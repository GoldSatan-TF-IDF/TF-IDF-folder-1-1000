peter robinson innocent graves the eighth book in the inspector banks series chapter i the night it all began a thick fog rolled down the dale and enfolded the town of eastvale in its shroud fog in the market square creeping in the cracks between the cobbles fog muffling the sound of laughter from the queens arms and muting the light through its red and amber panes fog rubbing and licking against cool glass in curtained windows and insinuating its way through tiny gaps under doors and the fog seemed at its thickest in the graveyard of st marys church where a beautiful woman with long auburn hair wandered barefoot and drunk a wineglass full of pinot noir held precariously in her hand she weaved her way between the squat gnarled yews and lichenstained stones sometimes she thought she saw ghosts gray translucent shapes flitting among the tombs ahead but they didnt frighten her and she came to the inchcliffe mausoleum it loomed ahead out of the fog massive and magnificent classical lines formed in marble steps overgrown with weeds leading down to the heavy oak door but it was the angel she had come to see she liked the angel its eyes were fixed on heaven as if nothing earthly mattered and its hands were clasped together in prayer though it was solid marble she often fancied it was so insubstantial she could pass her hand right through it she swayed slightly raised her glass to the angel and drained half the wine at one gulp she could feel the cold damp earth and grass under her feet hello gabriel she said voice a little slurred im sorry but ive sinned again she hiccupped and put her hand to her mouth scuse me but i just cant seem to then she saw something a blackandwhite shape sticking out from behind the mausoleum curious she squinted and stumbled towards it only when she was about a yard away did she realize it was a black shoe and a white sock with a foot still in it she tottered back hand to her mouth then circled around the back of the tomb all she could make out were the pale legs the fair hair the open satchel and the maroon uniform of st marys school for girls she screamed and dropped her glass it shattered on a stone then rebecca charters wife of the vicar of st marys fell to her knees on the broken glass and started to vomit ii the fog tasted of ashes thought detective chief inspector alan banks as he pulled up his raincoat collar and hurried down the tarmac path towards the faint gauzy light or perhaps he was being fanciful even though he hadnt seen the body yet he felt that familiar clenching in his stomach that murder always brought when he reached the scene just off a narrow gravel path past the shrubbery he saw the blurred silhouette of dr glendenning through the canvas screen bent over a vague shape lying on the ground like a dumbshow in a jacobean drama fog had played havoc with the usual order of arrival banks himself had been at a senior officers meeting in northallerton when he got the call and he was consequently almost the last person to arrive peter darby crimescene photographer was there already and so was detective inspector barry stott who for reasons clear to anyone who saw him was more commonly known as jugears stott who had recently been transferred from salford upon his promotion from detective sergeant was a temporary replacement for ds philip richmond who had gone to scotland yard to join a special computer unit banks took a deep breath and walked behind the screen dr glendenning looked up cigarette dangling from his mouth its smoke indistinguishable from the fog that surrounded them ah banks he said in his lilting edinburgh accent then he shook his head slowly banks looked down at the body in all his years in eastvale he hadnt had to deal with a crime like this he had seen worse in london of course which was part of the reason he had left the met and transferred up north but you clearly couldnt hide from it any more now not anywhere george orwell was right about the decline of the english murder and this was exactly the kind of thing it had declined into the girl about fifteen or sixteen by the look of her lay on her back in the long grass behind a huge victorian sepulchre upon which stood a marble statue of an angel the angel had its back turned to her and through the fog banks could make out the chipped feathers of its wings her eyes stared into the fog her long blonde hair lay fanned out around her head like a halo and her face had a reddishpurple hue there was a little cut by her left eye and some discoloration around her neck a trickle of blood the shape of a large teardrop ran out of her left nostril her maroon school blazer lay bunched up on the ground beside her and her white blouse had been ripped open at the front her bra had then been removedroughly by the looks of it banks felt the urge to cover her in his job he had already seen far more than a man should and it was little things like this that sometimes affected him more than the blood and guts the girl looked so vulnerable so callously violated he could imagine her shame at being exposed this way how she would blush and hurry to cover herself if she were alive but she was beyond shame now below her waist someone had pulled her skirt up to reveal her thighs and pubic region her long legs lay open at a fortyfivedegree angle her white socks were down around her ankles she wore shiny black shoes with buckles fastened at the sides lying beside her was an open satchel the strap had come free of the metal ring at one end using his pen banks pushed back the flap and read the neatly inked address miss deborah catherine harrison hawthorn close eastvale north yorkshire england united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland european community earth solar system milky way the universe he smiled sadly to himself it was a typical teenagers sense of playfulness exactly the same thing he had done at school hawthorn close meant money as did st marys in general it was an area of large mostly detached houses each with an acre or two of garden long drives and croquet lawns shaded by copper beeches to live there you had to make enough money to employ a gardener at the very least st marys school required money tooabout per term banks had checked when he first arrived in town but soon found he couldnt afford to send his daughter tracy there banks cadged some evidence bags from one of the socos and holding the satchel by its edges tipped the contents inside one of them all he found were a couple of exercise books with the name deborah catherine harrison written on the cover a portable chess set a few cosmetic items and three loose tampons in cellophane wrappers but why had the satchel been open he wondered the buckles seemed strong enough so he doubted it came open during a struggle had someone been looking for something glendenning directed one of his underlings to take oral vaginal and anal swabs and comb the pubic hair then he groaned and got to his feet im getting old banks he said massaging his knees too old for this sort of thing he jerked his head towards the body tall and whitehaired with a nicotinestained mustache the doctor was probably in his late fifties banks guessed they moved away letting the screen block their view of the victim every so often peter darbys flash exploded creating a strobelight effect in the fog banks accepted one of glendennings senior service normally he smoked silk cut tipped but he had cut down drastically on his smoking over the last few months and wasnt even carrying a packet with him well he thought as glendenning proffered a gold initialled lighter cutting down had been easy enough to do in a lazy summer with no murders to investigate now it was november and there was a body at his feet he lit up and coughed ought to get that cough seen to laddie said glendenning might be a touch of lung cancer you know its nothing im just getting a cold thats all ayewell i dont suppose you dragged me out here on a mucky night like this just to talk about your health did you no said banks what do you make of it i cant tell you much yet but judging by her color and the marks on her throat id say asphyxia due to ligature strangulation any sign of the ligature off the record that satchel strap fits the bill pretty nicely what about time of death oh come off it laddie vaguely not more than two or three hours ago but dont quote me on that banks looked at his watch eight oclock which meant she was probably killed between five and six not on her way home from school then at least not directly was she killed here aye almost certainly hypostasis is entirely consistent with the position of the body any sign of the rest of her underwear glendenning shook his head only the brassiere when can you get her on the table first thing in the morning coming banks swallowed the fog scratched his throat wouldnt miss it for the world fine ill reserve you the best seat in the house im off home you can get her to the mortuary now and with that glendenning turned and faded into the fog banks stood alone for a moment trying to forget the girl he had just seen spreadeagled so cruelly before him trying desperately not to see tracy in her place he stubbed out his cigarette carefully on the side of the inchcliffe mausoleum and pocketed the butt no point leaving red herrings at the crime scene a couple of yards away he noticed a light patch on the grass he walked over and squatted to get a closer look it looked and smelled as if someone had been sick he could also make out the stem and fragments of a wineglass which seemed to have smashed on the stone edging of a grave he picked up one of the slivers carefully between thumb and forefinger it was stained with blood or wine he couldnt be certain which he saw di stott within hearing range and called him over know anything about this he asked stott looked at the glass and vomit rebecca charters woman who discovered the body he said bit of an oddball shes in the vicarage wpc kemp is with her okay ill talk to her later banks pointed to the mausoleum anyone had a look in there yet not yet i sent pc aiken to see if he could come up with a key from the vicar banks nodded look barry someones got to break the news to the girls parents and seeing as im the new lad on the block thats not what i meant if youre not comfortable with the job then get someone else to do it but get it done sorry said stott taking his glasses off and wiping them on a white handkerchief im a bit he gestured towards the body of course ill go sure yes okay ill join you there soon before you go call in dc gay and ds hatchley and tell them to get down here someone might have to drag jim out of the oak stott raised his eyebrows banks noticed his little moue of distaste at the mention of detective sergeant hatchley well he thought thats his cross to bear and get as many officers out on the streets as you can i want every house in the area canvassed as soon as possible its going to be a long busy night but wed better work fast people forget quickly besides by tomorrow the vultures will be here vultures press tv people sightseers its going to be a circus barry prepare yourself stott nodded pc aiken turned up with the key to the mausoleum banks borrowed a torch from one of the search team and he and stott trod carefully down the weedcovered steps the heavy wooden door opened after a brief struggle with the key and they found themselves in the dark with the dead six sturdy coffins rested on trestles a few tentacles of fog slid down the stairs and through the door after them wreathing around their feet the small tomb didnt smell of death only of earth and mold fortunately there were no fresh inchcliffes buried there the family had left eastvale fifty years ago all banks could see on his first glance around were the spiderwebs that seemed to be spun in the very air itself he gave a little shudder and shone his torch over the floor there in the corner furthest from the entrance lay two empty vodka bottles and a pile of cigarette ends it was hard to tell how recent they were but they certainly werent fifty years old they found nothing else of interest down there and it was with great relief that banks emerged into the open air again foggy as it was it felt like a clear night after the inside of the tomb banks asked the socos to bag the empty bottles and cigarette ends and search the place thoroughly well need a murder room set up at the station he said turning to stott again and a van parked near the scene make it easy for people to come forward exhibits officer phone lines civilian staff the usual thing get susan gay to see to it better inform the chief constable too banks added with a sinking feeling at the moment banks was senior man in eastvale cid as detective superintendent gristhorpe had broken his leg while fixing his drystone wall technically detective chief superintendent jack wormsley from north yorkshire regional hq at northallerton was supposed to be in charge of a murder investigation however banks knew from experience not to expect much beyond the occasional phone call from dcs wormsley he was rumored to be far too close to finishing his scale matchstick model of the taj mahal to be bothered with a mere murder if it came from anywhere banks knew the main hindrance would come from the new chief constable jeremiah jimmy riddle a highflier of the pushy breathedownyourneck school of police management well also need a thorough groundsearch of the graveyard banks went on but we might be better doing that in daylight especially if this fog disperses a bit during the night anyway make sure the place is well secured banks looked around how many entrances are there two one off north market street and one off kendal road just by bridge should be easy to secure then the wall looks high enough to deter any interlopers but wed better have a couple of men on perimeter patrol just to make sure the last thing we need is some intrepid reporter splashing crimescene photos all over the morning papers is there any access from the riverside stott shook his head the walls high there too and its topped with broken glass welcoming sort of place isnt it i understand theyve had a bit of vandalism banks peered through the fog at the lights in the vicarage they looked like disembodied eyes youre a bit of a churchman arent you barry stott nodded yes st cuthberts though not st marys banks nodded towards the vicarage do you know who the vicar is here father daniel charters banks raised his eyebrows i thought so i dont know all the details but isnt he the one whos been in the news a bit lately he is stott said through gritted teeth interesting said banks very interesting and he wandered off towards the vicarage iii the woman who answered bankss knock at the back door was in her midthirties he guessed with a lustrous cascade of auburn hair spilling over her shoulders an olive complexion large hazel eyes and the fullest most sensuous lips he had ever seen she also had a stunned unfocused look on her face im rebecca charters she said shaking his hand please come through banks followed her down the hall a tall woman she was wearing a heavy black shawl draped over her shoulders and a loose long blue skirt that flowed over the swell of her hips almost down to the stone flags of the hallway her feet were bare and dirty with blades of grass stuck to her ankles and instep there was also a fresh cut by the achilles tendon of her right foot as she walked her hips swayed just a little more than he would have expected in a vicars wife and was it his imagination or did she seem a little unsteady on her pins she led him into a livingroom with a high ceiling and dull striped wallpaper wpc kemp stood by the door and banks told her she could leave now bottlegreen velour curtains were drawn across the bay window against the fog an empty tiled fireplace stood directly across from the door and in front of it lay a huge bundle of brownandwhite fur that banks took to be a large dog of some kind whatever it was he hoped it stayed there not that he disliked dogs but he couldnt stand the way they slobbered and fussed over him cats were much more bankss kind of animal he liked their arrogance their independence and their sense of mischief and would have one for a pet were it not that sandra his wife was violently allergic the only heat was provided by a small white radiator against the far wall banks was glad he hadnt taken off his raincoat yet he was thankful for the extra layer of warmth a threepiece suite upholstered in worn brown corduroy ranged around the coffeetable and in one of the armchairs sat a man with thick black eyebrows that almost met in the middle a furrowed brow a long pale face and prominent cheekbones he had the haunted look of a troubled young priest from an old movie as banks came in the man stood up a maneuver that resembled some large longlimbed animal uncurling from its lair and reached out his slender hand daniel charters would you like some coffee shaking his hand banks noticed the carafe on the table and nodded love some he said black no sugar banks sat on the sofa rebecca charters next to him also on the coffeetable stood an empty bottle of sainsburys romanian pinot noir as daniel charters poured the coffee rebecca walked over to a glassfronted cabinet brought out a bottle and a brandy balloon and poured herself a large one banks noticed her husband gave her an angry look which she ignored the coffee was good almost as soon as he sipped it banks felt the scratchiness in his throat ease up a little i realize youve had a terrible shock banks said but do you think you could answer a few questions rebecca nodded good did you report finding the body immediately almost when i saw the shape what it was ii was sick first then i ran back here and telephoned the police what were you doing in the graveyard at that time on such a miserable night i went to see the angel her voice was such a low whisper banks didnt believe he could have heard right you what he asked i said i went to see the angel her large moist eyes held his defiantly they were redrimmed with crying whats wrong with that i like graveyards at least i did what about the glass i had a glass of wine i dropped it then i fell look she lifted her skirt as far as her knees both of them were bandaged but the blood was already seeping through perhaps you should see a doctor banks suggested rebecca shook her head im all right did you disturb the body in any way banks asked no i didnt touch anything i didnt go near her did you recognize her just that she was a st marys girl did you know a girl called deborah catherine harrison rebecca put her hand to her mouth and nodded for a moment banks thought she was going to be sick again her husband didnt make a move but banks could tell from his expression that he recognized the name too is that who it was rebecca asked we think so ill have to ask you not to say anything to anyone until the identity has been confirmed of course not poor deborah so you knew her she sang in the choir daniel charters said the school and the church are very closely linked they dont have a chapel of their own so they come here for services a number of them also sing in the choir have you any idea what she might have been doing in the graveyard around five or six oclock its a short cut rebecca said from the school to her house but school finishes at half past three rebecca shrugged they have clubs societies activities youd have to ask dr green the head she took another gulp of brandy the dog on the hearth hadnt moved for a moment banks thought it might have died then he noticed the fur moving slowly as it breathed just old most likely the way he was feeling did either of you see or hear anything outside earlier this evening he asked daniel shook his head and rebecca said i thought i did when i was in the kitchen opening the wine it sounded like a stifled cry or something what did you do i went over to the window of course i couldnt see a damn thing in this fog and when i didnt hear anything else for a couple of minutes i decided it must have been a bird or a small animal can you remember what time that was around six oclock maybe a few minutes after the local news was just starting on television and even though you thought you heard a cry you still went out into the dark foggy graveyard alone forty minutes later rebecca cast her eyes on the empty wine bottle id forgotten all about it by then she said besides i told you i assumed it was an animal banks turned to daniel charters did you hear anything he was in his study until i came back screaming about the body rebecca answered thats the other room at the front the far side he couldnt have heard a thing from there mr charters daniel charters nodded thats right i was working on a sermon im afraid my wife is correct i didnt hear anything have either of you seen any strangers hanging around the area recently they both shook their heads has anyone been inside the inchcliffe mausoleum lately charters frowned no as far as i know noones been in there for fifty years i just gave the key to one of your men where do you usually keep it in the church on a hook in the vestry so its accessible to anyone yes but i cant see someones been down there recently we found vodka bottles and cigarette ends have you any idea who it might be i cant then he stopped and turned pale unless unless what mr charters banks drank some more coffee as you probably know charters said ive been under a bit of a cloud these past two months do you know the details banks shrugged only vaguely the whole thing is only vague anyway we employed a croatian refugee here as a sexton he turned out to be a complete mistake he drank he was abusive and he frightened people in what way he used to leer at the schoolgirls make lewd gestures one girl even saw him urinating on a grave charters shook his head that sort of thing he never actually touched anyone as far as we know but some of the girls complained to dr green and she and i had a long talk the upshot was i decided to get rid of him as soon as hed gone he went to the church authorities and claimed that i fired him because he refused to have sex with me and the church authorities believed him it doesnt matter what they believed said charters with a bitter glance at his wife once the accusation is made the wheels start to grind inquiries have to be made and the accused is put immediately on the defensive you ought to know how it works chief inspector like when did you stop beating your wife exactly and you think he might have been in the mausoleum hes the only one i can think of and he had better access to the key than most also as i remember vodka was his drink of preference because he believed people couldnt smell it on his breath what do you think of all this mrs charters rebecca shook her head looked away and drank more brandy my wife as you can see said charters has been a pillar of strength banks decided to leave that one well alone whats he called this man you fired ive jelačić how do you spell that charters told him explaining the diacritical marks banks wrote it down what does he look like hes tall about my height solidly built he has black hair which always needed cutting a dark complexion a slightly hooked nose he shrugged i dont know what else to say where is he now leeds has he ever threatened or bothered you at all since you fired him yes hes been back a couple of times why to offer me a deal he suggested that he would drop the charges if i gave him money how much charters snorted more than i can afford im afraid and how would he get the charges dropped say he misinterpreted my gesture cultural differences i told him to go away the mans a liar and a drunk chief inspector what difference does it make it might make a lot of difference said banks slowly if he had a reputation for bothering the st marys girls and he had a grudge against you do you know his address charters went over and opened a sideboard drawer i ought to he muttered flipping through a pile of envelopes theres been enough correspondence on the matter ah here it is banks looked at the address it was in the burmantofts area of leeds but he didnt recognize the street mind if i use your phone he asked go ahead said charters theres an extension in my study if you want some privacy its just across the hall banks went into the study and sat at the desk he was impressed how tidy it wasno papers scattered all around no chewed pencils no reference books open face down no errant paperclips or rubber bands the way his own desk usually looked when he was working on something even the ruler was lined up parallel with the edge of the blotter a neat man the reverend charters so neat that he had even tidied his desk after his wife came in screaming about a murder in the graveyard banks consulted his notebook and phoned detective inspector ken blackstone at home blackstone a good friend worked for west yorkshire cid out of millgarth leeds banks explained what had happened and asked blackstone if he could arrange to have a couple of officers go around to the address charters had given him first he wanted to know if jelačić was at home and secondly whether he had an alibi for this evening blackstone said it would be no problem and banks hung up when he went back into the livingroom he obviously interrupted daniel and rebecca charters in the midst of a hissed argument rebecca he noticed had refilled her brandy glass banks had nothing more to ask so he knocked back the rest of his lukewarm coffee and headed out into the graveyard iv as soon as banks had gone daniel charters looked disgustedly at the empty wine bottle and the remains of the brandy then at rebecca i asked you why you did that he said why on earth did you lie to him you know why daniel leaned forward in his chair hands clasped between his knees no i dont you didnt even give me a chance to answer you just jumped right in with your stupid lie rebecca sipped her brandy i didnt notice you rushing to correct me daniel reddened it was too late by then it would have looked suspicious shpicious oh thats a good one daniel and how do you think it looks already daniels face contorted in pain do you think i did it do you really believe i killed that girl out there he pointed a long bony finger towards the graveyard is that what you think you were protecting me from giving me an alibi for rebecca turned away dont be silly then why did you lie to make things easier lies never make things easier oh dont they rebecca thought shows what you know weve got enough problems she said with a sigh without having you as a suspect in a murder investigation dont you want to know where i was no i dont care where you were but you lied for me for us yes she ran her hand through her hair look daniel i saw something horrible out there in the graveyard im tired im upset and i feel sick cant you just leave me alone daniel remained silent for a moment rebecca could hear the clock ticking on the mantelpiece ezekiel stirred briefly then settled down to sleep again you think i did it dont you daniel persisted please daniel just let it drop of course i dont think you did it not the murder the other business i dont think anything of the kind i told you havent i stuck by you do you think id still be here if i thought you did it here youre not here you havent been here since it happened oh you may actually be physically present in this room yes ill admit that but youre not really here not with me most of the time youre in the bottle the rest youregod knows where oh right and we all know youre such a bloody saint you havent touched a drop throughout all our troubles well maybe im not as strong as you daniel maybe were not all so bloody devout some of us might just show a little human weakness every now and again but you wouldnt know about that would you rebecca topped up her brandy with a shaking hand daniel reached forward and knocked the glass out of her hand the brandy spilled on the coffeetable and the sofa and the glass bounced on the carpet rebecca didnt know what to say her breath caught in her throat it was the first time since she had known him that daniel had shown even the slightest sign of violence his face was red and his frown knitted his thick dark eyebrows together at the bridge of his nose you have your doubts dont you he insisted go on admit it im waiting rebecca bent down picked up the glass and poured herself another shot with shaking hands this time daniel did nothing answer me he said tell me the truth rebecca let the silence stretch then she took a long sip of brandy and said in a parody of a prostitutes tone well you know what they say dont you ducky theres no smoke without fire v banks left his car parked on north market street outside st marys and set off on foot to hawthorn close the fog appeared less menacing on the main road than it had in the unlit graveyard though the high amber streetlights and the flashing belisha beacons at the zebra crossing looked like the martian machines out of war of the worlds why had rebecca charters lied for her husband she had lied of that banks was certain even without the evidence of the tidy desk was she giving him an alibi perhaps tomorrow he would call on them again she was certainly an odd one going to see the angel indeed banks looked at his watch luckily it was just after nine oclock and he still had time to nip into the offlicense at the corner of hawthorn road and buy twenty silk cut after he had walked about two hundred yards down hawthorn road he took hawthorn close to the right a winding street of big stone houses that traditionally housed eastvales gentry he found number stubbed out his cigarette and walked up the gravel drive noting the o registration jaguar parked outside the front door on impulse he put his hand on the bonnet still a little warm barry stott answered the door looking grim banks thanked him for doing the dirty work and told him he could return to the station and get things organized then he walked down the hall alone into a spacious white room complete with a white grand piano the only contrasting elements were the turkish carpets and what looked like a genuine chagall on the wall over the adam fireplace where a thick log burned and crackled a white bookcase held folio society editions of the classics and french windows with white trim led out to the dark garden there were three people in the room all sitting down and all by the looks of it in a state of shock the woman wore a gray skirt and a blue silk blouse both of a quality youd be hardpushed to find in eastvale her shaggy blonde hair was the expensive kind of shaggy and it framed an oval face with a pale flawless complexion pale blue eyes and beautifully proportioned nose and mouth all in all an elegant and attractive woman she got up and floated towards him as if in a trance has there been a mistake she asked please tell me theres been a mistake she had a hint of a french accent before banks could say anything one of the men took her by the elbow and said come on sylvie sit down then he turned to banks im geoffrey harrison he said deborahs father i suppose its too much to hope there has been a mistake banks shook his head geoffrey was about six foot two with the long arms and broad shoulders of a fast bowler in fact he looked a bit like a famous test cricketer but banks couldnt put a name to him he was wearing gray trousers with sharp creases and a knitted green vneck sweater over a white shirt no tie he had curly fair hair with some gray visible around the ears and a strong cleft chin a bit like kirk douglas everything about his movements and features spoke of power of someone used to getting his own way banks put his age at about fortyfive probably a good ten years older than his wife all of a sudden the realization hit banks like a bucket of cold water christ he should have known should have been able to add it all up this damn cold must be addling his brain the man in front of him was sir geoffrey harrison sir he had been knighted for services to industrysomething to do with leadingedge computers electronics microchips and the likeabout three years ago and deborah harrison was his daughter do you have a recent photograph of your daughter sir he asked over there on the mantelpiece it was taken last summer banks walked over and looked at the photograph of the young girl posing on the deck of a yacht it was probably her first year in a bikini banks guessed and while she hardly had the figure to fill it out it still looked good on her but then anything would probably have looked good on such youth such energy such potential deborah was smiling and holding the mast with one hand with the other she held back a long strand of blonde hair from her face as if the wind were blowing it out of place even though the girl in the picture glowed with health and life it was the same one who now lay in eastvale mortuary im afraid its not a mistake he said glancing at the photograph beside it it showed two smiling young men in cricket whites one of them unmistakably sir geoffrey standing together in a quadrangle the other man who had his arm casually draped over sir geoffreys shoulder could easily have been the other person in the room about twentyfive years ago even now he was still slim and goodlooking though the sandy hair above his high forehead was receding fast and thinning on top he was wearing what looked like very expensive casual clothesblack cords and a rustcolored cotton shirtand a pair of goldrimmed spectacles hung around his neck on a chain michael clayton he said getting up and shaking banks hand michaels my business partner said sir geoffrey and my oldest friend hes also deborahs godfather i live just around the corner said clayton as soon as geoff heard the newswell they phoned me and i came over have there been any developments its too early to say said banks then he turned to sir geoffrey and lady harrison did you know if deborah was planning on going anywhere after school sir geoffrey took a second to refocus then said only the chess club chess club yes at school they meet every monday what time is she usually home sir geoffrey looked at his wife its usually over by six lady harrison said she gets home about quarter past sometimes twenty past if she dawdles with her friends banks frowned it must have been after eight oclock when detective inspector stott came to break the bad news he said but you hadnt reported deborah missing werent you worried where did you think she was lady harrison started to cry sir geoffrey gripped her hand wed only just got in ourselves he explained i was at a business reception at the royal hotel in york and the damn fog delayed me sylvie was at her health club deborah has a key she is sixteen after all what time did you get back about eight oclock within minutes of each other we thought deborah might have been home and gone out again but that wasnt like her not without letting us know and certainly not on a night like this there was no note no sign shed been here deborahs notwell she usually leaves her school blazer over the back of a chair if you see what i mean i do bankss daughter tracy was just as untidy anyway we were worried she might have been kidnapped or something we were just about to phone the police when inspector stott arrived have there ever been any kidnap threats no but one hears about such things could your daughter have been carrying anything of value cash credit cards anything no why do you ask her satchel was open i was just wondering why sir geoffrey shook his head banks turned to michael clayton did you see deborah at all this evening no i was at home until i got geoffs phone call sir geoffrey and lady harrison sat on the white sofa shoulders slumped holding hands like a couple of teenagers banks sat on the edge of the armchair and leaned forward resting his hands on his knees inspector stott says deborah was found in st marys graveyard sir geoffrey said is that true banks nodded anger suffused sir geoffreys face have you talked to that bloody vicar yet that pervert daniel charters thats him you know what hes been accused of dont you making a homosexual advance sir geoffrey nodded exactly if i were you id please geoffrey sylvie said plucking at his sleeve calm down let the chief inspector talk sir geoffrey ran his hand through his hair yes of course i apologize why such animosity towards charters banks wondered but that was best left for later sir geoffrey was distraught it wouldnt be a good idea to press him any further just now may i have a look at deborahs room he asked sylvie nodded and stood up ill show you banks followed her up a broad whitecarpeted staircase what a hell of a job it would be to keep the place clean he found himself thinking sandra would never put up with white carpets or upholstery still he didnt suppose the harrisons did the cleaning themselves sylvie opened the door to deborahs room then excused herself and went back downstairs banks turned on the light it was bigger but in much the same state of disarray as tracy s clothes lay tossed all over the floor the bed was unmade a mound of rumpled sheets and the closet door stood open on a long rail of dresses blouses jackets and jeans expensive stuff too banks saw as he looked at some of the designer labels deborahs computer complete with cdrom sat on the desk under the window beside that stood a bookcase filled mostly with science and computer textbooks and a few bodicerippers banks searched through all the drawers but found nothing of interest of course it would have helped if he had known what he was looking for arranged in custom shelving on a table by the foot of the bed were a minihifi system a small color television and a videoall with remote controls banks glanced through some of the cds unlike tracy deborah seemed to favor the rough grungy style of popular music hole pearl jam nirvana a large poster of kurt cobain was tacked to the wall next to a smaller poster of river phoenix banks closed the door behind him and walked back down the stairs he could hear sylvie crying in the white room and sir geoffrey and michael clayton in muffled conversation he couldnt hear what they were saying and when he moved close they saw him through the open door and asked him back in i have just one more question sir geoffrey if i may he said go ahead did your daughter keep a diary i know mine does they seem to be very popular among teenage girls sir geoffrey thought for a moment yes he said i think so michael bought her one last christmas clayton nodded yes one of the leatherbound kind a page per day banks turned back to sir geoffrey do you know where she kept it he frowned im afraid i dont sylvie sylvie shook her head she told me she lost it when was this about the beginning of term i hadnt seen it for a while so i asked her if shed stopped writing it why is it important probably not said banks its just that sometimes what we dont find is as important as what we do trouble is we never really know until later anyway i wont bother you any further tonight inspector stott said id have to identify the body sir geoffrey said youll make the arrangements of course again sir my condolences sir geoffrey nodded then he turned back to his wife like a butler banks was dismissed vi what with one thing and another it was after two in the morning when banks parked the darkblue cavalier he had finally bought to replace his clappedout cortina in front of his house after hawthorn close it was good to be back in the normal world of semis with postagestamp gardens fiestas and astras parked in the street the first thing he did was tiptoe upstairs to check on tracy it was foolish he knew but after seeing deborah harrisons body he felt the need to see his own daughter alive and breathing the amber glow from the streetlamp outside her window lit the faint outline of tracy s sleeping figure every so often she would turn and give a little sigh as if she were dreaming softly banks closed her door again and went back downstairs to the livingroom careful to bypass the creaky third stair from the top despite the late hour he didnt feel at all tired he turned on the shaded table lamp and poured himself a stiff laphroaig hoping to put the image of deborah harrison spreadeagled in the graveyard out of his mind after five minutes banks hadnt succeeded in getting his mind off the subject music would help music alone with sudden charms can bindthe wandring sense and calm the troubled mind as congreve had said surely it wouldnt wake sandra or tracy if he played a classical cd quietly he flipped through his quickly growing collectionhe was sure that they multiplied overnightand settled finally on richard strausss four last songs in the middle of the second song september when gundula janowitzs crystaline soprano was soaring away with the melody banks topped up his laphroaig and lit a cigarette before he had taken more than three or four drags the door opened and tracy popped her head around what are you doing up banks whispered tracy rubbed her eyes and walked into the room she was wearing a long sloppy nightshirt with a picture of a giant panda on the front though she was seventeen it made her look like a little girl i thought i heard someone in my room tracy muttered i couldnt get back to sleep so i came down for some milk oh dad youre smoking again banks put his finger to his lips shhh your mother he looked at the cigarette guiltily so i am and you promised i never did banks hung his head in shame there was nothing like a teenage daughter to make you feel guilty about your bad habits especially with all the antismoking propaganda they were brainwashed with at school these days you did too tracy came closer is something wrong is that why youre up so late smoking and drinking she sat on the arm of the sofa and looked at him sleepfilled eyes full of concern long blonde hair straggling over her narrow shoulders bankss son brian who was away studying architecture in portsmouth took after his father but tracy took after her mother they had come a long way since the bitter arguments over her first boyfriend long since dumped and too many late nights over the summer now tracy had determined not to have a boyfriend at all this year but to put all her efforts into getting good alevel results so she could go to university where she wanted to study history banks couldnt help but approve as he looked at her perching so frail and vulnerable on the edge of the sofa his heart swelled with pride in her and with fear for her no he said getting up and patting her head theres nothing wrong im just an old fool set in his ways thats all shall i make us both some cocoa tracy nodded then yawned and stretched her arms high in the air banks smiled gundula janowitz sang hermann hesses words banks had listened to the songs so many times he knew the translation by heart the day has tired me and my spirits yearn for the starry night to gather them up like a tired child you can say that again thought banks he looked back at tracy as he walked to the kitchen she was examining the smallprint cd liner notes with squinting eyes trying to make out the words she would find out soon enough what had happened to deborah harrison banks thought it would be all over town tomorrow but not tonight tonight father and daughter would enjoy a quiet innocent cup of cocoa in the middle of the night in their safe warm house floating like an island in the fog chapter i chief constable jeremiah riddle was already pacing the lino when banks arrived at his office early the next morning bald head shining like a new cricket ball freshly rubbed on the bowlers crotch black eyes glowing like a whitby jet cleanshaven chin jutting out like the prow of a boat uniform sharply creased not a speck of fluff or cotton anywhere to be seen and a poppy placed ostentatiously in his lapel he looked alert wideawake and ready for anything which was more than banks looked or felt for that matter all told he had got no more than about three hours uneasy sleep especially as an early telephone call from ken blackstone had woken him up though the fog was quickly turning to drizzle this morning he had walked the mile to work simply to get the cobwebs out of his brain he wasnt sure whether he had succeeded it didnt help that his cold was getting worse either filling his head with damp cotton wool ah banks about bloody time said riddle banks removed his headphones and switched off the jimi hendrix tape he had been listening to the breakneck arpeggios of pali gap were still ringing in his stuffedup ears and do you have to go around with those bloody things stuck in your ears riddle went on dont you know how silly you look banks knew a rhetorical question when he heard one i suppose youre aware who the victims father is sir geoffrey harrison sir i talked to him last night in that case youll realize how important this is thisthisterrible tragedy never at a loss for a cliché wasnt jimmy riddle banks reflected riddle slid his hand over his head and went on i want a hundred per cent on this one banks no two hundred per cent do you understand no shirking no dragging of feet banks nodded yes sir now what about this bosnian fellow jurassic is it jelačić sir and hes croatian whatever think hes our man well certainly be talking to him ken blackstone has just reported that jelačićs known to the leeds police drunk and disorderly one charge of assault in a pub and he didnt get home until after two this morning theyve got his prints so we should be able to compare them if vic gets anything from the vodka bottle good riddle grinned thats the kind of thing i like to hear i want a quick arrest on this one banks sir geoffreys a personal friend of mine do you understand yes sir right and take it easy on the family i dont want you pestering them in their time of grief am i clear yes sir riddle straightened his uniform which didnt need it and brushed imaginary dandruff from his shoulders wishful thinking banks guessed now im off to give a press conference he said anything i ought to know to stop me looking a prize berk nothing could stop you from looking like a prize berk banks thought no sir he said but you might like to drop by the murder room and see if theres anything fresh come in ive already done that what do you think i am a bloody moron banks let the silence stretch riddle kept pacing though he seemed to have run out of things to say for the present at last he headed for the door right then remember what i said banks he said pointing a finger results fast banks felt himself relax and breathe easier when riddle had gone like a victorian lady when she takes her corsets off he had read about type a personalities in a magazine articleall push and shove ambition and selfimportance and bloody exhausting to be in the same room with banks lit a cigarette read the reports on his desk and looked at the dalesman calendar on his wall november showed the village of muker in swaledale a cluster of gray limestone buildings cupped in a valley of muted autumn colors he walked over to the window where the early morning light was leaking through the cloud cover like dirty dishwater the market square with its norman church to his left bank shops and cafés opposite and queens arms to the right was a study in slategray except for one bright red honda parked by the weathered market cross banks watched a bent old lady hobble across the cobbles under a black umbrella he checked his watch with the church tower clock five to eight time to gather his papers and head for the morning meeting di stott was already waiting and raring to go in the boardroom so called because of its wellpolished oval table ten matching stiffbacked chairs and darkburgundy wallpaper above the wainscoting detective constable susan gay arrived two minutes later her makeup almost hid the bags under her eyes the gel made her short curly hair look as if it were still wet from the shower and her subtle perfume brought a whiff of spring to the room detective sergeant jim hatchley big and heavy like a rugby propforward gone to seed came in last he hadnt freshened up his face looked like a lump of dough with tufts of stubble sticking out of it his eyes were bloodshot and his strawy hair uncombed his navyblue suit was creased and shiny okay said banks shuffling the papers in front of him weve got two new pieces of information to deal with id hesitate to call them leads but you never know first off for what its worth one of our diuretically challenged constables found the missing underwear while nipping behind a handy yew to drain the dragon theyre with the rest of her clothing at the mortuary the second item might be even more significant he went on some of you may already know that a croatian refugee called ive jelačić was recently fired by daniel charters vicar of st marys and subsequently brought charges of sexual harassment against him by the sound of it this jelačićs an unsavory character according to west yorkshire cid mr jelačić didnt get home until after two oclock last night plenty of time to get back from committing a murder in eastvale even in the fog he said hed been playing cards with some fellow countrymen at a friends house hatchley grunted these foreigners would lie as soon as look at you he said especially to cover up for one another west yorkshire cid are already checking it out banks went on but im afraid detective sergeant hatchley has in his inimitable fashion probably put his finger on the truth of the matter so well take this alibi with a large pinch of salt di blackstone said theyll sit on jelačić until we get there i think well let him sweat for a couple more hours now we dont have anything in from the lab yet but from my observations of the scene what weve got here looks like a sex murder there was an arranged quality to it all but i want to stress looks like right now we just dont know enough there are several other avenues we simply cant afford to overlook he counted them off on his fingers school family jelačić boyfriends and the couple at the vicarage for starters rebecca charters lied to me last night when i asked where her husband had been at the time of the crime she gave him a false alibi and id like to know why he needed it especially given the recent scandal involving him we also need to know a lot more about deborah harrisons life not just her movements yesterday but her interests her activities her sex life if she had one and her past we need to know what made her tick what kind of person she was any questions they all shook their heads good barry id like you and sergeant hatchley to spend the morning going through the records of all known sex offenders in the county you know the procedure if anyone sounds likely make inquiries after that ask around at some of the restaurants and cafés in the st marys area places that might have been closed after eight or nine last night when the uniforms did their housetohouse you never know our man might have stopped off for a cup of tea on his way to the graveyard stott nodded and id also like you to try and find out anything you can about jelačić from records immigration wherever does he have form back home has he ever committed a sex offense of any kind there stott scribbled notes on his pad susan id like you to team up with me and check out a few things closer to home for a start weve got to find out exactly what deborahs movements were yesterday who saw her last okay yes sir so if theres nothing else banks said lets get on with it everyone check in with the murder room at regular intervals given their tasks they drifted away except dc susan gay who topped up her milky coffee and sat down again why me sir she asked pardon why am i teamed up with you on this im only a dc by rights it should susan whatever your rank youre a good detective youve proved that often enough think about it taking jim hatchley around to a girls school a vicarage and sir geoffrey harrisonsit would be like letting a bull loose in a china shop susans lips twitched in a smile what exactly will we be doing talking to the family friends teachers trying to find out if this isnt just the sex murder it seems and if someone had a reason to want deborah harrison dead are you going to check her parents alibis banks paused for a moment then said yes probably the chief constable wont like it will he wont like what any of it us going around poking our noses into the harrison family background maybe not i mean its pretty common knowledge around the station that theyre in the same funnyhandshake brigade sir the chief constable and sir geoffrey that is oh is it so rumor has it sir and youre worried about your career well ive passed my sergeants exam as you know im just waiting for an opening i mean im with you all the way sir but i wouldnt want to make enemies in the wrong places not just at the moment banks smiled dont worry he said its my balls on the choppingblock not yours ill cover you my word on it susan smiled back well thats the first time not having any balls has ever done me any good ii when she woke up shortly after eight oclock on tuesday morning rebecca charters felt the hammering pain behind her eyes that signaled another hangover it hadnt always been like this she reminded herself when she had married daniel twelve years ago he had been a dynamic young cleric she had loved his passionate faith and his dedication just as she had loved his sense of humor and his joy in the sensual world lovemaking had always been a pleasure for both of them until recently she got up put on her dressinggown against the chill and walked over to the window when they had first moved to st marys six years ago her friends had all said how depressing and unhealthy it would be living in a graveyard just like the brontës darling they said and look what happened to them but rebecca didnt find it at all depressing she found it strangely comforting and peaceful to consider the worms seething at their work just below the overgrown surface it put things in perspective it also reminded her of that marvell poem patrick had quoted for her just on the brink of their affair when things could have gone either way but at my back i always hear times wingèd chariot hurrying near and yonder all before us lie deserts of vast eternity thy beauty shall no more be found nor in thy marble vault shall sound my echoing song then worms shall try that long preservd virginity and your quaint honor turn to dust and into ashes all my lust the graves a fine and private place but none i think do there embrace what an easy seduction it had been after all the poem worked marvell would have been proud of himself rebecca pulled back the curtain some fog still drifted around the yew trunks and the heavy gray headstones but the drizzle seemed to have settled in now from her window she could see uniformed policemen methodically searching the ground around the church in a grid pattern deborah harrison she had often seen deborah taking a short cut through the churchyard she had also seen her in church and at choir practice too before the trouble began deborahs father sir geoffrey had deserted st marys at the first hint of a scandal the school had stuck with daniel but sir geoffrey to whom appearances were far more important than truth had made a point of turning his back taking his family and a number of other wealthy and influential members of the congregation with him and st marys was the wealthiest parish in eastvale had been now the coffers were emptying fast rebecca rested her forehead against the cool glass and watched her breath mist up the window she found herself doodling patricks name with her fingernail and felt the need for him burn in her loins she hated herself for feeling this way patrick was ten years younger than she was a mere twentysix but he was so ardent so passionate always talking so excitedly about life and poetry and love though she needed him she hated her need though she determined every day to call it off she desired nothing more than to lose herself completely in him like the drinking patrick was an escape she had enough selfknowledge to work that out at any rate an escape from the poisoned atmosphere at st marys from what she and daniel had become and as she admitted in her darkest moments an escape from her own fears and suspicions now this it didnt make sense she tried to convince herself daniel couldnt possibly be a murderer why would he want to murder someone as innocent as deborah harrison just because you feared a person might be guilty of one thing did that mean he had to be guilty of something else too as she watched the policemen in their capes and wellingtons poke through the long grass she had to face the facts daniel had come home only after she had gone to see the angel he had gone out before she thought she heard the scream she hadnt known where he was and when he came back his shoes were muddy with leaves and gravel stuck to their soles iii the mortuary was in the basement of eastvale general infirmary an austere victorian brick building with high drafty corridors and wards that susan had always thought were guaranteed to make you ill if you werent already the whitetiled postmortem room though had recently been modernized as if she thought the dead somehow deserved a healthier environment than the living chilled by the cooling unit rather than by the wind from outside it had two shiny metal tables with guttered edges and a long lab bench along one wall with glassfronted cabinets for specimen jars susan had never dared ask about the two jars that looked as if they contained human brains dr glendennings assistants had already removed deborah harrisons body from its plastic bag and she lay clothed as she had been in the graveyard on one of the tables it was nine oclock and the radio was tuned to wake up to wogan do we have to listen to that rubbish banks asked its normal banks said glendenning thats why we have it on millions of people in houses all around the country will be listening to wogan now people who arent just about to cut open the body of a sixteenyearold girl i suppose youd like some fancy classical concert on radio wouldnt you i cant say that the thought of performing a postmortem to elgars enigma variations would do a hell of a lot for me glendenning stuck a cigarette in the corner of his mouth and pulled on his surgical gloves susan smiled banks looked at her and shrugged the girl on the slab wasnt a human being susan kept telling herself she was just a piece of dead meat like at the butchers she remembered june walker the butchers daughter from school in sheffield and recalled the peculiar smell that always seemed to emanate from her odd she hadnt thought of june walker in years the smellstale and sharp but sweet toowas here all right but it was buried under layers of formaldehyde and cigarette smoke for both glendenning and banks were smoking furiously she didnt blame them she had once seen a film on television in which an american woman cop rubbed some vicks or something under her nose to mask the smell of a decomposing body susan didnt dare do such a thing herself for fear the others would laugh at her after all this was yorkshire not america still as she watched glendenning cut and probe at the girls clothing then remove it for airdrying and storage she almost wished she were a smoker at least that smell was easier to wash away than the smell of death that seemed to linger in her clothes and hair for days after deborahs panties lay in a plastic bag on the lab bench they werent at all like the navyblue knickers the passionkillers that susan had worn at school but expensive silky and rather sexy black panties maybe such things were de rigueur for st marys girls susan thought or had deborah been hoping to impress someone they still didnt know if shed had a boyfriend her school blazer lay next to the panties in a separate bag and beside that lay her satchel vic manson the fingerprints expert had sent it back early that morning saying he had found clear prints on one of the vodka bottles but only blurred partials on the smooth leather surface of the satchel di stott had been through deborahs blazer pockets and found only a purse with six pounds thirtythree pence in it an old chewinggum wrapper her house keys a cinema ticket stub and a halfeaten roll of polo mints after one of his assistants had taken photographs glendenning examined the face noting the pinpoint hemorrhages in the whites of the eyes eyelids and skin of the cheeks then he examined the weal on the neck as i said last night he began it looks like a clear case of asphyxia by ligature strangulation look here banks and susan bent over the body susan tried not to look into the eyes glendennings probe indicated the discolored weal around the front of the throat whoever did this was pretty strong he said you can see how deeply the strap bit into the flesh and id say our chappie was a good few inches taller than his victim and she was tall for her age five foot six he turned to susan thats almost centimeters to the younger generation see how the wound is deeper at the bottom the way it would be if you were pulling a leather strap upwards he moved away and demonstrated on one of the assistants see banks and susan nodded are you sure the satchel strap was the weapon banks asked glendenning nodded he picked it up and held it out you can see traces of blood on the edge here where it broke the skin were having it typed of course but id put money on this being your weapon next he set about removing the plastic bags that covered the hands gentlyalmost susan thought like a manicuristhe held up each hand and peered at the fingernails deborahs nails had been quite long susan noticed not the bittentothequick mess hers had been when she was at school when glendenning got to the middle finger of her right hand he murmured to himself then took a shiny instrument from the tray and ran it under the top of the nail calling to one of his assistants for a glassine envelope what is it banks asked did she put up a fight looks like she got at least one good scratch in with a bit of luck well be able to get dna from this passing quickly over the chest and stomach glendenning next picked up a probe and turned his attention to the pubic region susan looked away she didnt want to witness this indignity and she didnt care what anyone said or thought of her but she couldnt shut out the sound of glendennings voice hmm interesting he said no obvious signs of sexual interference no bruising no lacerations lets have a look behind he flipped the body over it slapped against the table like meat on a butchers block susan heard her heart beating fast and loud during the silence that followed no nothing glendenning announced at last at least nothing obvious im waiting for the test results on the swabs but id bet you a pound to a penny theyll turn up nothing susan turned back to face the two of them so she wasnt raped she asked doesnt look like it glendenning answered of course we wont know for sure until weve had a good look around inside and in order to do that he picked up a large scalpel glendenning bent over the body and started to make the y incision from shoulders to pubes he detoured around the tough tissue of the navel with a practiced flick of the wrist right said banks turning to susan wed better go glendenning looked up from the gaping incision and raised his eyebrows not staying for the rest of the show no time we dont want to be late for school glendenning looked at the corpse and shook his head cant say i blame you some days i wish id stayed in bed as they left glendenning to sort through the inner organs of deborah harrison susan had never felt quite so grateful to banks in her life next time they were in the queens arms she vowed she would buy him a pint but she wouldnt tell him why chapter i st marys school wasnt exactly castle howard but it certainly looked impressive enough to be used as a location in a bbc classic drama banks and susan turned through the high wroughtiron gates and drove along a winding driveway sycamores flanked both sides laying down a carpet of rust and gold leaves doublewinged seeds spun down like helicopter blades in the drizzle through the trees they first glimpsed the imposing gray stone building with its central cupola high windows and columns flanking the front entrance statues stood on the tops of the columns against a frieze and double stairs curled out at the front like lobster claws st marys school for girls banks had read was founded in on forty acres of woodland by the river swain the main building completed in had been intended as a country house but had never been lived in rumor had it that lord satterthwait for whom the house had been built lost much of his fortune in an illadvised business venture abroad along with the money of a number of other county luminaries and was forced to flee the area in disgrace for america the grounds were quiet this morning but a group of girls in maroon blazers saw banks pull up and started whispering among themselves the car was unmarked but banks and susan were strangers and by now everyone must know that deborah harrison had been murdered banks asked one of the girls where they might find the head and she directed him through the front door right down to the back of the building then along the last corridor to the right inside the place was all high ornate ceilings and dark polished wainscoting susans footsteps echoed as they walked it was certainly a far cry from the institutional gloom of eastvale comprehensive or from bankss old redbrick school in peterborough for that matter they walked along the narrow corridor noting the giltframed paintings of past heads on the walls most of them were men when they reached the door marked dr js green principal banks knocked sharply expecting to be asked into an anteroom and vetted by a secretary first banks was surprised when he and susan found themselves in the heads office like the rest of the building it had a high ceiling with elaborate cornices but there its ancient character ended the wainscoting if there had been any had been removed and the walls were papered in an attractive laura ashley print a shaded electric light hung from the old chandelier fixture and several gunmetal filing cabinets stood against the wall the bay window dominated the room its window seat scattered with cushions that matched the wallpaper the view through the trees to the river banks noticed was magnificent even on a drizzly november morning across the river was st marys park with its pond trees benches and childrens playground what do you think dr green asked after they had introduced themselves and shaken hands pardon said banks she took their raincoats and hung them on a rack in the corner i couldnt help but notice that you were casing the joint as they say she said hardly said banks thats what the bad guys do she blushed slightly oh dear my gaffe i suppose criminal parlance is not my forte banks smiled just as well anyway its very nice the tall elegant dr julia green looked every bit as laura ashley as her walls the skirt and waistcoat she wore over her white blouse were made of heavy cloth earth colors dominated browns and greens mixed with the odd flash of muted pink or yellow like wildflowers poking their way through the undergrowth her ashblonde hair lay neatly piled and curled on her head with only one or two loose strands she had a narrow face high cheekbones and a small nose there was also a remote unattainable quality about her that intrigued banks she might be one of the pale and distant beauties but there was no mistaking the sharp glint of intelligence in her applegreen eyes right now they also looked red from crying this is a terrible business she said though i suppose you have to deal with it all the time not often said banks and you never get used to it please sit down banks and susan sat in the two chairs opposite the small solid desk susan took her notebook out i dont know how i can help you dr green went on but ill do my best maybe you could start by telling us what kind of a girl deborah was she rested her hands on the desk tapered fingers laced together i cant tell you very much she said deborah iswasa daygirl do you know how the system works i dont know much about public schools at all independent school she corrected him public school sounds so victorian dont you think well you see we have a mix of daygirls and boarders the actual balance changes slightly from year to year but at the moment we have daypupils and boarding when i say that deborah was a daygirl i dont describe her status in any way just note the simple fact that she came and went each day so one didnt develop any special relationship with her relationship yes well when you live in such close proximity to the pupils youre bound to get to know more about them arent you in what way in any number of ways whether it be the crisis of elizabeth s first period merediths parents divorce or barbaras estrangement from her mother these things cant help but come out from time to time with the boarding pupils so youd soon find out whos a troublemaker for example yes not that we have any troublemakers nothing serious anyway we did catch one girl smoking marijuana in the dorm last year and some years ago one of our uppersixth girls got pregnant but these are extremes you understand quite rare have you ever had any inkling of widespread problems here such as what drugs perhaps or pornography chief inspector this isnt a comprehensive you know perhaps not but girls will be girls i dont know what you mean by that but to answer your question no theres been nothing of that nature at st marys do you live on the school grounds dr green nodded theres a small block of flats for members of stafffor some of us anywayand i live there alone yes alone so what can you tell me about deborah harrison dr green shrugged just superficial things really she was a bright girl very intelligent i dont think theres much doubt she would have ended up at oxford or cambridge had she lived where did her strengths lie she was something of an allrounder but she excelled in the sciencesmaths and physics in particular she was also good at modern languages she had just entered the lower sixth this year the school offers twentythree subjects at alevel deborah was taking four mathematics french german and physics what about her personality dr green leaned back and put her hands on the arms of her chair again i can only be fairly superficial thats all right she always seemed cheerful and lively you know some girls can get very moody and withdrawn in the lower sixththey go through a very difficult period in their livesbut deborah seemed to be outgoing she was an outstanding athlete swimming tennis running field events she was a good equestrian too i understand she belonged to the chess club yes she was a fine player a superb strategist you sound as if you play yourself she smiled moderately well id appreciate it if you could provide me with a list of the other members of course dr green searched through one of the filing cabinets and handed banks a sheet of paper with ten names on it then she paused scratched her cheek and said i must admit chief inspector the questions youre asking surprise me they do why well i know nothing of police work of course but i fail to understand why you should require my impressions of deborah in order to apprehend the criminal who attacked and murdered her what kind of questions do you think i should be asking she frowned i dont know about strangers in the area that sort of thing have you noticed any suspicious strangers hanging around the area lately no banks blew his nose sorry well that covers that one doesnt it now what about deborahs faults faults yes was she mischievous disobedient dishonest willful no more than any other child of her age less than most actually she thought for a moment no id say if deborah did have a fault it was that she tended to show off her abilities to some extent she could sometimes make the other girls feel small or awkward and clumsy she had a tendency to belittle people was she boastful not at all no thats not what i mean she never boasted about her abilities she just used them to the full she wasnt the kind to hide her light under a bushel half the time it was as if she didnt even realize she was so much brighter and more fortunate than many she liked the way her quickness with figures impressed people for example so she would add up or multiply things in her head quicker than some of the other girls could do it with a calculator thats one good way to make enemies banks remembered his own school math reports could do better than this harder work needed watch that arithmetic it was hardly serious dr green went on shrugging simply a matter of girlish exuberance a young woman taking full joy in her talents her eyes sparkled for a moment have you forgotten what it was like to be young to be popular gifted i dont know that i was ever gifted or popular banks said with a sidelong glance at susan who was smiling down into her notebook but i do remember what it was like to be young i thought i would live forever after the awkward silence that followed banks asked was deborah popular with the other girls what do you mean she sounds like a right little madam to me a proper pain in the neck i was wondering how she got on with her classmates really chief inspector dr green said through tight lips these were very minor faults im talking about mostly deborah was friendly cheerful and helpful was there any friend in particular yes megan preece her names on the list i gave you i understand from daniel charters banks went on that there was some trouble with ive jelačić the sexton yes julia green rubbed her cheek hed been bothering the girls saying things making lewd gestures that sort of thing had deborah in particular complained about him i believe she had did she continue going to the church after mr jelačić made his accusations against daniel charters it was my impression that her father seemed more upset about what charters had been accused of rather than what jelačić did julia green paused for a moment then said yes yes he was i dont understand it myself the school stands one hundred per cent behind father charters but sir geoffrey forbade deborah from singing with the choir or attending any services why do you think he did that i dont know some people are justwell very funny about any hint of homosexuality in the ministry did deborah obey him as far as i know she did i never saw her there anyway did deborah keep any of her belongings here at school all the girls have desks no lockers or anything she shook her head not the daygirls they bring what they need from day to day mostly might we have a look of course weve canceled classes for the day so the room should be empty she led them through a maze of high corridors to a small room it wasnt like any classroom banks had ever seen before with its wellpolished woodwork and nicely spaced desks this one said dr green pointing to a desk banks lifted the hinged flap he hadnt expected muchschool desks are hardly the most private of placesbut he was disappointed by how little there was a couple of school exercise books a computer magazine textbooks pens and pencils there was also a tattered paperback jeffrey archer deborahs intelligence obviously hadnt stretched as far as her literary taste under the flap deborah had taped a photograph of a scruffy pop star banks didnt recognize dr green saw it and said with a smile we discourage such things but what can you do banks nodded then he examined the desk surface to see if deborah had carved any initials the way he had at school again nothing strongly discouraged no doubt thanks he said to dr green can we have a word with megan preece now is she here dr green nodded after stopping back at her office for their raincoats and her umbrella she led them outside where are we going banks asked the school infirmary thats where megan is im afraid she had rather a nasty turn when i broke the news in assembly this morning ii the brick shattered the vicarage window at ninethirty that morning waking rebecca from the uneasy doze she had slipped into after taking three aspirin and a glass of water at first she lay there terrified fearing that someone had broken in then slowly so as not to make the bedsprings creak she sat up ears pricked for any sounds but nothing came she put on her dressinggown and looked out of the bedroom window nothing but the drizzle on the trees and graves and policemen in capes searching the grounds she tiptoed downstairs and when she got to the front room she saw the damage shards of glass lay all over the floor and some had even got as far as the sofa and coffeetable the brick had clearly been thrown from the river path beyond the small garden an area that was unguarded because it didnt provide access to the graveyard the brick had bounced off the coffeetable and ended up in the far corner by the sideboard it had a piece of paper wrapped around it fixed by a rubber band slowly rebecca bent picked up the brick and unfolded the paper once you let the devil into your heart he will corrupt every cell in your body and this is what has happened it is clear you must confess your sins it is the only way or else we must take things into our own hands someone knocked at the back door crumpling the note in her pocket rebecca gathered her dressinggown around her and went to see who it was is everything all right maam asked one of the uniformed constables who had been searching the graveyard i thought i heard breaking glass you did rebecca said but everythings fine just a little domestic accident are you sure yes rebecca started closing the door on him thank you everythings fine when she had shut the door she leaned her back against it and listened in a few seconds she heard his footsteps going along the path she took out a dustpan and broom and busied herself sweeping up the glass wondering what she could use to cover the broken window before she caught a chill and died maybe that would be best for everyone she thought it would be very fitting too hadnt emily brontë died after catching a chill at her brothers funeral but no she wasnt going to give the miserable meanspirited bastards the satisfaction just as she was trying to tape up a piece of cardboard over the window the phone rang can you talk the familiar voice asked patrick yes yes i can weve been given the day off pupils and staff that terrible business with the girl it must have been especially awful for you how are you bearing up oh not bad i suppose is daniel hes out meeting in york said he couldnt get out of it could we see one another i could come over i dont know rebecca said feeling herself flush with desire like a silly schoolgirl as she spoke no i dont think we should not the way things are around here but i want you rebecca put her hand over the mouthpiece and took a deep breath dont you want me he went on of course i want you patrick you know i do its justtheres police all over the place we could go for a drive rebecca paused and looked around her she couldnt stay here not with this mess not after the threatening note she would go insane and she couldnt deal with the police either on the other hand the very thought of patrick made her tingle god how she hated herself hated the way her body could so easily betray her morality and her good intentions how her defective conscience found ways of rationalizing it all all right she said but you mustnt come here i mean it about the police we shouldnt be seen together ill pick you up at the no lets meet at the hotel she looked at her watch theres a bus at tenfifteen all right ill be waiting for you iii these are the dormitories for the boarding pupils dr green pointed out as they walked through the school grounds the two large buildings ahead were of far more recent construction than the main school building redbrick for the most part with some stone at their bases functional rather than aesthetically pleasing as i said earlier we have boarders they have showers central heating all the comforts the modern child requires youll also notice we have installed a number of lamps along all the major pathways theyre kept on until ten oclock every night by which time all the girls are expected to be in bed this isnt lowood or dotheboys you realize parents spend a lot of money to send their children here television she smiled yes that too whats that building over there banks pointed through the trees to a threestorey rectangular building that seemed to be made of some sort of prefabricated concrete the color of porridge thats the staff residence im afraid said dr green ugly isnt it actually its quite nice inside the flats are quite spacious livingroom bedroom storage heaters luxury who lives there apart from you at the moment six of the flats are occupied it all depends we have thirty members of staff a very good ratio and some of our teachers live in or near town the flats are essentially for single members of staff who have recently moved into the area or as in my case single teachers who want to maintain close contact with the school she tilted her umbrella and gave banks a challenging glance from under the rim you asked me rather impertinently not so long ago whether i lived alone the school is my life chief inspector i have neither the inclination nor the time for anyone or anything else banks nodded then he sneezed susan blessed him here we are dr green went on stepping under the porch of the dormitory and lowering her umbrella she shook it carefully before rolling it up the infirmary is on the ground floor we have one fulltime nurse on staff and a local doctor on call they walked down the hall and entered the infirmary it smelled of disinfectant after a brief word with the nurse dr green directed banks and susan towards a row of curtained cubicles in one of which megan preece lay on a narrow bed megans fine nurse says dr green whispered but shes had a terrible shock and shes been given a mild tranquillizer so please go slowly banks nodded there clearly wasnt room for all of them in the cubicle yet dr green seemed to want to stay its all right banks said ushering susan to megans bedside chair well find our own way out when weve finished dr green stood for a moment and frowned then she nodded turned on her heel and clicked away down the corridor when banks found a chair for himself susan was already talking to megan reassuring her that everything would be all right from what banks could see of the head poking above the gray blanket megan was a slight thin girl of about deborah harrisons age with dark curly hair and a tanned complexion but megans features lacked whatever cohesion or symmetry it took to make her conventionally pretty unlike her friend deborah who had been beautiful in that lissom blonde athletic sort of way megans nose was a little too big and slightly crooked her lips were too thin and her mouth was too small for her teeth but her big serious earthbrown eyes were striking they seemed to capture you at first glance and draw you to her banks introduced himself noting that megan seemed comfortable enough in the presence of a male policeman and said he wanted to ask her a few questions about deborah megan nodded eyes turning a little glassy at the mention of her friends name were you very close friends he began she nodded were both daygirls and weve known each other for years we both live in the same area i thought you must be boarding said banks why arent you at home i had a dizzy spell at assembly then ii got all upset nurse says i should rest here for a while then i can go home at lunchtime therell be nobody there anyway mummys away in america and daddys at work i see now can you tell me what happened yesterday after the chess club go as slowly as you want theres no hurry megan chewed her lower lip then began well when wed put all the boards and pieces away in the cupboard and made sure the room was tidy we left the school was this the main building yes we hold the chess club in one of the upstairs classrooms what time just before six oclock how many attended last night only eight lesley and carol are doing a play with the theatre department so they had rehearsals the others are all boarders i see was there anyone else around a few people coming and going as usual the school is always well lit and there are always people around okay go on well we walked down the drive to kendal road theres only one main gate you see the schools surrounded by woods and theres the river on the west side it was so foggy we could hardly see the trees around us i must admit i was getting a bit scared but debs seemed to be enjoying herself what do you mean oh she liked things like that spooky things she liked to tell ghost stories in graveyards just for fun do you know if she ever went inside the inchcliffe mausoleum she never said anything to me about it if she did okay go on we crossed the road i live on st marys hill behind the shops so debs and i always said goodbye at the bridge she put her hand over her eyes take it easy susan said take your time when banks looked down he noticed that megan was gripping susans hand at the side of the bed megan took a deep breath and went on thats all she said we said goodbye debs was running backwards just showing off like then she disappeared into the fog she frowned was there something else banks asked did you notice anyone else around well like i said it was so foggy you couldnt really see more than a few feet but i saw a shape behind her i remember thinking at the time there was something odd about it but i put it down to the way debs had been scaring me with her stories of ghosts taking shape from the fog you mean you thought you were imagining it yes seeing things but i know i wasnt if that makes any sense youre doing fine megan what kind of shape was it it was a mans shape a tall man what was he doing nothing he was just standing on the bridge looking down the river towards the town she paused and her eyes lit up thats it thats what was strange he was looking over the bridge towards the town but he couldnt possibly see anything could he because of the fog so why was he standing there did you think that at the time no it just came to me did you see what he looked like not really because of the fog i mean he was like a silhouette a dark figure his features werent clear and he was in profile he did have a bit of a big nose though could you see what he was wearing an anorak i think a bright color orange or red maybe did you see him approach deborah no he was just behind her i dont think shed seen him because she was still running backwards and waving goodbye i remember thinking if she wasnt careful shed bump into him and that would give her a shock but i really didnt think much of it i mean it wasnt the only person wed seen who else did you see just ordinary people you know crossing the road and such i mean life goes on doesnt it just because its foggy you cant stop doing everything can you thats true said banks can you remember anything else megan squeezed her eyes shut i think he had dark hair she said then i turned away and went home i never thought anything of it untiluntil this morning when i heardi should have known something was going to happen shouldnt i how could you i just should poor debs it could have been me it should have been me dont be silly megan but its true debs was so good so wonderful and pretty and talented and just look at me im nothing im not pretty she should have lived im the one who should have died its not fair why does god always take the best i dont know the answer to that banks replied softly but i do know that every life is important every life has its value and nobody has the right to decide who lives and who dies only god only god banks repeated and blew his nose in the ensuing silence megan took a tissue from the box on the table beside her and wiped her eyes i must look a sight she said banks smiled just like me first thing in the morning he said now when we found deborah she had about six pounds in her purse did she ever have a lot of money to flash around money no none of us ever carried more than a few pounds do you know if she kept anything valuable in her satchel megan frowned no just the usual stuff exercise books textbooks that sort of thing did she say if she was intending to meet anyone after the chess club or go anywhere else before she went home no as far as i know she was going straight home can you tell us anything else about her like what you were her best friend werent you yes did you ever fall out sometimes why nothing really maybe debs would tease me about a lad she thought i liked or something or about not being good at arithmetic and id get mad but it wouldnt last long is that all yes she can be quite a tease can debs she gets her little needle in where she knows it hurts and just keeps pushing she put her hand to her mouth oh i didnt mean that to sound as bad as it did honest i didnt all i mean is that she had an eye for a weakness and she could be a bit nasty about it it was never anything serious do you know if anything had been bothering her lately i dont think so shed been a bit moody thats all since when the beginning of term did she say why no we have a lot on our minds a lot of work and shes been moody before she didnt mention any problems anything that might have been worrying her no did she have any enemies anyone who might have wanted to harm her no everyone loved debs it must have been a stranger did she ever mention mr jelačić the sexton at st marys the man who got fired thats the one she said he was gross always sticking his tongue out and licking his lips when she went past did he ever bother you i never went in the churchyard i live this side of the river over kendal road it was a short cut for debs are you sure deborah didnt have any other problems any worries maybe at home no she didnt complain about anything in particular only the usual stuff too much homework that sort of thing banks realized that deborah harrison would probably have fewer practical causes for concern than his own daughter tracy who at one time anyway had been constantly moaning about some new style of jacket or jeans she just had to have because everyone else was wearing it and the doc martens that were just essential these days banks had been like that himself and he gave tracy the same answer his mother and father gave him when they bought him a pair of heavy workboots for school instead of the thinsoled winklepickers he had asked for we cant afford it youll just have to make do these will last a lot longer but deborah harrison had wanted for nothing at least nothing that had a monetary value what about boyfriends banks asked megan blushed we dont have time not in the lower sixth and debs was always involved in some school event equestrian sports or quizzes or whatever so she didnt have a boyfriend im not saying she never had one when was the last one in the summer what was his name she told me his name was john thats all they didnt go out together for long she said he was really cool but too thick so she chucked him did she tell you anything else about him megan blushed no are you sure yes thats all i know his name was john and he was a thickie where did she meet him i dont know she didnt say i was away in america all summer with my parents so i didnt see her until school started by then shed already chucked him was he her first boyfriend i dont think so but there was never anyone serious how do you know she would have told me does she tell you everything megan considered the question seriously for a moment or so then said no i dont think so she can be secretive can debs but shed tell me if she had a boyfriend or id just know was she being secretive about anything recently megan frowned yes she was i was getting fed up of it did she tell you anything about it no it wouldnt be a secret then would it did she tell you who or what it concerned megan shook her head no did she say anything about it just that she thought it was time to tell someone and then to watch what happened when the sh just to see what happened when did she tell you this just as she was leaving on the bridge while she was running backwards yes itsit was the last thing she said her eyes filled with tears im tired all right said banks im sorry megan youre doing really well ill try not to be much longer but you must realize how important it is if it was a secret about somebody who didnt want it knownand if that somebody knew that deborah knewdo you see what i mean megan nodded how long had she been talking about this secret since the beginning of term thats quite a long time yes shed let it drop for a week or two then bring it up again would she have told anyone else no im her best friend is there anything else you can tell us megan anything at all megan shook her head i dont think so banks and susan stood up get some rest now banks said and believe me well be doing our best to find out who did this they said goodbye to the nurse picked up their raincoats and headed out into the drizzle what did you think banks asked susan as they walked back to the car about megan i think she told us pretty much all she knew notice the way she blushed and turned her eyes away when i pushed her about the boyfriend id say theres more to that relationship than shes told us well sir said susan from my experience id say deborah probably said he had his uses but he was thick you think deborah might have slept with this john she might have but thats not what i mean what i mean is shed say that or hint that she had the way kids do it doesnt mean they actually did anything and megan was embarrassed by it yes id guess megan is a bit shy around boys would you agree she was the ugly one in that relationship i wouldnt put it quite that way sir banks smiled im sorry it must be something to do with being on school grounds again it takes me back but when you were a teenager and you met two girls one of them was bound to be the ugly one and when you met two boys one of them was certain to be a drip and the other an octopus if you were really lucky you got a combination of the two banks laughed im sorry sir susan went on i dont get your point surely youre not suggesting that megan preece had anything to do with deborahs murder no of course not just thinking out loud is all they got in the unmarked police car when it started up vaughan williamss suite for viola and orchestra was playing on the radio the beautiful melancholy ballad it suited the falling leaves and the november drizzle perfectly banks thought im just trying to understand the relationship so that i can understand the way deborah related to people he said the way i see it is that megan was the less attractive of the two friends that would probably make her adoring and resentful in equal measures she knew she was overshadowed and outclassed by deborahs looks and talent and for the most part she was probably content to bask in the glory of being the chosen one best friend of the goddess are you with me so far yes sir megan was the kind of friend who could only make deborah look even better right but it also sounded as if deborah could twist the knife too could be cruel if she could annoy her best friend the way she did then she could have angered a more dangerous enemy dont you think its possible sir but a bit farfetched if you dont mind me saying so i still say were looking for a stranger and from what we know already that stranger on the bridge could have been ive jelačić true said banks it could also have been a figment of megans imagination at least in part but well sort out mr jelačić later hes not going anywhere ken blackstones got him under surveillance what do you think about the secret not much a lot of schoolkids are like that as megan said it probably didnt mean anything not to her perhaps but maybe to someone else look isnt that he pointed as they were turning left onto north market street banks noticed a woman in a long navy raincoat standing at the busstop over the road isnt it who susan asked oh i forgot you havent met her rebecca charters the vicars wife im sure it was her i wonder where shes going curioser and curioser said susan chapter i well sir said sergeant hatchley looking at his watch dont you think we might as well have a spot of lunch barry stott sighed oh all right come on this was the detective inspectors first major case after his promotion and transfer and he intended to make the most of it the only thorn in the ointment was this idle thick lump of yorkshire blubber beside him detective sergeant hatchley stott would have preferred dc susan gay not because she was prettier than hatchleyhe didnt find her attractive in that waybut because she was smarter keener and a lot less trouble like now left to himself stott would have skipped lunch or bought a takeaway from one of the cafés on north market street the morning had been a waste of time they had found no leads in the sex offender files and all stott could find out from immigration about jelačić was that he was an engineer from split who had come to england two years ago and since then he had worked at a variety of odd jobs never lasting long in any one place short of going to croatia himself stott thought it didnt look as if it would be an easy task getting hold of a criminal record if there was one at least out here near the crime scene he felt he had a good chance of scoring some success somebody had to have noticed a stranger in the area fog or no fog or a car parked where it shouldnt be st marys was after all an uppercrust area and people who could afford to live there were very wary of strangers and stott was sure that a stranger had murdered deborah harrison they were standing in the rain outside the nags head at the northwest corner of kendal road and north market street diagonally across from st marys church and stott was ready to do just about anything to shut hatchley up it wasnt the kind of pub youd expect in such a wealthy area stott thought no thick carpet polished brass and gleaming wood pot of mulled wine heating on the bar in fact it looked distinctly shabby he guessed it was probably a travelers pub being situated at such an important junction in one form or another kendal road ran all the way from the lake district to the east coast and market street was a major northsouth route the locals would have their own tasteful pubs hidden away in the residential streets either that or they drove out to the country clubs there were about six people in the lounge bar stott noted with distaste that the room smelled of smoke and beer this certainly wasnt his kind of pub if there were such a place he far preferred churches pubs as far as stott was concerned were simply breeding grounds for trouble pubs were where fights startedand he had a couple of scars from his beat days to prove thatthey were where crooked deals took place dodgy goods traded hands places where drugs were openly sold where prostitutes plied their filthy trade spreading disease and misery close all the pubs and youd force the criminals into the open right into the waiting arms of the police at least that was what di barry stott thought as he turned up his nose in the nags head that lunchtime sergeant hatchley on the other hand looked quite at home he rubbed his hamlike hands together and said ah this is better nowt like a bit of pub grub to take away the chill dont you think sir lets make it quick sergeant yes sir alf over here mate lets have a bit of service a person could die of thirst if there were a landlord hatchley didnt know by name in all of the eastvalenay all of swainsdalestott would have been surprised when alf finally turned up stott waited while he and hatchley exchanged a few pleasantries then ordered a ham and cheese sandwich and a cup of tea alf raised his eyebrows but said nothing ill have one of those bloody great big yorkshire puddings full of roast beef peas and gravy said hatchley and a pint of bitter of course this seemed to please alf more pint in hand hatchley marched over to a table by the window through the streaked glass they could see the raindarkened trees in the park and the walls of st marys church across the intersection square tower poking out above the trees the drizzle hadnt kept the ghouls away here and there along the sixfoot stone wall people would jump up every now and then and hold themselves up by the fingertips for a glimpse into the graveyard a group of about ten people stood by the kendal road entrance journalists one of them a woman stood talking into a microphone and looking into a video camera wrapped in a black plastic bag to protect it from the rain someone else held a bright light over her head yorkshire television stott thought or bbc north and newspaper reporters pretty soon theyd be doing reenactments for crimewatch banks was right the vultures had come we havent had much of a chance to get to know one another since you got here have we sir said hatchley lighting a cigarette and i always find it helps to know a bit about one another if youre going to work together dont you i suppose so said stott inwardly grimacing trying to sit downwind of the drifting smoke it didnt work he thought it must be one of those laws like sods and murphys wherever a nonsmoker sat the smoke was going to come his way no matter which way the draft was blowing where are you from sir hatchley asked spalding lincolnshire id never have guessed it not from the accent like we moved away when i was just a boy where all over the place cyprus germany my father was in the army stott remembered the misery of each move it seemed that as soon as he had made friends anywhere he had to abandon them and start all over again his childhood had consisted of a neverending succession of new groups of strangers to whom he had to prove himself cruel strangers with their own initiation rights just waiting to humiliate him he remembered the beatings the namecalling the loneliness a squaddie eh major actually pretty high up then hatchley swigged some beer where does he live now worthing he retired a few years ago not a dishonorable discharge i hope sir no look sir said hatchley ive been wondering about this here inspectors exam ive been thinking of giving it a go like is it easy stott shook his head all promotional exams were tough and involved several stages from the multichoice law test and the roleplaying scenarios to the final oral in front of an assistant chief constable and a chief superintendent how hatchley had even passed the sergeants exam was a mystery to stott good luck he muttered as a pastyfaced young woman delivered their food and stotts pot of tea which was actually just a pot of lukewarm water and a teabag on a string to dunk in it and they were stingy with the ham too about one in four get through he added how old was hatchley he wondered he couldnt be older than his midthirties maybe five or six years older than stott himself and just look at him unfit a bulky man with hair like straw piggy eyes freckles spattered across his fleshy nose tobaccostained teeth he also seemed to own only one suitshiny and wrinkledand there were egg stains on his tie stott could hardly imagine hatchley going up before the chief for his formal promotion dressed like that stott prided himself on his dress he had five suitstwo gray two navy blue and one brown herringboneand he wore them in rotation if its thursday it must be herringbone he also wore his fathers old striped regimental tie and usually a crisply laundered white shirt with a starched collar he always made sure that he was clean shaven and that his hair was neatly parted on the left and combed diagonally across his skull on each side then fixed in place with spray or cream if need be he knew that the way his ears stuck out still made him look odd especially with his glasses hooked over them just as they had when he was a young boy and that people called him names behind his back there was an operation you could have for stickingout ears these days he had heard maybe if it wasnt too late hed have his ears done soon a freakish appearance could after all be detrimental to ones career path and barry stott felt destined for the chief constables office hatchley tucked into his yorkie with great relish adding a gravy stain to the egg on his tie when he had finished he lit another cigarette inhaled deeply and blew out the smoke with a sigh of such deep satisfaction as stott had never encountered before over a mere physical functionand an unpleasant one at that one of natures true primitives sergeant hatchley wed better be getting along sergeant he said pushing his plate aside and standing up cant i finish my fag first sir best part of the meal the cigarette after if you know what i mean he winked stott felt himself flush you can smoke it outside he said rather harshly hatchley shrugged slurped down the rest of his pint then followed stott towards the door bye alf he said on the way to the door i hope our lads didnt catch you serving drinks after hours last night what lads said alf hatchley turned and walked towards the bar police didnt they come and ask you questions last night whether youd seen any strangers that sort of thing alf shook his head nah nobody in last night i shut up at ten oclock filthy weather by the time stott got to the bar hatchley seemed to have magically acquired another pint and his cigarette had grown back to its original length stott swallowed his anger were you open earlier hatchley asked alf snorted aye for what it were worth any strangers we get a lot of strangers he said you know commercial travelers and the like tourists ramblers aye i know that said hatchley but how about yesterday late afternoon early evening nah weather were too bad for driving anyone at all alf scratched his stubbly cheek one bloke he had nobbut two pints and a whisky and left that were it a regular nah dont have many regulars people round here are too stuckup for the likes of this place stott was beginning to feel frustrated this alf was obviously a moron they would get nothing useful out of him but you said you hadnt had any strangers in lately he said he werent a stranger either who was he then nay dont ask me but you said you knew him alf looked over at hatchley and gave a sniff of disgust before turning back to stott and answering no i didnt he said i said he werent a regular but he werent exactly a stranger either different thing so youve seen him before alf spat on the floor behind the bar well of course i bloody have stands to reason doesnt it hed have been a stranger if i hadnt seen him before wouldnt he hatchley took over again all right alf he said youre right good point how often have you seen him not often but hes been in three or four times this past year or so used to come in with a lass a right bonnie lass and all but not the last few times do you know who he is no he always stuck to himself any idea where he lives could be bloody timbuktu for all i know are you saying he was africanenglish stott cut in alf gave him a withering look its just a saying like summat me mother used to say what did he look like hatchley asked well he were a tall bloke i remember that a bit over six foot anyroad thick black hair a bit too long over tcollar if you ask me bit of a long nose too did you talk to him no more than to serve him and make a few remarks about the weather he didnt seem to want to talk took his pint over by the fire and just sat there staring into his glass muttered to himself now and then too as i recall he talked to himself well not all the time and not like he was having a conversation or anything no hed just say something once in a while as if he were thinking out loud like you do sometimes did you hear anything he said nay he were too far away did he have any sort of an accent stott cut in couldnt say did you know ive jelačić the sexton over the road at st marys nah he drank at tpig and whistle how do you know landlord stan told me after it was in tpapers like about him and that dodgy vicar did you ever see mr jelačić only from a distance could this have been him couldve been i suppose same height and hair color do you know if this customer had a car how would i know that alf rubbed his chin come to think of it he looked more like hed been walking you know a bit damp short of breath what time was this alf hatchley asked about five oclock what time did he leave just afore six like i said he had nobbut two pints and a double whisky one for the road he said and knocked it back in one then he was out the door alf mimicked the drinking action stott pricked up his ears the timing worked assuming the girl had been killed on her way home from the school chess club was that the way a person might act before raping and murdering a sixteenyearold schoolgirl in a foggy graveyard stott wondered a dram of dutch courage he tried to remember what hed learned in the criminal psychology course the trouble was you could justify just about any sort of behavior if you were talking about a psycho some of them liked to sit and have a beer and a fag before a nice little dismemberment others liked to buy a box of chocolates or bunch of flowers for their mothers you could never predict so maybe the killer would have dropped in at the nags head why not maybe he just needed to sit there for a while have a little chat with himself about what he was going to do did you see which direction he went stott asked nay you dont expect me to chase outside after my customers and see which way theyre going do you what was he wearing stott asked orange anorak expensive type by the looks of it that goretex stuff lots of pockets and zips can you remember anything else about his appearance im not good at describing people never was do you think you could work with a police artist dunno never tried it will you give it a try alf shrugged sergeant stott said go and see if you can get a police artist out as soon as possible will you ill wait here it was almost worth suffering the stale smoke and booze atmosphere of the nags head for another hour or so to see the expression on sergeant hatchleys face as he trudged out into the rain ii they had made love in every position imaginable sideways backwards forwards upside down they had also done it in just about every place they could think of her bed his bed hotels a field his cramped orion up against a wall under the kitchen table sometimes it seemed to last forever other times it was over almost before it began sometimes the foreplay went on so long rebecca thought she would burst other times they were overtaken by a sense of urgency and didnt even have time to get all their clothes off this time it had been urgent afterwards rebecca lay on the bed of a hotel room in richmond panting for breath covered by a film of sweat her skirt was bunched up around her waist her knickers down still hanging around one bare ankle her blouse was open at the front a couple of the buttons torn off in the heat of the moment and her bra was pushed up to expose her breasts patricks head lay against her shoulder she could feel his breath warm against her skin both their hearts were beating fast rebecca rested one hand over his broad strong shoulders and with the other she stroked the hair over his ear felt the stubbly down at the back of his neck where it had been recently cut it wasnt loveshe knew enough to realize thatbut it was one hell of a fine substitute but all too soon the sense of shame and melancholy that always came to her after sex with patrick began to descend like a thick fog numbing the nerveends that only minutes before had thrilled to such exquisite pleasure and guilt began to overwhelm the vestiges of her joy patrick moved away and reached for a cigarette it was the one thing she disliked his smoking after sex but she didnt have the heart to tell him not to he also put his glasses on she knew he couldnt see a thing without them but sometimes she laughed because he looked so funny naked except for his glasses what is it patrick asked clearly sensing something was wrong didnt you enjoy it of course i did you know that i always dowith you noits just that i feel soso damn guilty then leave him come and live with me dont be foolish patrick just imagine the scandal schoolteacher shacks up with ministers wife youd lose your job for a start and where would we live oh dont be so practical wed manage well get a flat in town i can get another job well move away rebecca shook her head no no no why not dont you love me rebecca didnt answer you do love me dont you he persisted of course i do rebecca lied it was easier that way then leave him i cant you dont love him iidont know rebecca did love daniel somewhere inside her the feeling was still there she knew battered bruised halfevaporated but still there she couldnt explain that to patrick i shouldnt tell you this but rebecca felt a tingle run up her spine at the words nothing to do with sex yes she prompted him go on yesterday evening your husband came to see me daniel went to see you why he came to talk to me rebecca sat up she quickly slipped her bra down and rearranged her skirt to cover herself holding the front of her blouse together as best she could what about she asked feeling awkward and stupid about us patrick flicked his ash into the ashtray on the bedside table it was a small room with the curtains drawn and rebecca already felt claustrophobic but he doesnt know about us oh but he does he says hes known for a while he suspected something then he watched you hes seen us together my god he told me not to tell you hed been to see me what did he want he asked me to stop seeing you what did you say i told him the truth that we were in love that you were discovering for the first time your true erotic nature and that as soon as we could manage it you were going to leave him and we were going to live together rebecca couldnt believe what she was hearing daniel knew had known for ages you bloody fool she swung her legs over the side of the bed and pulled up her knickers then she buttoned her blouse put on her jacket over it and went to the wardrobe where her raincoat was hanging you bloody fool she muttered again under her breath daniel i must go to him patrick sat up and stubbed out his cigarette what do you mean it is the truth isnt it you idiot youve ruined everything he got up and walked over to her she thought he suddenly looked ridiculous with his glasses on the limp penis hanging between his thin hairy legs rebecca he said grasping her arms hes only concerned about how it looks with appearances dont you see he wants everything to seem normal for you to act like the dutiful vicars wife but its not you its really not you i know you rebecca i know your true nature weve discovered it together youre a wild passionate sensual creature not a bloody driedup vicars wife let me go she tore herself out of his grasp finished putting her raincoat on and grabbed the doorhandle dont do this rebecca he said stay with me dont be afraid of finding out who you really are follow your passion your feelings oh shut up you pompous bastard it was just a fuck thats all you dont know a bloody thing do you wait ill drive you he called out as she walked through the door dont bother she said over her shoulder ill catch a bus and she slammed the door behind her iii a couple of uniformed policemen kept the press away from sir geoffreys house when banks and susan got there early in the afternoon there were only about six reporters hanging around at the end of the driveway they fired off a few questions but banks ignored them too early to start giving statements to the press unless you were chief constable riddle of course the only new information banks had was that the swabs taken from deborah had revealed no traces of semen and he certainly wasnt going to tell the media that he had also discovered that sir geoffreys reception at the royal hotel in york had ended at four oclock plenty of time to get back home by six even in the fog lady harrison had indeed been at the health club but she hadnt arrived there until almost sixthirty banks hadnt noticed in the fog last night but the house had a large lawn and beautiful flowerbeds clearly the work of a gardener even keeping the lawn trimmed would have been a fulltime job the house itself was an ostentatious pile of victorian stone complete with gables probably built for one of the getrichquick wool merchants in the last century sir geoffrey himself answered bankss ring and beckoned the two of them in banks introduced susan is there any news sir geoffrey asked banks shook his head not yet sir sorry sir geoffrey looked drawn and stooped and he had large bags like bruises under his eyes banks followed him through to the white room with the bookcases the chagall and the grand piano michael clayton was sitting in one of the armchairs also looking as if he had gone without sleep for a week michael i believe you met detective chief inspector banks last night sir geoffrey said yes said clayton and i know detective constable gay too i dont know if i ever thanked you susan smiled all part of the service sir banks gave her a quizzical look mr clayton had his car and a valuable notebook computer stolen in august she explained we got them back for him someone was trying to sell the computer at eastvale market i dont think i explained last night sir geoffrey went on but in addition to being a dear friend michaels the scientific genius behind harclay industries i simply provide the sales and marketing strategies he clapped clayton on the shoulder i dont know what wed do without him please sit down wheres your wife sir banks asked sylvies resting shewe didnt get much sleep last night shes exhausted me too look weerim sorry things are a bit of a mess around here how can i help you we wont keep you long just a couple of questions sir geoffrey nodded wearily ill do the best i can thank you said banks weve talked to a few people at deborahs school and everyone seems to agree that deborah was a cheerful and talented girl sir geoffrey nodded sylvie and i are very proud of her but even the best of people make enemies banks went on often inadvertently can you think of any enemies deborah might have made sir geoffrey closed his eyes and thought for a moment then shook his head no she got along well with her schoolfriends and teachersim sure theyll all bear that outand there wasnt really anyone else in her life aside from family i heard that she had a tendency to show off at times would you say thats fair sir geoffrey smiled yes deborah can be a showoff and a bit of a devil at times but what child cant be banks smiled thinking of tracy and deborah was still a child in some ways he said she might not always have realized the effects of her actions on others do you see what i mean sir geoffrey nodded but i cant see us getting anywhere with this he said unless youre implying that someone at the school had something to do with her death or that bloody minister at st marys daniel charters thats the one why do you dislike him so the mans a pervert he abused his power banks shook his head but nothings been proved against him isnt he entitled to be presumed innocent until proven guilty in theory perhaps but a man in his position should be above suspicion the man who accused father charters is called ive jelačić would it surprise you to know that he made lewd gestures towards your daughter and that she complained to dr green the head of st marys she never told me that if she had id have broke his bloody neck banks turned to clayton did deborah ever confide in you about anything clayton raised his eyebrows me good heavens no i suppose i was just as uncool as her parents as far as she was concerned uncool you know teenagers chief inspector were ancient and decrepit creatures to them i suppose we are banks took a deep breath and turned back to sir geoffrey this is a little delicate im afraid but i have to ask where you went after the royal hotel reception ended at four oclock yesterday good god man you cant poss geoff he has to ask hes just doing his job said michael clayton putting his hand on sir geoffreys arm offensive though it may be sir geoffrey ran his hand over his hair i suppose so i had a private meeting with a client if you must know a man from the government called oliver jackson its a very confidential matter and i dont want anyone else to know about the meeting things like this can have an effect on share prices and any number of market factors not to mention international affairs do you understand banks nodded there is just one more thing sir geoffrey sighed go ahead if you must i was wondering about any boyfriends deborah might have had boyfriends yes it would be perfectly natural for a girl of sixteen to have an interest in the opposite sex perfectly innocent things like going to the pictures with a boy maybe she did have a ticket stub from the regal in her blazer pocket sir geoffrey shook his head she used to go to the pictures with her mother a lot the two of themdeborah didnt have any boyfriends chief inspector youre barking up quite the wrong tree there she didnt have time for boys had she never had a boyfriend only pierre if that counts at all pierre in bordeaux or rather at montclair my wifes family owns a chateau in the country near bordeaux we often spend holidays there pierre is a neighbours son all quite innocent of course of course banks agreed and a long way away yeswell look about this jelačić character thats a disturbing piece of news are you going to bring him in were pursuing inquiries in a number of directions banks said as he and susan walked to the door annoyed at himself for sounding as if he were talking to the press outside they ducked through the reporters beyond the gate and got back into bankss car out of the rain interesting dont you think banks said about the boyfriend yes sir either he really didnt know or he was lying but why lie perhaps deborah really did keep it a secret from him if hes a strict father i could see her doing that possibly what about his alibi very plausible said susan i noticed you didnt ask his wife for hers one at a time susan one a time besides i hardly think sylvie harrison murdered her own daughter shes not tall or strong enough for a start if she goes to a health club shes probably strong enough susan pointed out maybe she stood on a stone banks sneezed into his handkerchief bless you sir susan said they headed towards north market street you know said banks i think theres a lot more to deborahs life than people know or are saying id like to have another talk with her mother alone if possible michael clayton was right teenagers dont have a lot of time for adults but daughters do sometimes confide in their mothers and id like to find this john if he exists oh im sure he does sir deborah was an attractive girl and she was sixteen id be very surprised indeed if she had nothing at all to do with boys bankss car phone beeped he picked it up di stott here whats up barry i think we should meet up back at the station weve got a description of a possible suspect in the deborah harrison murder and it could be jelačić vic manson called too jelačićs prints are all over the vodka bottles were on our way banks switched off the phone and put his foot down iv all the way home on the rickety bus rebecca chewed her nails she didnt look once at the fading autumn scenery beyond the rainstreaked windows the muted gold russet and lemon leaves still clinging to the roadside trees fragile and insubstantial as the moons halo the soft greens and browns of the fields the runic patterns of the drystone walls she didnt notice the way that the dale to her west with its gradually steepening valley sides was partially lost in mist and drizzle making it look just like a chinese watercolor rebecca just chewed her nails and wished that tight tearing churning feeling inside her would go away she felt constantly on the verge of screaming and she knew if she started she could never stop she took deep breaths and held them to calm herself they helped by the time the bus lumbered into eastvale she had regained some control of her emotions but she still felt devastated as if her world had been suddenly blown apart she supposed it had to happen that she had been living a lie living on borrowed time or whatever other cliché she could come up with to describe the last few months of her life looking at it now her life had simply become one hangover after another either from booze or infidelity it didnt seem to make any difference what pleasures she had found in getting drunk or having sex were so fleeting and so quickly overwhelmed by the painsheadaches stomachache guilt shamethat they no longer seemed worthwhile but was it too late now had she lost daniel almost there she pushed the bell and felt the driver and other passengers giving her strange looks as she waited for the bus to stop what could they sense about her could they smell sex on her she hadnt washed before leaving patrick in richmond she had simply pulled her clothes on as quickly as possible and left but her raincoat covered the torn blouse god what could she do about that if daniel were home he would notice but what did it matter now he knew anyway even so she couldnt stand the thought of his knowing she had been with patrick this afternoon as the bus approached the stop she saw the knot of reporters hanging about by the church walls and knew why the passengers were looking at her she was getting off at st marys the scene of the most horrible crime eastvale had experienced in decades the bus came to a sharp halt and rebecca would have tumbled forwards if she hadnt been holding onto the metal pole when the doors opened she jumped off and dashed past the policeman at the gate then ran through the churchyard to the vicarage when she got there she flung open the door and called out for daniel silence thank god he wasnt home pulling off her torn blouse she ran upstairs to the bathroom to wash the smell of sex from her body then she would be ready to face daniel she would have to be v ive jelačić lived on the sixth floor of a tenstory block of flats in burmantofts off york road in the gray november drizzle the maze of tall buildings reminded banks of a newspaper picture hed seen of workers quarters in some siberian city charming isnt it said detective inspector ken blackstone waiting for them outside he looked at his watch do you know the council had to put slippery domes on all the roofs to stop kids climbing down on the upper balconies and breaking in through peoples windows immaculately dressed as usual blackstone made banks aware that his top collar button was undone and his tie a little askew blackstone looked like an academic with his wirerimmed glasses bookworms complexion and thinning sandy hair a little curly around the ears and he was in fact something of an expert on art and art fraud not that there was often much call for his area of expertise in leeds nobody had knocked off any atkinson grimshaws recently and only an idiot would try to fake a henry moore sculpture jelačićs alibi checks out blackstone said as they walked towards the entrance for what its worth and weve had a poke about his flat nothing what do you think its worth banks asked blackstone pursed his cupidsbow lips me about as much as a fart in a bathtub there were three of themall croatian stipe pavič mile pavelič and vjeko batorac theyd probably swear night was day to protect one another from the police here it is take my word the lift doesnt work banks looked through the open sliding doors the walls of the lift were covered in bright spraypainted graffiti and even from where he stood he could smell glue and urine they took the stairs instead surprising a couple of kids sniffing solvent on the thirdfloor stairwell the kids ran they knew the only people dressed like blackstone in that neighborhood were likely to be coppers there were a few times when banks regretted smoking and the climb to the sixthfloor flat was one of them puffing for breath and sweating a little he finally arrived at the outside walkway that went past the front doors number had once been red but most of the paint had peeled off it also looked as if it had been used for knifethrowing practice jelačić answered on the first knock wearing jeans and a string vest his upper body looked strong and muscular and tufts of thick black hair spilled through the holes in the vest with his height longish hair and hooked nose he certainly resembled the descriptions of the man seen in st marys yesterday evening why you bother me he said standing aside to let them in and letting his eyes rest on susan for longer than necessary i tell you already i have done nothing inside the flat was small enough to feel crowded with four people in it and tidy enough to surprise banks if nothing else ive jelačić was a good housekeeper an ironing board stood in one corner with a shirt spread over it and there was a small television set in the opposite corner no video or stereo equipment in sight the only other furniture in the room consisted of a battered sofa and a table with three chairs family photographs and a couple of religious icons stood on the mantelpiece over the electric fire how are you making a living now mr jelačić banks asked dole do you own a car why just answer the question da is old ford fiesta did you drive it to eastvale yesterday jelačić looked at blackstone ne i tell him already i play cards vjeko tells you and stipe and mile jelačić sat down on his sofa taking up most of it and lit a cigarette the room quickly began to fill with smoke blackstone stood with his back against the door and banks and susan sat on the wooden chairs banks soon noticed the way jelačić was sliding his eyes over susans body and he could tell susan noticed it too the way she made sure her skirt was pulled down as far over her knees as it would go and the way she kept her knees pressed tight together but still jelačić ogled the thing is banks said that people will often lie to cover for their friends if they think a friend is in trouble jelačić leaned forward aggressively muscles bulging in his arms and shoulders you call my friends liars jebem ti mater you tell that to their face fascist police upak banks held out a photograph of deborah harrison did you know this girl jelačić glared at banks for a moment before glancing towards the photo he shook his head are you sure da she went to st marys sang in the church choir used to walk through the graveyard on her way home he shook his head again i think youre lying mr jelačić you see she complained about you she said you used to make lewd sexual comments and gestures towards her what do you think about that is not true father charters said you were drunk most of the time you didnt do your job properly and you bothered the girls is that true ne he is liar all st marys people lie get ive in trouble make him lose job did you ever enter the inchcliffe mausoleum nikada is always locked banks looked at ken blackstone and rolled his eyes oh come on ive we found your fingerprints all over the empty vodka bottles in there vrag ti nosi we know you went down there why jelačić paused to sulk for a moment then said all right so i go down there sometime in summer when it get too hot just for cool you understand maybe i have a little drink and smoke is not crime did you ever take anyone else down there any girls nikada banks waved the photograph and you swear you didnt know this girl jelačić leaned back on the sofa maybe i just see her you know if i am working and she walk past so you do admit you might have seen her da but that is all mr jelačić what were you wearing last night jelačić pointed towards a coathook by the door a red windcheater hung on it shoes frowning jelačić got to his feet and picked up a pair of old trainers from the mat below the hook banks looked at the soles and thought he could see gravel trapped in the tread and perhaps bits of leaves there was also mud on the sides how did your shoes get in this state he asked i walk back from miles you didnt drive jelačić shrugged is not far wed like to take your shoes and windcheater in for testing banks said it would be easiest if you gave us permission youll get a receipt if i do not then well get a court order is okay you take them i have nothing to hide were you standing on the kendal road bridge around six oclock yesterday evening ne i go to miles house we play cards until late did you have two pints of beer and a double whisky in the nags head opposite st marys park i tell you i go to miles and we play cards and drink daniel charters told us youd been back to eastvale to extort money from him is that true vra je i tell you that man he is satans tool an evil liar so its not true that you offered to withdraw the charges in exchange for money is not true ne and i have nothing more to say jelačić looked at susan again letting his eyes travel slowly from her feet all the way up to her breasts where they lingered he didnt exactly lick his lips but he might as well have done banks saw susan flush with embarrassment and rage well let me just get clear what you have told us banks said last night you were playing cards with friends who will vouch for you right jelačić nodded you didnt know the girl in the photograph though you might have seen her in passing da but you certainly didnt leer at her or make any suggestive gestures ne and after you were unjustly fired you never went back to eastvale and tried to extort money out of father daniel charters nikada fine then said banks standing up thatll be all well be off now jelačić looked surprised you leave now dont worry well take good care of the clothing and get it back to you as soon as weve run our tests thank you for your cooperation mr jelačić good day and they left him gaping after them biggest load of bollocks ive ever heard in my life said ken blackstone as they walked down the stairs a dog went on pissing nonchalantly against the wall as they passed by banks lit a cigarette yes it was wasnt it what do you think susan whether he did it or not susan gay said between gritted teeth i think the bastard should be hung over the balcony by his balls sir chapter i it was after six and daniel still wasnt back rebecca paced she should make a start on dinner at least it would take her mind off things had all this happened just a couple of days ago she would have gone to see the angel blabbed her fears and feelings out to its marble heavenward gaze but the inchcliffe mausoleum was soured for her now by what she had seen there she put on her striped butchers aprona birthday present from daniel when he still had his sense of humorand searched in the fridge for the remains of the weekends roast she would make shepherds pie there was a bottle of marks and sparks sauvignon blanc in the fridge lying on its side near the front after a moments hesitation rebecca opened it and poured herself a generous glass before setting about grinding the leftover meat she was halfway through her second glass and had just put the potatoes on when she heard the door open daniel her legs turned to water suddenly she couldnt face him didnt know what to say he called out her name and she managed to tell him she was in the kitchen quickly she knocked back the rest of the wine and poured herself another glass her hand was shaking so much she spilled some of it on the table sometimes you just couldnt get drunk enough quick enough what happened to the front window daniel asked when he came through rebecca stared down at the potatoes in the pan waiting for the water to boil someone chucked a brick through it she said she didnt tell him about the note where were the police up around the inchcliffe mausoleum isnt it marvelous police all over the place but still a crime gets committed daniel rested the backs of his thighs against the solid wood table daniel a young girls been killed and i found her daniel rubbed his brow i know im sorry i wasnt thinking clearly bad day how was the meeting at least theyre resolved on not kicking me out for the present daniel said over the past month he had developed a tic beside his left eye it was jumping now but the bishop is very upset about the murder especially about its happening on church property thats another nail in my coffin things could hardly get much worse dont tempt providence providence hah i dont know if i still believe in providence any more or in anything for that matter im hungry he went to the fridge found some old cheddar and cut himself a chunk how about you rebecca shook her head the way her stomach felt she thought she might never be able to eat again the potatoes came to a boil she turned down the heat and wiped her hands on her apron the tension inside her had built so high that she felt like a volcano about to erupt she couldnt stand it any longer daniel she turned to face him what ii donttoday i the front doorbell rang damn rebecca banged her fist on the table who could that be ill go and see daniel went off to answer it rebecca grasped the edge of the table she could feel the room spinning around her and it wasnt the booze this time becky the note of concern in his voice brought her back are you all right she closed her eyes and shook her head not so bad im fine sorry i just came over a bit funny thats all when she opened her eyes she saw daniel standing next to the detective who had visited them last night he was smaller than youd expect for a policeman she noticed compact lean and wiry with an aura of pentup strength his closely cropped black hair showed just a little gray at the temples and his blue eyes danced and sparkled with energy there was a little crescent scar beside his right eye detective chief inspector banks is back daniel said he wants to ask us some more questions rebecca nodded took off her apron and followed them through to the livingroom she left the glass of wine on the kitchen table another postponement maybe she could drink herself through yet another night of guilt and misery im sorry to intrude again banks said when they had all sat down he sneezed took out a large handkerchief and blew his nose sorry i seem to be catching a cold look ill come straight to the point i can see you were busy getting dinner ready i was just wondering if maybe youd decided to tell me the truth about last night for a moment rebecca was stunned by the matteroffact way banks spoke the truth she echoed yes youre a poor liar mrs charters and you can take that as a compliment he glanced towards daniel when i asked your husband where he had been at the time you said you heard a cry you jumped in a bit too quickly and answered for him i did yes then he felt dutybound to lie to cover for you its all very admirable in some ways but it wont do not when theres a sixteenyearold girl lying dead in eastvale mortuary rebecca felt completely tonguetied what the hell was going on her mind whirled searching for things to say but before she could say anything a voice far calmer than her own cut in chief inspector daniel charters said im afraid thats my fault i should have corrected rebecca rather than let the deceit stand believe me there was no need for a lie i have nothing to hide banks nodded he seemed to be waiting for something else daniel sighed and went on yes i was out at the time my wife heard the cry but i can assure you that my whereabouts had absolutely nothing at all to do with the poor girls murder where were you banks asked rebecca noticed daniels lips tighten for a moment as he tensed in thought id rather not say it would help us a lot if we could verify your story daniel shook his head im afraid i wouldnt be able to prove my alibi even if i told you you could let us try he smiled sadly its a kind offer but the doorbell rang again ill go said rebecca whoever it is daniel told her get rid of them leaving them in silence rebecca went to open the front door patrick metcalfe was standing there he looked as if he had been walking around in the rain without a raincoat for hours oh my god rebecca cried trying to shut the door against his shoulder please go away cant you see youve caused enough trouble already let me in rebecca i want to come in i must come in i want to talk to both of you you must listen to me he kept pushing at the door and rebecca wasnt strong enough to hold him back suddenly bankss calm voice behind her said why dont you let him in mrs charters whoever he is the more the merrier ii even barry stott was almost ready to call it a day by sixthirty the drizzle that at one time had looked like ending had turned into a much harder downpour as darkness fell and now both he and sergeant hatchley were soaked to the skin even the best raincoat and shoes which stotts were could only take so much without springing leaks if only jelačić had broken down and confessed instead of stubbornly protesting his innocence the way banks said he had how much easier life would have been they were showing the police artists impression based on alfs descriptionand what a lengthy and frustrating experience getting that done had beenalong the rather twee row of shops set back from kendal road opposite the school the newsagent hadnt seen anyone the grocer was closed and the hairdresser gave a lengthy opinion as to the sorry state of the suspects locks but said she was closed on mondays and no she hadnt noticed anyone strange hanging around on any other days the teashop was also closed the way most yorkshire teashops close at teatime but the peking moon the chinese restaurant next door had just opened it was as hatchley explained a rather pricey upmarket sort of chinese restaurant not the kind of place that yobbos go for a quick chop suey after a skinful of ale on a friday night i wonder why they dont change the name sergeant hatchley said as they approached the door isnt peking called beijing now a real chinaman wouldnt have a clue where he was if he saw this stott turned to hatchley before he pushed the door open i know what youre thinking sergeant and you can forget it were not staying here for dinner definitely not got it hatchley looked hurt furthest thing from my mind sir i dont even like chinese food its got no sticking power im always hungry again ten minutes after ive eaten it right just as long as we understand each other the bell at the top of the door jingled as they went in like many chinese restaurants its decor was simple and relaxing with a series of ancient chinese landscapestiny human figures dwarfed by evergreencovered mountainson the walls and plain red tablecloths soft tinkling music played in the background so soft that stott couldnt even figure out whether it was pop or classical or chinese not that he cared much for music a waiter in a white jacket walked towards them jim me old mate what can i do you for he asked in a cockney accent you could cut with a knife despite the oriental eyes and complexion di stott hatchley introduced them this is well hung low he laughed and the waiter laughed with him stott seethed inside his rage as it always did crystallizing quickly from fire to ice just a joke sir hatchley went on his names joe sung deserted the bright lights of whitechapel for the greener pastures of eastvale joe wanted to be a copper once too sir but i managed to persuade him he was better off where he was his father owns this place its a little goldmine perhaps you should reconsider stott said with a smile shaking joes hand we need morea more ethnically diverse police force especially in yorkshire aye said hatchley i told him he wouldnt know what was worse the prejudice or the patronizing joe laughed again stott felt his anger boil up and freeze oafs like hatchley symbolized all that was wrong in todays police force his types days were numbered i wonder if we might ask you a few questions he said to joe sung fire away mate joe gestured to the empty restaurant see how busy we are here take the weight off he beckoned them to join him at one of the tables remember what i said sergeant stott hissed in hatchley s ear as they followed this isnt another meal break no sir but hatchley took the ashtray on the table as an invitation to light up what is it then joe asked when theyd sat down official business about that murder yes said stott joe shook his head terrible business i knew the girl too you know knew her well not in the real sense of the word not to talk to like i mean shed eaten in here with her mates thats all i couldnt believe my eyes when i saw that photo in the evening post stott couldnt understand how it happened but a tray of appetizers suddenly appeared on the table in front of them spring rolls garlic shrimp chicken balls all stott noticed was the retreating back of another waiter he hadnt heard a thing hatchley picked up a shrimp and popped it in his mouth between drags on his cigarette when did she eat here stott asked they come here every now and then a bunch of girls from the school that is maybe when one of their daddies sends the monthly check anyway they generally keep quiet dont cause any trouble and they dont expect to be served beer she was with them once or twice that deborah harrison who got killed i recognized her do you remember anything about her nah not really cept that she was a goodlooking girl thats why i remembered her in particular ever noticed anyone take an unusual interest in her or the other st marys girls well theyve caught the odd eye or two theres a couple of right corkers among them and theres always something about a girl in a school uniform sorry that was in bad taste not at all joe said hatchley i know what you mean and im sure the inspector does too stott said nothing three bottles of beer materialized with three glasses on the table before them as if by magic somefink to wash the food down joe said with a grin my treat stott ignored the beer hatchley grabbed a bottle and ignored the glass well let him drink it stott thought fine he wasnt going to touch any himself give hatchley enough rope and hell surely hang himself if only he didnt have a strong ally in chief inspector banks stott couldnt understand that relationship at all banks seemed like an intelligent civilized sort of copper what could he possibly see in a boor like hatchley right now though there were more important things to think about than hatchleys eating and drinking habits so you noticed nothing unusual about the girl and nobody taking any undue interest in her or her friends stott asked thats right said joe noffink out of the ordinary did she ever meet anyone here anyone other than her schoolfriends no they always came and left together as a group never had any boys with them if thats what you mean too close to the school if you ask me you never know when one of the teachers might drop in and catch them they eat here too sometimes stott glanced over at hatchley who took out the artists impression of the stranger in the nags head ever seen this man he asked joe stared at the picture shaking his head it doesnt look much like him except for the hair he said but we had a bloke looked a bit like that in here just last night stotts pulse began to race what was he wearing an orange anorak tall yeah tallish bit over six feet anyway what time did he come in about half six i remember because he was the only one in at that time miserable night the time fit stott thought feeling his excitement rise the killer had a couple of drinks at the nags head murdered deborah harrison and then he came here for dinner did he do or say anything unusual he seemed a bit restless i saw him muttering to himself once or twice hear what he said sorry who waited his table i did we were shortstaffed because of the fog he was certainly hungry ill say that first he had spring rolls then he ordered orange beef and szechuan shrimp a bowl of rice and a pint of lager ate it all too did you talk to him only to take his order he didnt seem communicative so i didnt push it you learn how to behave in this business who wants to chat and who just wants to be left alone this bloke wanted to be left alone stott saw his bottle of beer disappear into hatchleys hand he let it pass did you notice anything else about him yeah he had a little cut just up there high on his left cheek joe touched the spot on his own cheek stott could hardly contain his excitement the postmortem had reported skin and tissue under the middle fingernail of deborah harrisons right hand she had scratched her attacker it had to be jelačić how long did he stay stott asked just as long as it took to order and eat about threequarters of an hour did he have a car if he did i didnt see it somehow i got the impression he was on foot i mean whod take the car out by himself on a night like that just to go out alone for a chinese meal fine as the food here is me id order a takeaway and let some other poor bugger do the driving good point said stott see where he went afraid not from the corner of his eye stott noticed the last spring roll disappear between two sausagelike fingers had you ever seen him before he asked joe shook his head stott smiled i dont suppose he happened to mention his name did he joe grinned back sorry didnt mention his address either no like i said some of them are chatty this one wasnt he paused ill tell you what though what joe stood up if my memory serves me right he paid by card you might be able to get his name from that i havent done the returns yet shall i go get it for you stott sent up a silent prayer of thanks to god joe came back with a sheaf of visa slips in his hand and started going through them not this one not thatnono yeah right this is the one and he passed it over anxiously stott grabbed the slip of paper but as soon as he looked at it his spirits sank he couldnt read the signaturethat was just a mess of loops and whirlsbut the name was printed clearly enough in the top left corner and it wasnt ive jelačić beside him he heard the glug of an emptying beer bottle followed by a resonant burp iii right said banks now that weve all calmed down a bit maybe we can play truth or consequences and im telling you the consequences will be bloody severe if you dont play got it the three pale miserablelooking people in the chilly vicarage livingroom nodded in unison the brownandwhite bundle of fur on the hearth scratched and fell still again as soon as banks had appeared in the hall patrick metcalfe had tried to make a break for it perhaps he believed that the power of his love could vanquish unhappy husbands but he must have known it didnt stand a chance against the long arm of the law as he turned to run away he slipped on the doorstep and fell down three stone steps onto the garden path sprawling in the rain on the worn pavingstones holding his knee and cursing banks helped him inside with a firm hand and sat him down in one of the armchairs now he sat there hair plastered to his skull looking sullen the consumptive look wasnt hard for him to cultivate given his lanky frame and hollow cheeks he kept giving rebecca charters significant stares with his soulful eyes but she averted her gaze by this time rebecca had brought the bottle of wine from the kitchen and topped up her glass she was beginning to look a little blurred around the edges daniel charters permanent frown etched in his high brow muscle twitching beside his left eye just sat there long legs crossed his face growing steadily paler looking like a man old before his time now then mr charters banks said you were trying to tell me where you were last night before we were so rudely interrupted he was with me the newcomer burst out and you are patrick metcalfe im the history teacher at st marys so you knew deborah harrison i wouldnt say i knew her i taught her history last year and you say mr charters was with you yesterday evening he was what time did he arrive metcalfe shrugged about a quarter to six i was just thinking about putting something in the microwave for dinner and i usually eat at about six does that time sound right to you mr charters charters nodded glumly banks turned back to metcalfe where do you live one of the school flats on st marys grounds alone yes alone metcalfe looked longingly at rebecca charters who stared down into her wineglass what time did mr charters leave banks asked around ten to six he didnt stay more than five minutes he could see i wasnt interested in what he had to say which meant that charters was unaccountedfor during the crucial period around six oclock banks could see rebecca frowning at this information she had lied for her husband only to have someone give him what seemed like an alibi then immediately snatch it away again did she know where he had been between ten to six and whenever he got back home and banks realized this also left patrick metcalfe without an alibi rebecca too for that matter he only had her word that she had heard something like a cry around six oclock what were you wearing banks asked charters wearing a raincoat color beige may i see it charters went and brought the raincoat in from the hall closet banks examined it closely but could see no traces of blood or earth do you mind if i take this for further testing he asked ill give you a receipt of course charters looked alarmed should i call my lawyer not if youve got nothing to hide ive got nothing to hide go ahead take it thank you where did you go after you left mr metcalfe nowhere in particular i just walked where in the school grounds by the river did you see anyone there were a few people about yes what about on or near the bridge he thought for a moment then said yes come to think of it i did see someone when i came out of the main school gate and crossed the road there was a man in front of me walking along kendal road towards the bridge did you get a good look at him no he stopped on the bridge and i walked past him he was about my heightsix foot twoand he was wearing an orange anorak i could see that much from behind his hair was dark and rather long are you sure it was a man certain even in the fog i could tell by the way he walked theres somethingi dont know how to explain itbut im certain it was a man another sighting of the mysterious stranger that stott and hatchley had unearthed in the nags head interesting can you tell me anything more about him im afraid not said charters i had other things on my mind could it have been a red windcheater rather than an orange anorak charters frowned i suppose it could have been i wasnt paying really close attention i hope you realize mr charters that if youd continued lying to us you would also have been withholding what could be an important piece of evidence charters said nothing where did you go next banks asked i walked up to north market street carried along there for a while then took constance avenue back down to the river path and home he looked at rebecca then looked away again but when i got here iididnt want to go in andnot just yet so i kept on walking for a good ten minutes or so then turned back and came home is that everything yes did you go into the churchyard at any time no i wish i had i might have been able to prevent the poor girls murder what time did your husband get home mrs charters he was home when i got back from the graveyard and that was about a quarter to seven yes and what did you do after mr charters left your flat banks said to metcalfe nothing much heated up my dinner i considered coming over here and putting an end to the ridiculous charade but decided against it what ridiculous charade they were all silent for a moment as if someone had finally gone too far and they were deciding how to cover up then daniel charters spoke up i went to talk to metcalfe he said to try to persuade him to stop seeing my wife banks looked at metcalfe is this true yes and what was your response metcalfe sneered at charters i told him i wasnt interested that it was too late rebecca and i are in love and were going away together banks looked towards rebecca she had lowered her head so he couldnt see her expression only the mass of auburn hair hanging down to her knees her glass of wine had sat untouched for several minutes on the table tell him metcalfe urged her go on rebecca tell him its true tell him how this marriage is a sham how its stifling you destroying your true nature tell him you dont love your no what rebecca charters held her head up and stared directly at metcalfe her dark eyes flashed with angry tears i said no patrick she seemed to gain control of the situation the welling tears remained at the edges of her eyes she spoke quietly i tried to tell you before but you wouldnt listen you didnt want to understand im not defending myself what ive done is wrong terribly wrong she looked at her husband who showed no expression then back at metcalfe but its my guilt my sin if i wasnt strong enough to stand by my husband when he needed me most if i let a hint of scandal and suspicion poison our marriage then its my mistake my fault but i wont compound it with lies she turned to banks yes chief inspector i had an affair with patrick i met him at a social evening we put on for the staff and upper sixth of st marys school around the middle of last month he was charming interesting passionate and i became infatuated with him daniel and i were already going through a difficult time as i think you know and when i should have been strong i was weak im not proud of myself but i want you to know thats why i lied to you because i was afraid that too many questions would lead to exactly this kind of situation now its happened im glad believe me though ive been trying to avoid it at all costs theres been far too much distrust and suspicion around this house lately i cant believe that my husband had anything to do with this murder any more than i can believe hes capable of doing what that vile man accused him of she turned back to metcalfe tears still hanging on the rims of her eyes dampening the long dark lashes im sorry patrick if i misled you i didnt intend to just put it down to a foolish woman seeking temporary escape but you were only a distraction i didnt mean for you to fall in love with me and if youre honest with yourself i think youd have to admit that youre not in love with me at all i think youre in love with the idea of being in love but youre far too selfabsorbed to ever love anyone but yourself metcalfe stood up its not true rebecca i do love you cant you see how youre blinding yourself if you stay youll wither up and die before your time before youve even a harsh sound came from one of the armchairs and banks saw daniel charters bend forward cup his head in his hands and start to cry like a child rebecca jumped up and went over to him putting her arm around his shoulder he doesnt even like women metcalfe went on you cant possibly banks picked up charterss raincoat grasped metcalfe by the back of the collar and shoved him towards the front door even though metcalfe was a few inches taller than banks he didnt put up much of a struggle just muttered something about police brutality once outside banks shut the door behind them guided metcalfe down the path and tossed him out of the gate onto the river path on your bike he said still muttering metcalfe walked towards the school banks glanced back as he closed the gate and saw rebecca and daniel framed in the window rebecca was cradling her husbands head against her breast like a babys stroking his hair her mouth was opening and closing as if she were uttering soothing words banks had unfinished business at the vicaragethey werent off the hook yetbut it could wait he looked up into the dark sky as if searching for enlightenment but felt only the cool raindrops on his face he sneezed then he pulled his collar up and set off along the river path for the kendal road bridge chapter i owen pierce had just opened a bottle of wine and taken the heated remains of last weeks beef stew out of the oven when the doorbell rang muttering a curse he put his stew back in the oven to keep warm and trotted to the front door at the end of the hall he could make out two figures through the frosted glass one tall and heavyset one shorter and slim when he opened the door he first thought they were jehovahs witnesses or mormonswho else came to the door in pairs wearing suits but these two didnt quite look the part true one of them did look like a bible salesmanstickingout ears glasses not a hair out of place freshly scrubbed lookbut the other looked more like a thug mr pierce mr owen pierce asked the bible salesman yes thats me look i was just about to eat my dinner what is it what do you want if youre selling were police officers sir the man went on my name is detective inspector stott and this is detective sergeant hatchley mind if we come in they flashed their warrant cards and owen stood back to let them in as soon as they got into the livingroom the big one started poking around nice place youve got stott said while his partner prowled the room picking up vases and looking inside them opening drawers an inch or two inspecting books look what is this owen said is he supposed to be going through my things like that there are no drugs here if thats what youre looking for oh dont mind sergeant hatchley hes just like that insatiable curiosity dont you need a search warrant or something well owen said stott the way it works is like this we could go to a magistrate and we could apply for a warrant to search your premises but it takes a lot of time sergeant hatchley would have to stay here with you while i took care of the formalities i think this way is much better all round anyway youve nothing to hide have you no no its not that its just well said stott with a smile thats all right then isnt it i suppose so mind if i sit down be my guest stott sat in the chair by the fake coals and owen sat opposite him on the sofa a mug of halffinished coffee stood between them on the glasstopped table beside a couple of unpaid bills and the latest radio times look owen said im afraid youve got me at a disadvantage here whats it all about just routine inquiries sir thats a nasty scratch on your face mind telling me where you got it owen put his hand up to his cheek ive no idea he said i woke up this morning and there it was were you in the st marys area of eastvale yesterday evening let me thinkyes yes i believe i was he glanced at hatchley who seemed fascinated by the print of renoirs bathers over the fireplace why what sorry look just ignore sergeant hatchley for the moment stott said look at me i asked you why you were in st marys owen shrugged no particular reason i was just walking walking on a miserable night like that well if you let the weather dictate it you wouldnt get much walking done in yorkshire would you even so st marys is quite a distance from here no more than three miles each way and its a very pleasant walk along the river even in the fog hatchley fished a copy of playboy out of the magazine rack and held it up for stott to see stott frowned and reached over for it the cover showed a shapely blonde in skimpy pink lace panties bordered in black a flimsy slip stockings and suspender belt she was on her knees on a sofa and her round behind faced the viewer her face was also turned towards the camera glossy red lips eyes an impossible shade of green unfocused as if she had just woken from a deep sleep one thin strap had slipped over her upper right arm i bought it because of one of the stories i wanted to read owen said immediately feeling himself turn red it wasnt so much that he had been caught with something warped and perverted but with something subliterary something beneath his intelligence and dignity its not illegal you know you can buy it at any newsagents its not pornography thats a matter of opinion sir isnt it said stott he handed the magazine back to hatchley as if he were dropping something in a rubbish bin holding it between his thumb and forefinger and theres a video tape full of what sounds like sexy stuff to me sir judging by the titles said hatchley one of thems called schools out and you should have a butchers at some of the poses in these here socalled art books im an amateur photographer owen said its my hobby for christs sake what do you expect is that what all this is about pornography because if it is stott waved his hand no he said its of no matter really it might be relevant well have to see do you live here by yourself mr pierce yes what kind of work do you do im a lecturer at eastvale college english ever been married no girlfriends some but not to live with no videos and magazines enough to satisfy you eh now just a min stott held up his hand sorry he said sorry i shouldnt have said that tasteless of me out of line why couldnt owen quite believe the apology he sensed very strongly that stott had made the remark on purpose to nettle him he hoped he had passed the test even though he couldnt be sure what the question was feeling more like kafkas joseph k every minute he shifted in his chair why do you want to know all this he asked again you said you were going to tell me what its all about did i well first would you mind if we had a quick look around the rest of the place it might save us coming back go ahead owen said and accompanied them as they did the rounds it wasnt a thorough search and owen felt that by granting them permission he had probably saved himself a lot of trouble he had seen on television the way search teams messed up places they gave the bedrooms one of which was completely empty a cursory glance poked about in his clothing drawers and wardrobe in the study stott admired the aquarium of tropical fish and of course hatchley rummaged through some of owens photo files and found the blackandwhite nude studies of michelle he showed them to stott who frowned whos this stott asked owen shrugged just a model whats her name im sorry i dont remember she looks very young she was twentytwo when those were taken hmm was she now muttered stott handing the photos back to hatchley must be artistic license notice any resemblance sergeant he asked hatchley aye sir i do resemblance to who mind if we take these too stott asked as a matter of fact i do theyre the only prints ive got and ive lost the negatives i understand sir you want to hang onto them for sentimental reasons well take good care of them wait a minute thoughdidnt you say she was just a model i did and i didnt say i wanted to keep them for sentimental reasons theyre part of my portfolio for exhibitions and such like ah i see might we just take one of them perhaps then oh all right if you must hatchley leafed through some more art books on a shelf over the filing cabinet one of them dealt with japanese erotic art and he opened it at a charcoal sketch of two young girls entwined together on a bed they had either shaved off their pubic hair or they were too young to have grown any it was difficult to tell he shoved it under stotts nose a bit like those books in the other room sir he said stott turned up his nose and some of them novels he reads have been on trial hatchley went on lady chatterleys lover naked lunch ulysses delta of venus a bit of de sade for christs sake owen cut in i cant believe this im an english teacher you fucking moron thats what i do for a living now you look here mate said hatchley squaring up to him the last bloke used that kind of language with me had a nasty accident on his way down the police station steps are you threatening me hatchley thrust his chin out take it any way you want stop it sergeant stott cut in ill not have you talking to a member of the public this way apologize to mr pierce at once yes sir said hatchley he looked at pierce and said sorry sir if you ask me owen said youre the ones who are sick like witchhunters seeing the devils work everywhere maybe it is everywhere stott said calmly have you ever thought about that its just hard to believe theres someone who still thinks lady chatterleys lover and ulysses are dirty books thats all they sat down in the livingroom again now why dont you tell me all about what you did in st marys yesterday evening stott said sergeant hatchley will take notes no hurry take your time owen told them about his walk the drinks at the nags head the meal at the peking moon and the walk home as he spoke stott looked directly at him the stern triangular face showed no expression and the eyes behind the lenses seemed cool the mans ears almost made owen want to laugh out loud but he restrained himself the big one hatchley scribbled away in a spiralbound notebook owen was surprised he could even write are you in the habit of talking to yourself mr pierce asked stott when he had finished owen reddened i wouldnt say talking to myself exactly sometimes i get lost in thought and i forget there are people around dont you ever do that no said stott i dont finally after they had asked him to go over one or two random points again hatchley closed his notebook and stott got to his feet thatll be all for now he said for now we might want to talk to you again dont know we have to check up on a few points first would you mind if we had a look in your hall cupboard on the way out why routine go ahead i dont suppose i can stop you stott and hatchley searched through the row of coats and jackets and pulled out owens new orange anorak is this what you were wearing last night yes yes it is but what about these shoes yes those too look mind if we take them with us sir but why purposes of elimination you mean it might help clear this business up stott smiled yes it might well let you have them back as soon as we can do you think you could get me a plastic bag while the sergeant here writes out a receipt owen fetched a binliner from the kitchen and watched stott put the shoes and anorak inside it while hatchley wrote out the receipt then he accepted the slip of paper and signed a release identifying the items as his stott turned to hatchley i think wed better be off then sergeant he said weve already taken up enough of mr pierces valuable time hatchley took the plastic bag while stott slipped the photograph into his briefcase then they walked towards the door arent you going to tell me what its all about owen asked again as he opened the front door for them it was still raining stott turned and frowned thats the funny thing about it owen he said that you dont know then he shook his head slowly anybody would think you dont read the papers which is odd for an educated man like yourself ii tracy bankss bedroom lit by a shaded table lamp was a typical teenagers room just like deborah harrisons with popstar posters on the wall a portable cassette player a narrow bed usually unmade and clothes all over the floor tracy also had a desk against one wall and perhaps more books on her shelves than many girls her age they ran the gamut from the wind in the willows to the pelican history of the world a row of dolls and teddy bears sat on the bookcases lowest shelf they always reminded banks that his daughter wasnt that far away from childhood things yet one day they would disappear as had most of his own toys the fort with its soldiers the hornby train set the meccano he had no idea where they had gone along with his childhood innocence tracy herself sprawled on the bed in black leggings and a sloppy sweatshirt she looked as if she had been crying when banks had got the message from his wife sandra at his office saying that tracy was upset and wanted to talk to him he had hurried straight home now banks sat on the edge of the bed and stroked his daughters hair which was tied back in a ponytail what is it love he asked you didnt tell me tracy said last night are you talking about the murder yes oh its all right i know why you didnt tell me she sniffled you wanted to spare my feelings i dont blame you im not mad at you or anything i wish you had told me though it wouldnt have been such a shock when all the girls at school started talking about it im sorry said banks i knew youd find out eventually and it would upset you i suppose i was just trying to give you one more night of peace before you had to deal with it maybe it was selfish of me no really its all right so what is wrong tracy was silent a moment banks heard laughter and music from downstairs i knew her she said finally knew who deborah harrison i knew her apart from both being attractive blonde teenagers tracy and deborah harrison were about as far apart as you get in background and class deborah went to the expensive élite st marys school where she was carefully groomed for oxford or cambridge and tracy went to eastvale comprehensive where she had to fight her way through overcrowded classes massive apathy and incompetent teaching to get decent enough alevels to get into a redbrick university now here was tracy saying she knew deborah how he asked tracy shifted on the bed and sat crosslegged she pulled the duvet over her shoulders like a shawl you wont get mad at me will you dad promise banks smiled ive a feeling im not going to like this but youve got my word tracy took a deep breath then said it was in the summer a few times i hung around with the crowd at the swainsdale center down by the bus station you hung around with those yobs jesus christ tracy i see i knew youd be mad banks took a deep breath okay im not mad just surprised thats all how could you do that those kids are into drugs vandalism all sorts of things oh we didnt do any harm daddy it was just somewhere to go thats all and theyre not so bad really i know some of them look pretty weird and frightening but theyre not really what did you used to do when you were a kid with nowhere to go banks would like to have to answered museums art galleries long walks books classical concerts but he couldnt mostly he and his friends had hung around on street corners on waste ground or in empty schoolyards sometimes they had even broken into condemned houses and played there okay he said well let it pass for now carry on deborah harrison was down there shopping one day and one of the girls in the group knew her vaguely from dressage or swimming competitions or something and they got talking she came down a couple of days laterdressed down a bitand started to hang out i think she was bored with just staying at home and studying so she thought shed slum it for a while what about her own friends i dont really think she had any she said most of her schoolfriends were away for the summer most of the boarders had gone home of course and the daygirls had all jetted off to exotic places like america and the south of france why cant we go to places like that dad you were in france earlier this year she slapped his arm im only teasing it wasnt a serious question when did deborah first start joining in with the group early august i think and how did the others treat her theyd tease her about being a bit lahdedah sometimes but she took it well enough she said somebody had to be and besides it wasnt all it was cracked up to be what did she mean by that it was just her way of talking about things did she ever flaunt her wealth flash it about no not that i saw how long did she hang around with the group about three weeks on and off have you seen her since then tracy shook her head well she wouldnt want to be seen dead with the likes of us now would she not now shes back at st marys then she put her hand over her mouth im sorry dad i just havent got used to the idea that shes dead yet banks patted her arm thats all right love it takes time how well did you know her not very well but we chatted once or twice she wasnt so bad you know when you got to know her a bit i mean she wasnt so snobbish and she was quite bright did you ever talk about school sometimes what did she think of st marys she thought it was all right at least the teachers were pretty good and the classes werent too big she said they had a staff to pupil ratio of one to ten it must be more like one to five hundred where i go did she mention any teachers in particular not that i can remember patrick metcalfe does that name sound familiar tracy shook her head no what kind of things did she say about school nothing much really just like youd be surprised if you knew some of the things that go on there that sort of thing very melodramatic what did you think she meant tracy looked down and rubbed her hand against her knee well theres a lot of girls live in you know all together in the dormitories i thought she meant like lesbians and stuff did she imply that any of the teachers had any sort of sexual relations with the pupils no dad honest i dont know i mean she never really said anything not specific she just implied hinted but she was like that about everything like what as if she knew more than she let on and as if we were poor fools who saw only the surface and she knew what really went on underneath like we all swallowed the illusion but she knew the underlying truth im not trying to paint her in a bad way she was really nice but she just had this sort of tone like as if she knew more than everyone else did she ever speak about her family she mentioned her fathers business now and then what did she say about that i said once that it must be interesting having a father as famous as sir geoffrey harrison being knighted and all that so much for having a mere detective for a father banks thought swallowing his pride what did she say the usual something like oh youd be shocked if you knew some of the things i know and she didnt elaborate no i just shrugged it off i thought she meant the bad side of technology all the war stuff missiles and bombs and that we all know sir geoffrey harrisons companies are involved in things like that its in the papers nearly every day and she didnt say any more about it no did she ever mention father daniel charters or ive jelačić the people from st marys church yes not to me if you ask me she was more interested in boys than anything else boys anyone in particular well she sort of took up with john spinks tracy pulled a face i mean of all the boys banks leaned forward the bedsprings creaked tell me about john spinks he said chapter i eastvale college of further education was a hodgepodge of ugly redbrick and concrete buildings on the southern fringe of the town separated from the last few houses by a stretch of marshy waste ground there was nothing else much around save for the featherstone arms across the road a couple of industrial estates and a large riding stable about half a mile away the college itself was a bit of a dump too owen thought over his lunchtime pint and soupy lasagna and he wouldnt be teaching there if he could get anything better the problem was with only a ba from leeds and an ma from an obscure canadian university he couldnt get anything better so he was stuck teaching the business secretarial and agriculture students how to spell and write sentences skills they didnt even want to know it was a long way from the literary ambitions he had nursed not so many years ago but he had more immediate problems than his teaching career he had lied to the police and they probably suspected as much it wasnt much of a lie admittedly besides it was none of their business he had said he never lived with a woman but he had with michelle for five years and michelle was the woman in the blackandwhite nude photographs so owen wasnt exactly surprised when stott and hatchley walked into the pub and asked him if he would mind going to the station with them to clear up a few points nervous yes but not surprised they said the department head had told them where they were likely to find him and they had walked straight over nobody spoke during the first part of the journey sergeant hatchley drove the unmarked rover and inspector stott sat beside him owen could see the sharp line of his haircut at the back of his neck and the jughandle shape of his ears glasses hooked over them as they approached the market square owen looked out of the window at the drab shadowy figures hurrying from shop to shop holding onto their hats i wonder if youd mind very much stott said turning slightly in his seat if we arranged to take a couple of samples what kind of samples oh just the usual blood hair do i have to let me put it like this youre not under arrest but the crime were investigating is very serious indeed it would be best all around if you gave your permission and signed a release for elimination purpose and if i refuse what will you do hold me down pull my hair out and stick a needle in me nothing like that we could get the superintendent to authorize it but that wouldnt look good would it especially if the matter ever went to court refusing to give a sample a jury might see that as an admission of guilt and of course as soon as youre eliminated from the inquiry the samples will all be destroyed no records what do you say all right thank you sir stott turned to face the front again and picked up his car phone ill just take the liberty of calling dr burns and asking him to meet us at the station it was all handled quickly and efficiently in a private office at the police station owen signed the requisite forms rolled up his sleeve and looked away he felt only a sharp brief pricking sensation as the needle slid out then the doctor pulled some hair out of his scalp that hurt a little more the interview room they took him to next was a desolate place gray metal desk three chairs two of them bolted to the floor grimy windows of thick wired glass a dead fly smeared against one institutionalgreen wall and that was it it smelled of stale smoke a heavy blue glass ashtray sat on the desk empty but stained and grimy with old ash stott sat opposite owen and sergeant hatchley moved the free chair and sat by the wall near the door out of owens line of vision he sat backwards on the chair wrapping his thick arms around its back first stott placed the buff folder hed been carrying on the desk smiled and adjusted his glasses then he switched on a doublecassette tape recorder tested it and gave the date time and names of those present just a few questions owen he said youve been very cooperative so far i hope we dont have to keep you long so do i said owen looking around the grim room shouldnt i call my lawyer or something oh i dont think so said stott of course you can if you want its your right he smiled but its not as if youre under arrest or anything youre free to leave anytime you want besides do you actually have a solicitor most people dont come to think of it owen didnt have a solicitor he knew one though an old university acquaintance had switched from english to law after his first year and now practiced in eastvale they hadnt seen each other in years until owen had bumped into him in a pub a few months back gordon wharton that was his name owen couldnt remember what kind of law he specialized in but at least it was a start if things went that far for the moment though stott was right owen hadnt been arrested and he didnt see why he should have to pay a solicitor let me lay my cards on the table owen you have admitted to us that you were in the area of st marys on monday evening is that true yes why i told you i went for a walk shall we just go over it again for the record owen shrugged theres really nothing to go over he could see the sheet of paper in front of stott laid out like an appointment book some of the times and notes had question marks in red what time did you set off on this walk just after i got back from work about four maybe as late as half past how far is it to st marys along the river about three miles from my house and the house is about half a mile from the river about seven miles there and back then yes about that now before you ate at the peking moon you drank two pints of bitter and a scotch whisky at the nags head right i wasnt counting but yes i had a couple of drinks and you left the pub at about a quarter to six i wasnt especially aware of the time thats what the landlord told us i suppose it must be true then and you ate at the peking moon at approximately sixthirty is that correct about then yes again i didnt notice the actual time what did you do between a quarter to and half past six walked around stood on the bridge did you go into st marys graveyard no i didnt look if youre trying to tie me in to that girls murder then youre way off beam why would i do something like that perhaps i had better call a solicitor after all ah stott glanced over owens shoulder towards sergeant hatchley so he does read the papers after all i did after you left of course i did stott looked back at him but not before id have known what you were talking about then wouldnt i stott straightened his glasses what made you connect our visit with that particular item of news owen hesitated was it a trick question it didnt take much he answered slowly given the kind of questions you asked me even though i know nothing about what happened i know i was in st marys that evening i never denied it and while were on the subject what led you to me stott smiled easy really we asked around small wealthy neighborhood like st marys people notice strangers plus you were wearing an orange anorak and you used your visa card in the peking moon owen leaned forward and slapped his palms on the cool metal surface there he said that proves it then doesnt it stott gave him a blank look proves what that i didnt do it if i had done it what you seem to be accusing me of i would hardly have been so foolish as to leave my calling card would i stott shrugged criminals make mistakes just like everybody else otherwise wed never catch any would we and im not accusing you of anything at the moment owen you can see our problem though cant you your story sounds thin very thin i mean if you were in the area for some real believable reasonmaybe to meet someone did you know deborah harrison owen no had you been watching her following her owen sat back ive told you why i was there i cant help it if you dont like my reason can i i never thought id have to explain myself to anyone did you see anyone acting suspiciously not that i remember did you see deborah harrison no about that scratch on your cheek stott said remember yet where you got it owen put his hand to his cheek and shrugged cut myself shaving i suppose bit high up to be shaving isnt it i told you i dont remember why what about the nude photos owen the ones we found at your house what about them theyre figure studies thats all sergeant hatchley spoke for the first time and the rough voice coming from behind startled owen come on lad dont be shy whats wrong with you dont you like looking at a nice pair of tits youre not queer are you owen halftwisted in his seat no i didnt say i didnt like looking at naked women of course i do im perfectly normal and some of the girls in that magazine seemed very young to me said stott owen turned to face him again since when has it been a crime to buy playboy you people are still living in the middle ages for christs sake theyre models they get paid for posing like that and you like videos too dont you owen there was that one in your cabinet your own private video to keep to watch whenever you want including schools out a friend gave me it as a sort of joke i told him id never seen any pornany sexy videos before and he gave me that said id enjoy it well ill tell you owen said stott ive got to wonder about a bloke who watches stuff like that and likes the sort of art books and pictures you like especially if he takes nude photos of young girls too its a free country im a normal single male i also happen to be an amateur photographer and i have a right to watch whatever kind of videos i want as long as theyre legal owen felt himself flushing with embarrassment christ how he wished chris lorimer at the college hadnt given him the bloody video schools out hatchley said quietly from behind him a bit over the top that wouldnt you say i havent even watched that one you can see what sergeant hatchleys getting at though cant you owen said stott it looks bad the subjectmatter the image it all looks a bit odd distinctly fishy well i cant help that its not fishy im perfectly innocent and thats the truth whos the girl in the photographs the one who looks about fifteen she was twentytwo just a model it was a couple of years ago i cant remember her name funny that what is that you remember her age but not her name owen felt his heart pounding stott scrutinized him closely for a few seconds then stood up abruptly you can go now he said im glad we could have our little chat owen was confused thats it for the moment yes well be in touch owen could hardly stand up quickly enough he banged his knee on the underside of the metal desk and swore he rubbed his knee and started to back towards the door his face was burning i can really go yes but stay available owen was shaking when he got out of the police station and turned down market street towards home could they really treat you like that when you went along with them of your own free will he had a feeling his rights were being trampled on and maybe it was time to look up gordon wharton the first thing he did when he got into the house was tear up the copy of playboy and burn the pieces in the wastebin cormac mccarthy story and all next he took the video that chris lorimer had given him pulled the tape out broke the plastic casing and dumped it in the rubbish bin to burn too at least they couldnt use it as evidence against him now finally he went into the spare room and took the rest of the nude photographs of michelle from his filing cabinet he held them in his hands ready to rip them into tiny pieces and burn them along with the rest but as he held them he couldnt help but look at them they were simple tasteful chiaroscuro studies and he could tell from the way michelles eyes glittered and her mouth was set that she was holding back her laughter he remembered how she had complained about goosebumps that he was taking so long setting up the lighting then he remembered the wine and the wild lovemaking afterwards she had liked being photographed naked it had excited her his hands started to shake again god she looked so beautiful so perfect so young so bloody innocent still shaking he thrust the photos back in the cabinet and turned away tears burning in his eyes ii while stott and hatchley were interviewing owen pierce banks drove out to st marys to see lady sylvie harrison he would have liked susan with him for her reactions and observations but he knew he was risking chief constable riddles wrath by having anything more to do with the harrisons and he didnt want to get susan into trouble she was right she had worked hard and passed her sergeants exam all but the rubber stamp and he wouldnt forgive himself easily if he ruined her chances of a quick promotion he would be sad to lose her though detective constables were rarely promoted straight to the rank of detective sergeant and almost never in the same station they usually went back in uniform for at least a year then they had to reapply to the cid before setting off banks had phoned the harrison household and could hardly believe his luck sir geoffrey was out with michael clayton and lady harrison was at home alone no she said with that faint trace of french accent she would have no objections to talking to banks without her husband present as he drove along north market street past the tourist shops and the community center where sandra worked banks played the tape of ute lemper singing michael nymans musical adaptations of paul celans poems it was odd music and it had taken him some time to get used to it but now he adored them all found them pervaded by a sort of sinister melancholy it was a chilly day outside gray and windy skittering the leaves along the pavements but at least the rain had stopped just as corona was coming to an end banks pulled up at the end of the harrisons drive lady harrison must have heard him coming because she opened the large white door for him as soon as he got out of the car she wore jeans and a blue cashmere pullover she hugged herself against the cold as she stood in the doorway she had done her best to cover up the marks of misery and pain on her face but they were still apparent through the makeup like distant figures looming in the fog this time instead of heading for the white room she hung up his overcoat and led him to the kitchen which was done in what banks thought of as a sort of rustic french style lots of wood paneling and cupboards copperbottomed pots and pans hanging on hooks on the wall flowerpatterned mugs on wooden pegs a few potted plants a vase of chrysanthemums on the table and a redandwhite checked tablecloth the room smelled of herbs and spices cinnamon and rosemary being the two most prominent a kettle was just coming to the boil on the red aga please sit down she said banks sat on a wooden chair at the kitchen table its legs scraped along the terracotta floor tea i was just going to make some fine said banks ceylon darjeeling earl gray or lapsang souchong lapsang if thats all right she smiled exactly what i was going to have her movements were listless and banks noticed that the smile hadnt reached her eyes it would probably be a long time before one did are you sure youre all right here alone lady harrison he asked yes actually it was my idea i sent geoffrey out he was getting on my nerves i needed a little quiet time toto get used to things what would be the point of us both moping around the house all day hes used to action to doing things and please she added with a fleeting smile call me sylvie fine he said sylvie it is she measured out the leaves into a warmed pota rather squat ugly piece with blue squiggles and a thick straight spoutthen sat down opposite banks and let it brew im sorry to intrude on your grief banks said but there are still a lot of questions need answering of course said sylvie but geoffrey told me this morning that you already have a suspect is it true interesting banks thought he hadnt realized there was a lodge meeting last night of course as soon as stott had tracked down owen pierce and sent his anorak off to the lab for analysis banks had let the chief constable know what was happening and riddle obviously hadnt wasted much time in reporting to sir geoffrey ah privilege someones helping us with our inquiries yes he said immediately regretting the trite phrase i mean last night we talked to someone who was seen in the area on monday evening detective inspector stott is interviewing him again now its not that man from the church the one who was fired we dont think so but were still keeping an open mind about him do you think this other person did it i dont know i havent talked to him yet were playing it very cautiously very carefully if he is the one we want to be certain we dont make any mistakes that will come back to haunt us when the case goes to court sometimes mused sylvie it seems that the system favors the criminal rather than the victim dont you think tell me about it thought banks wearily if they did think theyd got their man next they would have to convince the crown prosecution service they had a casenot always an easy jobthen after they had jumped through all the hoops as often as not they could look forward to watching the accuseds lawyer tear the evidence to shreds sometimes he agreed did deborah ever mention anyone called owen pierce sylvie frowned no ive never heard the name before banks described pierce but it meant nothing to her she poured the tea tilting her head slightly and biting the end of her tongue as she did so the lapsang smelled and tasted good its smoky flavor a perfect foil for a gray cold november day outside the wind whistled through the trees and rattled the windows creating dust devils and gathering the fallen leaves into whirlwinds sylvie harrison put both hands around her mug as if keeping them warm what do you want to know from me she asked im trying to find out as much as i can about what deborah was like there are still a few gaps such as boyfriends for example ah boyfriends but deborah was far too busy at school for boys there was plenty of time for that later after she finished her education even so there was the summer sylvie held his gaze she didnt have a boyfriend banks paused then said slowly feeling as if he were digging his career grave with every word thats not what i heard someone told me she had a boyfriend in august sylvie paled she pressed her lips so tight together they almost turned white did she have a boyfriend banks asked again sylvie sighed then nodded yes in the summer but she finished with him was his name john spinks she raised her eyebrows how did you know that you knew about him she nodded yes he was a most unpleasant character why do you think a bright pretty girl like deborah would go out with someone like that a distant look came into her eyes i dont know i suppose he was goodlooking perhaps exciting in a way sometimes one makes mistakes she said with a shrug that banks thought of as very gallic sometimes one makes a fool of oneself does something with the wrong person for all the wrong reasons what reasons she shrugged again a womans reasons a young womans reasons was deborah having sex with john spinks sylvie paused for a moment then nodded and said with a sigh yes one day i came home unexpectedly and i caught them in deborahs bedroom i was crazy with anger i shouted at him and threw him out of the house and told him never to come back how did he react she reddened he called me names i will not repeat in front of you was he violent he didnt hit me if thats what you mean she nodded in the direction of the hall there was a vase not a very valuable vase but a pretty one a present from my father on a stand by the door he lifted it with both hands and threw it hard against the wall one small chip of pottery broke off and cut my chin thats all she fingered the tiny scar did he leave after that yes did you tell sir geoffrey about him no why not she paused before answering you must understand that geoffrey can be very victorian in some ways especially concerning deborah i hadnt even told him she was seeing the boy in the first place he would have made things very uncomfortable for her if hed known given spinkss character and background iwellim a woman and i think in some ways i understood what she was going through more than geoffrey would have anyway im not saying i approved but it was something she had to get out of her system stopping her would only have made her more determined in the long run it would probably have resulted in even more damage do you know what i mean i think so did deborah go on seeing spinks no i dont think so not after he threw the vase she was very upset about what happened and we had a long talk she said she was really sorry and she apologized to me i like to think that she understood what i was telling her what a waste of time seeing this spinks boy was she said she realized now what kind of person he was and she would never go near him again shed heard him curse me in the most vile manner shed seen him throw the vase at the wall seen the sliver cut me draw blood sylvie touched the small scar again i think it truly shocked her made her see him in a new light deborah is a good girl inside chief inspector stubborn willful perhaps but ultimately sensible too and like a lot of girls her age she is very naïve about men in what ways she didnt understand the way they use women manipulate them or the power of their lust i wanted her to learn to value herself in sex when the time came as much as in everything else unless a woman respects her sexual self shes going to be every mans victim all her life giving herself away to thatthat animal was a bad way for her to start you men dont always understand how important that time of a womans life is was she a virgin before she met spinks sylvie nodded and curled her lip in disgust she told me all about it that night after the row he stole a car like so many youths do these days they went for a ride out on the moors her fists clenched as she talked and he did it to her in the back of the car had you met him before that time she nodded just once it was two or three weeks earlier deborah brought him to the house it was a sunny day they were out making a barbecue when i got back from shopping in leeds what happened that time oh nothing much they were drinking no doubt at the boys instigation deborah had taken a bottle of my fathers estate wine from the cellar i was a little angry with them but not too much you must remember chief inspector that i grew up in france we had wine with every meal taken with a little water when we were children so drinking under age hardly seems the great sin it does to you english what was your impression of john spinks he was very much a boy of single syllables he didnt have much to say for himself at all ill admit i didnt like him right from the start call me a snob if you like but its true after hed gone i told her he wasnt good enough for her and that she should consider breaking off with him how did she react to that sylvie smiled sadly the way any sixteenyearold girl would she told me shed see who she wanted and that i should mind my own business and stop trying to run her life exactly what my daughter said in the same situation said banks is there anything else you can tell me about spinks sylvie sipped some tea then she went to fetch her handbag she slipped her hand inside and pulled out a packet of dunhill you dont mind if i smoke do you she asked why i should ask permission in my own house i dont know its just these daysthe antismoking brigadethey get to you its only in moments of stress i revert to the habit i know what you mean said banks pulling his silk cut out with a conspiratorial smile may i join you that would be even better geoffrey will go spare of course he thinks ive stopped the phrase go spare sounded odd with that sight french lilt to it such a yorkshire phrase banks thought your husband told me youre from bordeaux banks said accepting a light from her slim gold lighter sylvie nodded my father is in the wine business a négociant one of la noblesse du bouchon im afraid my french is very rusty literally it means the bottlecork nobility its a collective term for the négociants of a great wine center like bordeaux i suppose it means hes rich she wrinkled her nose very anyway i met geoffrey when he was on a winetasting tour of the area it must have been oh seventeen years ago i was only nineteen at the time geoffrey was thirty and sir geoffrey fell in love with the négociants daughter how romantic sylvie dredged up another sad smile yes it was romantic then she drew deep on her cigarette and let the smoke out of her nose you asked if there was anything else about spinks chief inspector yes there was things had been going missing from the house missing like what she shrugged a silver snuffbox not very valuable though it might look antique to the untrained eye some foreign currency a pair of silver earrings little things like that since deborah had been seeing spinks she nodded yes im almost certain of it deborah wouldnt do anything like that im not saying she was a saintobviously notbut at least she was honest she was no thief did you challenge her about the stolen articles yes and what did she say she said she didnt know about the missing things but she would talk to him did she tell you what he said she said he denied it did spinks ever bother either of you after that day you threw him out sylvie frowned and stubbed out her cigarette she rubbed the back of her hand over her lips as if to get rid of the taste he made threats one day he came to the house when both deborah and geoffrey were out what did he do he didnt do anything nothing physical if thats what you mean if he had i wouldnt have hesitated to call the police i tried to close the door on him but he pushed his way in and asked for money did you give him any no what did he say he said if i didnt give him money he would keep on seeing deborah and that he would get her pregnant make himself part of the family she shuddered he was disgusting and you still didnt give him anything no then he said if i didnt give him money he would start spreading the word around that he had deflowered sir geoffrey harrisons daughter that she was nothing but a slut he said he would spread it around st marys and get her expelled and he would make sure people in the business community knew so that they would all laugh at geoffrey behind his back what did you do nothing i was too shocked luckily michael was here at the time he handled it what did he do i dont know youll have to ask him i was so upset i went upstairs all i can say is that i heard nothing more of the matter after that spinks disappeared from our lives just as if he had never been there in the first place not without leaving some damage of course did he ever threaten to harm deborah physically sylvie shook her head not that i heard but he certainly seemed capable of acting violently she touched her scar again yes do you think i honestly dont know said banks but anythings possible did mr clayton know about spinks from the start yes he dropped by the house that time when they were having the barbecue he said something to spinks about the drinking and spinks was very rude michael agreed with me then that deborah was wasted on the boy and i told him aboutwhen i found them together in bed i had to tell someone clayton seemed to be dropping by sir geoffreys house an awful lot banks thought especially when sir geoffrey wasnt there but sylvie was does mr clayton have any family of his own he asked michael no he and his wife gillian split up three years ago it was a childless marriage she smiled i think part of the problem was that michael is married to his work sometimes i think he has his computers wired directly to his brain he has a girlfriend in seattle now and that seems ideal for him longdistance romance he travels there quite often on company business how long have he and sir geoffrey known one another since oxford theyve always been inseparable in fact michael was with geoffrey when we met banks paused for a moment and sipped some lukewarm tea do you know any of the teachers at st marys he asked some of them when you pay as much money to send your child to school as we do you tend to have some say in the way the place is run and and st marys is an excellent school wonderful facilities good staff a healthy atmospherei could go on did you ever get the sense there was anything unpleasant going on there unpleasant im sorry i cant be any more precise than that but if anyone or any group was up to something at schoolsomething illegal such as drugsand if deborah found out about itshe was attacked on her way home from school after all someone could have followed her from there sylvie shook her head slowly the things you policemen dream up no i never heard the slightest hint of a rumor of anything wrong at st marys and i believe one does hear about these things if they are going on did you have any reason to think john spinks or anyone else might have introduced deborah to drugs she sighed i cant say i didnt worry about it then she shook her head but i dont think so i never saw any signs deborah was a very active girl she valued her physical health her athletic prowess far too much to damage it with drugs do you know patrick metcalfe ive met him yes did deborah ever talk about him no not that i recall did she like him she didnt say one way or the other she did quite well at history though it wasnt her best subject but why do you ask hes just part of the tapestry thats all maybe not an important part did deborah have any contact with the church after you and your husband stopped going i dont think so geoffrey was quite adamant that we all stay away but the school and the church remained close she may have had some contact she rubbed her eyes and stood up please excuse me chief inspector but im feeling very tired i think ive told you all i can for the moment and i hope youll be discreet id prefer it if you didnt let geoffrey know about what ive told you today banks smiled of course not not if you dont tell him ive been here im afraid my boss but before he could get the words out the front door opened and shut and sir geoffrey shouted out im home darling how is everything iii at the back of eastvale bus station past the noise of revving engines and the stink of diesel fumes a pair of heavy glass doors led past the small newsagents booth to an escalator that rarely worked at the top of the staircase a shoplined corridor ended in an open glassroofed area with a central fountain surrounded by a few small tatty trees in wooden planters the swainsdale center several other corridors leading from other street entrances also converged like spokes at the hub there were shops all aroundhmv boots wh smith currys dixonsbut at sixthirty that wednesday evening none of them were open only the small coffee shop was doing any business at allif you could call two cups of tea and a penguin biscuit in the last two hours business the teenagers hung out around the fountain usually leaning against the trees or sitting on the benches that had been put up for little old ladies to rest their feet no little old ladies dared go near them now a number of pennies gleamed at the bottom of the pool into which the fountain ran god knew why people felt they had to chuck coins in water banks thought but the small pool was mostly full of floating cigarette ends cellophane mars bar wrappers beer tins plastic bags containing traces of solvent and the occasional used condom banks experienced a brief flash of anger as he approached imagining tracy standing there as one of this motley crowd smoking drinking beer pushing one another playfully raising their voices in occasional obscenities or sudden whoops and generally behaving as teenagers do then he reminded himself as he constantly had to do these days that he hadnt been much different himself at their age and that as often as not beneath the braggadocio and the rough exteriors most of them were pretty decent kids at heart except john spinks according to tracy spinks was a hero of sorts among the group because of his oftrecounted but neverdetected criminal exploits she thought he made most of them up but even she had to admit that he occasionally shared his illgotten gains with the others in the form of cigarettes and beer as he didnt work and couldnt have got very much from the dole he clearly had to supplement his income through criminal activities and he never seemed short of a few quid for a new leather jacket he lived with his mum on the east side estate a decaying monument to the sixties social optimism but he never talked much about his home life he had boasted of going to an acid house party in manchester once tracy said and claimed he took ecstasy there he had also tried gluesniffing but thought it was kids stuff and it gave you spots he was proud of his clear complexion spinks standing a head taller than the rest was immediately recognizable from tracys description his lightbrown hair was short at the back and sides and long on top with one long lock halfcovering the left side of his face he wore jeans trainers with the laces untied and a midlength flak jacket when banks and hatchley approached showed their warrant cards and asked for a private little chat he didnt run curse them or protest but simply shrugged and said sure then he gave his mates a sideways grin as he went they went into the coffee shop took a table and hatchley fetched three coffees and a couple of chocolate biscuits the owners face lit up it was more business than shed done in ages in a way tracy was right spinks did resemble someone from neighbors clean cut with that smooth complexion he had full lips perhaps a shade too red for a boy brown eyes that could probably melt a young girls heart and straight white teeth the front ones stained only slightly by tobacco he accepted the cigarette banks offered and broke off the filter before smoking it you tracy bankss dad then he said thats right she said her father were a copper nice bit of stuff tracy is ive had my eyes on her for a while come to think of it i havent seen her for a few weeks whats she up to these days banks smiled it hadnt taken long to get past the good looks to the slimy vain and cocky little creep underneath now he knew he wouldnt feel bad no matter what he had to do to get spinks to talk when banks didnt answer spinks faltered only slightly before saying why dont you ask her to drop by one evening she knows where i am we could have a really good time know what i mean one more remark like that hatchley cut in and youll be mopping blood from your face for the rest of our little chat threats now is it he shrugged whats it matter anyway ive already had the little bitch and shes not the woman behind the counter looked over just after spinkss face bounced off the table and she hurried over with a cloth to stem the flow of blood from his nose thats police brutality spinks protested his words muffled by the cool wet cloth broke my fucking nose did you see that me said the woman didnt see nothing and theres no call for that sort of language in here you can keep the cloth then she scurried back behind the counter funny said banks i was looking the other way too he leaned forward now listen you little arsewipe lets start again only this time i ask the questions and you answer them okay spinks muttered a curse through the rag okay banks asked again spinks took the cloth away the flow of blood seemed to have abated and he only dabbed at it sulkily now and then throughout the interview youve broken my tooth he whined thatll cost money i was only joking anyway about your deborah harrison banks said name ring a bell spinks averted his eyes sure its that schoolkid from st marys got herself killed the other day all over the news she didnt get herself killed someone murdered her whatever the lock of hair kept slipping down over spinkss eye and he had developed the habit of twitching his head to flick it back in place dont look at me i didnt kill her where were you on monday around six oclock was that the day it was really foggy yes i was here he pointed to the group outside ask anyone go on ask them banks nodded at sergeant hatchley who went out to talk to the youths besides spinks went on why would i want to kill her you went out together over the summer and you parted on bad terms you were angry with her you wanted revenge he probed his tooth and winced thats a load of old knobrot that is besides they wasnt supposed to tell you that who wasnt them the french tart and that bloody clayton they went to enough trouble to stop me from telling anyone now they go and tell you themselves bloody stupid it is doesnt make sense unless they just wanted to drop me in it he dabbed at his red nose hatchley came back inside and nodded they telling the truth banks asked hard to say like jelačićs mates theyd probably say black was white if young lochinvar over here told them to banks studied spinks who showed no emotion but kept dabbing at his nose and probing his tooth with his tongue what did michael clayton do to stop you from talking he asked spinks looked down into the bloodstained rag imagine how it would sound if some newspaper got hold of the story that an east side estate yobbo like me had been sticking it to sir geoffrey harrisons daughter thats why i asked you what gave me some money who did clayton michael clayton gave you money to stay away from deborah thats what i said how much hundred quid so you admit to blackmailing lady harrison nothing of the sort look if you sell a story to the papers they pay you for it dont they so why shouldnt you get paid if you dont sell the papers a story your logic is impeccable john i can see you didnt waste your time in school spinks laughed school hardly ever there was i was deborah there when you went to ask for money nah just the two of them clayton and the old bag he put on a posh accent it was deborahs day for riding dont you know dressage got a horse out middleham way always did like hot flesh throbbing between her legs did deborah so the two of them had a talk with you thats right and after lady harrison had gone upstairs michael clayton hit you and gave you a hundred pounds like i said we came to an arrangement then her ladyship came back and said if she ever heard id been talking about her daughter she would tell sir geoffrey and hed probably have me killed you blackmailed her and she threatened you with murder yeah get away with anything those rich fuckers just like the pigs youve been listening to too many jefferson airplane records john they dont call us pigs now once a pig always a pig and its compact discs now not records jefferson airplane indeed youre showing your age oh spare us the witty repartee did you see deborah again after that no did you ever have anything to do with st marys church with daniel charters and his wife or with ive jelačić church me you must be fucking joking did deborah ever mention an important secret she had what secret youre not being very cooperative johnny i dont know anything about no secret and my names john what you gonna do arrest me banks took a sip of coffee i dont know yet if you didnt kill deborah who do you think did some psycho why are you so sure i saw it on telly thats what they said you believe everything you hear on telly well if it wasnt a psycho who was it banks sighed and lit another cigarette this time he didnt offer spinks one thats what im asking you he snapped his fingers come on wake up john boy spinks dabbed at his nose it had stopped bleeding now how should i know you knew her you spent time with her did she have any enemies did she ever talk to you about her life what no mostly we just fucked if you want to know the truth apart from that she was boring always on about horses and school and always bloody picking on things i said and the way i said them well she was an educated woman john i realize it would have been hard for you to keep up with her intellectually like i said she was only good for one thing i understand you once stole a car and took deborah for a joyride inow hang on just a minute i dont know whos been spreading vicious rumors about me but i never stole no car cant even drive can i he took a pouch of drum from his flakjacket pocket and rolled a cigarette what about drugs never touch them stay clean thats my motto ill bet if we had a look through his pockets said sergeant hatchley wed probably find enough to lock him up for banks stared at spinks for a moment as if considering the idea he saw something shift in the boys eyes guilt fear no he said standing up hes not worth the paperwork well leave him be for the moment but he went on well probably be back so dont wander too far i want you to know youre looking good for this john youve got quite a temper so we hear and you had every reason to hold a grudge against the victim and one more thing spinks raised his eyebrows banks leaned forward rested his hands on the table and lowered his voice if i ever catch you within a mile of my daughter youll think that bloody nose sergeant hatchley gave you was a friendly pat on the back iv at home later that evening after dinner when tracy had gone up to her room to do her homework banks and sandra found a couple of hours to themselves at last with elgars first symphony playing quietly on the stereo banks poured himself a small laphroaig and sandra a drambuie with ice he wouldnt smoke tonight not at home he decided even though the peaty bite of the islay almost screamed out for an accompaniment of nicotine first banks told sandra about john spinks and his visit to sylvie harrison i thought the chief constable ruled the family offlimits she said he did banks shrugged actually i just escaped by the skin of my teeth sir geoffrey came in and caught me talking to her a word in jimmy riddles ear and my name would be mud luckily lady harrison didnt want him to know wed been talking about deborahs boyfriend so she told him id just dropped by to give them a progress report he was more annoyed that shed been smoking than he was about my presence this spinks sandra said he sounds like a bad character do you think tracy had anything to do with him banks shook his head he was part of the crowd thats all shes got more sense than that deborah harrison obviously didnt have we all make mistakes banks stood up and walked towards the hall oh go on sandra said with a smile have a cigarette if you want one its been a tough day at the gallery i might even join you sandra had stopped smoking some years ago but she seemed able to cheat occasionally without falling back into the habit banks envied her that as it turned out banks hadnt been going for his cigarettes but for the photograph that stott and hatchley had got from owen pierce still not being one to look a gift horse in the mouth he weakened and brought the silk cut from his overcoat pocket once they had both lit up and the elgar was moving into the adagio banks slid the photograph out of the envelope and passed it to sandra what do you think he asked very pretty but not your type surely her breasts are too small for your taste thats not what i meant and ive got nothing against small breasts sandra dug her elbow in his side and smiled im teasing you think i didnt know that seriously though what do you think professionally sandra frowned its not her is it not the girl who was killed no do you see a resemblance though sandra shifted sideways and held the photo under the shaded lamp yes a bit the newspaper photo wasnt very good mind you and teenage girls are still in some ways unformed if theyve got similar hair color and style and theyre about the same height and shape you can construe a likeness easily enough apparently shes not a teenager she was twentytwo when that was taken sandra raised her dark eyebrows would we could all look so many years younger than we are what do you think of the style as a photograph its good very good in fact its an excellent composition the pose looks natural and the lighting is superb see how it brings out that hollow below the breasts and the everso slight swell of her tummy you can even see where the light catches the tiny hairs on her skin and it has a mood too a unity theres a sort of secret smile on her face a bit mona lisaish a strong rapport with the photographer do you think she knew him sandra studied the photograph for a few seconds in silence elgar playing softly in the background they were lovers she said finally ill bet you a pound to a penny they were lovers womens intuition sandra gave him another dig in the ribs harder this time then she passed him the photo no just look at her eyes alan the laughter the way shes looking at him its obvious when he looked more closely banks knew that sandra was right it was obvious men and women only looked like that at one another when they had slept together or were about to he couldnt explain why certainly couldnt offer any proof or evidence but like sandra he knew and barry stott had said that pierce denied knowing the woman the next job then was to find her and discover why banks would wait for the initial forensic results then hed have a long chat with owen pierce himself chapter i the man who sat before banks in the interview room at two oclock that saturday afternoon looked very angry banks didnt blame him he would have been angry himself if two hulking great coppers had come and dragged him off to the police station on his day off especially with it being remembrance day too but it couldnt be helped banks would rather have been at home listening to brittens war requiem as he did every november but it would have to wait new information had come in it was time for him to talk to owen pierce in person relax owen said banks were probably going to be here for a while so theres no point letting your blood pressure go right off the scale why dont you just get on with it owen said ive got better things to do with my time banks sighed me too owen me too he put new tapes in the doublecassette recorder then he told owen that the interview was being taped and as before stated the names of everyone in the room along with the time place and date susan gay was the only other person present her role was mostly to observe but banks would give her the chance to ask a question or two they were taking a fresh team approachso far only stott and hatchley had interviewed pierceand banks had already spent a couple of hours that morning going over the previous interview transcripts okay banks began first let me caution you that you do not have to say anything but if you do not mention now something which you later use in your defense the court may decide that your failure to mention it strengthens the case against you a record will be made of anything you say and it may be given in evidence if you are brought to trial owen swallowed does this mean im under arrest no said banks its just a formality so we all know whats what i understand youve been informed about your right to a solicitor yes and youve waived it for the moment yes i keep telling you i havent done anything why should i have to pay for a solicitor good point they can be very expensive now then owen can we just go over last monday evening one more time please owen sighed and told them exactly the same as he had told stott the last time and the time before that and you never at any time that day had contact with the victim deborah harrison no how could i i had no idea who she was youre quite sure you didnt meet her i told you no why were you in the area just walking oh come on do you think i was born yesterday owen hey you had a meeting with deborah didnt you you knew her dont be ridiculous how could i know someone like her banks reached down into his briefcase and pushed the photograph across the desk whos this he asked just a model look at it owen look closely you know her any idiot can see that banks watched owen turn pale and lick his lips i dont know what you mean he said she was just a model bollocks she was just a model have you noticed her resemblance to the murdered girl banks set a photograph of deborah harrison next to it owen looked away i cant say i have look again owen looked and shook his head no and you still maintain that youve never met deborah harrison thats right he looked at his watch look when is this farce going to end ive got work to do banks glanced over at susan and nodded she leaned forward and placed two labeled packages on the desk the thing is owen banks said that this evidence shows otherwise evidence what evidence hair owen hair banks tapped the first envelope to cut a long story short this envelope contains samples of hairs taken from those we found on the anorak you were wearing on monday evening when you went for your walk the one you gave us permission to test there are a number of hairs that our experts have identified as coming from the head of deborah harrison owen grasped the edge of the desk but they cant be you must be mistaken banks shook his head gravely oh i could bore you with the scientific details about the medulla and the cortex and so on but you can take my word for itthey match owen said nothing susan pushed the other package forward now this banks said contains hair samples taken from deborah harrisons school blazer oddly enough some of these hairs have been positively identified as yours again matched with the samples you freely allowed us to take the other day banks sat back and folded his arms i think youve got quite a bit of explaining to do havent you owen youre trying to set me up those hairs arent mine they cant be youre lying to get me to confess arent you confess to what owen owen smiled youre not going to catch me out as easily as that banks leaned forward and rested his palm on the desk read my lips owen he said were not lying the hairs are yours owen ran his hand through his hair wait a minute there must be some simple explanation for this theres got to be i hope so said banks id really like to hear it owen bit his lip and concentrated the only thing i can think of he said after a few moments is that when i was on the bridge someone bumped into me it all happened so fast i was turning from looking over the river and she knocked the wind out of me i didnt get a really good look because she disappeared into the fog and i only saw her from behind but i think she had long fair hair and wore a maroon blazer and skirt it could have been her couldnt it that could have been how it happened couldnt it banks frowned and looked through the notes in front of him i dont understand owen when you talked to di stott and ds hatchley you didnt say anything about this i know owen looked away at first i just forgot then wellwhen i remembered when id seen the paper and knew why theyd been questioning mewell id already not said anything so i suppose i was worried it would look bad if i spoke up then look bad but how could it owen how could it look bad if you simply said the girl might have bumped into you what were you afraid of yes but i mean if it really had been deborah harrisoni dont know besides i couldnt be sure it was her it just seemed like the best thing to do at the time keep quiet it didnt seem important im sorry if it caused you any problems caused us any problems not really owen but it has caused you quite a few its funny you should mention it now though isnt it now weve matched the hair samples yes welli told you look you can check cant you didnt her friend see me i could just see her through the fog banks tapped the two envelopes what if she did see you that doesnt help your case at all does it in fact it makes things worse but i never denied being on the bridge no but you led us to believe you didnt see deborah harrison now youre changing your story id like to know why i was confused thats all i understand that owen but why didnt you tell the detectives who first interviewed you that youd seen deborah that night i told you it slipped my mind after all i had no idea why the detectives were talking to me then later when i knewwell i was worried that this was exactly the kind of thing that would happen if i did tell you that you would misconstrue it misconstrue yes misinterpret distort misunderstand i know what the word means owen said banks i dont need a bloody thesaurus thank you very much i just dont see how it applies in your case im sorry just put it down to an english teachers pedantry what i mean is i thought youd read more into it thats all when you get right down to it its not very much in the way of evidence is it you have to admit owen attempted a smile but it came out crooked i mean a couple of hairs hardly enough to stand up in court is it dont get clever with me sonny ii wasnt i was just pointing out thats all but we dont know how the hairs got where they did do we thats what im saying maybe it happened when she bumped into me if it was her who bumped into you i cant think of any other explanation but i can see youve lied to us before owen to di stott and ds hatchley why should we believe you now owen swallowed his adams apple bumped up and down lied well you never told us about seeing deborah or about bumping into her for that matter thats a lie of a kind isnt it you might call it a lie of omission and you also said you didnt know the girl in the photo but you do know her dont you no i banks sighed look owen im giving you a chance to dig yourself out of this hole before its too late weve talked to the landlord of the nags head again showed him the picture of this model he says youve been in the pub with her on a number of occasions hes seen you together what do you have to say about that banks noticed the sweat start beading on owens forehead all right i know her knew her but i dont see how its relevant in any way she was my girlfriend we lived together does that satisfy you who is she where is she now what happened to her owen put his hands over his ears i dont believe im hearing this surely you cant think that ive killed michelle too too as well as who for christs sake its a figure of speech id have thought a pedantic english teacher like yourself would be more careful with his figures of speech yes well im upset this michelle what happened we lived together for nearly five years then we split up over the summer simple as that and where is she now she lives in london in swiss cottage why did you split up why does anyone split up irreconcilable differences banks suggested owen laughed harshly yes thatll do irreconcilable differences you could call it that what would you call it its none of your business but there is something else its got nothing to do with this at all but if itll help yes well its the reason i was out walking it was the anniversary the anniversary of the day we met i was a little down a bit sad we used to go for walks by the river as far as st marys or even further and wed sometimes drop in at the nags head to wet our whistles so i just went for that long walk to get it out of my system you were upset of course i was upset i loved her and did you get it out of your system to a certain extent how did you get it out of your system oh this is absurd youve got a onetrack mind theres no point talking to you any more maybe not owen but youve got to admit things are looking pretty bleak you lied to us four times he counted them off on his fingers once about why you were out walking once about never meeting deborah harrison once about not knowing the girl in the photo and once again about never having lived with anyone all lies owen you see what a position it puts me in but they were all sosuch small lies yes all right i lied i admit it but thats all i havent harmed anyone at that point came the soft knock at the door that banks had arranged earlier he turned off the tape recorders and told the person to come in di stott entered nodded quickly at owen pierce and apologized for disturbing them then he handed a report to banks and stood by the door banks glanced over the sheets of paper taking his time pretending he didnt already know the information they contained when he had finished he passed them to susan all the time he was aware of owens discomfort and restlessness susan read the report and raised her eyebrows banks thought they were overacting a bit behaving like doctors who had just looked at the xrays and found out their patient had an inoperable tumor but it was working pierce was really sweating now banks turned the tape recorders on again explaining briefly why he had turned them off and adding that di stott was now also in the room results of the blood tests he said to owen what blood tests remember we took samples the other day yes but with your permission i know but well we also found a small dried bloodstain on your anorak and according to this report owen its deborah harrisons blood group not yours can you explain that ii the three detectives remained silent for a few moments as owen struggled for an explanation then banks spoke up again come on owen he said tell us about it itll do you good owen slammed his fist on the table theres nothing to tell i saw a girl she bumped into me then she ran off she might have been deborah harrison it was foggy i didnt get a clear enough look thats all that happened i dont know how her blood got there youre trying to frame me youre planting evidence youre starting to sound a bit desperate now owen banks said clutching at straws why dont you calm down and tell us all about it but why would i have killed the girl what possible reason could i have why dont you believe me because you didnt tell us the truth that means you had something to hide and theres something else too what we found your blood under deborah harrisons fingernails what do you have to say to that nothing owen said i want a solicitor now im not saying another word until i get a solicitor thats your right said banks but just hear me out for a moment before you do or say anything else youll feel much better if you just tell us what happened and itll go better for you in the long run when you saw deborah harrison on the bridge she reminded you of this michelle didnt she the girl you were upset about were you punishing michelle through deborah owen is that what all this was about what did she do to you owen broke off eye contact nothing he said this is all just speculation its rubbish you followed her into the graveyard and you approached her didnt you banks went on resting his elbows on the desk and speaking softly maybe you offered her a fiver to toss you off so you could pretend it was michelle doing it whatever it doesnt matter but she reacted badly she got scared you dragged her off the path behind the inchcliffe mausoleum it was dark and foggy and quiet there you were going to give her what for werent you give it to her good and proper just to show her she couldnt do what she did to you and get away with it all your anger burst out didnt it owen what happened couldnt you get it up what did michelle do to you it was her you were strangling wasnt it why did you lie about knowing her owen put his head in his hands and groaned banks packed up his papers stood and nodded to stott who said owen pierce you have already been cautioned and now were going to put you under arrest im going to ask you to come with me to the custody officer do you understand me owen ii stott had called it the custody suite on the way down and the sign on the door said charge room but to owen it resembled nothing less than the entrance to hell abandon all hope it was a cavernous room in the basement of the old tudorfronted eastvale regional hq full of noise and activity saturday afternoon was one of the busiest times in the eastvale custody suite today in addition to the usual saturday bouts of shoplifting hooliganism and drunkenness eastvale united were playing at home to archrivals ripon and there had already been plenty of violence both on and off the field the flaking paint had obviously once been an attempt at a cheerful lemon color now it looked like a nicotine stain owen sat between stott and hatchley on a hard bench opposite elevated joined desks screwed to the floor that ran the whole length of the room like a counter behind the desks about six or seven uniformed police officers typed bustled about shouted laughed filled in forms and questioned people presided over by the custody sergeant himself the contrast between the real smell of fear and this slick bureaucratic activity brought for owen its special brand of terror like a hospital casualty department where ripped flesh bleeds and pristine machines hiss and beep at the moment a drunk with a bloody face leaned over the desk singing danny boy at the custody sergeant who was trying to get his personal details on the benches near owen sat a couple of gloomy skinheads laces missing from their bovver boots a man who resembled nothing more than a bank clerk perhaps an embezzler owen thought and a nervouslooking young woman smartly dressed biting her lip a kleptomaniac another man at the desk started arguing with one of the officers about being picked on because he was black the drunk paused in his song to look over and shout bloody right too ought to go back to the bloody jungle where you came from sambo then he emitted a technicolor whoosh of vomit all over the desk and sank to his knees on the floor to clutch his stomach and whimper the sergeant swore and jumped backwards but he wasnt quick enough to prevent some of the vomit from spattering the front of his uniform get that bastard out of here he yelled in the rooms eerie acoustics his voice rose echoed wildly then fell dead adrenalin pumped through owens system he took a couple of deep breaths to calm himself and almost gagged on the stink of vomit and ammonia cleaning fluid that permeated the stale air an officer filled in names numbers charges and times with a black marker on a white board posters covered the walls one gave a graphic warning about the possible consequences of driving while drunk one informed prisoners of their rights a third showed sign language another advised officers to wear gloves when dealing with vomit and blood due to possible aids and hepatitis b exposure two officers dragged the drunk out and another started clearing up the mess with a mop cloth and a bucket of lysol he was wearing plastic gloves blood had dripped on the pale green linoleum even the skinheads looked cowed by it all owen kept trying to convince himself that the nightmare would end any moment and he would wake up and find himself out shopping with the rest of the saturday crowd perhaps he would go to hmv in the swainsdale center and buy the new van morrison cd then maybe a pint or two and a nice dinner out chinese or indian just to celebrate alone the way he liked it best or perhaps the policemen would rip off their uniforms to reveal clowns costumes underneath and stott would break into a song and dance number like characters out of a dennis potter play as soon as the custody sergeant was free stott went over and had a brief word then gestured for owen to approach the desk stott disappeared through the far door empty your pockets please sunshine said the sergeant after taking owens personal details owen emptied his pockets onto the desk there wasnt much in them keys wallet three pounds sixtyeight pee in change check book bank machine and credit cards a few crumpled shopping lists and old bus tickets that had been through the washer and dryer a couple of times his gold cross fountainpen the small letts appointment diarycumaddress book with the pencil tucked down the spine three pieces of dentyne chewinggum and a few balls of fluff the sergeant flipped through owens diary it was empty apart from a few addresses next he looked through owens wallet nothing much there he said placing it in the plastic bag with the other items he held the pen between thumb and forefinger and said goldlooking fountainpen it is gold owen said its not just goldlooking well were not going to get a bloody appraiser in mate are we the sergeant said goldlooking he dropped it in the bag before they sealed the bag a constable patted owen down to see if he had anything else hidden shall we have a look up his arse sir he asked the custody sergeant when he had finished the sergeant looked at owen then back at the constable as if he were seriously considering the proposition nah he said i never did like rectal searches myself messy business never know what you might find take him to the studio jesus christ thought owen theyre enjoying this they dont need to be rude violent and brutal they get their kicks better this way the vicious tease the cruel joke they had already judged and condemned him in their minds he was guilty and the rest would be mere formality and if they believed it wouldnt everyone else when they put him jail he thought with a stab of fear it would be even worse he had heard about the things that went on how people like the yorkshire ripper and dennis nilsen had to be kept in solitary for their own good how jeffrey dahmer had been murdered in prison and frederick west had hanged himself solitary confinement would probably be better than a poke up the bum from a threehundredpound hells angel with tattoos on his cock owen thought but could he stand the loneliness the feeling of being hopelessly cut off from everything he held dear abandoned by the whole civilized world he liked the solitary life but that was his choice could he stand it when it was imposed on him the constable led him into another room for fingerprinting and mug shots taken by a mounted camera the studio another cruel joke now then mate the constable said lets have your belt and shoelaces what why on earth regulations sos you dont top yourself see but im not going to do away with myself ive told you all im innocent aye well it doesnt matter its more than my jobs worth wed have your tie too if you were wearing one saw a fellow once topped himself with his tie polkadot tie it was a nice one you shouldve seen him eyes all bulging and his tongue sticking out and the pong you wouldnt believe it aye nasty business it was dont worry mate youll get your things backthats if youre ever in a position to need them again he had a good laugh at that while owen took the belt off his jeans and the long white laces from his trainers back at the desk the custody sergeant gave owen a pamphlet on legal aid and sheet of paper that advised him of his rights to call a solicitor to inform a friend and to consult the codes of practice then he went over to scrawl details on the board i want to call my solicitor owen said the sergeant shrugged and gestured to the constable again who escorted owen to a telephone he felt in his inside pocket for his addressbook where he had politely jotted down whartons number but realized it had been taken away along with all his other possessions he turned to the constable the phone number he said its in my diary can i get it back for a minute sorry the constable replied against regulations its all been entered and bagged but i cant remember my solicitors number best try this then he pulled a dogeared telephone directory from the desk drawer it usually works owen flipped through and managed to find gordon whartons office number he got an answering machine and even though it was late on saturday afternoon left an urgent message anyway just in case then he tried the listed home number but got no answer what now he asked the constable cells another constable appeared beside them they took owen gently by the elbows and led him back into the corridor nothing to worry about the first officer said quite comfortable really more like a hospital ward most modern part of the whole building police boots echoed from the greenishblue walls and high ceiling as the three of them walked down the hallway at the end the constable took out a key and opened a heavy hinged door true the cell wasnt the dank dripping dungeon owen had imagined it was actually very clean all white tiles like a public urinal and bright light from bulbs covered by wire mesh it contained a narrow bed fixed to the wall and floor with a thin mattress a washstand and a seatless toilet made of molded orange plastic there was only one window set high and deep in the wall about a foot square and almost as thick the door had a flap for observation a faint odor of dead skin and old sweat lurked under the smell of disinfectant sorry theres no telly said one of the jailers but you can have something to read if you like a book maybe or a magazine he turned to his companion jock heres probably got an issue or two of playboy hidden away at the back of his desk owen ignored the taunt he simply shook his head and stared around in amazement at the cell owt to eat the jailer asked when he thought about it owen realized that he was hungry he said yes the specials steak and kidney pud today or theres fish and chips sausage and steak and kidney pud sounds just fine owen said mug of tea milk and sugar owen nodded this is bloody absurd he thought almost unable to contain his laughter here i am sitting in a cell in the bowels of the eastvale police station putting in an order for steak and kidney pudding and a mug of tea you wont be here long said the jailer and if it wasnt a weekend wed have you up before the beak tomorrow anyway just sos you know youll be well treated youll get three square meals a day a bit of exercise if you want it reading material pen and paper if you want we cant give him a pen ted said jock he mightyou knowremember that bloke who he drew his forefinger across his throat and made a gurgling sound aye youre right ted turned back to owen we had a bloke once tried to cut his throat with a fountainpen messy and another jabbed a pencil right through his eye socket a yellow hb if i recollect it right he shook his head slowly sorry lad youll have to wait for writing privileges its our responsibility see anything else you want though just let us know as i always say just ring the bell and ask for room service they laughed and walked out into the corridor the heavy door slammed shut behind them iii so what do you think sir susan gay asked over the noise handing banks the pint she had just bought him thanks looks like i was wrong doesnt it banks said with a shrug the queens arms was buzzing with conversation and ringing with laughter that saturday evening rumors had leaked out that the eastvale strangler was in the holding cells and all was well with the world parents could once again rest easy in their beds just about every phone fax and modem in town was tied up by the press and those police who were off duty were celebrating their success the only things missing were the fireworks and the brass band banks sat next to susan gay with hatchley and stott not far away stott looked like the cat that got the cream chief constable riddle had visited the station earlier patting backs and bragging to the media he hadnt wasted the opportunity to admonish banks for pestering the harrisons nor had he neglected to praise stott for his major role in what was probably the quickest arrest of a sex murderer ever this time riddle was going to go and tell the harrisons personally that he had a man in custody for deborahs murder largely due to the efforts of a new member of eastvale cid di barry stott of course riddle wouldnt be seen dead drinking in a pub with the common footsoldiers even if he didnt have a couple of tv interviews lined up thank god for small mercies banks thought as he sipped his pint and let the conversation and laughter ebb and flow around him banks wondered why he felt so depressed never one to shy away from selfexamination he considered professional jealousy first but was that really true banks had to admit that it would only look that way to the chief constable and one or two others who had it in for him as far as the media were concerned detective chief inspector alan banks had headed the most successful investigation in the history of eastvale divisional headquarters his troops had won the battle he was the general so why did he feel so depressed the evidence is pretty solid isnt it sir susan shouted in his ear banks nodded it was nothing on the shoes that pierce couldnt have picked up on the river path but positive blood and hair matches both ways his and hers suspect a bit of an oddball a liar to boot seen in the area with no good reason around the time of the murder oh yes banks admitted even the crown prosecution service should have no trouble with this one what could be better and if the dna results were positive when they came through he looked at susan earnest expression on her round face with its peaches and cream complexion short slightly upturned nose tight blonde curls she had a glass of st clements in front of her banks smiled trying to shake off his gloom let me buy you a drink susan he said a real drink what would you like i shouldnt sir really susan said i mean you know officially bugger officially youre off duty besides this is your senior officer telling you its time you had a real drink whats it to be susan blushed and smiled averting her bluegray eyes well in that case sir ill have a port and lemon port and lemon it is let me go sir no stay there save my seat banks got up and edged his way through the crowd nodding and smiling a hello here and there one or two people clapped him on the back and congratulated him on the speed with which he had caught the killer with his pint in one hand and susans port and lemon in the other he excusemed his way back before he had got halfway he felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around to see rebecca charters standing there long auburn hair framing her pale face banks smiled a bit off the beaten track arent you he said i dropped by the police station first the man on the front desk said you were all over here celebrating ive heard that youve got someone under arrest for deborah harrisons murder is it true banks nodded yes a suspect at least does that mean youll be leaving us alone now things can get back to normal whatever that is banks said why what are you worried about im not worried about anything it would just be nice to know we could get on with our lives in private now rather than sharing every significant emotional event with the local police that was never my intention mrs charters look its a bit silly just standing here like this would you like a drink he could see rebecca consider the offer seriously needily she eyed the bottles ranged behind the bar then suddenly she shook her head no no thank you thats another thing im trying to put behind me good said banks good for you how the hell would you know she said and stormed out banks shrugged and headed back to the table where everyone even di stott was laughing at one of hatchleys jokes banks didnt mind missing it he had heard them all before at least five times when he slid into his seat again susan thanked him for the drink what was all that about she asked im not sure said banks i think i offended her or maybe abstinence has made her irritable as long as she doesnt complain to the chief constable what next sir next i think weve got to find out a bit more about what makes pierce tick weve still got no motive have we he asked us why he should have committed such a crime and i think we have a duty to try and answer that if not for his sake then for a jurys but sir if it was a sex murder we dont really need a motive do we we wouldnt expect a rational one did owen pierce seem mad to you thats a very difficult question susan said slowly the kind of thing experts argue about in court im not asking for an official statement this is off the record your personal observations your coppers intuition susan sipped her port and lemon well to start with he was nervous edgy hostile and confused isnt that how you would feel if you were accused of murder and subjected to an interrogation susan shrugged i dont know sir ive never been in that position i mean if youve got nothing to hideif youre telling the truthwhy get upset because everyone thinks you did it and theyve got all the power we have the power we basically bullied pierce until he was so confused he acted like a guilty man are you saying you still dont think he did it sir banks scratched the scar beside his right eye it was itching sometimes that meant something sometimes not he wished he knew which was which no all im saying is that everyones got something to hide everyone starts to feel guilty when theyre stopped and questioned by the police whether theyve done anything or not almost anyone would react the way pierce did under that sort of pressure banks lit a cigarette and blew out the smoke slowly careful to blow it away from susan then he took a long swig of beer but you still have doubts banks clicked his tongue i shouldnt should i i mean i did arrest him this is just perfect signed sealed and delivered im still confused thats all all this business with pierce has happened so quickly there are still too many loose ends there was so much going on around deborah remember jelačićs alibi still doesnt really hold water then theres that triangle of daniel and rebecca charters and patrick metcalfe thats a pretty volatile combination if ever ive seen one theres john spinks another character capable of violence add to that the open satchel michael clayton spending half his time with sylvie harrison while her husband is out and youve still got a lot of unanswered questions yes sir but are any of them relevant now weve got pierce with the hair and blood banks shrugged hair and blood arent infallible but youre probably right sometimes i wish i could just accept the official version but you agree pierce could have done it oh yes he probably did do it we found no trace evidence at all on either charterss or jelačićs clothing and pierce was in the area theres also something about him that harmonizes with the crime in an odd sort of way i dont know how to put it any better than that you struck a nerve in him there sir i must admit he gives me the creeps yes theres a part of him that has some sort of imaginative sympathy with what happened to deborah harrison what i tried to do in that room was make contact with his dark side banks gave a little shudder what is it sir everyone has a dark side susan doesnt owen pierce make you wonder about your own susans eyes widened no sir i dont think so i mean weve done our job weve got the evidence weve got a suspect in custody i think we should just let it lie and move on banks paused then smiled youre right of course he said but weve still a fair bit of work to do how do you fancy a trip to london on monday london me sir yes id like to pay this michelle a visit see what her story is he did his best to keep their relationship from us so there has to be something in it besides id like you impressions woman to woman if thats not a terribly sexist thing to say it isnt sir of course id love to come good banks looked at his watch and finished his pint id better get home have a nice liein tomorrow youll enjoy it susan smiled i think i will sir goodnight banks put his overcoat on said farewell to everyone and acknowledged a few more pats on the back as he walked through the crowd to the door he stood for a moment on market street by the cobbled square watching his breath plume in the clear cold air so much had happened today that he had hardly had time to notice the clear blue sky the autumn wind stripping leaves from the trees now it was dark and the stars shone for the first time in days a line from last months eastvale amateur dramatic society production tripped through his mind the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves again banks thought of that foggy night in the graveyard and wondered what had really happened there perhaps he would never know it was a cold night to walk home but he had drunk three pints too much for driving and he decided he wanted to clear his head anyway with numb hands he managed to put on his headphones and flip the switch of the walkman in his pocket after a second or two of hiss he was shocked by the assault of a loud distorted electric guitar he had forgotten about the jimi hendrix tape he had put in earlier in the week to wake him up on his way to work he hadnt listened to it since then then he smiled and started walking home why not hear my train a coming would do just fine he would listen to brittens war requiem later chapter i the intercity from york pulled into london kings cross at on monday november twenty minutes late a problem with points outside peterborough the conductor explained over the pa system not for the first time banks regarded the bleak postindustrial landscape of his hometown with a mixture of nostalgia and horror peterborough of all the places to come from even if the football team he had supported as a teenager had recently edged about halfway up the second division as forecast the rain came not a shower or a storm but steady november drizzle that looked as if it would keep falling forever from a leaden sky it was raining in eastvale when banks and susan drove out to york that morning it was raining in york when they caught the train and it was raining in london when they got off the underground at oxford circus at least it was a little warmer than the weekend raincoat weather not heavy overcoat to make it easy all around michelle chappel had suggested over the telephone that she talk to them during her lunchhour which started at in a small pasta restaurant off regent street near where she worked as office administrator for a quality stationery company as the questioning was to be informal and michelle herself certainly wasnt suspected of any crime banks agreed it meant they could get the job done and be back in eastvale by late afternoon if they were lucky as usual regent street was crowded even in the rain and banks found he had to dodge many an eyethreatening umbrella spoke as he and susan made their way to the rendezvous in a sidestreet not far from dickins amp jones they got there about five minutes late and banks spotted michelle chappel at a window table with a skill that peterborough united could have used the previous weekend he managed to sidestep the waiter who was blocking the way holding out large menus and muttering about a fifteen to twentyminute wait the restaurant was unpretentious in appearancerickety tables and chairs plenty of scratched woodwork giltframed watercolors of venice and florence stained white tableclothsbut when banks looked at the list of specials chalked on the blackboard he soon realized it was the kind of london unpretentiousness you pay for through the nose the small diningroom was crowded but michelle had saved two places for them waiters scurried around sweatybrowed carafes of wine appeared on tables and the smell of garlic tomatoes and oregano permeated the air despite the bustle though it wasnt unduly noisy and when they had introduced themselves and sat down they didnt have to shout to be heard ive told mr littlewood i might be a few minutes late getting back michelle said he said he didnt mind good said banks well certainly try not to take up too much of your time thats all right physically michelle resembled her photograph very closely except for her hair which was now cut short razorsculpted around her delicate ears and hung in a ragged fringe the strong bone structure was still apparent in her cheeks and jaw the pale almost translucent skin still flawless and although she was sitting it was clear that she maintained her slim athletic figure she wore a tailored red jacket over a black silk blouse buttoned up to the hollow of her long swanlike neck from her tiny pale ears two silver angel earrings danced every time she moved her head you said on the telephone that you would recognize me from one of owens photographs michelle said to banks clearly aware of his scrutiny that was two years ago have i changed very much banks shook his head it was one of the nudes i suppose yes then im afraid youll have to take my word on the rest she smiled and the humor flickered in her eyes for a moment just as owen pierce had captured it on film she touched her hair i had this cut six months ago just for a change would you like to eat both banks and susan had skipped the train food and were starving after much study and some consultation banks decided on the gourmet pizza with goat cheese olives sundried tomatoes and italian sausage it was london after all he thought and london prices so why not susan went for the cannelloni they ordered a halfliter of red wine for the two of them michelle was already drinking white she ordered linguine with clam sauce that done they settled back to talk customers came and went more leaving than arriving as it got close to one oclock and the drizzle continued to streak the window behind the slightly dirty white lace curtains im not sure what you want from me michelle said you didnt tell me very much on the telephone im not certain myself miss chappel said banks i just hope ill know it when i hear it call me michelle please banks nodded you said owen has been arrested thats right on what charge you mean you dont know well his names not been in the papers and you didnt tell me over the phone how could i know of course not banks looked at susan and nodded im afraid its very serious michelle susan said owens been arrested for murder im sorry murder but whowait a minutenot that schoolgirl deborah harrison yes i read about it michelle shook her head slowly bloody hell so hes she looked back at banks and what do you think i can do for you wed like to know what you can tell us about him he didnt seem willing to admit he knew you or tell us who you were ill bet he didnt did something happen between you michelle frowned what do you know already not much given the nature of the crime we need to get some sort of grasp on what kind of person he is we understand already that hes a bit of a loner something of an oddball according to some people is he he wasnt always you know not at first he could be fun could owen for a while anyway then her eyes darkened then what oh justthings change people change thats all well you can see our problem cant you banks said hes got no close family and noone in eastvale seems to know him very well we were hoping you might be able to throw some light on his character is he going to plead insanity its nothing like that why do you ask i mean what do you want to know about him for look dont worry were not going to drag you into court or anything oh i dont mind that then what michelle leaned forward and rested her elbows on the table in fact she said lowering her voice id be more than happy to go into court banks frowned i dont understand michelle what happened between you all we know is that the two of you split in the summer and that owen seemed reluctant to admit he knew you in fact he tried to tell us the photographs were of some anonymous model michelle snorted ill bet he did why would he do that why ill tell you why because he tried to kill me too thats why ii it was less than a mile from the police station to the town hall and owen would have appreciated the walk after being cooped up in a cell all weekend but two officers escorted him straight to a van in front of the station before they went out of the doors one of them threw a musty old raincoat over his head it was no distance from the front doors to the van either but on the way owen had the awful sensation of being swallowed up by a huge mob and he had to struggle to stop his bowels from loosening he could hear people shouting questions yelling insults and cursing him one group all women by the sound of them were chanting hang him hang him owen had always feared crowds had never been able to attend a football match or a music concert in comfort to owen crowds werent really human they were a mindless beast with the power of an elemental force the raincoat over his head smelled of other peoples fear luckily the jostling didnt last before owen actually lost control of his bowels and made a fool of himself he felt himself pushed into the back of a van and heard the door slam the shouts and chants were muffled now and the vans engine soon drowned them out completely things werent quite as bad at the other end where he was hustled through a smaller crowd then taken to an antechamber when owen was finally able to remove the raincoat the first person he saw was gordon wharton not the prettiest sight in the world but a welcome one under the circumstances wharton leaned back in his chair plucked up the crease of his pinstripe trousers and crossed his legs it was a prissy sort of gesture owen thought and one that went with his supercilious expression the pink wellscrubbed cheeks and the way he wore his few remaining strands of oily hair combed across his gleaming skull though he was probably about the same age as owen he looked much older it was partly the fat owen thought and the baldness and maybe the strain of overwork why did the only solicitor he knew turn out to be wharton he had been the university swot never time for a drink in the local or a film in town and owen had never much liked him he sensed the feeling was mutual the only reason they had first come into contact at all was a shared subsidiary subject in their first year and then they had both ended up working in eastvale and met by chance that day wharton had finally arrived to see owen on sunday morning having been out of town on saturday and had been unable to get him out on police bail all right wharton asked owen took a few deep breaths i suppose so what are they trying to do get me torn to pieces wharton shrugged what nobody seems to realize is that im innocent wharton made a steeple of his fingers and looked down owen youre not the first innocent man to be arrested for some offense or other and you wont be the last thats why we have the law everyones innocent until theyre proven guilty the police are only concerned with whether they can prove a case its up to the courts to decide now trust in justice owen snorted the british justice system it hasnt done me a lot of good so far has it carp all you may owen but it is the best justice system in the world in many other countries youd be on your way to the executioner already or languishing forever in some smelly cell look i suggest that you accept your situation complaining will do you no good at all in your present circumstances it will only lead to selfpity now let us see if theres anything else we need to consider pompous bastard owen thought its all very well advising me not to complain he said youre not the one whos in jail will i get bail at court this morning wharton shook his head i doubt it not on a charge like this one look im sure if you could persuade the police to do a bit more digging around theyll come up with the real killer wharton leaned forward and rested his hands on the desk owen noticed the gold cufflinks flash in the light owen he said pausing for emphasis you still dont seem to realize the gravity of your situation you have been arrested for the most serious crime there is murder nobodys going to let you simply walk away whose side are you on wharton held his hand up let me finish as far as the police are concerned they have already got their man why would they waste their time looking for an alternative youll have to face up to the facts owen youve been arrested for murder youre being held in a week or two the crown prosecution service will start building a case against you and youre going to be tried in court i will do everything in my power to help you including engaging the services of the best barrister i can find to represent you but you must accept the situation do you understand me owen wasnt sure that he did but he nodded anyway good said wharton so what will happen in court whats the point of coming here if theyre only going to send me back to jail for remand theyll either grant it or release you as ive already said i wouldnt depend on the latter then theyll set a date for the preliminary hearing how long will i have to wait before that hmm its hard to say theres supposed to be a time limit of fiftysix days wharton gave a twisted smile unfortunately youre not the only alleged criminal in the system we get backlogs owen felt his chest tighten are you saying i could be in jail until february before i even get a preliminary hearing oh at least not in eastvale nick though no probably somewhere like armley and dont worry they know well enough to keep the other prisoners away from you everyone knows how moral criminals get when sex crimes are involved youll be isolated but dont worry about that now take things as they come owen one day at a time thats my advice ill be working for you never fear why didnt that thought comfort owen as much as it should have he wondered a clerk popped his head around the door time gentlemen wharton smiled and picked up his black leather briefcase come on then owen he said better gird up your loins iii the food arrived just after michelles remark about owen pierce trying to kill her and they kept silent as the waiter passed them the hot plates and refilled the baskets of bread it was after one oclock now michelle was going to be late back for work banks knew but she didnt seem to mind she clearly wanted to tell them the worst about owen pierce banks waited until they had all sampled their food and commented on its quality then went on there was something you said earlier about owen being fun at first then changing how did he change was that anything to do with what happened did he become violent no well not really violent not until the end that is the end the day i left him the night before rather if he wasnt violent before that then what was wrong how did he change he was just becoming impossible thats all badtempered complaining irrational jealous she paused and took a mouthful of her linguine following it with a sip of white wine did he have a violent temper michelle nodded her angel earrings danced he started developing one it got worse towards the end he just became so possessive so jealous hed fly into rages over nothing is that why you left him fear of violence susan cut in were you frightened hed hurt you michelle looked at susan no she said well not really it was frightening especially the last night buthow can i make you understand were listening susan watched banks nibble at his pizza out of the corner of her eye what happened will you tell us michelle gulped a little more wine looked at her then nodded when she spoke she looked back and forth between the two of them all right yes id been out late with a friend owen was waiting up for me and hed been drinking did he usually drink much banks asked michelle speared some linguine and twisted it on her fork no not usually though he had been doing more lately especially if he was brooding about something which he always seemed to be anyway i could definitely smell the whisky on his breath that night banks sipped his red wine it tasted watery had you been drinking much too he asked only a couple of glasses of wine banks nodded what happened next he started calling me terrible names and accusing me of all kinds of disgusting things and then hehe he what michelle oh bugger it get it out michelle she took a deep breath and rubbed the back of her hand across her eyes he tried to force himself on me thats what he did he tried to rape you yes he tried to rape me she wasnt crying but her eyes glittered with anger was this the first time he had ever tried such a thing of course it was do you think id willingly stay a moment longer than i had to with anyone who did that to me she hadnt finished her meal but she pushed her plate aside and sipped some more wine i dont know what your situation was banks said sometimes people women especially get stuck in abusive situations they dont know what to do yes well not me im not like that oh id done my best tried to please him given in to hisbut it was getting impossible i was at my wits end his demands were getting too much for me this was the last straw and i was especially upset by the names he called me and the dirty things he accused me of so you resisted him yes i thought it was awful that someone would say such horrible things to me call me such vile names and then want to do it to meyou knowlike animals did you struggle michelle nodded then what happened its not very clear after that i know he hit me at least once and then everything went dark he hit you when you refused to have sex with him yes i just remember falling and my head hurting and everything going dark fori dont knowmaybe only a few seconds what happened next i felt his hands around my neck owen was trying to strangle you yes he had his hands on my throat and he was pressing how did you stop him i didnt i hadnt the strength i must have passed out again then what i woke up it was light early morning and i was still on the floor where id fallen i felt all stiff and my head hurt my clothes were torn i had an awful headache where was owen he was in bed asleep or passed out i heard him snoring and went to look had he interfered with you sexually in any way yes i think hed had sex with me you cant be certain no i wasnt conscious but im pretty sure he had how did you know she looked directly at banks he couldnt detect any strong emotion in her eyes now despite the events she was relating she wasnt exactly being cold and clinical about it all but she wasnt overly agitated either the few remaining diners would never have guessed what horrors the trio near the window were talking about a woman can tell about those things she said then she turned to susan i felt soreyou knowdown there susan nodded and touched her arm banks finished his pizza and looked around to see if anyone was smoking miraculously one or two people were the restaurant had quietened down a lot and when banks beckoned the waiter to bring him an ashtray he did what did you do next banks asked michelle i packed up my things what little i had and i left where did you go i just walked and walked i had nowhere to go at least it was summer and it wasnt raining i remember sleeping in the sun in a park and that night i tried to sleep at the railway station but the police kept moving me on i went in shop doorways wherever i could find shelter i was scared and the next day i swallowed my pride went back to my parents and faced the music a month later i got the job down here what did you tell them susan asked i couldnt tell them the truth could i i was too ashamed i couldnt tell anyone that i made up a story about just not you know being happy with owen and they believed it it was what they wanted to hear theyd only met him once and didnt like him anyway thought he was too old for me all i had to do was tell them what they wanted to hear and eat enough crow they always believed what i told them why didnt you report the incident to the police banks asked i told you i was too ashamed im sure detective constable gay will understand that susan nodded yes oh i know what i should have done michelle went on especially now after whats happened to that poor schoolgirl in a way i feel terribly guilty almost responsible but you cant really predict what a person will do can you how far he will go i knew owen was a bit unbalanced that he could be dangerous i should have known just how dangerous and i should have reported him to the police but i was scared she looked at susan again and id heard such awful things about what they do you know in court to girls who make such complaints how they make out youre the guilty one that youre just a slut and how they get all sorts of doctors andii just didnt think i could go through with it i mean i was living with owen wasnt i and i had given in to him willingly before what would they have said about that theyd have said i led him on thats what the courts arent so easy on rapists these days michelle said susan it wouldnt have been like that but how was i to know was that the only reason you didnt report the incident banks asked fear of the police and the courts well mostly but there was owen too wasnt there i mean after someones done something like that to you something violent you have to wonder dont you whether theyre capable of anything you hear about men stalking women and all the things they do to them i was ashamed but i was scared as well scared of what he might do she looked at her watch my god its after two she said look i really must go now mr littlewood is only liberal to a degree in the light of what youve just told us banks said wed like to get a full statement from you we can do it after youve finished work this evening if youve got no objection michelle bit her lip and thought for moment no she said ive got no objection yes lets do it lets get it over with i finish at fivethirty well be waiting they watched her go then banks lit another cigarette and they each ordered a cappuccino well said banks it looks like were stuck in the big city for the afternoon want to see the crown jewels maybe tour the black museum or we could always do some early christmas shopping susan laughed no thanks sir perhaps we could give phil richmond a call at the yard he might be able to sneak away for an hour or so all right said banks why dont you phone him yes sir got a tenpee piece iv armley jail loomed ahead like a medieval fortress owen could only see part of it through the mesh window between himself and the vans driver but he knew the building well enough hed seen it many times when he was at leeds university standing on a hill to the west of the city center it was an enormous sprawling victorian edifice of black granite complete with battlements and towers and newer sections that seemed constantly under construction the place was practically a tourist attraction they had kept peter sutcliffe the yorkshire ripper on remand there for a while in at least the van driver had a sense of humor elvis presley belted out jailhouse rock as the van passed through the huge gates with its load of prisoners shackled in heavy cuffs owen wondered if he did that every trip the way tour guides always made the same jokes in a lowceilinged reception room the cuffs were removed and owen found himself signed over from the police to the jailers he might easily have been a cow or pig sold at market next he was given a number he made no attempt to memorize then after his belongings had been catalogued and placed in a box much as in the charge room at the police station he was taken to a cubicle and stripsearched after that the governor explained that as owen was regarded as a category a inmate he would spend twentythree and a half out of twentyfour hours alone in his cell the other halfhour being set aside for supervised exercise he would be allowed to purchase as many cigarettes as he wantednot that this appealed to owen at alland given access to writing paper and books the whole thing reminded owen of the scene from kubricks film a clockwork orange where alex is inducted into jail this room had the same gray inhuman feel a perfect setting for humiliation he was now a number no longer a man after a cursory medical ever suffered from palpitations shortness of breath no doubt required to protect the authorities should he drop dead tonight in his cell he was ordered to take a bath in about six inches of lukewarm water the tub was an old victorian model with stained sides and claw feet when he had dried off he was given his prison uniform brown trousers and a blue striped shirt that felt coarse and scratchy next to his skin after this he was handed his equally rough bedding and escorted to his cell it was in a special wing of the prison with black metal stairs and catwalks like something out of an mc escher print the walls were covered in flecked institutionalgreen paint and high ceilings echoed every footstep his cell was slightly larger than the one in eastvale police station but a lot more gloomy the whitewashed walls had turned gray with age and dirt the floor was cold stone the only window stood high in the wall about as big as a handkerchief it seemed to be made of reinforced glass light shone from a low wattage bulb hanging from a ceiling outlet the shade was covered by wire mesh though a washstand soap and a towel stood in the corner behind the door there was no toilet looking around owen located a bucket and some toilet paper beside his bed one added feature was the table and chair they were so small that he could hardly get his knees underneath comfortably the scored table was a bit rickety but a couple of sheets of toilet paper folded and wadded beneath one of the legs soon fixed that he had asked for paper and books from the prison libraryscience fiction if possible to let him escape at least in mind from his dreary surroundings scifi had been a passion during his adolescence though he hadnt read any since now curiously he felt an urge to start reading it again wharton would also be bringing him his walkman and a few cassettes as soon as possible he paced for a while then tried to take approximate measure of his cell he concluded that it was about eight feet by ten next he slouched on his hard narrow mattress and stared at the cracks on the ceiling he had expected to find days crossed off all over the walls just like he had seen in films but there were none there wasnt even a trace of graffiti a name scratched by fingernail to show who had been here last perhaps it had been the ripper himself owen shivered that was a foolish thought he told himself it was years ago that sutcliffe had been held here dozens of people must have been in and out since then stilla haunted cell that would just about make his day it was time to keep his imagination in check and take stock of his situation certainly he was aware of what could happen to him the worst case scenario as wharton had put it earlier that morning and that didnt bear thinking about wharton had already been right about the magistrates court the whole thing had been over in a couple of minutes and owen found himself on remand awaiting trial for the crime of murder so much for truth and justice what worried him most now were the practical things his job the house the fish his car wharton had taken his keys and said he would take care of things but stillhad anyone let the department at college know if so what had the chairman done it wouldnt be too difficult to share out his classes among his colleagues until a temporary lecturer could be brought in but what if this thing dragged on for months he didnt have tenure so the college could let him go whenever they felt like it if he lost his job because of this farce this absurd mistake he wondered if he could seek any kind of compensation the house would remain his as long as his bank account could stand the strain of the standing payment order for his mortgage and that should be long enough after all he had been making fairly decent money for some time and had very little in the way of expenses he hoped that his neighbor ivor who also had a key would take good care of the fish the sound of footsteps disturbed his train of thought then he heard the key turn in the lock it was mealtime already the warder had also brought him a felttipped pen writing pad and envelopes a surprisingly wellthumbed copy of wordsworths collected poems and isaac asimovs foundation trilogy when he had finished his meal and the door closed again behind the warder owen picked up the pen and sat at the desk he had noone to write to but he could certainly pass time on a journal of his experiences and impressions maybe someday someone would want to publish it fiftysix days or longer wharton had said well there was nothing he could do about it was there so he might as well just get used to it chapter i the offices of the eastvale crown prosecution service were located on the top floor of a drafty old threestory building on north market street straddling two shops between the community center and the town hall the lower floor was taken up by a clothes boutique catering to oversize people and a shop that sold imported belgian chocolate somewhere else in the building a dentist had managed to squeeze in his surgery sometimes you could hear the drill while discussing a case the chief cps lawyer assigned to the pierce file was stafford oakes a shabby little fellow with elbow patches greasy hair a sharp nose and eagle eyes banks had worked with oakes before on a number of occasions and had developed great respect for him banks was with di stott and beside oakes sat denise campbell his colleague whose expensive and stylish designer clothes stood in stark contrast to oakess offthepeg bargain items denise was an attractive and ambitious young lawyer with short black hair and pale skin banks had never once seen her smile and she seemed far too stiff prim and proper for her age in general the police were wary of the cps because of its negative attitude towards bringing cases to court and indeed banks had had more than one argument with oakes on this subject on the whole though oakes was a fair man and he didnt usuallylike so many crown prosecutorsdo more damage to the case than the defense did banks had even had a pint with him on a couple of occasions and swapped stories of life in the trenches of london where they had both spent time oakess office was as untidy as the man himself briefs and files all over the place many of them bore his trademarklinked coffeerings like the olympic games symbolfor oakes was a caffeine addict and didnt care where he rested his mug today it sat on top of the postmortem report on deborah harrison it was already only a couple of weeks before christmas more than two weeks since they had first consulted by telephone dna tests had confirmed that it was indeed deborahs blood on owens anorak and owens tissue under her fingernail banks had sent over all the witness statements and forensic test results collected in the initial case file owen pierces defense team would also have copies of them by now i like this oakes was saying tapping the footthick heap of files on his desk i particularly like this dna analysis something i can really get my teeth into no confession you say no banks answered good he slurped some coffee nothing but trouble confessions if you ask me youre better off without them what do you think denise weve had some success with confessions limited ill admit as often as not theyll retract say the police falsified it or beat it out of them she gave banks a stern look but even scientific evidence isnt entirely problemfree depends very much on how it was gathered and whos presenting it oh i know that said oakes waving his hand in the air remember that dithering twit in the innes case we did in richmond he looked at banks and stott and rolled his eyes open and shut or should have been simple matter of bloodstains by the time the defense had finished with this chap he was a nervous wreck not even sure any more that two and two made four but what i mean is a good solid case rests on facts like dna thats what judges like and thats what juries like facts indisputable beautiful facts am i right denise denise campbell nodded now oakes went on after another slug of coffee i trust that mr pierce gave his permission for the blood and hair samples to be taken yes said banks they were taken by a registered police surgeon you should have copies of the signed consent forms oakes frowned and dug around deeper in the pile ah yes he muttered pulling out a few coffeeringed sheets here they are good good and i trust his anorak was legally obtained in the first place banks looked at stott who said yes he gave us his permission to take it in for tests and we gave him a receipt but you didnt go into his home with a search warrant no said stott at that stage in our inquiries we merely wanted to talk to mr pierce then when i saw the orange anorak having heard descriptions of a man in a similar orange anorak in the vicinity of the crime scene i took the initiative and oakes flapped his hand again yes yes yes inspector all right youre not giving evidence in court spare me the formalities its a bit flimsy but itll have to do stott sat stiffly in his chair redfaced mouth tight banks couldnt resist a smile it was the new lads first taste of stafford oakes oakes went on thumbing through the pile on his desk good stuff most of this he said dna hair blood analysis good stuff cant understand a word of it myself of course but get the right man in the box and wed even be able to sell it to your average sun reader thats the key you know plain language without talking down he put a thick wad of papers aside and flapped a few statements in the air and this he went on not so bad either your vicar whats his namedaniel chartersplaces our man on the bridge around the right time he touched his index finger to the side of his nose must say though banks theres a hint of moral turpitude about the fellow daniel charters was accused of making a homosexual advance to a church worker said banks a croatian refugee called ive jelačić who was also a suspect in this case until we turned up pierce if its of any interest i dont believe charters did it doesnt matter what you believe does it denise no said denise see my learned colleague agrees no what matters banks is what the jury believes vicar with a whiff of scandal lingering around the dogcollar like a particularly virulent fart he shook his head and tuttutted now there they say to themselves goes a true hypocrite a man who preaches the virtue of chastity a man who belongs to a church that wont even ordain homosexual ministers caught with his hand up the choirboys surplice so to speak well you see what i mean its tabloid scandalsheet material thats what it is the point is academic anyway banks said as owen pierce openly admits to being on the bridge at the time ahhah said oakes raising a finger i wouldnt take too much notice of that its about as useful as a confession and remember thats what he said before he talked to his solicitor a lot can change between now and the trial believe me we need as much evidence as we can get charters isnt the only one who can place pierce on the bridge around the right time deborahs friend megan preece saw him too oakes shook his head ive read her statement shes not entirely sure it was him damn good thing too nothing worse than children in the box oh well use your vicar dont worry about that just playing devils advocate have to anticipate all eventualities he glanced at more statements the landlord of the nags head places pierce in the pub a short while before too i see hes reliable i suppose banks looked at stott again well the latter said stiffly he seems a bit slow to me but given that it wasnt a busy night and pierce seems to have been about his only customer i think we can rely on him yes good and whats this other place now ah the peking moon a chinese restaurant he wrinkled his nose chinaman i suppose born and bred in whitechapel said stott chinaman with a cockney accent then yes oakes shook his head juries dont like chinamen dont trust them still think of the old fu manchu image you know inscrutable yellow peril and all that dont go for it myself but you cant seem to get these racist attitudes out of peoples minds as quickly as youd like and you certainly cant legislate them away still well do our best bright fellow is he hes very articulate said stott good thatll help unless he seems too bright of course juries dont like people who come across as being too clever especially foreigners they expect it of the boffins of course but not of your commonorgarden sort of restaurateur well cant be helped he got up and refilled his coffee mug from the machine on the filing cabinet now what really bothers me he went on is this other stuff here he reached into the pile again and pulled out more papers you took a statement from a woman called michelle chappel an exgirlfriend of pierces its all above board of course but the whole issues dodgy he clicked his tongue and rested his hand on the papers as if ready to swear on the bible dodgy in the extreme in what way asked banks oakes sat back in his chair linked his hands behind his head and quoted at the cracked ceiling a trial judge in a criminal trial has always a discretion to refuse to admit evidence if in his opinion its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value lord diplock regina v sang and do you think this is the case with michelle chappels statement banks asked im saying it could be a problem there should be excluded from the jury information about the accused which is likely to have an influence on their minds prejudicial to the accused which is out of proportion to the true probative value of admissible evidence conveying that information same source and it usually relates to evidence of similar fact youre implying here by trying to introduce the womans statement as evidence that pierce was just the kind of person who would commit such a crime freudian mumbojumbo and juries dont like it except on television and more to the point a lot of judges dont like it either banks shrugged im aware of the similar fact rule he said but what were trying to establish here is a history of violence against women and theres a marked physical similarity between the two victims were trying to get at a motive oakess eyebrows shot up ah yes thats all very well and good banks but then youre an imaginative sort of chap kind who reads a lot of fiction arent you if you understand the problem of similar fact evidence then you must see that what youre doing is saying that pierce was the sort of person who would commit such a crime because he once acted in a way similar to the perpetrator of the crime under consideration and whats more its an unreported crime based purely on the evidence of a woman who no doubt despises the man for rejecting her he tuttutted again and drank some coffee still he mused stranger things have happened so whats your conclusion banks asked my conclusion he slapped the stack of coffeestained files oh well give it a try why not at worst her evidence can only be declared inadmissible he chuckled it used to be that the definition of inadmissible evidence was anything that might help the defense that was in the good old days sometimes depending on the judge you can get a bit of leeway on these matters especially in a case as serious as this one ive seen similar fact evidence admitted more than once what the rule actually states is that the mere fact that the accused has previously acted in a similar way to the crime he is standing trial for is not relevant however if theres a very close similarity something that links the two events in a convincing way as part of a whole system of actions an emerging pattern so much so that it becomes more than a matter of mere coincidence then such evidence may be admissible do you follow me i think so said banks if we attempt to show that the two assaults are part of such a pattern oakes continued then we might just be able to squeeze it in depending on the judge of course have you got a psychologist you can consult on this what about that young woman ive seen you with in the queens arms pretty young thing redhead isnt she a psychologist jenny fuller thats the one yes but jennys still teaching in america she wont be back until after christmas thatll do fine no hurry dear boy no hurry weve got enough for committal already just need something to beef up the admissibility quotient if we can are you going to prosecute then oakes drank more coffee looked at the papers and sniffed a few times oh i think so he said after what seemed like an eternity then he nodded yes yes i think weve got a good case what about you denise denise campbell nodded lets nail the bastard she said then she blushed and put her hand over her mouth as if she had just burped ii owens committal proceeding occurred in early february the whole affair was about as exciting as a damp squib more reminiscent of a college faculty meeting than an affair at which grave matters were decided nobody was even wearing wigs and robes he appeared before three jps one bitter cold morning and on whartons advice they heard the newstyle committal that is they read all the prosecutions statements and the defense offered no case it was basically committal by consent and just as wharton had guaranteed the jps agreed there was prima facie case and owen was bound over for trial in the crown court a trial date was set for late march there were a few spectators in court and owens name was now known to the general public but only the charges and bare details were made known to the press not the actual evidence luckily owen had quickly got used to the monotony of prison routine lights on slop out lights out sleep after the first few weeks he had lost track of time he was allowed out of his cell only to exercise in the dreary yard for half an hour each day he hardly saw another soul there but for his guards and it was no pleasure walking around in circles alone the food reminded him of school dinners breadandbutter pudding gray leathery beef lumpy custard spam fritters usually he left most of it even so he felt constipated most of the time the cells around him were all occupied at night he heard voices even crying sometimes and one evening the person in the next cell tried to strike up a conversation asking him what hed done but owen didnt answer what could the man possibly want to talk about compare notes on rape and mutilation mostly he listened to the tapes wharton brought him and read poetry and science fiction he had wordsworth almost by heart after the first month every few days for some unknown reason the prison authorities played musical cells with him only the smells were different one place had a mattress acrid with spilled semen one of the washstands seemed to breathe vomit fumes from its depths but maybe that was his imagination the predominating odor was of disinfectant and slops in one cell he discovered in the middle of night that there was no chamber pot or bucket he called a warder who told him to piss on the floor he pissed down the sink that wasnt his imagination as time went on it was the little things that began to get him down the rough feel of his prison clothes the lack of cooking or teamaking facilities the lousy coffee the dreadful food the more he thought about them the less petty they seemed these were the essential parts of the tapestry of his liberty things he took for granted normally now he had no access to them they assumed greater importance in his mind it was all relative of course for a starving child in an ethiopian village for example prison food would be a luxury and freedom might simply be defined as the hour or twos relief from the agony of hunger when people are starving they have no true freedom but for someone like owenmiddleclass reasonably welloff welleducated living in englandfreedom was made up of myriad things some more abstract than others but it all came down to having a choice locked in his small lonely cell once again owen actually felt relieved to be left alone at last to be shut away from the bureaucrats the reporters and the women who stared at him with such naked hatred in their eyes he was protected here from the crowds outside eager for his blood and from the policemen so anxious to rip off the surface of his life and dig their hands deep into the slimy darkness below his cell was the only place he felt safe now its routine and isolation sheltered him from the malevolent absurdity of the world outside iii jenny fuller dashed into the queens arms ten minutes late shucked off her black overcoat and folded it carefully over the back of the adjacent chair she gave her head a shake to toss back her mass of flamecolored hair then sat down and patted her chest out of breath sorry im late are we on expenses dr jennifer fuller was a lecturer in psychology at the university of york and over the years her focus had shifted towards criminal and deviant psychology now she had even started publishing in the field and was quickly making a name for herself hence the summer in america banks had worked with her on several cases before and an initial attraction had transformed into an enduring friendship that delighted and surprised both of them banks laughed afraid not pity i was getting sort of used to that in america everyones on expenses there let me buy the first one at least how kind ill have a small brandy please to take the chill off and to eat chicken in a basket on his way to the bar banks recognized one or two of the local shopowners and the manager of the natwest bank on his lunchbreak cyril had also got the coal fire going nicely the closest table to it was already taken by a group of ramblers in hiking boots and waterproof gear so banks and jenny sat off to one side near the window rain spattered the red and amber diamonds and blurred the clear panes along with the drinks banks ordered jennys chicken and scampi and chips for himself jenny rubbed her hands together and gave a mock shiver when banks came back with the drinks then she picked up her small glass and said cheers they clinked glasses have a good christmas the usual my parents for christmas eve sandras for christmas day and boxing day and how is sandra shes fine jenny took another sip of brandy so she said i see youve got your man under lock and key another notch in your truncheon banks nodded it looks that way i take it thats what you do want to pick my brains about and this isnt just a ruse to secure the pleasure of my company banks smiled yes to the first not that id be averse to the latter stop it you sweet man youll make the lady blush how can i help banks lit a cigarette i dont know if you can or if you will rather just listen first of all and tell me if im going way off the tracks jenny nodded okay banks told her what they knew about owen pierce and michelle chappel stressing owens reluctance to admit to knowing michelle her resemblance to deborah harrison and what she said owen had done to her when he had finished jenny sat quietly for a moment sucking her lower lip and thinking banks sipped some beer and said ive been trying to work up some sort of psychological scenario for this crime owen pierce had means and opportunity and the dna evidence is pretty damning i suppose im looking for a motive you should know by now that you dont always get one with crimes like this alan motiveless stranger killings at least not what you or i would regard as a logical or even a reasonable motive like anger or revenge true but bear with me jenny say hes upset about the girl michelle angry at her he goes for a walk and there out of the fog this vision appears michelle well maybe not exactly michelle but an approximation a younger model more innocent perhaps more vulnerable less threatening so he follows her into the graveyard approaches her she says something and sparks his anger hes already been violent towards michelle remember so theres a precedent does it make sense jenny frowned it could do she said sometimes we act out we behave towards people as if they were someone else its called displacement an unconscious defense mechanism where emotions or ideas are transferred from one object or person to another that seems less threatening i think freud defined it as one of the neuroses but my freuds a bit rusty at the moment what youre asking is whether i think owen pierce could have displaced his feelings for michelle to deborah because of some vague superficial resemblance and because of his mental state at the time all right that too and that this led him to kill her really he was killing michelle yes what do you think i think youve got a point or the beginnings of one you dont think im way off beam not at all their food came how about another drink to wash this down please i never argue when a woman wants to buy me a drink banks watched jenny walk to the bar she moved well and had a superb figure long legs narrow waist and a bum like two plums in a wet paper bag she had a new energy and confidence in her stride too and it looked as if the summer in california had done her good she was wearing tight black jeans and a jadegreen jacket made of raw silk over a white shirt judging by the cut and the material of the jacket the way it narrowed at her waist and flared slightly over the swell of her hips it had probably cost her a small fortune on rodeo drive or some such place but jenny always had liked nice clothes banks noticed her exchange a few words with a young man who looked like a trainee bank manager while she waited for cyril to pour the pint poor fellow banks thought he didnt stand a chance but jenny was smiling why did he feel a pang of jealousy when he saw her flirt with another man even to this day she came back with a pint of bitter for banks and a campari and soda for herself he thanked her making a date he said nodding towards the man jenny laughed what do you think i am a cradlesnatcher besides hes not my type jenny was thirtyfive in december the young man about twentyfour as yet banks knew jenny hadnt quite figured out what her type was when jenny smiled her green eyes lit up and the lines around them crinkled into a map of her humor her tan brought out the freckles across her nose and cheeks how was california he asked all sun and surf just like baywatch really she wrinkled her nose no not really youd hate it she said cant smoke anywhere and they call it the garden of eden is that where you developed a taste for fried chicken not at all ive always had a weakness for lean relatively fatfree meat deepfried in batter and cholesterol it appeases both conflicting sides of my nature she sliced off a chunk of deepfried chicken breast and popped it in her mouth banks laughed they finished their meals in silence then banks lit a cigarette and said back to pierce look i know im putting you on the spot jenny but id like you to work something up for the cps like what the kind of thing we were talking about displacement for example tell me more jenny sipped her campari and soda banks still had half a pint left and he wasnt allowing himself another drink this lunchtime okay jenny said lets say that he has poor control over his anger its pretty much a commonplace that people often respond to frustration by getting angry and if their anger is really intense and their inner controls are weakened even furthersay by alcohol or tirednessthen it can result in physical assault even murder that seems to be what happened with michelle but what about deborah had he been drinking hed had two pints and a whisky okay lets say then that we are dealing with displacement which is a coping pattern a defense mechanism if you like defense against what stress basically if a situation really threatens your sense of adequacy your ego your selfesteem then your reactions become defenseoriented you defend your self from devaluation how any number of ways denial rationalization fantasy repression things we all do what it basically comes down to is ridding yourself of the anxiety and the tensions that are causing the pain sexual tension could be but thats just one kind and displacement is one of these defense mechanisms yes you shift the strong feelings you have from the person or object towards which they were originally intended to another person or object often very difficult emotions are involved like hostility and anxiety its an unconscious process are you suggesting he wasnt responsible interesting point but i dont think so i dont know exactly what the law is but im not saying a person suffering displacement isnt responsible for his actions especially violent ones just that he might not know the inner processes that are leading him to want to do what he does which you can probably say for most of us most of the time yes in less extreme ways okay go on displacement is often combined with projection where you put the blame for your own problems on someone else or some group women could be in extreme cases it leads to a form of paranoia people become convinced that forces or groups are working against them he could have formed such a projection of his anxieties and hostilities against women in general plenty of men do that frenchcanadian who shot all those women at the college in montreal for example and could he also have displaced his hostile feelings for michelle onto deborah given the stress of the anniversary the effect of alcohol and the resemblance between the two women possibly yes theres a study by a psychologist called masserman done in where he manages to show that under sustained frustration people become more willing to accept substitute goals deborah for michelle yes look im a bit rusty on this ill need a few days to come up with something how about next week jenny smiled ill see what i can do if theres anything else you want to know give me a call can you get copies of the statements to me no problem okay now i really must go she stood up and reached for her raincoat then she leaned forward and gave banks a quick peck on the cheek when she had gone he lit another cigarette vowing it would be his last for the day and contemplated the remains of his pint another half wouldnt do any harm he decided so he went and got one pouring it into the pint glass because he didnt like drinking beer from small glasses iv one afternoon about three or four weeks after his committalhe was losing track of timeowen was taken from his cell to a prison interview room where he met for the first time the barrister gordon wharton had engaged to lead his defense in her early forties owen guessed shirley castle qc was an attractive woman by any standards she was also the first woman he had seen since his trip to the magistrates court she had glossy dark hair that fell over her shoulders and framed a pale oval face her almondshaped eyes were a peculiar shade of violet so unusual that owen wondered if she were wearing tinted contact lenses she had on a gray pleated skirt and a pale pink blouse buttoned up to her chin her perfume smelled subtle and expensive wharton sat beside her with a smug proprietorial air about him basking in the glory of her presence as if to say just look who ive got for you my boy what a treat shirley castle took the cap off her montblanc fountainpen shuffled some papers in front of her and began it doesnt look very good owen she said i dont want to give you any false hopes or illusions well have an uphill struggle on our hands with this one but all theyve got is circumstantial evidence she looked at him the point is that they can build a very good case on that look at it this way she started to count off the points on her long fingers one you had the opportunity two motive in such crimes is so obscure to say the least that they dont really need to establish one and three theres the dna hairs and blood but i can explain it all i have done i never denied being in the area from the start and i told them the girl bumped into me maybe thats how the hair and blood were exchanged maybe but the police dont believe you she said and quite frankly i dont blame them especially given that you only came up with that explanation at the eleventh hour no owen im afraid were going to have to fight tooth and nail for this one are they still looking for the real murderer why should they they think theyve already got him so theres nobody out there trying to prove my innocence im afraid not cant you employ a private detective or someone shirley castle laughed it was a lighter frothier more vivacious sound than he would have imagined given her overall gravity but it was a nervous laugh no doubt about that to do what she asked find the real murderer prove me innocent things dont work quite like that well how do they work she leaned back in her chair and frowned we go to court and we give them the best fight we can theres no other way its only on perry mason that the lawyer and the private eye get out on the mean streets and track down the real killer just let me tell them my story im sure theyll believe me im not sure yet if im going to put you in the witness box at all why not shirley castle frowned crossexaminations can be really tough is something bothering you yes as a matter of fact it is the cps file suggests an approach to the case that involves similar fact to try and establish a motive for the murder too but you said they didnt need one their case will be all that much stronger if they can come up with one what are they saying shirley castle rested her chin in her hand tell me about michelle chappel owen owen swallowed his mouth felt dry what about her about your relationship and why you lied to the police about the nude photographs denied you knew her you didnt want them to find her and talk to her did you no i cant say i did michellewell lets say we parted on bad terms shed have nothing good to say about me as i understand it there was violence perhaps attempted murder thats absurd have you talked to her no she said the police have ive just been reviewing the statement and its very interesting read for yourself she dropped a sheaf of papers in front of him owen felt rising panic as he read the transcript of the taped interview with michelle q miss chappel could you tell us how and when you first met mr pierce a yes in class he was my teacher i was his student q how old were you at the time a seventeen q was this at eastvale college of further education a yes q how old was owen pierce when you met a thirtytwo thirtythree im not exactly sure q so he was almost old enough to be your father a technically i suppose a sixteenyearold could be a father q did you live at home a yes until i was eighteen q where did you go then a i moved in with owen q how long did you live with him a five years q how did mr pierce approach you a he suggested a coffee after class one day then he asked me out to dinner q were your marks good a yes q did you start seeing one another regularly a yes we went out together a few times for dinner to the pictures or for a drink sometimes he took me out for a ride in the country in his car and wed find a little village pub somewhere q how soon did you become lovers a very soon after we first went out q weeks days a days q and the relationship went well after you moved in with him a at first it did yes look i mean you have to realize i was very young a bit of a misfit too i suppose i wasnt very happy at home and i didnt really have any close friends i found most people my own age immature i was also very shy and owen was nice to me i suppose i was flattered too by the attention when i talked about leaving home he asked if id like to move in with him and it seemed like a good idea i felt safe with him q were you still his student when you moved in with him a i was in his business communications class yes q did you continue to do well in that course a very well q deservedly a i think so look im not stupid but i also admit it may have helped sleeping with my teacher q do you think there was a price to pay for your success a what do you mean q did owen ever suggest or attempt to commit any unnatural acts a do you mean was he kinky q something like that a no i wouldnt say that i mean he liked me to wear certain underclothes you know black silky things thigh stockings skimpy things he liked me to keep them on when weyou know q during intercourse a yes q was that all a all was what all q the skimpy clothes did he ever make you do anything you didnt want to a he wanted to do it to me from behind like dogs i didnt like that q but did you do as he wished a well iyes at first i did i wanted to please him q because you were worried about your marks a a bit i suppose q did he show any interest in pornography a we watched a dirty video once you know the sort of thing i didnt really enjoy it in fact i thought it was dead gross but it seemed to turn him on q how did he behave when you were watching the video a well he was you know maybe a bit more ardent than usual he wanted to try out things they were doing you know on the video q against your will a no but i thought it was a bit weird q did he ever resort to violence for the purpose of sexual stimulation a he used to like to tie me up sometimes q how did you react to this a what could i do he was stronger than me i wanted to please him it was uncomfortable and it frightened me a bit but it didnt really hurt it was just a game really it was something hed seen in that silly film and it turned him on q did he beat you at all flagellation a no q so apart from the tying up he wasnt violent a nonot until the end then living with him became sort of like being in prison every time i went out i had to account for my movements some nights he wouldnt even let me go out q how did he keep you in a he just made such a fuss it wasnt worth it i felt shut in always under observation i couldnt breathe i was frightened of his temper i started rebelling in small ways like seeing other friends and stuff and it made him more and more possessive q is that why you left him fear of violence a partlyit was frightening especially the last night but q can you tell us about that last night michelle michelle went on to tell about the night she claimed owen had raped and tried to strangle her pale owen shoved the papers aside and looked at shirley castle well she asked what do you think of it owen shook his head slowly i dont know what to say its not true then some of it maybe but she even makes the truth sound different sound bad for me the way she slants it in what way every way the sex for example she makes me sound like a pervert but most of it was her idea she loved it the tying up the talking dirty it really got her going and she liked the video did you hit her that last night i pushed her i was protecting myself she was berserk out of control shed have killed me if i hadnt pushed her away and she hit her head as she fell yes knocking her unconscious yes butoh god owen held his head in his hands i know how it sounds but ive never hurt anyone in my life never on purpose did you have sex with her after shed knocked herself out no i didnt thats a lie what do you take me for im just trying to get at the truth owen did you try to force her to have sex at any time that evening no i mean yes no i didnt try to force her but i suggested it i just wanted to see how she would react it was a test i didnt force her shirley frowned you made advances im afraid i dont understand you owen youll have to explain it to me how could he tell her about that night still vivid in his mind it was like watching a cartoon play the gaudy colors the exaggerated violence the sense of being a spectator unable to stop the film unable even to walk out of the cinema how did it start owen owen tried to explain he had grown suspicious of michelle over the last year or so he said suspected that she was seeing another man or other men that night when she said she was going to meet a girlfriend he followed her into eastvale town center and watched her meet someone in a pub as they talked and drank rubbing close together owen sat shielded by a frostedglass partition and watched the shadows at closing time he followed them to a house not far from his own and watched outside as the bedroom light went on then the curtains closed and someone turned out the light he went home and paced and drank whisky until michelle got in after twothirty in the morning instead of challenging her immediately with what hed found out he made sexual advances to see how she would react she pushed him away and told him she was too tired listening to her girlfriends tales of woe till so late he could smell the other man on her the stale beer and smoke on her clothes in her hair mingled with the reek of sex she hadnt even had the decency to take a shower afterwards then he told her what hed seen what he had watched she went wild flew at him screamed that he didnt own her and if he was no good in bed she had every damn right to find someone who was it was like watching another person emerge from the shell of someone you thought you knew he called her a bitch a whore told her he knew shed been at it all the time theyd been together that she had just used him had never really loved him for a moment she paused in her attack and a different look came into her eyes hard cold hatred she picked up a pair of scissors from the table and lunged at him he grabbed her hand and twisted until she dropped them then she renewed the attack kicking scratching flailing out wildly he held his hands in front of his face to ward off the blows and tried to talk her down but she wouldnt stop finally out of desperation he pushed her away just to give himself some space to maneuver and she fell over and hit her head on the chair leg he tried to tell shirley castle all this as calmly as he could he knew it sounded thin without the whole background of the relationship from the early innocence to the bitter knowledge that it had all been a lie what he couldnt tell her though what he hardly dare even admit to himself was that after michelle had fallen on the floor arms spread out one leg crooked over the other he had wanted her hating her even then he had torn at her clothing then halfmad with jealousy and hatred had put his hands around her throat and wanted to choke the life out of her for what she had done to him for ruining for defiling what he had thought was the love of a lifetime he hated himself for wanting her and he hated her for making him at that moment the full power of his love turned to hate and overwhelmed him and he knew that everything her words her gestures her lovemaking her promises had all been a lie but he let go he couldnt kill her he stood up steadied himself and went to collapse on the bed she was still breathing there was no blood he hadnt raped her in the morning he found her sulking in the spare room nursing the bump on her head she tried to make up to him told him she would do anything he wantedanythingand started squirming around under the thin sheet it had always worked before but this time owen had had more than enough he knew that if he took her back if he lived with her for just one more day he would lose his selfrespect forever when he told her to go she screamed and begged but he threw her out in the street with only her suitcase the next thing he knew he got a letter with a swiss cottage address to send on the rest of her things he did so shirley castle let the silence stretch after his explanation owen couldnt read the way she looked at him he didnt know whether she believed him or not owen she said finally whatever the truth is michelles is a very damning statement you can imagine the case the crown is trying to build up a man obsessed with pornography especially if it features young girls capable of sexual violence against womenyou see my point but its not true owen argued none of it im not obsessed with pornography shirley held up her hand im not attacking you owen im simply trying to demonstrate the spin the prosecution will try and put on the facts given the chance owen laid his hands on the desk and stared at the veins in his wrists i dont know what you must think of me he said his voice hardly more than a whisper but i want you to know that im not the monster they say i am its a distortion if i knew only certain facts about your life or anyones if your fantasies were laid bare for all to seewell i might form a picture and it might be the wrong one do you know what i mean he could have sworn there was an amused glint in her eyes and perhaps a faint flush on her cheeks you dont need to please me owen she said im here as a professional its not my place to make judgments about your private life only to prove reasonable doubt you dont need to seek my approval but i want it owen said damn it i want it youre not a machine are you you must have opinions feelings shirley castle didnt answer instead she shuffled the papers back towards her briefcase and said theres one more important question before i go owen why would michelle do what she did why would she say all those things about you to the police if theyre not true what reason has she to want you to go to jail dont you understand michelles a user she used me from the start for her education her escape from her overbearing parents for her livingquarters the good life i was her passport through college she threw me a few crumbs and i took them for love even now i have a hard time believing that you can live with someone for so long and not really see them for what they are not know them at all but its true maybe i didnt want to see all the time she was with me she was going with other men and i admit i got jealous and possessive but she didnt care she thought she could get away with everything just take her clothes off for me and make it all right at heart shes a cold calculating monster she has no conscience do you understand sometimes its only when the final piece falls into place that you see there was ever a pattern at all that was what happened that last night the final piece shed been doing it all along lying to me seeing other men doing exactly what she wanted using my homeour homeas a squat i gave her all the freedom she wanted at first before i started to suspect the truth she was young after all how can you keep the love of a younger woman if you try to put her in a cage as soon as i became more vigilant the cracks started to appear shirley castle shook her head i can accept all that owen but it doesnt really answer my question why does she wish you so much harm why because i found her out owen answered remembering that one calm moment in the final battle when he had seen her for what she really was because i saw through her i saw her true face and because i rejected her i threw her out though she denied me the night before just after shed been with her boyfriend she offered me her body the next morning but i wouldnt take it she begged me to forgive her and let her stay but i threw her out she was like a spiteful child if she didnt get her own way she cant forgive me for seeing the truth and having the courage to throw her out before she dumped me shirley castle nodded slowly well owen thats all very well she said but wed just better hope for your sake that she doesnt get anywhere near the witnessbox chapter i wood creaked as those present in court got to their feet one rainy april day judge simmonds entered resplendent in scarlet moire and white linen he was a wizened old man with reptilian eyes buried deep in wrinkles and folds of flesh his face was expressionless as he looked around the courtroom before sitting the benches groaned as everyone in the crowded room sat down owen noticed that the courtroom smelled of the same lemonscented polish his mother used to use it made him feel sad the prisoner will stand so this was it owen stood is your name owen pierce asked the clerk of the court it is the clerk then read out the indictment and asked owen how he pleaded not guilty owen answered as firmly and confidently as he could manage with all eyes on him he scrutinized the jury as he spoke seven men and five women all dressed for a day at the office a pudgy man with a slack flabby jaw looked at him with something like awe a pursedlipped young woman wouldnt meet his eyes at all but looked down at her hands folded in her lap most of them at least glanced at him in passing some were nervous others looked as if they had already made up their minds it was irrational he knew but he decided to pick one of them to be his barometer throughout the trial one whose expressions he would chart to tell how the case was goingfor or against him not the frowning woman in the powderblue suit nor the balding chap who reminded him of his insurance agent not the conventionally pretty girl with the pageboy cut nor the burly wrestlertype with his brickred neck bulging out of his tight collar it was difficult to find someone at last he decided on a woman for some reason it had to be a woman she was in her late thirties he guessed with a moonshaped face and short mousy hair she had a wide red slash of a mouth and large eyes but it wasnt her physical appearance so much as her aura that caused him to pick her out for some reason he decided this woman was good and honest what was more she could tell the truth from lies at the moment she looked puzzled and confused to find herself in such a frightening role but she would he knew as soon as the trial progressed listen carefully weigh judge and decide her decision would be the right one and he would be able to tell from her expression what it was yes he would keep a close eye on her he would call her minerva almost before owen realized it jerome lawrence qc had launched into his opening address lawrence was a small darkcomplexioned man with beady restless black eyes and a perpetual fiveoclock shadow shiny as shoepolish on his cheeks and chin somehow he seemed to fit perfectly into his robes looking even more like a bat ready to flap its wings and take off into the night than anyone else in the room like shirley castle he spoke with his hands a lot and his robe swished about in a most distracting way the crown shall seek to prove lawrence said in his oiliest publicschool voice that the accused is guilty of the most heinous the most despicable brutal inhuman crime of allthe murder of a child an innocent a mere sixteenyearold girl with her whole life before her and for the rest of the day owen could only listen openmouthed to the depiction of himself as a barely human monster though the parade of witnesses began dramatically enough with rebecca charters tearfully recounting how she discovered deborah harrisons body several things became clear to him in the first days probably the first and foremost of these was that you could be bored even at your own murder trial witnesses came and went people he had never met people who didnt know him vicars shopkeepers teachers schoolgirls policemen pub landlords some of them seemed to spend hours in the box for no reason owen could think of jerome lawrence or shirley castle questioned most of them but sometimes their juniors took over with unfailing regularity one lawyer or another would raise points of law that meant the jury had to be sent out sometimes for hours and all sides seemed to like nothing better than the kind of delay that meant an early adjournment for the day also there were one or two days off due to illness of a jury member and another for a family bereavement every night without fail owen was shipped back to his little cell at armley jail he was becoming so used to it by now that he almost thought of it as home he had forgotten what his real home looked like as far as owen could tell things seemed to be going quite well over the first few weeks shirley castle made mincemeat of the policeman with the jugears for not explaining why he was visiting owen in the first place detective inspector stott came out looking like a member of the gestapo by the time detective chief inspector banks was called owen had lost track of the days ii in the same situation chief inspector do you think you would bother to mention everyone you saw on the streets during a certain period banks shrugged it was his second day giving evidence and shirley castle was crossexamining him i would hope i would do my duty and try to recall everything that happened around the crucial time he answered finally but you are a policeman chief inspector you have special training such facts and fine details are part of your job im sure i wouldnt even remember most of the people i passed in the street nor i imagine would most members of the jury and here shirley castle paused long enough to look over at the jury most of them seemed to agree with her banks thought yet you expect mr pierce to remember every face every detail she went on i ask you again chief inspector do you really think this is reasonable perhaps not on a busy thoroughfare at rush hour said banks but this was a foggy night in a quiet suburb yes i think i would remember if i had seen a particular person and mr pierce remembered as soon as thats enough chief inspector you have answered my question banks couldnt help but allow himself a slight feeling of satisfaction when he saw shirley castle reel from his answer she had made a small mistake she hadnt already known the answer to the question she asked she hurried on now as mr sung proprietor of the peking moon restaurant has already testified and as my learned friend brought out during his examinationinchief mr pierce used his credit card to pay for his meal there if the timing of events is correctand i stress ifthis would have occurred shortly after the murder of deborah harrison would it not yes now in your professional experience chief inspector would you not say that a criminal someone who has just committed an attack of the most vile and brutal kind would be a little more careful to cover his tracks most criminals arent that clever said banks thats why they get caught the members of the gallery laughed but my client is not stupid she went on ignoring the interruption it is hardly likely that he would go and eat chinese food and pay for it with a credit card after murdering someone now is it not to mention do it all wearing a bright orange anorak why would he be so foolish as to draw attention to himself in such an obvious way if he had committed the crime of which he is accused perhaps he was distraught banks answered not thinking clearly mr sung did say he was talking to not thinking clearly she repeated with exactly the right tone of disdain is it not a fact chief inspector that perpetrators of such random crimes are usually in fact thinking very clearly indeed that they rarely get caught unless by accident that they take great care to avoid discovery banks fiddled with his tie he hated having it fastened up and could only bear it if he kept the top button of his shirt undone there are certain schools would say that yes but a criminals behavior is not easily predictable if it were wed have an easier job on our hands he smiled at the jury one or two of them smiled back come on chief inspector banks you cant have it both ways either theyre stupid and easy to catch as you said earlier or theyre unpredictable and impossible to catch which is it some are stupid some are not as i said before murderers dont always act rationally this wasnt a rational crime theres no way of predicting what the killer would do or why he did things the way he did but arent you in the business of reconstructing crimes chief inspector nowadays we leave that to crimewatch laughter rose up from the gallery judge simmonds admonished banks for his flippancy my point is shirley castle went on without cracking a smile that you seem to know so very little of what went on in st marys graveyard or indeed of what kind of criminal youre dealing with isnt that true we know that deborah harrison was strangled with the strap of her school satchel and that her clothing was rearranged but isnt it true that you simply picked on the first person seen in the area whom you thought fit the bill that owen pierce was unfortunate enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time id say it was deborah harrison who was in the wrong place at the wrong time were there not certain elements of the crime scene that struck you as odd what elements shirley castle consulted her notes as i understand it she said the victims school satchel was open doesnt that strike you as odd it could have come open during the struggle hardly scoffed shirley castle it was fastened by two goodquality buckles weve tested it believe me and it wont open unless someone deliberately unfastens it perhaps the murderer wanted something from her like what chief inspector surely youre not suggesting robbery from a schoolgirls satchel its possible but i but what money could a schoolgirl have worth stealing i understand deborah harrison had six pounds in her purse when she was found if robbery were the motive why not take that too and wouldnt it make more sense to take the entire satchel why hang around the crime scene any longer than necessary which question do you want me to answer first shirley castle scowled why would deborah harrisons killer remain at the scene and go through her satchel rather than take it with him i dont know perhaps he was looking for a trophy of some kind something personal to the victim but was anything missing we dont know noone knew exact you dont know we have heard a great deal of evidence she went on placing mr pierce in the vicinity of st marys at the time of the crime but let me ask you this chief inspector did anyone actually see mr pierce enter st marys graveyard he was seen a simple yes or no will suffice banks was silent a moment then said no is it not also possible chief inspector that deborah went somewhere else first and returned to the graveyard later after mr pierce had gone to the peking moon its possible but and that deborah harrison was murdered by someone she knew perhaps because of something she was carrying in her satchel exactly what i thought at first banks agreed i think thats a rather farfetched explanation he said more farfetched than charging mr pierce here with murder she pointed at pierce theatrically while you were busy harassing my client did you pursue the investigation in other directions we continued with our inquiries and we didnt har she sniffed you continued with your inquiries what does that mean we tried to find out as much about the victim and her movements as possible we tried to discover through talking to friends and family if she had any enemies anyone who would want to kill her we collected all the trace evidence we could find and had it analyzed as quickly as possible we found nothing concrete until we came up with mr pierce and after mr pierces name came up banks knew that most investigations tend to wind down once the police think theyve got their man and much as he would have liked to pursue other possibilities there was other work to do and there was also chief constable riddle i continued other lines of inquiry until it became app you continued other lines of inquiry as soon as you first interviewed him you decided on mr pierces guilt didnt you objection sustained ms castle please stop insulting the witness shirley castle bowed my apologies your honor chief inspector banks let me rephrase the question what was your attitude to mr pierce from the start we decided he was a definite suspect and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary we proceeded to build up our case against him in the usual accepted manner thank you chief inspector shirley castle said sitting down and trying to look bored no further questions then i suggest said judge simmonds that we adjourn for the weekend court will be in session again at tenthirty monday morning iii on monday morning it happened exactly what owen had been fearing when he tried to reconstruct the sequence of events later back in his cell he couldnt be sure whether jerome lawrence had actually managed to call out michelles name before shirley castle jumped to her feet either way judge simmonds listened patiently to the objection then he dismissed the jury for yet another voir dire what followed was a legal wrangle that owen educated as he was could only half follow so mired was it in tortured english and in citing of precedents as far as he could gather though both sides put their points of view to the judge jerome lawrence argued that michelles evidence was relevant because it established a pattern of violent behavior that had its natural outcome in deborah harrisons murder and shirley castle countered that the proposed evidence was nothing but vindictive fantasy from an unreliable witness that it proved nothing and that its prejudicial effect by far outweighed any probative value it might have owen held his breath as judge simmonds paused to consider the arguments he knew that his entire future might be hanging in the balance here his mouth felt dry his jaw clenched his stomach churned if simmonds disallowed the evidence owen knew there could be no reporting of what had gone on in the jurys absence only a very few people would ever know about what had happened between him and michelle if simmonds admitted it though the whole world would know and the jury he crossed his fingers so tightly they turned white finally simmonds puckered his lips frowned and declared the evidence inadmissible owen let out his breath the blood roared in his ears and he felt his whole body relax jaw stomach fingers he thought he was going to faint shirley castle flashed him a discreet thumbsup sign and a quick smile of victory the jury was brought back in and jerome lawrence called his next witness dr charles stewart glendenning made an imposing figure tall with a full head of white hair and a nicotinestained mustache the home office pathologist carried himself erectly and had just the right amount of scottish burr in his accent to make him come across as a nononsense sort of person the serious expression on his face which had etched its lines over the years added to the look of the consummate expert witness he entered the witnessbox as if it were his second home and spoke the oath owen noticed that he didnt rest his hand on a copy of the new testament and that the wording was slightly different from everyone elses an atheist then not surprising owen thought given the evidence of mans inhumanity to man he must have seen over the years after spending what remained of the morning establishing dr glendennings credentials and responsibilities jerome lawrence finally began his examinationinchief after lunch rebecca charters has already described finding the body and calling the police he said could you please describe doctor the condition of the body at the scene the victim lay on her back her blouse was open her brassiere torn and her breasts exposed her skirt had been lifted above her waist exposing the pubic region in the manner typical of a sex murder her underwear was missing i understand it was later found nearby on closer examination of the face i noticed a reddishpurple color and traces of bleeding from the nose consistent with death by asphyxia there was also a small fresh scratch by her left eye could you tell us what you discovered at the postmortem the girl washad beenin good general health to be expected in a girl of sixteen there were no signs of toxicity in her organs on further examination i concluded as i had earlier that death was caused by asphyxia due to strangulation would you care to elaborate on asphyxia for the members of the jury doctor jerome lawrence went on glendenning nodded briefly some strangulation victims die from vagal inhibition which means heart stoppage caused by pressure on the carotid arteries in the neck he touched the spot beside his jaw the victim in this case however died because of obstruction to the veins in her neck and the forcing of the tongue against the back of throat cutting off her air intake there are certain telltale signs people who die from vagal inhibition are pale those who die from asphyxia have reddishpurple coloring there are also petechial hemorrhages little pinpricks of blood in the whites of the eyes eyelids facial skin contrary to popular fiction the tongue does not protrude owen glanced over at sir geoffrey and lady harrison the victims parents who had attended almost every day lady harrison turned to her husband and let her head touch his shoulder for a moment both were pale owen felt he glimpsed at that moment the coldblooded logic of the prosecutions strategy like the dramatic structure of a play or a novel and it sent a chill up his spine after hearing rebecca charterss emotional account of finding the body and then bankss solid professional testimony about the police investigation if things had gone according to plan the jury would next have heard michelles testimony they would have seen only a sweet innocent young girl in the witness box and heard how this monster in the dock had attempted to strangle her he was certain she would have touched her long tapered fingers to her throat as she described the attack then they would have heard the gruesome medical details of the effects of strangulation and what would they have thought of owen after all that thank you doctor lawrence went on could you tell in this case how the victim was strangled yes with a ligature a satchel strap in fact and was this found close to the scene yes it was still attached to the victims satchel in your expert opinion do you have any reason to doubt it was used as the murder weapon none at all we carried out a number of tests the satchel strap matched the indentations in the victims throat perfectly it was angled slightly upwards cutting into the skin at the bottom part indicating that she had been strangled from behind and that her attacker was taller than her there was also blood around the edge of the strap how much taller was the killer asked jerome lawrence the victim was five foot six so i would put the attacker at least six inches taller perhaps more and the accused is six foot two as has already been established so i believe yes would it have required a great deal of strength a certain amount yes but nothing superhuman would the manner of attack make it difficult for the victim to fight off her attacker almost impossible there wouldnt be much she could do she might manage a wild scratch of course or a backwards kick to the shins with her heel you mentioned a wild scratch would this be possible if she were strangled from behind oh yes its quite conceivable she might reach behind and scratch her assailant was it possible to tell whether she had been killed in st marys churchyard or elsewhere yes by the extent of postmortem lividity such as it was this he turned to explain to the jury without lawrences prompting means that when the heart stops the blood simply obeys the force of gravity and sinks to the lowest part of the body it gathers and stains at points where the flesh is not in contact with the ground parts of the body that do remain in contact with the ground will remain white of course because the pressure will not allow the blood to settle in the capillaries in this case the staining at the back of the neck small of the back and backs of the legs indicated that the deceased had been lying in the same position since her death also as lividity was in its early stages she couldnt have been there for very long it generally begins about thirty minutes to one hour after death develops fully between three and four hours and becomes fixed between eight and ten hours the lividity was still faint and blanching still occurred could you explain blanching for the benefit of the court certainly before the blood coagulates in the vessels if you touch an area of lividity it will turn white when you remove your fingertip it will resume its lividity after four or five hours the discoloration hardens becomes clotted and pressure will not cause blanching and what does this tell you amongst other things it helps determine time of death as i said lividity had only just started and there was no sign of rigor mortis which usually begins in the eyelids about two or three hours after death i also took temperature readings and based on a mathematical calculation i came up with time of death somewhere between five oclock and when she was discovered no earlier in my opinion that would be very unlikely indeed and as the victims friend megan preece reports parting with deborah near the bridge at six oclock and the evidence of daniel charters places owen objection sustained judge simmonds pointed with a bony finger mr lawrence behave yourself you ought to know better lawrence bowed your honor thank you dr glendenning i have no further questions shirley castle stood up to crossexamine i only have a couple of questions doctor she said briskly minor points really i shant keep you long dr glendenning inclined his head and smiled at her in a gentlemanly way i assume you supervised the collection of oral vaginal and anal swabs at the crime scene shirley castle began i did and did you find any traces of semen none none at all that is correct in your postmortem examination did you discover any signs of forcible intercourse i found no signs of any intercourse at all forcible or otherwise shirley castle frowned yet you referred to this as a sex crime in your earlier testimony does that absence of evidence not strike you as unusual in such a crime not really there are many kinds of sex crimes the way the clothing was disturbed was reminiscent in my experience of a sexcrime scene and we have already heard your enviable credentials as an expert on such matters doctor how accurate is your estimate of time of death its always an approximate business glendenning admitted there are so many variables could you give the court an example of how you might determine time of death certainly as i have already indicated there are a number of factors such as rigor mortis lividity and stomach contents but body temperature is often the most accurate if the temperature at the time of death is normalthirtyseven degrees centigradeand it takes the body twentyfour to thirtysix hours after death to fall to the temperature of the environment then one can make a backcalculation to the time of death twentyfour to thirtysix hours said shirley castle frowning towards the jury thats between a day and a day and a half thats a rather broad margin for error isnt it glendenning smiled i did say it was an approximate business yes but you didnt say how wildly inaccurate it was objection sustained mr lawrence shirley castle bowed my apologies doctor how long would it have taken deborah harrisons body temperature to reach that of the environment well again its hard to say precisely she was healthy normal slim partially unclothed and it was a moist evening with a temperature of ten degrees centigrade id say quicker rather than later say twentyeight hours twentysix around there around there very well does the body cool at an even steady rate as a matter of fact no it falls in a sigmoid curve and how do you arrive at time of death from temperature glaisters formula in this case the victims temperature was thirtyfive point five degrees centigrade one subtracts this from the normal temperature of thirtyseven degrees and multiplies by one point one the answer in this case is one point sixfive hours taking the temperature of the environment into account that becomes between one and two hours before i arrived on the scene what might affect the rate at which temperature falls its hard to say exactly a number of factors shirley castle took a deep breath and leaned forward but it is not hard to say is it dr glendenning that thin people cool quicker than fat ones and deborah harrison was thin on the other hand healthy people cool more slowly than weak ones and deborah harrison was healthy naked bodies cool quicker than clothed ones yet deborah harrison was only partially clothed bodies cool quicker in water than in air yet in the humidity of the fog deborah harrison was subject to both am i right these are all relevant factors admitted glendenning according to evidence already given shirley castle went on deborah was last seen alive at six oclock which rules out her being murdered earlier wouldnt you say glendenning raised his eyebrows i would say so yes but the body was discovered by rebecca charters at six fortyfive is that correct i understand so and the first police officers arrived at six fiftynine objection yes mr lawrence judge simmonds asked id like to know where ms castle is going with this line of questioning your honor the defense requests your honors indulgence this will become clear in a short while make it fast ms castle yes your honor deborah harrison was last seen at about six oclock and her body was discovered in st marys graveyard at six fortyfive that leaves fortyfive minutes during which she could have been murdered now according to your evidence as regards time of death doctor she could have been murdered later than sixthirty couldnt she glendenning nodded yes she could have been in fact death could have occurred even as late as sixforty couldnt it yes but i believe rebecca charters heard please doctor you should know better than that rebecca charters has already admitted that what she heard could easily have been some animal or another now given that nobody actually saw owen pierce enter st marys graveyard and given that time of death could have occurred as late as sixforty when mr pierce was already in the peking moon there is no direct evidence placing him at the exact scene of the crime at the exact time the crime was committed is there doctor this is not and as noone saw either deborah harrison or owen pierce enter the graveyard shirley castle charged on before anyone could stop her then it follows that deborah could have gone somewhere else first couldnt she its not my place to speculate on such matters said glendenning im here to testify on matters of medical fact ah yes said shirley castle facts such as time of death its a lot of leeway to give the definition of a fact isnt it doctor objection sustained will you get on with it ms castle i have no further questions your honor she said and sat down very clever thought owen then he turned to watch the juror who looked like a wrestler try to scratch an egg stain off his club tie iv a week later after more legal arguments and a succession of dull minor scientific witnesses from the fingerprint man to the officer responsible for keeping track of the forensic exhibits owen watched shirley castle intimidate the hair expert who ended up retreating into scientific jargon and admitting that it was virtually impossible to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that hair found on a victims or suspects clothing could be positively matched to its source the final prosecution witness was dr tasker biologist and dna expert a thinfaced thinhaired academic of about forty owen guessed he seemed to know his stuff but there was a tentativeness about his delivery that threw jerome lawrence off kilter occasionally owen wondered if the jury were as bored as he was by the interminable descriptions of autorads and enzyme scissors by the testimony as to the scientific validity of polymerase chain reactions and the meaning of short tandem repeats by the seeming hours spent describing the extreme care taken against the possibility of contamination of laboratory samples when shirley castle stood up to crossexamine the next afternoon tasker seemed a little in awe of her and if owen were not mistaken perhaps a mite smitten too maybe she realized this her tone as she began was relaxed friendly a little flirtatious even dr tasker she said with a smile im sure the court was most impressed yesterday with your account of dna analysis you would seem to have proved without blinding us all with science that the dna derived from the bloodstain on mr pierces anorak was indeed the dna of deborah harrison is this true tasker nodded the dna extracted from the dried bloodstain on mr pierces anorak was fifty million times more likely to be hers than anyone elses and the dna taken from the tissue sample discovered under the victims fingernail was fifty million times more likely to be owen pierces than anyone elses all we can say is how rare such a result is compared to the rest of the population still smiled shirley castle those are impressive odds arent they oh yes tasker beamed i certainly wouldnt bet against them almost beyond a shadow of a doubt shirley castle said and that is after all what this is all about isnt it however dr tasker there are one or two points you might be able to clarify for me owen swore that tasker almost flushed with pleasure of course it would be a pleasure shirley castle acknowledged the compliment with a slight tilt of her head how much of deborah harrisons blood did you find on my clients anorak a small amount could you please give the court some sense of how much that might be tasker smiled well not a great deal but enough for polymerase chain reaction analysis as i described earlier yes but how much a thimble full oh good heavens no not that much as much then as might smear from a small cut or scratch mmm about that yes a pinprick possibly in other words a spot of blood about the size of a pinhead am i right perhaps a little bigger than approximately the size of a pinhead i suppose so about that yes but as i said now the court has already heard dr glendenning testify that there was a small scratch beside deborah harrisons left eye is this the kind of wound that might produce a similar amount of blood if some fabric brushed against it tasker shifted in his seat well i didnt see the scratch so i cant say for certain but it was a small amount definitely commensurate with a minor injury such as the one you describe where did you find this blood on the accuseds anorak where on the accuseds anorak on the left arm near the shoulder now we have already heard that deborah harrison was five foot six inches tall and owen pierce is six foot two would this put deborah harrisons left eye in the region of his upper arm tasker shrugged i suppose so i couldnt say exactly if your honor would allow me shirley castle addressed judge simmonds i would like the opportunity to demonstrate to the court that this is in fact so owen could see her holding her breath most judges she had told him hate anything that smacks overly of theatrics she must however have convinced him that she was following an important line of questioning because he granted his permission after hardly any hesitation at all it was a simple enough thing to do a man and a young girl were brought inwhere shirley had found them owen had no ideathe girl markedly shorter than the man they were officially measured at five foot six and six foot two then stood side by side the girls eye came level with the upper part of the mans arm shirley castle thanked them and continued was that the only blood you discovered on my clients clothing yes shirley castle called for owens anorak to be shown to the jury one feature she pointed out was the zippered pocket at the outside top of the sleeve did you dr tasker find any of the girls blood on or around this zip yes in the vicinity could you elaborate it was right at the end of the zip actually would you point to the spot on the exhibit please tasker did so the edge of the metal teeth is fairly sharp there shirley castle went on does that not indicate to you that the girl may have scraped her cheek on the zip when she collided with mr pierce after running backwards in the fog it could have got there in any number of ways but it could have got there in the way i suggest yes but and that was all the blood you found ive already said that i not very much is it as i said it was enough for pcr analysis ah yes pcr str dna genetic fingerprinting magic words these days and what does that prove dr tasker that the blood on the defendants anorak is fifty million times yes yes weve already been through all that havent we but the defense has never denied that it is deborah harrisons blood she bumped into my client and scratched herself on the zip of his anorak would you admit that the amount and location of the blood you found bear out that explanation i suppose so you suppose so did you find any traces of blood on the cuffs of the anorak no wouldnt you expect to if the victim were bleeding from the nose as the accused strangled her perhaps so he might be expected to get blood on his cuff if he did indeed strangle her from behind with the satchel strap well its possible yes but and did you find any blood lower down his sleeve no but she could have twisted side thank you dr tasker you have answered my question now given the lifeanddeath struggle that must have taken place it would have been difficult to avoid some close contact wouldnt it presumably and did you test the rest of anorak for blood yes we carried out a thorough examination but you found no blood other than this infinitesimal amount high on the sleeve at the edge of the metal teeth on the zip no the infatuation seemed to be on the wane owen noticed tasker didnt even want to look shirley castle in the eye now owen glanced over at minerva who was regarding the doctor sternly no more would she believe the scientific tests have proved commercials if indeed she ever had dr tasker do you know where deborah harrisons hairswhat we have since learned only might in fact be deborah harrisons hairswere found on mr pierces anorak no thats not my then let me tell you they were found on the upper left arm and on the upper left arm only in fact all three of her hairs were found in the teeth of mr pierces zip by the pinpoint bloodstain what do you have to say to that i dont know its not my field not your field but would you not say its consistent with the scenario i just outlined for you a minor collision i have already agreed that is a possible explanation how much blood and skin did you find under the victims fingernail a small amount but enough for consistent with what might be deposited from a light scratch yes if deborah harrison had been fighting for her life wouldnt you have expected to find more in your professional judgment possibly but again its not my i understand that dr tasker but we cant have it both ways can we either she did get the opportunity to defend herself by scratching in which case she came away with a pitiful amount of skin or she didnt which is it to be in your opinion owen saw lawrence on the verge of an objection but he seemed to think better of it and sank down again it could have been just a lucky strike said tasker i dont know you dont know very well would you at least agree that the presence of a small amount of mr pierces skin under one of her fingernails could have got there during a minor collision if she put out her hand to steady herself yes then would you also agree that it is possible that deborah harrisons killer could have been someone other than my client objection overruled mr lawrence witness will please answer the question tasker fiddled with his tie well theoretically yes of course he gave a nervous titter i mean theoretically anythings possible i wasnt there i cant tell you exactly what happened the dna was a good match to the defendants so he cant be excluded i submit that the dna match is irrelevant is your answer to my question yes i suppose so is it yes shirley castle turned to the judge and threw her hands in the air your honor she said i find myself exasperated that the prosecutions case is based on so little and such flimsy evidence no further questions for the first time jerome lawrence stood up to reexamine it must be because its his last witness owen thought he wants to leave a positive impression just two questions dr tasker he said you are fully aware of the nature of the crime the nature of the victims injuries would you say in your expert opinion that the amounts of the victims blood left on the accuseds clothing were in any way too little for him to have committed such a crime no i wouldnt said tasker and could the exchange of blood and tissue have taken place during a struggle for her life indeed it could jerome lawrence gave an oily bow thank you very much dr tasker chapter i nothing could have prepared owen for the shock of seeing michelle sitting in the gallery when he glanced nervously around the courtroom before going into the witnessbox his heart thudded against his ribcage he felt as if a large bird had somehow found its way inside him and was scratching and plucking at his chest and throat beating its wings trying to get out she was still beautiful she still had the power to make his heart ache and yearn if anything owen thought michelle looked even younger than she had when they had been together about fifteen or sixteen she wore no makeup to mar her delicate alabaster complexion a maroon blazer and a simple white blouse very much like the st marys school uniform her blonde hairthe same color and length as deborah harrisonshung over her shoulders in exactly the same way deborahs had in the newspaper photographs her lips the color of the inside of a strawberry were fixed in a childish pout and the implication of innocence and immaturity permeated her entire bearing owen wondered if people knew who she was she was sitting next to a man he had seen there often before a reporter owen thought he tried to avoid looking at her why was she here had the crown lured her in to upset him he had already realized that he was participating in a drama a theatrical event more than anything else and that the awards would be handed out in a few days time did michelle have a part to play too she wasnt going into the boxshirley castle had taken care of thatso what was she doing in court he was so distracted by her presence that he didnt hear shirley castle calling him to give evidence at first then the judge called him to the box shirley castle spent more than a day taking him through the events of that fateful monday in november as smoothly as she had before in the interview room near his cell he felt calm as he spoke and he hoped the jury wouldnt interpret this as lack of emotion minerva as far as he could tell listened to him objectively a slight furrow of concentration in her brow most of the others he noticed appeared to be paying attention too but a couple had disbelieving sneers etched around their lipsthat come on tell us another one look he had become so adept at perceiving of late occasionally he sneaked a glance at michelle once in a while she turned and spoke behind her hand to the reporter next to her the next day after shirley castle had finished eliciting a reasonable and believable account of events from owen or so he thought jerome lawrence dragged himself to his feet there hardly seems any point lawrences weary longsuffering movements seemed to be saying in bothering with this as you and i know hes guilty ladies and gentlemen of the jury but duty demands we go through the motions owen looked at the gallery and saw michelle was in court again lawrence asked what seemed a lot of dull questions for most of the morning and after lunch he finally began to zoom in on the crime mr pierce he said you have told the jury that between the hours of about six and sixthirty on november last year you simply walked around the area of st marys eastvale in the fog and stood on the bridge for some time is this so yes were you intoxicated mr pierce not at all you drank let me see two pints of beer and a double scotch at the nags head is that right owen shrugged i think so and you werent intoxicated im not saying i didnt feel the effects at all just that i was perfectly in control and i was walking not driving you had more to drink later didnt you at the peking moon yes with a large meal indeed and can you tell the court why you spent so long standing on the bridge before a fine view that you couldnt possibly see because of the thick fog i dont know really it was just what i felt like doing i had one or two problems to mull over and i find fog helps contemplation what problems were these owen saw shirley castle making discreet warning signals he looked michelle in the eye personal matters of no relevance i see and was it this same personal matter that led you to drink so much i didnt drink a lot ive already told you i wasnt drunk and led you to hide yourself away in the corner of a restaurant and mutter to yourself owen felt himself flush with embarrassment thats just a habit like when im adding up ive always done it sometimes a thought just comes out loud thats all i forget that there are people around it doesnt make me a maniac or a murderer are you sure you werent muttering in the peking moon about what youd just done murdered deborah harrison of course not thats totally absurd i was just reasoning with myself to calm down calm down there was no missing the verbal underlining in that repetition why did you feel the need to calm down mr pierce what made you so agitated in the first place i wasnt agitated theres a difference between being a little melancholy and being agitated isnt there i mean would you please stick to answering my questions lawrence butted in if i need lessons in the english language believe me i shall ask for them im the one in the dock arent i why shouldnt my opinion count youve asked everyone elses havent you why should i let you get away with distorting the meaning mr pierce judge simmonds grumbled please answer mr lawrences questions as directly and as clearly as you can im sorry your honor said owen he turned back to lawrence the answer is no i wasnt agitated i was melancholy is it not true that you were upset and dejected about your breakup with a young lady some objection sustained mr lawrence i apologize your honor what the hell was that little skirmish about owen wondered his heart jumping he glanced at michelle again lawrence was trying it on he knew damn well that evidence had been ruled inadmissible the bastard was trying to slip it in regardless he thanked his lucky stars shirley castle was so quick still something had been lodged with the jury no matter how much the judge might tell them to disregard it he looked at minerva she seemed puzzled owens breath came a little quicker let us then move on to the scientific evidence lawrence continued you dont deny that deborah harrisons hair and blood were found on your clothing its not for me to accept or deny owen said im not a scientist if your experts have identified these things thats their business and when faced with this fact by detective chief inspector banks you gave him some story about bumping into the girl is this true it was plain enough that lawrence intended cock and bull to come before story i didnt bump into her owen said she bumped into me as i was turning from the wall answer the question i would answer it if it were correctly posed lawrence sighed and made a longsuffering gesture to the jury very well then mr pierce you told the police that the girl bumped into you is this correct i told them exactly what happened why didnt you tell them earlier it didnt seem important come on mr pierce the police had already told you how important everything that happened that day was the second time they interviewed you you knew you were in a serious situation why didnt you tell them earlier ive already told you i didnt tell them about the time i had to bend down and refasten my left shoelace either or about stopping at the newsagents for an evening paper which by the way they didnt have it just didnt seem important yet you remembered it well enough later in fact as soon as you were challenged with evidence of your physical contact with the victim you suddenly came up with an explanation lawrence laughed and flapped like a bat as if by magic really mr pierce do you expect the court to believe that objection sustained the witnesss opinion on such matters of what the court should or should not believe is not required as you well know mr lawrence i am sorry your honor i submit to you mr pierce that you saw deborah harrison part from her companion that you followed her into the graveyard and that you no i did nothing of the kind owen cut in and that you strangled deborah harrison with her own school satchel strap owen clenched his fists and kept them out of sight i did not he said quietly with as much dignity as he could muster lawrence held him with his black beady eyes then breathed no more questions and sat down looking pleased with himself it was friday afternoon so judge simmonds adjourned for the weekend and owen was escorted back to his cell ii back in the dock on monday owen tried to keep his eyes off michelle and concentrate on jerome lawrences final address to the jury from what he heard it wasnt much different from the opening remarks owen was a monster hardly even human who had brutally murdered a pure and innocent young girl most of the time he found himself looking towards michelle he sensed she knew he was staring at her but she wouldnt catch his eye lawrence went on for the best part of the day piling atrocity on atrocity outrage upon outrage and it wasnt until tuesday morning that shirley castle got to make her closing speech again owen found himself watching michelle most of the time and the next thing he knew shirley castle was wrapping up and above all remember the phrase beyond reasonable doubt she said it is the very foundation upon which our justice system is built the burden of proof lies with the crown ask yourselves has the crown proven its case beyond reasonable doubt are you yourselves sure beyond reasonable doubt that this man before you is anything other than an innocent victim do you not harbor doubts yourselves i think you will find that you do and that you can honestly do no other than agree with me and say no the crown has not proven its case for you see in front of you a man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time a man confused worried and anxious by a police investigation he could not understand and which was not explained to him but more than anything you see in front of you an innocent man who has already been punished more than enough for a crime he did not commit look into your hearts ladies and gentlemen and im sure you will find there the certain knowledge that my client is innocent of all charges laid against him thank you after this carefully impassioned finale judge simmondss summing up seemed perfunctory to owen at least he was fair owen had to admit in a detached monologue the judge reiterated the main points of the case careful not to indicate any bias as the old man talked owen kept switching his gaze between michelle and minerva minerva was clearly listening but owen could not help getting the impression that this final speech was superfluous to her that she had already made up her mind once she caught him looking at her for a second and turned away quickly blushing he could have sworn though that her eyes held no trace of accusation of condemnation when michelle finally decided to return owens gaze she smiled and he couldnt mistake the cold malicious glint in her eyes it made him shiver iii while the jury was out owen sat in a cheerless room below the court with shirley castle and his guards drinking bitter coffee until his stomach hurt he had experienced anxious waiting beforeafter a job interview for example or those long nights at the window watching for michelle to come homebut nothing as gutwrenching as this his stomach clenched and growled he bit his nails he jumped at every sound he tried to imagine what it must have been like when the death penalty existed but couldnt shirley castle tried to make conversation but soon stopped after his terse and jumbled responses hours it seemed went by at last someone came and said the jury hadnt reached a verdict yet and as it was late owen was to spend the night back in his cell he asked shirley castle about the jury taking so long and she said it was a good sign that night he hardly slept at all fear gnawed at him the cell walls closed in in that nether world between sleep and waking where memories take on the aspect of dreams he actually watched himself strangle deborah harrison in a foggy graveyard or was it michelle he had been told so often that he had done it that his subconscious mind had actually been tricked into believing it he thought he screamed out in the night but nobody came rushing to see what was wrong when he woke from the dream he noticed he had an erection and felt ashamed morning came slopping out the stink of piss and shit that seemed to permeate the place the supervised shave breakfast then owen sat around in his suit waiting to go back to the court and face the verdict still nothing by midmorning on wednesday he wasnt sure how much longer he could last without going mad just before lunch his cell door opened and the warder said come on lad it looks like theyre back in court owen gripped the front of the dock until his knuckles turned white the gallery was full michelle leaning forward thumbnail between her front teeth as she often did during thrillers or when she was concentrating hard the harrisons two of the detectives stott and banks the vicar daniel charters and his attractive wife rebecca reporters morbid members of the public they were all there the jury filed back in owen looked at minerva she didnt glance in his direction he didnt know what to make of that after the hush came the legal rigmarole about charges then the question everyone had been waiting for do you find the defendant owen pierce guilty or not guilty as charged the splitsecond pause between question and answer seemed an eternity for owen his ears roared and he felt his head swimming then the spokesman a drablooking man owen had guessed to be a banker spoke the words we find the defendant not guilty your honor there was more talk after that but most of it was lost in the hubbub that raced through the courtroom like an explosive blast reporters dashed for phones owen swayed and clutched the dock for dear life he couldnt seem to stop the ringing in his ears he heard a woman yell its a travesty then everything went white and he fainted owen came to in a room below the court a cool damp cloth pressed to his brow with shirley castle and gordon wharton standing over him as he recovered he felt the stirrings of joy like the first tentative shoots of a new plant in spring overtake the gnawing anxiety that had burdened him before he was free surely it would sink in soon shirley castle was talking to someone but when she stopped and walked towards him he could feel the muscles in his face form a smile for the first time in what seemed like years she smiled back curled her fist and thumped the air triumphantly we did it you did it owen said i dont know how to thank you winning is thanks enough she held out her hand congratulations owen and good luck he shook it the first time hed touched a woman in months and he was conscious of the soft warmth under the firm grip he felt her give a little tug and released her embarrassed to realize he had held on too long he wanted to kiss her and not only because she had won his case instead he turned to wharton what now he asked what oh the solicitor glanced away from the disappearing figure wonderful woman isnt she i told you if anyone could do it shirley castle could it was a majority verdict you know ten to two thats what took them so long what now well youre free thats what butwhat do i do i mean my stuff and tell you what wharton looked at his watch ill drive you back over to the prison if you like and you can pick your stuff up then ill take you back to eastvale owen nodded thanks how do wei mean do we just walk out of here wharton laughed yes he said yes thats exactly what we do hard to get used to eh but i think therell be a bit of a mob out front wed better leave by the back way a mob wharton frowned yes well youve seen the papers those sly innuendos about the evidence they couldnt present in court that notguilty verdict wont have sunk in with them yet will it people lose all sense of proportion when they get carried away by chants and whatnot come on in a daze owen followed wharton through the corridors to the back exit the sun was shining on the narrow backstreet opposite was a refurbished victorian pub all black trim and etched smokedglass windows under his feet the worn pavingstones looked gold in the midday light freedom owen breathed the air deeply a warm still day when he thought about it he realized the trial had lasted almost two months and it was now may the most glorious month in the dales back up near eastvale the woods fields and hillsides would be a ablaze with wildflowers bluebells wild garlic celandines cowslips violets and primroses and here and there would be the fields of bright yellow rapeseed as they walked towards whartons car owen could vaguely hear the crowd outside the front of the courthouse womens voices mostly he thought chanting guilty guilty guilty iv fuck it said barry stott loudly then he said it again banging his fist on the arm of the bench for emphasis fuck it a couple standing by the pub door gave him a dirty look sorry he said to banks blushing right up to the tips of his jugears i just had to let it out banks nodded in sympathy it was the first time he had ever heard barry stott swear and he had to admit he didnt blame him they were sitting on the long bench outside whitelocks in the narrow alley called turks head yard drinks and food propped on the upturned barrel that served as a table along with his pint of youngers bitter banks had a cornish pasty with chips and gravy and stott had a scotch egg with hp sauce with a half of shandy to wash it down they had just left leeds crown court after the owen pierce verdict it was a beautiful may day the pub had lured students from their studies and encouraged office workers to linger over their lunchhours not much light penetrated turks head yard because of the high walls of the buildings on both sides but the air was warm and full of the promise of summer men sat with their jackets off and shirtsleeves rolled up while barelegged women opened an extra button or two on their blouses banks took a sip of beer before tucking into the pasty he watched stott pick at the scotch egg dip little pieces in the sauce chew and swallow too distracted to taste the food it was obvious that he had no appetite he had only eaten half when he pushed his plate away banks finished his own lunch quickly and lit a cigarette i cant believe he got off stott said i just cant believe it im just as pissed off as you are barry but it happens said banks you get used to it dont take it personally but i do it was me who cottoned on to him me who tracked him down we build a solid case and he just walks away banks didnt bother reminding him how it was teamwork and hard procedural slog that had led them to owen pierce the case obviously wasnt solid enough he said dr tasker wasnt very good for a start even glendenning wasnt up to his usual form who knows maybe they were right who the jury stott shook his head his ears seemed to flap with the motion no i cant accept that he did it i know he did i feel it in my bones he murdered that poor girl and he got away with it you know if wed got the evidence from michelle chappel in then wed have got a conviction for certain the judge made a hell of a mistake there perhaps did you see her there by the way where who michelle chappel in court i dont know if shes been there all along but she was in the public gallery for the verdict shed let her hair grow since last november too looked more like deborah harrison than ever she was even wearing a maroon blazer she was talking to that reporter from the news of the world see what i mean said stott if wed been able to bring out that connection her evidence of what he did to her theres no jury in the country wouldnt have convicted pierce maybe so but thats not the point barry stott flushed excuse me but i think it is a guilty man has just walked out of that courtroom after committing one of the most horrible murders i have ever investigated and you tell me thats not the point im sorry but i mean its not the point im trying to make stott frowned i dont follow why is michelle chappel so keen to stick the knife in pierce oh i see well maybe because he beat her up or perhaps because he tried to strangle her or could being raped by him after he knocked her out have upset her just a little a bit banks sipped some more beer all right barry give it a rest i catch your drift perhaps youre right but why hang around after her evidence was declared inadmissible just to watch him suffer why take time off work stott frowned what makes you think theres a connection its just odd thats all banks stubbed out his cigarette and drank some more beer her hair was short when we talked to her womens hair said stott with a shrug who knows anything about that banks smiled good point another pint half rather should we yes we damn well should jimmy riddles going to be out for our blood might as well put off the inevitable as long as possible oh all right ill have another half of shandy then ill have to be off banks edged through the crowd to the bar looking at his reflection in the antique mirror at the back while he waited not too bad for his early forties he thought still slim and trim despite the pints and the poor diet a few lines around the eyes maybe and a touch a gray at the temples but that was all besides they added character sandra said he intended to part company with stott after the next drink and visit an old friend while he was in leeds pamela jeffreys a violist with the english northern philharmonic orchestra about a year ago she had been badly hurt in an attack for which banks still blamed himself she wasnt back in the orchestra yet but she was working hard and getting there fast and this afternoon she was playing a chamber concert at the universitys music department it might go some small way towards making up for the disappointment in court this morning he might also while he was so close drop in at the classical record shop and see about the samuel barber song collection he had been wanting for a while listening to dawn upshaw singing knoxville summer of on the drive down had made him think about it on the other hand the notguilty verdict changed things while he was in leeds he would also phone di ken blackstone and see about having a chat with one of jelačićs cardplaying cronies he might even have another word with jelačić himself though the crown would probably appeal the verdict as far as banks was concerned it was back to the drawingboard for the time being a drawingboard he was beginning to feel he should never have left in the first place and ive jelačić was certainly high on his list of loose ends damn that judge said stott when he had thanked banks for the drink just thinking about it makes my blood boil im not convinced michelle chappels testimony would have helped as much as you think barry banks said why not at least it proves he had homicidal tendencies towards young women of deborah harrisons physical type it proves nothing of the kind said banks okay ill admit i was as excited about the psychological possibilities it opened up as you were and yes i was bloody annoyed that simmonds excluded it but now i think about it looking at her in court im not so sure stott scratched the back of his left ear and frowned why not because i think that defense lawyer shirley castle would have made mincemeat of her thats why in the final analysis shed have had the jury believing that michelle chappel was lying that she did what she did out of pure vindictiveness towards pierce for revenge because she harbored a grudge for the way he treated her and rightly so after what he did to her but dont you see how it would discredit her testimony barry make her seem like a lying bitch especially with such criticisms coming from another woman that could be pretty damning shes good is ms castle ive been up against her before shed have made sure that pierce convinced them with his version of that nights events and if they believed that he had simply been warding off the frenzied attack of a hysterical woman then he could have gained their sympathy stott took off his glasses and polished them with a spotless handkerchief i still think it would have helped us get a conviction well theres no way of knowing now is there i suppose not stott said glumly what do we do now theres not much more we can do reopen the investigation banks sipped some beer oh yes i think so dont you after all barry someone out there killed deborah harrison and according to all the hallmarks it looks very much like someone who might do it again chapter i vjeko batorac was out when banks called in the afternoon and a neighbor said he usually came home from work at about fivethirty ken blackstone who said batorac was probably the most believable of jelačićs three cardplaying cronies had given banks the address grateful for the free time banks played truant he went up to the university and spent a delightful hour listening to vaughan williamss string quartet no and he was glad he did as he watched and listened all the stress and disappointment of the verdict all his fears of having persecuted the wrong man in the first place seemed to become as insubstantial as air at least for a while as he watched pamela jeffreys play in the bright room prisms of light all around her glossy raven hair dancing skin like burnished gold the diamond stud in her right nostril flashing in the sun he thought not for the first time that there was something intensely spiritually erotic about a beautiful woman playing music it seemed as he watched that pamela first projected her spirit and emotions into her instrument the bow an extension of her arm fingers and strings inseparable then she became the music flowing and soaring with its rhythms and melodies dipping and swooping eyes closed oblivious to the world outside or so it seemed though he had taken a few hesitant steps towards learning the piano banks couldnt actually play an instrument so he was willing to admit he might be romanticizing maybe she was thinking about her paycheck erotic fantasies aside it was all perfectly innocent they had coffee and a chat afterwards then banks headed back to batoracs house vjeko batorac lived in a small prewar terrace house in sheepscar near the junction of roseville road and roundhay road less than a mile from jelačićs burmantofts flat there was no garden the front door which looked as if it had been freshly painted opened directly onto the pavement this time a few minutes before six oclock bankss knock was answered by a slight hollowcheeked young man with fair hair wearing oilstained jeans and a clean white tshirt molim said batorac frowning mr batorac banks asked showing his warrant card i wonder if i might have a word do you speak english batorac nodded looking puzzled what is it about ive jelačić batorac rolled his eyes and opened the door wider youd better come in the livingroom was sunny and clean and just a hint of baby smells mingled with those of cabbage and garlic from the kitchen what surprised banks most of all was the bookcase that took up most of one wall crammed with english classics and foreign titles he couldnt read serbocroatian he guessed the six oclock news was on radio in the background thats quite a library youve got batorac beamed hvala lipo thank you very much yes i love books in my own country i was a schoolteacher i taught english so i have studied your language for many years i also write poetry what do you do here batorac smiled ironically i am a garage mechanic fortunately for me in croatia you had to be good at fixing your own car he shrugged its a good job not much pay but my boss treats me well a baby started crying batorac excused himself for a moment and went upstairs banks examined the titles in more detail as he waited dickens hardy keats austen balzac flaubert coleridge tolstoy dostoevsky milton kafkamany he had read but many were books he had promised himself to read and never got around to the baby fell silent and batorac came back sorry he said we have a friend takes care of little jelena during the day while we work when she comes home shehow do you say thisshe misses her mother and father banks smiled yes thats right she has missed you has missed yes sometimes i get the tenses wrong what is it you wanted to see me about sit down please banks sat this didnt look or smell like the kind of house where one could smoke especially with the baby around so he resigned himself to refrain it would no doubt do him good remember he asked a few months ago when the local police asked you about an evening you said you played cards with ive jelačić batorac nodded yes it was true every monday we play cards dragica my wife she is very indulgent but on mondays only he smiled tuesday i do not have to go to work so sometimes we talk and play until late and drink yes i do not drink much because i drive home the streets are not safe at night but i drink some yes a little and are you absolutely certain on that monday the sixth of november you were playing cards with stipe pavic and ive jelačić at mile pavelics house yes i swear on the bible i do not lie inspector no offense please understand we have to be very thorough about these things was jelačić there the whole time yes he said that he walked to mr pavelics house and back did he usually do that yes he only lives about five hundred meters away over the waste ground im curious mr batorac call me vjeko please very well vjeko im curious as to how the four of you got together if you dont mind my saying so you and ive jelačić seem very different kinds of people vjeko smiled there are not many of my countrymen here in leeds he said we have clubs and societies where we meet to get news from home and talk about politics what you english call a very good grapevine ive knew mile from the old country they are both from split i met stipe here in leeds he is from zagreb and i am from dubrovnik long way apart have you ever visited dubrovnik chief inspector banks shook his head it is a very beautiful city very much history ancient architecture many english tourists came before the war you have missed much perhaps forever when did you come here in after the siege i could not bear to see my home destroyed he tapped his chest i am a poet not a soldier chief inspector and my health is not strong i have only one lung vjeko shrugged when ive came from eastvale he came into contact with us he told us his parents were both killed in the fighting many of us have lost friends and relatives in the war i lost my sister two years ago raped and butchered by serb soldiers it gives us a common bond the kind of bond that transcendsis that right yesthat transcends personality after that we just started meeting to talk and play cards he smiled not for money you understand my dragica would not be so indulgent about that almost on cue the front door opened and a pretty petite young woman with dark hair and sparkling eyes walked in what would your dragica not be so indulgent about she asked with a smile going over and kissing vjeko affectionately before turning to glance curiously at banks vjeko told her who banks was and why he was there i said you would not be indulgent if i played cards for money dragica thumped him playfully on the shoulder and perched on the arm of the sofa sometimes she said i ask myself why you must stay up most of the night playing cards with those people instead of keeping your wife warm in bed and getting up when little jelena cries ive jelačić particularly is nothing but a useless pijanac pijanac banks repeated what is that drunk said vjeko yes ive ishe does drink too much he is not a pleasant man in many ways inspector you must not judge my fellow countrymen by ives example and i do not put forward the tragedy in his life as an excuse for his behavior he lies he boasts most of all he is greedy he often suggests that we play cards for money and i know he cheats with women he is bad too dragica cannot bear him near her that is true dragica told banks shuddering at the thought and hugging her slight frame he undresses you with his eyes banks remembered susan gays reaction to jelačićs ogling and nodded please excuse me dragica said i must attend to jelena and she went upstairs he is rude too vjeko went on illmannered and i have seen him behave violently in pubs picking fights when he is drunk he laughed when i put it like that i wonder why i do spend time with him it is a mystery to me but one thing i can tell you is that ive wouldnt kill a young girl that way never perhaps in a fight in a pub he could kill but not like that not someone weaker than himself it is a joke with us that ive always picks on people bigger than himself and he usually comes off worst do you know why mr jelačić left eastvale banks asked he told us that a svecenik a man of god made homosexual advances towards him you said he was a liar do you believe his story vjeko shook his head no i do not think it is true i have listened to him talk about it and i think he did what he did to get revenge for losing his job if thats so said banks then hes caused daniel charters an awful lot of grief vjeko spread his hands but what can anyone do i did not know ive back in eastvale when all this happened and i do not know this father daniel charters perhaps he is a good man perhaps he is not but i do think that ive is tired with his revenge he has had enough the problem is that he is mixed up with lawyers and humanrights campaigners among our own people it is not so easy for him to turn around and say to them it was all a lie a mistake or a joke he would lose face and face is important to him yes dragica returned carrying a sleeping jelena in her arms and said something in croatian vjeko nodded and she went into the kitchen dragica asked if dinner is nearly ready he said i told her yes banks stood up then i wont use up any more of your time youve been very helpful he stuck out his hand why dont you stay for dinner vjeko asked it is not very much just sarma cabbage rolls but we would be happy if you would share with us banks paused at the door it was almost sixthirty and he hadnt had anything since lunch at whitelocks he would have to eat sometime all right he said thanks very much yes id love to stay ii instead of continuing along roundhay road towards wetherby and the a banks cut back down roseville road and regent street then headed for burmantofts he had dined well with the batoracs and conversation had ranged from books and teaching to the balkan war and crime after their goodbyes it was a quarter to eight on a fine may evening and dusk was slowly gathering when banks pulled up near jelačićs flat in the failing honeyed light the shabby concrete tower blocks looked as eerie as a landscape on mars there were plenty of people around in the recreation areas between the buildings mostly teenagers congregated in little knots here and there some of them playing on swings and roundabouts banks managed to climb the six flights of graffitiscarred concrete without incident apart from a little shortness of breath and rapped on jelačićs door he could already hear the television blaring coronation street through the paperthin walls so when noone answered the first time he knocked even harder finally jelačić answered the door grubby shirt hanging out of his jeans and scowled when he recognized banks you he said upak why you come here you already have killer things change ive said banks gently shouldering his way inside the place was as he remembered tidy but overlaid with a patina of stale booze and cigarette smoke here he could light up with impunity he turned down the sound on one of jack and vera duckworths loud public arguments jelačić didnt complain he picked up a glass of clear liquidprobably vodka banks guessedfrom the table and flopped down on the settee it creaked under his weight jelačić had put on quite a few pounds since they had last met most of it on his gut he looked about eight months pregnant youll be glad to hear banks said that your alibi still seems to hold water jelačić frowned water hold water what you mean i mean we believe you were playing cards at mile paveličs house at the time deborah harrison was killed i already tell you that so why you come here to ask you some questions jelačić grunted first of all when exactly did you come here from eastvale was last year september so the st marys girls would have been back at school for a while before you left yes two weeks banks leaned forward and flicked his ash into an overflowing tin ashtray which looked as if it had been stolen from a pub now the last time we talked he said you swore blind youd never seen deborah harrison or at most that you might just have seen her once or twice in passing is true now im asking you to rethink im giving you another chance to tell the truth ive theres no blame attached to this now youre not a suspect but you might be a witness i saw nothing banks nodded towards the tv set i dont suppose you watch the news he said but for your information owen pierce was found not guilty and released earlier today he is free jelačić stared openmouthed then began to laugh then you failed you let the guilty man go free always that happens here he shook his head such a crazy country yes well at least we dont shoot them first and ask questions later but thats beside the point he may or may not have committed the crime but officially he didnt and were reopening the case which is why im here now why is trying to get the tiniest scrap of help from you like getting blood out of a stone ive can you tell me that jelačić shrugged i know nothing dont you care what happened to deborah harrison deborah harrison deborah harrison silly little english rich girl why i care more girls killed in my homeland who cares about them my father and mother die my girlfriend is killed but to you that means nothing nobody cares any mans death diminishes me john donne wrote that have you never heard it ive have you never heard of the concept that were all in this together all part of mankind jelačić just looked at banks incomprehension written on his features why dont you answer my questions banks went on you saw the girl youve admitted as much you must have seen her quite often when you were working outside i work inside and out clean church cut grass right so you liked to watch the st marys girlswe know you didand you must have noticed deborah she was very striking and she complained about your making lewd gestures towards her i never ive spare me the bullshit please ive heard enough of it to last a lifetime nobodys going to arrest you or deport you for this bloody hell they might even give you a medal if you tell us anything that leads to the killer jelačićs eyes lit up medal you mean there is reward it was a joke ive said banks no there isnt a reward we just expect you to do your duty like any other decent lawabiding citizen i see nothing did you ever notice anyone hanging around the graveyard looking suspicious no did you ever see deborah harrison meet anyone in st marys churchyard he shook his head did she ever linger around there as if she was going to meet someone or was up to something again he shook his head but not before banks noticed something flicker behind his eyes some memory some sign of recognition what is it banks asked what is what is nothing you remembered something but it was gone no said jelačić like i say i only see her when she walk home sometimes she never stay never meet anyone that is all he was lying about something banks was certain but he was equally certain jelačić was too stubborn to part with whatever he had remembered right now banks would have to find more leverage sometimes he wished he had the freedom and power of certain other police forces in certain other countriesthe freedom and power to torture and beat the truth out of jelačić for examplebut only sometimes there was no point going on banks said goodbye and opened the door to leave before he had got ten feet away from the flat he heard the sound on jelačićs television shoot up loud again iii it was late that wednesday evening when owen finally got home after he had picked up his belongings from the prison he decided he didnt want to spend even one or two hours of such a beautiful dayhis first moments of freedom in over six monthstrapped in a car with gordon wharton so he begged off walked into town and just wandered aimlessly for a while savoring his liberty late in the afternoon he went into a pub on boar lane and had a pint of bitter and a roast beef sandwich which almost made him gag after months of prison food then he walked over to the bus station and by a circuitous route and a surprising number of changes he managed to get himself back to eastvale when owen finally put his key in the lock the door swung open by itself he stood in the silence for a moment but could hear nothing that seemed wrong he knew there should have been a familiar sound even if he couldnt right now remember what it was his house had never been in such complete silence no place ever is and there was an odd smell dust he had expected after so long away perhaps mildew too he couldnt expect ivor or siobhan next door to do his cleaning for him but this was something else he stayed by the door listening for a while then went into the livingroom it looked like the aftermath of a jumble sale someone had pulled the books from the shelves then ripped out pages and tossed them on the floor some of the torn pages had curled up as if they had been wet and had dried out compact disc cases lay strewn shattered and cracked along with them the discs themselves were mostly at the other side of the room where marks on the wall showed that they had probably been flipped like frisbees the tv screen had been smashed scrawled on the wall beside the door in giant spidery red letters were the words jails too good for filthy fucking perverts like you owen sagged against the wall and let his bag drop to the floor just for a moment he longed for the stark simplicity of his prison cell again the intractable order of prison life this was too much he didnt feel he could cope taking a deep breath he stepped over the debris and went into the study his photos and negs lay ripped and snipped up all over the carpet none of them looked salvageable not even the inoffensive landscapes his cameras lay beside them lenses cracked in spiderweb patterns his art books had also been taken from their shelves and pages of reproductions ripped out by the handful gauguin cézanne renoir titian van gogh vermeer monet caravaggio rubens everything that was bad enoughall or any of that was bad enoughbut the thing he hadnt dared look at until last the thing he had sensed as soon as he entered but hadnt quite grasped was the worst of all the aquarium stood in darkness and silence lights pumps and filters switched off the fish floated on the waters surfacedanios guppies angelfish jewelfish zebrafishtheir oncebright colors faded in death it looked as if the intruder had simply switched off their lifesupport and left them to die for owen this was the last straw misguided vindictiveness against himself he could understand but such cruelty directed against the harmless helpless fish was beyond his ken owen leaned against the tank and sobbed until he couldnt get his breath then he ran to the bathroom and rinsed his face in cold water after that he stood gripping the cool sides of the sink until he stopped shaking in his bedroom most of his clothes had been ripped or cut up with scissors and scattered over his bed in the kitchen the contents of the fridge and cupboards had been dumped on the lino and smeared in the manner of a jackson pollock canvas the resultant gooey mess of old marmalade eggs baked beans instant coffee sour milk cheese slices sugar tea bags butter rice treacle corn flakes and a whole rack of herbs and spices looked like a special effect from a horror film and smelled worse than the yeast factory he had once worked in as a student right in the middle on top of it all sat what looked like a curled dried turd he knew he should call the police if only for insurance purposes but the last people on earth he felt like dealing with right now were the bloody police and he couldnt face cleaning up instead he decided to give up on his first day of freedom it was only about nine oclock just after dark but owen swept the torn and snippedup clothes from his bed burrowed under the sheets and pulled the covers over his head chapter i like canute holding back the tide or the greeks fighting off the trojans banks could only postpone the inevitable not avoid it altogether in fact the inevitable was waiting for him at eight oclock on thursday morning when he got to his officecoffee in hand listening to barbers setting of dover beach on his walkmanin the strutting fretting form of chief constable jeremiah riddle banks take those bloody things out of your ears and where the hell do you think you were yesterday banks told him about talking to batorac and jelačić while he was in leeds but omitted pamelas chamber music concert and his quick visit to the classical record shop riddles presence called for a cigarette he thought he was trying to cut out the early morning smokes but under the circumstances lighting up now might achieve the double purpose of both soothing his nerves and aggravating riddle into a cardiac arrest he lit up riddle coughed and waved his hand about but he wasnt about to be distracted or to die what have you got to say about that fiasco in court yesterday the chief constable asked banks shrugged theres nothing much to say sir he replied the jury found pierce not guilty i know that bloody idiots that may well be sir said banks but theres still nothing we can do about it i thought we had a strong case im certain the crown will appeal ill be talking to stafford oakes about it when the fuss dies down hmph were going to look like real idiots over this one banks as if we havent got enough problems already riddle ran his hand over his red shiny head anyway i want you to know that ive asked detective superintendent gristhorpe to have a look over the case files maybe he can bring a fresh viewpoint either you get more evidence on pierce or if he really didnt do it you damn well find out who did ive decided im going to give you a week to redeem yourself on this before we hand it over to a team of independent investigators i dont want to do that i know how bad it looks an admission of failure but weve no bloody choice if we dont get results fast i need hardly remind you of the impact a negative result might have on your future career need i no sir and go easy on the harrisons theyre bound to be upset by pierce getting off after everything theyve been through tread softly understand ill tread softly sir stupid pillock banks cursed after riddle had left the office a whole bloody week and how he wondered could he do his job with one hand tied behind his back and tied because of bloody privilege class and wealth not by compassion for a bereaved family again he had the feeling he would soon be walking on very thin ice indeed if he were to get to the bottom of things he walked over to the window pulled up the venetian blind and opened the sash a couple of inches it was too early for tourists but the market square was busy with eastvalers starting their day heels clicking on the cobbles as bank cashiers dentists and estate agents went to work in the warren of offices around the town center the shops were opening and the smell of freshbaked bread spilled in with sunlight looking to his right banks could see south along market street with its teashops boutiques and specialty shops and out front was the square itself with the natwest bank an estate agent the ei toro coffee bar and joplins newsagents at the opposite side over the shops were solicitors offices dentists and doctors surgeries with a sigh banks walked over to his filing cabinet where he kept his own records of the salient points of the harrison case the tons of paperwork and electromagnetic traces that a murder case generated couldnt possibly be stored in one detectives office but most detectives had their own ways of summarizing and keeping track of the cases they worked on banks was no exception his filing cabinet contained his own notes on all the major cases he had been involved with since coming to eastvale plus a few he had brought with him from the met the notes might not mean much to anyone else but with the use of his keen memory banks was able to fill in all the gaps his shorthand left out his own notes also contained the hunches and accounts of offtherecord conversations that didnt make their way into the official files and statements it was time he thought to clear his mind of owen pierce for the moment and go back to basics two possibilities remained either deborah harrison had been murdered by someone she knew or a stranger other than owen pierce had killed her putting the second possibility aside banks picked up the names and strands of the first before the pierce business he had believed that deborah might have arranged to meet someone on her way home from the chess club he would spend the morning reading his notes and thinking he decided then after lunch he would go back to where it all started st marys graveyard ii siobhan would bloody well kill me if she knew i was here with you now ivor said you dont understand what its been like mate shes still convinced you did it they were standing at the bar of the queens arms on thursday lunchtime after owen had spent the entire morning cleaning up his house thats ridiculous said owen i know she never really liked me but i thought she had more sense than that is that why you didnt report the breakin i told you it only happened the other day you dont know what its been like for us tell me ivor sighed and took a swig from his pint you should have seen some of the things you got through your letterbox for a start what things shit hateletters used johnnies death threats something that looked like a lump of kidney or liver i had to go in and clean it all up didnt i im sorry did you report it to the police of course i did they sent a man round but he didnt do anything what can you expect the police thought i was guilty they still do along with the rest of the world he thought still ivor said you werent living next door you didnt have to put up with it all right i was safely locked up in prison all nice and comfortable in my little cell fucking luxury you dont have to be so sarcastic owen im just trying to explain what it was like on the outside so you can understand peoples attitudes like siobhans yes and yours ivor shrugged what exactly is your attitude owen asked whats it matter youre out now not just out ivor but not guilty remember well he mumbled you know what people say no i dont tell me what people say you know guilty people get off all the time because the systems biased in their favor we bend over backward to help criminals and dont give a damn for their victims im the victim here ivor owen thrust his thumb at his own chest me i even found a letter from the college waiting for me that bastard kemp has fired me and he did it before the jury even went out ivor looked away yeah well im just saying what people think in general thats all and what do you think ivor look i really dont want to get into this all im saying owen is that shit sticks meaning oh come on for christs sake youre supposed to be the english teacher meaning exactly what it says all those rumors that went around during the trial the stuff they couldnt bring in as evidence do you think nobody knew about it hell i found out from one of the students in the local library owen felt a shiver run up his spine found out about what everything your sex life your photographic pursuits your taste for dirty books and magazines the porn video how you screwed your students owen toyed with a damp beermat you already knew that michelle had been one of my students i dont think even you would call lady chatterlys lover a dirty book these days and dont forget you watched part of one of those videos with me im no worse than anyone else oh grow up you may not be but the whole country doesnt know everything about anyone else does it you know how rumors get exaggerated as far as theyre concerned youre the one who beats up women when they wont let you fuck them youre the one who spends his days ogling innocent young schoolgirls and your nights dreaming about defiling and strangling virgins while youre watching video nasties owen felt himself flush theyre all bloody hypocrites maybe so but that doesnt help you does it and what does help me i dont know i was thinking maybe you should go away somewhere run away thats great advice thanks a lot mate owen ordered a couple more pints at least the barmaid didnt seem to have recognized him she actually smiled as she put down the drinks a woman smiling something he hadnt seen in ages apart from shirley castle in her moment of victory either she didnt watch telly or read the papers or prison had changed his appearance enough to fool some people not everyone of course but some people look he went on get this into your thick skull i havent done anything i never beat up anyone and i certainly never raped and murdered anyone ive been a victim of the system they owe me something its doubtful theyll pay but they owe me in the meantime ive lost a few months out of my life and my reputations taken a bit of a bashing ive got to put things in order again and im damned if im going to start by running away how do you think thatll look ivor paused and scratched his beard before answering its not a bad idea you know its not really like running away new life somewhere else fresh start you could even go live and teach english on the continent somewhere france maybe your french is pretty good as i remember or japan owen sniffed i cant believe what im hearing you think thats the solution to my problems go live in obscurity in a foreign country a sort of selfimposed exile im telling you for the last time ivor i havent done anything ivor paused a little before saying you might find it more difficult than you thinkputting things in order what do you mean nothing specific im just pointing out that siobhans attitude isnt unique theres probably a few others feel the same way locally like feelings can get pretty strong are you telling me im in danger a lynch mob or something all im saying is that when people get frightened they lash out and what do you feel ivor you never really answered my original question you know youre my neighbor youre also supposed to be my friend do you think im a pervert what can i say how do i know i watched part of that video with you like you said didnt i i dont think doing that turned me into a pervert mind you i cant say it did a lot for me but i watched it more of a laugh than anything if fuck off ivor what look just fuck off and leave me alone ivor banged his pint down on the bar the barmaid glanced over anxiously all right if thats the way you want it mate just dont expect any more help from me owen snorted believe me ivor youve earned my undying gratitude for what youve done for me already now just fuck off ivor stormed out redfaced above his beard and the barmaid gave owen an odd look perhaps of recognition of disapproval then the landlord cyril he of the popeye forearms appeared from the back whats all the noise about he said he seemed to recognize owen and started walking towards him well you can fuck off too owen slammed his glass down on the bar so hard it broke and beer swilled over the counter here yelled cyril making for the hinged flap but owen shot out of the door and down the street the base of his thumb stinging and bleeding from where a sliver of glass had pierced it he hurried along north market street head down and hands thrust deep in his pockets fists clenched ivor that slimy backpedaling little turd and michelle just what was she trying to do to him but perhaps ivor was right about moving the thought wasnt quite as upsetting as it might have been a year or so earlier somehow the mess he had found on his release from prison had soured the house for him anyway there were also he realized still too many memories of michelle there and moving would be a project something to do start looking for a new place perhaps somewhere a little cheaper in a different part of the country not abroad but in devon maybe or cornwall he had always liked the southwest as he walked down the street head bowed owen felt like an outsider as if the rest of the world were swimming happily together in a huge tank and he was knocking on the glass unable to find a way in one or two people gave him strange looks as he passed and he realized he must have been mumbling to himself or maybe they recognized him shit sticks ivor had said people would see him the way the rumors had depicted him and would perhaps move aside and whisper to one another here comes the eastvale strangler you know the one that got off when he finally looked up to see where he was he saw he was in st marys despite all his resolutions he had walked there as if by instinct he stood at the church gate uncertain what to do then on an impulse he decided to go in it was a beautiful day and the few hawthorn trees scattered among the yews bore white yellow or pink blossoms wildflowers pushed their way through the grass around some of the plots thriving on decomposing remains owen thought fancifully before he noticed that most of the graves were from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries there were some recent ones but not many the graveyard was peaceful the muffled sounds of traffic on north market street and kendal road formed only a distant backdrop to the birdsongs owen followed the tarmac path where it curved past the church and arrived at the kendal road exit there he walked up to the bridge and stared down at the swirling water the color of a pint of bitter from the peat it picked up on its way through the dale ahead facing south he could see the formal gardens the riverside willows and the castle high on its hill dominating the town it seemed so long ago he had stood here that foggy november night no he would not think about that again he took the river path home and as he passed by the vicarage he saw over the garden gate a woman hanging up washing on the line and stopped to watch her the plain white tshirt she was wearing stretched taut against her heavy round breasts as she reached to peg up a sheet owen fancied he could see the dark nipples harden at the winds caress then she looked his way he recognized her he had seen her in court she was the woman who had found the body the one whose husband had been accused of molesting a church worker for a moment she seemed about to smile and say hello then she frowned her jaw dropped and she backed away inside the house shutting the door behind her owen could hear the sound of a chain being fastened she hadnt hung the sheet properly on the washingline and at the first light gust of wind it filled like a sail then broke free and fluttered onto the flowerbed like a shroud iii banks saw the curtain in the bay window twitch just after he rang the vicarage bell and a few moments later a nervous and jumpy looking rebecca charters answered the door she looked relieved to see him and ushered him down the hall into the livingroom it was a lot more cozy than on his previous visits he noticed immediately and it felt much more like a family home than a temporary encampment the whole place had been redecorated new wallpaper cream with rose patterns a new threepiece suite in a matching floral design and three vases of flowers placed around the room ezekiel the mound of brownandwhite fur was in his usual place by the empty fireplace how about some tea rebecca asked freshly brewed well ten minutes ago thatll be fine said banks no milk or sugar thanks rebecca went into the kitchen and returned seconds later with two mugs of tea today she wore her hair tied back fixed in place by a tooledleather slide and a broad wooden pin the style made her olivecomplexioned face seem to bulge forward a little emphasizing the slightly long nose weak chin and curved brow like a photograph through a fisheye lens but she still looked attractive especially the dark eyes and full lips i noticed you were in court for the verdict banks began rebecca cradled her mug in her hands yes she said i can hardly believe it he was here earlier that was why i was a bit nervous when you rang owen pierce was here why not actually here but he walked past on the river path i was in the garden i saw him its a free country i suppose banks said and hes a free man but isnt he dangerous i mean people still think he did it even if he did get off theyre free to believe what they want i dont think you have anything to worry about though easy for you to say perhaps keep your doors and windows locked if it makes you feel better im sorry rebecca said i dont mean to be sharp i its all right said banks youre worried you think theres a killer been set free and hes got his eyes on you the quicker we find out whether he did it or not the sooner youll feel safe again do you think he did it banks scratched the little scar beside his right eye right now i dont know he admitted there were times when i did certainly but the more i look at some of the things that struck me as odd before we latched onto pierce the more i start to wonder the courts set innocent people free as well as guilty ones sometimes and if anyone knows the truth hes a lucky man what brought you back here im not really sure except that this is where it all started yes said rebecca i remember she gave a small shudder and fingered the neck of her dress and id like to apologize for what for the last time we met in the queens arms i seem to remember i was very rude to you i seem to be making a habit of it dont worry banks said you get used to it in my job but you shouldnt have to i mean i shouldnt have behaved the way i did she put her mug down on the table im not that kind of person rudei look i dont know why im telling you this except that your coming here again brings it all back brings what back finding the body that yes certainly but it was a terrible time for me all round the charges against daniel all the turmoil they caused she took a deep breath you see chief inspector you didnt know the half of it of course you didnt it wasnt relevant not to your inquiries but i lost a baby about three months before that business with jelačić and the doctor said it would be dangerous for me to try for another daniel and i hadnt talked about it as much as we should and we had started drifting apart we had just made some tentative inquiries about adoption when jelačić brought the charges of course everything fell through it was worse than it was before im afraid i withdrew i blamed daniel there was even a time when i thought he was guilty since i lost the baby we hadnt beenwell you knowand i thought hed lost interest in me it was easier to explain that by assuming he was really interested in men what can i say i started to drink too much then there was patrick she laughed nervously i dont know why im telling you all this except that you witnessed the final scene banks smiled youd be surprised the things people tell us mrs charters anyway i hope life has improved since then she beamed yes yes it has daniel and i are stronger than weve ever been there are stillwell a few problemsbut at least were working together now hows the jelačić problem progressing it drags on weve not heard anything for over a month now but i believe hes got some humanrights lawyer working on it and the drink six months without patrick metcalfe not since that time you were here when he caused all that fuss has he pestered you at all since then she smiled no i think he realized pretty quickly how carried away with himself he was getting and i think your interest in him helped keep him at bay too i should thank you for that you dont still suspect him do you hes not off the hook yet banks said anyway thats not why i came actually i was hoping for another look at the area where the body was found surely you dont have to ask my permission to do that no but its partly a matter of courtesy and you know the area better than i do will you come with me certainly to retrace deborahs steps they walked first along the riverside path from the vicarage towards the kendal road bridge where worn stone steps led up to the pavement it was another beautiful day and over the road in st marys park lovers lay entwined students sat reading in the shade of the trees and children played with balls and frisbees this was where she would enter said rebecca holding the wooden gate open for banks it was a lychgate with a small wooden roof where the coffin would await the arrival of the clergyman in days gone by seventeenth century rebecca said isnt it superb banks agreed that it was this is the main path were on now rebecca explained it was about a yard and a half wide and had a pitted tarmac surface ahead it curved around slightly in front of the church separated from the doors only by a swath of grass across which led a narrow flagstone path it leads to north market street rebecca said near the zebra crossing where deborah would cross to go home and this path she said taking banks by the elbow and diverting him to the right where the entrance to the path was almost obscured by shrubbery is the path that leads to the inchcliffe mausoleum it was the gravel path banks remembered from last november after a couple of yards the shrubbery gave way to yews and lichenstained graves warm sunlight filtered through the greenery and flying insects buzzed around the dandelions and forgetmenots some of the graves were aboveground tombs with heavy lids and flowery religious epitaphs by far the most impressive and baroque was the inchcliffe mausoleum to the right now said banks we were assuming that deborah reached the junction between the main path and this one when someone either grabbed her and dragged her up here or persuaded her to go with him of her own free will but why couldnt she have come this way herself rebecca asked why should she its out of her way she had done before i noticed her do it once or twice banks raised his eyebrows you never mentioned this before rebecca shrugged you never asked and it didnt seem relevant but didnt it strike you as odd no im sorry it wasnt something i was paying a lot of attention to i suppose i assumed that she liked graveyards as i do and this is where the most interesting old tombs are and the inchcliffe mausoleum of course she blushed maybe she went to talk to the angel like i did when did she start using the path ive no idea i dont remember noticing her go that way before last september when school started up but that doesnt mean she never did did you ever see anyone else with her or anyone going along the path before or after her no you did ask me about that before and i would have told you if id seen her meeting anyone i would have noticed something like that do you think its important that she took this path banks paused from the start he explained id been working on the theory that if owen pierce or someone else hadnt followed deborah into the graveyard dragged her off the main path and killed her then she might have been meeting the person who did now youre telling me youve seen her take this path before im wondering if this is where she arranged the meeting by the mausoleum her friend megan preece said deborah had a morbid streak that she liked spooky things a rendezvous in the depths of a foggy graveyard beside an old mausoleum might have appealed to her to meet someone she knew yes a lover perhaps or someone else we know that deborah had a secret it did cross my mind that she might have arranged to meet the person involved to discuss it what to do about it but what could she have possibly known that was so important if we knew that then wed probably know who the killer is and do you still believe that she was meeting someone i think its a strong possibility she didnt tell megan but perhaps she wanted to be really secretive ive jelačić told me he never saw her meeting anyone but hes a pathological liar on the other hand you just told me yourself that you never saw anyone else around it doesnt mean that there couldnt have been someone rebecca said the woods are quite deep here and it was a foggy night i just wish i could be of more help banks stood and looked around rebecca was right you could just about see the church through the trees to the south but to the north between the inchcliffe mausoleum and kendal road it was a different matter there the yews were thicker the undergrowth denser it would be an ideal place for a secret meeting and if he had learned anything from returning to the scene it was that deborah might have taken the gravel path of her accord and that she had done so before he looked up at the inchcliffe mausoleum it could have been the angle he was viewing it from or perhaps a trick of the light but he could have sworn the marble angel with the chipped wings was smiling chapter i lets assume pierce didnt do it just for the moment said banks thatll make things easier it was the first friday in june and the rays of late morning sunlight flooded the market square banks sat in gristhorpes office trying to get a fresh perspective on the deborah harrison murder gristhorpe a bulky man with a pockmarked face and bushy eyebrows sat sideways at his large teak desk one leg stretched out and propped up on a footstool he insisted that the broken leg had healed perfectly but he still got the odd twinge now and then given that it was same leg he had also been shot in not so long ago that wasnt surprising banks thought banks took a sip of coffee on the generous side id say weve got maybe five or six suspects if deborah didnt have a lover we dont know aboutand i dont think she didthen the key to it all might lie in the secret she had and if deborah knew something about someone she might easily have misjudged the importance of what she knew underestimated the desperation of that person adults can have some pretty nasty secrets the pierce trial redirected all our time and energy towards proving that the killer didnt know her that she was a random victim or became a victim because she had the misfortune of resembling pierces exgirlfriend michelle chappel whats happening with that now i talked to stafford oakes about an hour ago banks said and hes ninetynine per cent certain the crown will appeal the verdict on the basis of the similar fact evidence being declared inadmissible if they get a judge who allows it in another trial could be disastrous for pierce whether he did it or not gristhorpe scratched his chin as you know alan he said ive been able to keep an open mind on this because i wasnt part of the original investigation id just like to say in the first place that i think you did good detective work you shouldnt flagellate yourself over the result it may still turn out that pierce didnt do it but i agree we should put that aside for a moment from what ive read so far barry stott seemed particularly sold on pierce any idea why it was his lead banks said or so he thought actually if it hadnt been for jim hatchley stopping for a pint in the nags head he might never have turned it up but barrys ambitious and tenacious and lets not forget jimmy riddle was dead set on pierce too hes a friend of the family gristhorpe said i should imagine he just wanted an early conclusion no matter who went down for it banks nodded now gristhorpe went on the two things we have to ask ourselves are what possible secret deborah harrison could have learned that was important enough to kill for and who given the opportunity could have killed her because of it banks told him about his visit to rebecca charters and what he had learned about deborahs occasional detours from the main path you think she had arranged to meet her killer gristhorpe asked rebecca never actually saw her meet anyone but its one possibility blackmail perhaps though im not sure from what i know of deborah that she was the type to do that i suppose it is possible after all her satchel was open when we found her and that has always bothered me perhaps she had some sort of hard evidence and the killer took it on the other hand maybe she just wanted to let whoever it was know that she knew the secret or how she had found out perhaps she just wanted to flaunt her knowledge a little her friends say she could be a bit of a showoff anyway lets say she didnt know the power or the value of what she was playing with which takes us to my questions why and who yes banks counted them on his fingers one by one for a start theres john spinks he was deborahs boyfriend for part of the summer and hes a nasty piece of work they parted on very bad terms and i think hes the type to bear a grudge he also has an alibi that doesnt hold much water ive jelačić has a solid alibi id say in vjeko batorac but im still certain hes involved he knows something any idea what id guess he might have seen deborah meeting someone why not tell us who then thats not jelačićs style if you ask me id say hes trying to work out what might be in it for him first for crying out loud he even asked me if there was a reward what do we do beat it out of him believe me that thoughts crossed my mind but no well get him one way or another dont worry about that im not finished with mr jelačić yet who else have we got what about that schoolteacher patrick metcalfe another possibility though i doubt very much that hes got the bottle we have to consider him he was deborahs history teacher and he was having an affair with rebecca charters the vicars wife one might reasonably assume thats a poor career move for a male teacher at an anglican girls school if deborah knew about the affairand she could easily have seen metcalfe entering or leaving the vicarage on occasionthen it could have cost metcalfe not only his job but his entire teaching career and as i recall from the statement gristhorpe said he says he stayed home alone in his flat after daniel charters left banks nodded and weve no way of confirming or denying that unless someone saw him which noone has admitted to so far what about the vicar ive been wondering about him too banks said in general ive been pretty sympathetic towards him but looking at things objectively he could be our man he certainly has no alibi and hes both tall and strong enough motive we know that ive jelačić accused him of abusing his position by making homosexual advances given jelačićs character this is probably pure fabricationvjeko batorac certainly thinks it isbut lets say its true or it approximates the truth and lets say deborah saw something that could confirm it either involving charters and jelačić or charters and someone else if it got out he also stood to lose everything that might give him a powerful enough motive or his wife gristhorpe suggested yes it could have been a woman banks agreed after all there was no evidence of rape and the body could have been arranged to make it look like a sex murder rebecca charters is probably tall and strong enough and she could have had either of two motives gristhorpe added to protect the knowledge of her affair with metcalfe or to protect her husband from certain dismissal he shook his head its a real peyton place weve unearthed here alan whod think such goings on occurred in a nice little yorkshire town like eastvale banks smiled it is my belief watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside gristhorpe smiled back and what about jimmy riddles mates he said certainly not out of the question i was beginning to think that michael clayton might have been having an affair with sylvie harrison unlikely as it sounds sir geoffrey and michael clayton have been close friends since university if clayton were having an affair with his wife and if deborah knew about that it could have had a devastating effect think of how much money and prestige were at stake there as i understand it none of them have alibis either thats right and they all knew deborah went to the chess club on a monday and what time she usually came home and by what route but even if we accept the horrible possibility that she was capable of such a crime sylvie harrison is neither tall nor strong enough to have killed her daughter rebecca charters is the only woman in this case who could remotely have done it clayton then possible certainly hes the more likely of the two though again he was the childs godfather lets also not forget gristhorpe added that harclay industries had a lot of mod contracts they do a lot of hushhush work if deborah found out about any hankypanky going on there contracts with foreign governments and the like or even something our own government didnt want the general public to know i wouldnt put it past them gristhorpe agreed according to your notes at the time of his daughters murder sir geoffrey harrison was in a private meeting with a man from the government called oliver jackson i happen to know oliver jackson and hes not exactly from the government hes special branch arent we getting a bit farfetched here banks said maybe its just someone else with the same name gristhorpe shook his head i checked with the york cid it was the same oliver jackson all right they knew he was in town but they werent told why its just another aspect to consider any other angles banks sighed not that i can think of he said unless deborah stumbled on something illegal going on in the schoolsomething to do with sex or drugs perhapsbut we couldnt dig anything up there its still plenty to be going on with for the moment banks stood up and walked to the door already reaching in his pocket for his silk cuts by the way gristhorpe asked how is di stott doing banks paused at door hes been walking around looking like death warmed up ever since pierce got off im getting a bit worried about him maybe hell be better after a weekends rest maybe as he walked back to his own office banks heard raised voices down the corridor and went to see what was happening there at the bottom of the staircase stood john spinks and dc susan gay ii the problem is not with your teaching ability owen you have demonstrated that to us quite clearly over the years then i dont understand owen said why cant i have my job back he was sitting in the chairmans booklined office peter kemp with his rolledup shirtsleeves his freckles and ginger hair like tufts on a coconut sat behind the untidy desk kemp the unkempt the staff members had nicknamed him to one side a computer hummed white cursor blinking in anticipation on an empty blue screen kemp leaned back in his chair and linked his hands behind his head owen could see a dark patch of sweat under each arm technically owen kemp said you cant demand back a job you never had remember you were employed purely on a termtoterm basis no guarantees we simply cant use you next term as he spoke kemp looked at owen down his nose under the tortoiseshell rims of his glasses as an entomologist might regard an especially interesting but ugly new bug the office smelled of polo mints and fresh paint owen longed to let in some air but he knew from experience that none of the windows opened i was depending on you owen said youve always renewed my contract before kemp sat forward and rested his hairy forearms on the desk ah yes but this time you left us in a bit of a mess didnt you we had to bring in someone to finish your classes she did a good job a very good job under the circumstances we cant very well chuck her out without so much as a byyourleave can we i dont see why not you seem to be doing it to me and at least ive got seniority besides it was hardly my fault i got arrested kemp sniggered well it certainly wasnt mine but thats irrelevant theres no such thing as seniority in temporary appointments owen you know that im sorry but my hands are tied and he held them together linking his fingers as if to demonstrate what about next january i can just about get by until then kemp pursed his lips and shook his head i cant see any vacancies opening up budgets are tight these days very tight look owen said sitting forward im getting fed up with this ever since ive been in your officeand i had to wait long enough before i got to see you by the wayive heard nothing but flannel you know damn well that you could find courses for me if you wanted to but you wont if its nothing to do with my teaching abilities then maybe youd better tell me what really is the problem owen had a good idea what he would hearhe had read the letter after allbut he wanted to put kemp through the embarrassment of having to say it ive told you youve told me buggerall is it the trial is that it well you could hardly imagine something like that would endear you to the board could you but we all understand that you were mistakenly accused and we deeply regret any hardship you suffered owen laughed mistakenly accused i like that thats a nice way of putting it kemp pursed his lips owen we know how you suffered believe me do you owen felt himself redden with anger he gripped the sides of the chair do you also believe in my innocence one must put faith in the justice system owen abide by the verdict of the jury so you do believe they were right the court found you not guilty thats not the same thing but what else are we to base our judgments on what else on your knowledge of the person on character on trust damn it after all ive worked here for eight years kemp shrugged but i can hardly say i know you can i ours has always been a professional relationship a work relationship if you like and my work has always been of the highest quality so what about my job then if you believe ive done nothing wrong and you have faith in my teaching ability why dont i get my job back youre making this very difficult for me owen owen thumped the desk oh am i im really sorry about that maybe it just hasnt occurred to you how fucking difficult this is for me kemp backed away slowly on his wheeled officechair owen youre not helping yourself at all by behaving in this manner dont give me that youve already made it clear what my position is i want you to admit why and please dont tell me how bloody difficult it is for you kemp stopped edging back and leaned forward on the desk making a steeple of his fingers all right he said if thats the way you want it the college has expressed its unwillingness to employ an instructor who has a reputation for bedding his female students and photographing them in the nude its bad for our image itll make parents keep their daughters away and seeing as we depend on the students for our livelihood and a good percentage of them are females of an impressionable age it was felt that your presence would be detrimental to our survival and besides that the college also takes a dim view of its lecturers giving marks for sexual favors rather than for academic excellence he took a deep breath there owen does that suit you better owen grinned at him itll do it certainly beats the bullshit you were giving out earlier but none of what you say has been proven its all hearsay kemp looked at the blinking cursor you know how rumors spread what damage they can do and people here were aware of yourerrelationship with ms chappel even at the time you did nothing then why now circumstances have changed so i lost my job because circumstances have changed no smoke without fire you smug bastard goodbye owen kemp stood up he didnt hold out his hand michelle again owen felt like picking up the computer monitor and hurling it through the window then punching kemp on the nose but he restrained himself his teaching career was over here perhaps everywhere people would know about him wherever he applied the academic community is small enough word gets around quickly instead of hitting kemp owen contented himself with slamming the door striding down the corridor he almost bumped into chris lorimer owen chris had a pile of essays under his arm and seemed to be struggling to hold onto them iits kemp wont take me back hmmwell i suppose you can understand his position lorimer shifted from one foot to the other as if he desperately wanted to go to the toilet can you look chris its noon the suns over the yardarm as they used to say and im a bit cheesed off its been a bad day so far how about a pint and a spot of lunch over the road my treat lorimer contorted to glance at his watch id like to owen i really would but i have to dash and he really was dashing as he spoke edging away down the corridor as if owen had some infectious disease maybe some other time perhaps he called over his shoulder before disappearing round a corner sure owen thought some other time fuck you too chris lorimer you and the horse you rode in on iii well well well said banks standing at the top of the stairs overlooking the openplan ground floor speak of the devil just the fellow ive been wanting to see ive been looking over your file and guess whos turned eighteen since we last met spinks looked at him uh no more youth court banks glanced towards susan and raised an eyebrow taking and driving away sir she said under the influence influence of what i wonder said banks and so early in the day spinks struggled but susan managed to hold onto him not to mention crashing it through the window of henrys fish and chip shop on elmet street she said through gritted teeth banks smiled and opened the door of the nearest interview room be my guest he said to spinks stretching an arm out through the open door take a pew i need a doctor spinks moaned the fucking steering was fucked i hurt my head i got whiplash i couldve been killed shut up and sit down banks said with enough authority that spinks paused and obeyed i suppose youll be suing the owner next spinks licked his lips maybe i will there was a small cut just above his right eye it was nothing serious but banks knew that if they didnt get him medical attention theyd be breaking a pace directive and spinks would probably succeed in getting his case dismissed see if you can get dr burns will you susan banks asked indicating by a private gesture that she should take her time susan nodded straightened her dress and left what are you on banks asked spinks looked away i dont know what you mean banks grabbed spinkss chin with one hand and held his head up staring at the pinpoint pupils crack is it john or solvent maybe heroin i dont do drugs like hell you dont you know taking and driving away is an arrestable offense dont you john spinks said nothing do you know what that means spinks gave a lopsided grin a little drool had formed at the side of his mouth it means you can arrest me for it he giggled good said banks patting his shoulder gently very good john now you might not know this but to put it nice and simply that also means we can detain you for up to twentyfour hours longer if the superintendent authorizes it which he will but wait a minute do you know what day it is john what do you mean course i know its friday thats right banks looked at his watch pity for you john see a day like this the magistrates will all be on the golf course by now and they dont sit on saturday or sunday so youll have to stay with us until monday morning so what your arrest also gives us powers of search john we dont need a warrant that means therell be coppers all over your mums place if there arent already bound to turn up something your mum will love you for that wont she she doesnt give a fuck banks turned the free chair around and sat with his arms resting on the back anyway he said im not interested in petty stuff like car theft and drug abuse you dont think a detective chief inspector concerns himself with runofthemill stuff like that do you spinks sniffed cant say i care one way or another no course not i dont suppose you do well im not doing this by the book john i want you to know that like i said im not really interested in some gormless pillpopping pillock who steals a car and cant even drive it straight spinks bristled i can fucking drive i told you the steering was fucked fucking owner ought to be locked up know what they say about a poor workman john he always blames his tools fuck off look im getting sick and tired of your severely limited vocabulary know what i think we ought to do with people like you instead of community service or jail i think we ought to have compulsory education for gobshites like you who spent so much time blitzed on model airplane glue that they never set foot in school more than a couple of weeks a year know what id do id make you read the dictionary for a start at least ten new words a day and spelling tests every morning first thing after slopping out a dozen lashes for every word you get wrong literature too lots of it austen hardy dickens trollope george eliot long books poetry as wellwordsworth shelley dryden milton and shakespeare john tons and tons of shakespeare memorizing poems and long lovely speeches analyzing the imagery in macbeth and othello sound like fun id rather be in fucking jail banks sighed you will be john you will be its just a fantasy of mine now id like you to travel back in time through that addled wormeaten brain of yours id like you if you can negotiate through that lump of swiss cheese you call a mind to go back to last summer specifically to last august can you do that spinks frowned is this about that bird what got snuffed yes said banks this as you so eloquently put it is about that bird what got snuffed remember her name john deborah harrison thats right yeah debbie good now something happened didnt it something nasty dont know what you mean her mother and her godfather warned you off didnt they oh right stuckup motherfuckers look whats this got to do with i told you john im not doing this by the book this is unofficial off the record okay spinks nodded a look of suspicion forming in his glazed eyes one day you went around to ask lady sylvie harrison to give you money to leave her daughter alone right so theres no law against it theyd got plenty i didnt see why i shouldnt get some compensation bird wasnt much of a fuck really more like a sack of potatoes but banks gripped the back of the chair so hard his knuckles turned white spare me your erotic memoirs john he said they might make me do something ill regret you might not realize it but im exercising great restraint as it is spinks laughed a little more drool dripped down his chin banks felt so much like clocking him one that he had to look away who was in the house that day what you heard who else was there as well as you oh didnt i already tell you that i seem to remember humor me tell me again right there was debbies mother the blonde bitch and that stuckup prick clayton fucking snobs and deborah wasnt there i already told you no spinkss head started to roll from side to side the drugs whatever they were wearing off either that or he had sustained more than superficial damage in the car crash just as well they had sent for dr burns when you went to the house and found michael clayton there banks asked did you get the feeling that there was anything going on spinks closed his eyes his head stopped lolling dont know what you mean did you interrupt anything interrupt stop behaving like a parrot did you get the feeling there was anything going on between them spinks frowned and wiped the drool from his mouth with the back of his hand his eyes opened again and seemed to keep shifting in and out of focus going on he repeated you mean was he fucking her you mean do i think clayton was fucking the wicked witch he laughed out loud banks waited patiently until he had stopped well he said do you youve got a dirty mind do you know that do you spinks shrugged couldve been for all i know but you didnt notice anything special about them the way they behaved towards one another no were they both fully dressed course they were did they look disheveled at all come again dish what see what i mean about the need for compulsory education it means messed up ruffled untidy oh no i dont think so cant really remember though did deborah ever say anything about them he shook his head stopped abruptly and opened his mouth as if to say something then carried on shaking it no banks leaned forward on the chair back the two front legs raised off the floor what were you going to tell me john nothing she never said nothing he coughed and a mouthful of yellow vomit dribbled down his chin onto his tshirt the smell was terrible booze cheeseandonion crisps and tacos banks stood up and stepped back at that moment there was a knock on the door and susan gay came in followed by dr burns the police surgeon whose surgery was just across the market square sorry sir susan said but the doctors here right said banks shaking hands with burns hes all yours ive had enough take good care of him nick i might want to talk to him again and as he walked back to his own office he had the strange feeling that not only had spinks been holding back hiding something but that he himself hadnt even been asking the right questions something was eluding him and he knew from experience that it would drive him around the bend until he thought of it chapter i banks took a deep breath outside michael claytons house on saturday morning then he got out of his car and walked up the garden path if chief constable riddle found out about this bankss life probably wouldnt be worth living claytons house wasnt quite as large as the harrisons but it was an impressive enough construction solidly built of redbrick and sandstone detached and surrounded by an unkempt garden the lawn looked as if it hadnt been trimmed yet this year and weeds choked the flowerbeds after he rang the doorbell the first time banks heard nothing but silence and began to suspect that clayton was out he tried again about thirty seconds later just as he was about to head off down the path the door opened and clayton stuck his head out yes what is it he asked crossly oh its you chief inspector he moved aside and opened the door fully youd better come in sorry about the mess banks followed him through a door from the hallway into a room full of computer equipment at least three computers stateoftheart by the look of them sat on their desks two of them displaying similar graphic images these were incomprehensible to banks and looked like a cross between circuit diagrams and the molecular structures he remembered from school chemistry they were all multicolored and some of the nodes and pathways between them flashed different on each screen the third vdu showed a deck of cards set out in what banks recognized as the solitaire pyramid fashion i always have a game going when im working clayton said smiling it helps me concentrate dont ask me why the floor was a mass of snaking cables and banks trod carefully not to trip over any of them he could almost feel the room vibrating with the electrical hum running through them clayton cleared a stack of computer magazines from a hardbacked chair banks almost asked him what the diagrams on the screens were but he knew that either clayton wouldnt tell him or he wouldnt understand anyway best not start off looking like an ignoramus sheets of paper hissed as they slid out of a laser printer one of the computers started to emit a loud pulsating beep clayton excused himself while he went over and hit a few keys diagnostic programs he said when he got back well that was clear enough banks thought even he knew what diagnostic programs were though what they were supposed to diagnose was another matter entirely computers clayton went on theyve changed the world chief inspector nothing is the same as when you and i were children and theyre still changing it believe me in the nottoodistant future nothing will be the same as it is now but i dont suppose you came here to talk technology with me did you are you coming to apologize what for for letting the bastard who killed deborah slip through the cracks i was there you know in court with geoff and sylvie theyre devastated and ive hardly been able to concentrate on my work since then how could you let it happen banks shrugged ive seen it happen more often than you have were not living in a perfect world you can say that again i dont know what the procedure is now but if i can help in any way clayton scratched his smooth chin look ive heard one or two disturbing rumors about this pierce fellow beating up young girls and raping them is that true i cant comment on that said banks but there is some evidence that wasnt admissible isnt there something that might have got him convicted if it had been heard in the trial the judge rules on matters of law banks said so there might be a strong basis for the appeal thats really all i can tell you at the moment clayton paused and glanced quickly around at the computer screens well chief inspector thank you for bringing me up to date can i help in any way banks leaned forward as a matter of fact there is something one of the results of the courts decision is that we have decided to reopen the case and examine some of the other angles again clayton frowned i dont understand did you get the right man or didnt you the jury thinks we didnt but what about you you know more about him than youre ever allowed to tell the jury what do you think banks was getting sick of that question now he knew what defense barristers felt when people kept asking them how they could possibly defend people they knew must be guilty i didnt see him do it he said so theres always room for doubt clayton snorted so just because the justice system fouls up yet again youre going to run around reopening old wounds i hoped you might look at it as cooperation banks said about what john spinks for a start that moron who caused all the trouble last summer thats the one sylvie told you about him yes and i talked to him again yesterday you surely dont think he could have done it its possible banks said he doesnt have either the guts or the brains since when did it take brains to murder someone outside a detective novel that is it takes brains to do it and get away with it brains or luck clayton shrugged no point in arguing look at it that way and anythings possible he was certainly angry at her about what happened i imagine anger is a familiar enough part of his limited emotional range i suppose he could have laid in wait for her and lost his temper did he know she attended the chess club how should i know somehow i doubt it said banks not if he hadnt been seeing her after term started anyway thats beside the point as you say he would know the route she took and he could have simply lain in wait in the foggy graveyard ever since school came out now as i understand it spinks came to sir geoffreys house to extort money from lady sylvie harrison is that right yes and you hit him no more than a little cuff youre not going to arrest me for assault and battery are you banks smiled no believe me sir ive felt like doing the same thing myself on more than one occasion then you understand my feelings about him entirely you hit him and later you paid him off yes it seemed the easiest way how much did you give him a hundred pounds that was all yes he didnt come back for more no why clayton leaned forward and rested his hands on his knees because i told him that if he did i would certainly inform sir geoffrey who would at the very least have him horsewhipped no matter what vile threats he made clayton frowned and sat back you say you talked to spinks again why was this in connection with reopening the case not really no it was coincidence he stole a car and crashed it pity he didnt break his neck serves the little bastard right i suppose so banks said he paused feeling his heartbeat speed up what were you doing here when spinks came what do you mean i got the impression that youre here an awful lot especially when sir geoffrey is out and his wife is at home claytons mouth dropped open and he started shaking his head very slowly my god youve got a mind like a sewer he said i dont believe it on the basis of that youre suggesting he put his fingertips to his temple let me get this clearyour theory is that sylvie and i were having a torrid affair and deborah found out and threatened to tell her father instead of allowing that to happen i waited for deborah my own goddaughter in the graveyard after her school chess club one day and strangled her is that your theory i hadnt thought it out that far banks said i was just trying to get the lie of the land thats all but i must admit youve got a way of reducing things to their essentials thank you for putting it so succinctly clayton stood up his face was red this is insane banks youre clutching at straws i think youd better leave now i was just on my way but i do have one more question clayton gritted his teeth very well about the kind of work harclay industries does some of it is highly secret isnt it mod stuff yes so is there any chance that deborah might have stumbled across something she shouldnt have say in her fathers papers clayton shook his head first you practically accuse me of murder then you bring up all this james bond stuff no chief inspector deborah couldnt have stumbled across any government secrets that got her killed i think you already had the killer and you let him get off now youre casting about wildly for some sort of scapegoat banks stood up to leave maybe he admitted and for your information clayton went on ive known geoff and sylvie for years i was there when they met i was at university with geoff i have never had nor am i having now any other sort of relationship with sylvie harrison than that of a close friend am i making myself clear banks turned and met his gaze perfectly and just for this one time im willing to forget that this meeting ever took place but if you ever dare come here again with your banks held his hand up i get the message sir if i ask any more questions youll go tell the chief constable fair enough when banks got outside and back into his car his hands were shaking as he lit his first cigarette of the day ii rebecca charters hadnt known what to do at first when owen pierce surprised her in the garden on thursday she had been scared as she told chief inspector banks and her instinct had been to run inside bolt the door and put the chain on he hadnt tried anything after that even though he must have known she was alone in the house but she had looked through the window and watched him stand by the garden gate for a moment before walking off her heart had beat fast after banks had left she rationalized her fear away pierce hadnt done anything after all or even said or threatened anything perhaps she was overreacting pierce might not be guilty of anything certainly inspector banks had his doubts and his idea of deborah having arranged to meet the person who ultimately turned out to be her murderer made sense but when owen pierce came and knocked at her door on saturday afternoon while daniel was out visiting the terminally ill patients in eastvale general infirmary she felt afraid all over again because it was a warm day and she liked the way the scents of the flowers drifted into the livingroom rebecca had opened the bay window before moving to shut it and lock it she shouted go away or ill call the police please he said please listen to me im not going to hurt you ive never hurt anyone i just want to talk to you she left the window open but put her hands on top of the frame ready to slam it down if he made any suspicious moves what about she asked just talk thats all please i need someone to talk to there was something in his tone that touched rebecca but not enough to open the door to him why me she asked you dont even know me but i know about you i know what youve been through youre the vicars wife ive read about the accusations and everything i just feltim not trying to say im especially religious or anything i dont want to lie to you about that please will you just let me come in and talk will someone just treat me like a human being please rebecca could see tears in his eyes she still didnt know why he had come she couldnt let him in nor did she feel she could turn him away after all she was a christian and a ministers wife stay there she said ill come out she would feel safe outside in the garden with the constant flow of people on the river path why was she doing it she asked herself as she went outside she knew part of the answer not too long ago she had allowed herself to doubt daniel her own husband instead of offering him her unqualified support and devotion she had turned to liquor and carnality to escape her obligations more than that it wasnt just her obligations she was running away from but the horrible realization that she had doubted daniel she had believed him guilty and now here was this pathetic man found not guilty by a jury and presumed guilty by the rest of the world call it pity compassion christian charity or mere folly but she couldnt turn him away daniel had put out a couple of folding chairs in the garden when the weather was nice he liked to sit and watch the river as he composed his sermon there was also a beautiful view of st marys hill the fine old houses above the gentle slope of grass and trees here i am rebecca thought sitting in the garden with a possible murderer on a warm june afternoon i still dont understand why youre here she said i told you i wanti needa friend or friends everywhere i go people turn their backs im lonely and im scared i heard somewhere about what your husbands been going through but you have obviously stood by him however hard its been ive got nobody rebecca almost laughed out loud at the irony of it instead she said yes it has been hard but the court found you innocent youre free now owen sniffed not innocent just not guilty as charged its a different thing anyway it doesnt matter im not really free everyone believes im guilty are you will you believe me if i promise to answer truthfully rebecca felt her heart speed up it was such a simple question but it seemed to her that so much depended on it not just owen pierce here and now but her whole moral reality her sense of trust and even her faith itself she became aware of pierce looking at her and realized that she had probably been holding her breath finally she let it out and took the leap yes she said ill believe you pierce looked her in the eye no he said no i didnt do it somehow rebecca felt great relief what can we do for you she asked almost as if he didnt believe his good fortune pierce remained speechless for a while his eyes filled with tears and rebecca felt for a moment like taking his hand but she didnt finally in a cracking voice he said i need help i have to put my life back together again and i cant do it alone as he spoke he regained his composure and wiped the tears away briskly it may seem cold calculated he said but it isnt when i found out who you were i remembered you from court and i was drawn to you because i thought youd understand you know about being thought guilty when youre innocent about all the hypocrisy they talk about truth and justice im sure your husband didnt do what hes been accused of no more than i did but i thought you would be angry with us my husband gave evidence against you owen shook his head all he did was tell the truth it didnt make any difference to the case it was me on the bridge i never denied that and it must have been terrible for you finding the body no i hold nothing against you or your husband look i have no friends mrs charters everyones deserted me i have no close family even strangers treat me like some sort of monster if they recognize me i need support public support i need it to be seen that decent intelligent people dont think im a monster i need you on my side you and your husband you might have come to the wrong place rebecca said you wouldnt want to join a losing cause remember my husband is still under suspicion yes but he has carried on in the face of it all and i know you believe in him youve stuck by him so have a lot of other members of the congregation im sure dont you see mrs charters were both victims your husband and i rebecca thought for a moment remembering the hypocrisy of some parishioners all right then she said i cant guarantee anything but ill talk to my husband thank you breathed owen but will you do one thing for me of course will you come to church tomorrow morning im not trying to convert you or anything but it would be good if you could be seen there the people who still come to st marys have for the most part stuck up for daniel and believed in his innocence as you say if we take you into the congregation they might do the same for you i know it might sound hypocritical the way people judge by appearances but they do you know and perhaps ifwhy are you laughing im sorry mrs charters i really am i just cant help it of course ill come to church believe me it seems a very small price to pay iii it was just after two oclock in the morning and banks kept waking up from disturbing dreams he and sandra had been out to a folk night in the dog and gun in helmthorpe with some old friends harriet slade and her husband david the star of the evening was penny cartwright a local singer who had given up fame and fortune to settle back in helmthorpe a few years ago banks had first met her while investigating the murder of harold steadman a local historian and he had seen her once or twice in the intervening years they chatted amicably enough when they met but there was always a tension between them and banks was glad when the chitchat was over her singing was something to be relished though alto husky on the low notes but pure and clear in the higher range her voice also carried the controlled emotion of a survivor she sang a mix of traditional and contemporaryfrom anon to zimmermanand her version of the latters i dreamed i saw st augustine had made bankss spine tingle and his eyes prickle with tears but now after a little too much port and stilton back at harriet and davids banks was suffering the consequences he had often thought that the blue bits in stilton being mold had mild hallucinogenic properties and actually gave rise to restless dreams it didnt matter that he hadnt yet found a scientist to agree with him he was sure of it because every time he ate stilton it happened these werent satisfying dreams the kind you need to make you feel youve had a good nights sleep but abrupt and disturbing transformations just below the threshold of consciousness computer games turned into reality cars crashed through monitor screens and the ghost of a young woman walked through a foggy graveyard in one he had terminal cancer and couldnt remember what his children looked like all the while voices whispered about demon lovers and crows picked bodies clean to the bone thus banks was not altogether upset when the phone rang puzzled but relieved in a way to be rescued from the pit of dreams at the same time apprehension gripped his chest when he turned over and picked up the receiver sandra stirred beside him and he tried to keep his voice down sir yes banks mumbled it was a womans voice this is dc gay sir im calling from the station what are you doing there whats happened im sorry to bother you sir but it looks like theres been another one another what another girl disappeared sir names ellen gilchrist she went to a school dance at eastvale comprehensive tonight and never arrived home her mum and dad are climbing up the walls banks sat up and swung his legs from under the covers sandra turned over where are they he asked theyre here sir at the station i couldnt keep them away i said were doing all we can but have you called her friends boyfriends yes sir thats all been done everyone her mum and dad and her friends from the dance could think of weve woken up half the town already as far as i can gather she left the dance alone just after eleven oclock had a headache her parents only live on the leaview estate so its not more than a quarter of a mile down king street they got worried when she hadnt turned up by midnight her curfew called us at twelvethirty sir yes they said normally theyd have given her till one more likely then give her a good talking to and pack her off to bed but they said theyd heard about that killer who got off owen pierce thats why they called us so soon sitting on the edge of the bed banks rubbed his eyes trying once and for all to rid himself of the stilton dreams he sighed from one nightmare to another all right he said get someone to put on a strong pot of coffee will you susan ill be right over chapter i an early rambler from middlesborough set off from a bed and breakfast in skield and found the girls body tucked away in a fold of witch fell above the village at eight oclock on sunday morning an hour later the detectives from eastvale and the sceneofcrime officers began to dribble in closely followed by dr glendenning who was out of breath by the time he had climbed up to where the body was banks stood at the edge of the terrace which he suspected was a lynchet an ancient anglian plowing strip leveled on a hillside such lyncheted hills went up in a series of steps of which this was the first the strip was about ten yards wide and dipped a little in the middle the girls body lay spreadeagled in the central depression as if cupped in the petals of a flower the little meadow was full of buttercups and daisies flies and more delicate winged insects buzzed in the air some pausing to light on the girls pale unyielding skin for a moment several buttercups and daisies had been twined in her long blonde hair which lay spread out on the bright green grass around her head like the halo in a russian icon her blouse had been torn open and her bra pulled up revealing small pale breasts and her short skirt was up around her thighs her discarded panties on the grass beside her as banks got closer he noticed the discoloration around her neck and the open shoulderbag by her arm some of its contents spilled on the grass lipstick a purse compact nailfile chewing gum perfume keys address book earrings hairbrush the similarities to the deborah harrison scene were too close to be ignored and banks had just convinced himself that deborah had been murdered by someone she knew for some sort of logical reason now it looked as if they were dealing with a sexual psychopathone who had murdered two young girls in the area banks stood back as peter darby took photographs and then watched dr glendenning perform the onscene examination by then superintendent gristhorpe had arrived and jimmy riddle was rumored to be pacing at the bottom of the hill trying to decide whether to attempt the short climb or wait until the others came down to him banks sniffed the air it was another fine morning a couple of sheep stood facing the drystone wall as if just wishing it would all go away well it wouldnt banks knew no more than the tightness in his gut which felt like a clenched fist would go away before tomorrow well he asked after the doctor had finished his examination as were not in court laddie said glendenning with a crooked grin i can tell you that she probably died between ten oclock last night and one or two oclock in the morning do you think she was killed here looks like it from the lividity on her back and thighs so he brought her here alive all the way from eastvale banks made a mental calculation the girl ellen gilchrist had disappeared on her way home shortly after eleven oclock last night by car it was about thirty miles from eastvale to skield but some of that journey was on bad moorland roads where you couldnt drive very fast especially at night for one thing the sheep were inclined to wander and as anyone it has happened to will tell you running into a sheep on a dark road is a very nasty experience indeed especially for the sheep it would probably have taken the killer an hour banks estimated particularly if he took an indirect route to avoid being seen why bother why not just dump her in eastvale somewhere was location important to him part of his profile did he hope the body would remain undiscovered for longer here not much hope of that banks thought skield and witch fell were popular spots for ramblers especially with the good weather theres a nasty gash behind her left ear glendenning said which means she was probably unconscious when he brought her here before he strangled her it looks like it could have been caused by a hammer or some such heavy object cause of death off the record of course is ligature strangulation just like the last one shoulderbag strap this time instead of a satchel and the bags open also like last time banks mused aye said glendenning well you can have the body sent to the mortuary now and he walked off banks tried to run the scenario in his mind as if it were a film girl leaves friends at end of school lane walks onto king street busy during tourist hours but quiet at night apart from the odd pub or two some streetlamps but not an especially welllit area most kids are still at the dance but ellens going home ahead of her curfew because she has a headache or so her friend said she walks alone down the hill towards the leaview estate not more than ten minutes at the most car pulls up or is it already waiting down the road lights turned off knowing theres a school dance hoping someone will be careless enough to walk home alone hes standing by the car looking harmless enough he cant believe his luck another blonde just like deborah harrison and about the same age or did he know who he wanted had he been watching her did he know her as she passes he grabs her and drags her into the passenger seat before she knows whats happening she tries to scream perhaps but he puts his hand over her mouth to muffle her he knocks her out now shes in the passenger seat unconscious bleeding behind her ear he straps her in with the safety belt and sets off maybe someone saw the car someone else leaving the dance he has to get her to an isolated spot before hes seen all the way to skield he savors what hes going to do to her the anticipation is almost as thrilling as the act itself maybe even more so he anticipates it and later he relives it replays it over and over in his mind he parks off the road out of the way car hidden behind a clump of trees perhaps and drags her up the hillside its not very far or very steep the first lynchet but hes sweating with the effort and maybe shes coming round now trying to struggle beginning to realize that something terrible is about to happen to her they get to the lynchet and he lays her down on the grass and doeswhatever he does alan what oh sorry sir lost in thought superintendent gristhorpe and dc gay had come to stand beside him as uniformed officers searched the area wed better get back to the station and get things moving said gristhorpe we can start by questioning all the friends who were at the dance with her again and then do a housetohouse along king street check out the pubs too ill get someone to ask around skield as well you never know someone might have been suffering from insomnia sir both banks and gristhorpe looked around to see pc weaver one of the searchers approach with something hooked over the end of a pencil when he got closer banks could see that it was one of those transparent plastic containers that mm films come in living with sandra he had seen plenty of those found this in the grass near the body sir he said near the shoulderbag gristhorpe asked no sir thats why i thought it was odd it was on the other side of her a couple of yards away do you think it could be the killers it could be anyones lad gristhorpe said a tourists maybe but wed better check it for prints as quickly as we can he turned to banks maybe weve got one who likes to photograph his victims possible banks agreed and we already know one keen amateur photographer dont we ill get vic manson on it right away he should be able to do a comparison before the mornings over just at that moment a red bald head shiny with perspiration appeared over the rim of the meadow whats going on grunted chief constable riddle oh weve just finished here sir said banks smiling cheekily as he walked past riddle and headed down the slope ii the church was hot and smelled like dust burning on the element of an electric fire owen remembered hearing somewhere that most household dust was just dead skin which meant the church smelled like dead bits of people burning hell all flesh is grass the heaps of dead dry grass burning in allotments or autumn stubble burning in the country fields vast rolling carpets of fire spread out in the distance palls of smoke hanging and twisting in the still twilight air owen took off his jacket and loosened his tie he had never been comfortable in churches his parents were both dyedinthewool atheists and the only times he had really been in church were for weddings and funerals so he always wore a suit and tie of course it was all right when you were a tourist checking out the saxon fonts and gothic arches but a different story altogether when there was a vicar up front prattling on about loving they neighbor owen had always distrusted overly churchy types before feeling that the church offered a public aura of respectability to many who pursued their perversions in private but the vicar in this case was daniel charters now one of the few allies owen had in the entire world today it was the hoary old chestnut about how you get nothing but bad news in the papers and how that can make you cynical about the world but really there are wonders and miracles going on all around you all the time that morning owen could certainly relate to the first part of the sermon if not the uplifting bit just before he had set off for church he had screwed up the news of the world in a ball and tossed it across the room judging by the looks he got when he walked into st marys and by the way so many members of the congregation leaned towards one another and whispered behind cupped hands even the upmarket clientele of st marys had had a butchers at the news of the world over their cappuccino and croissants and there it was blazoned across the front page in thick black letters the story they couldnt tell in court obviously michelles journalist friend had probed her thoroughly there was a reference to owens liking to take photographs phrased in such a way that it sounded downright sinister and a mention of his love of kinky positions he also it appeared liked his sex rough and as far as partners were concerned the younger the better michelle came out of it sounding more like a victim than a willing lover which owen supposed was the intention there was also an old slightly blurred photograph of the two of them and a scrap of a letter owen had written michelle once when he was away at a conference the letter was a perfectly innocuous cantwaittoseeyou again sort of thing but in this context of course it took on a far more disturbing aspect he recalled the day the photograph was taken shortly after michelle had moved in with him they had taken a holiday in dorset visiting various sites associated with thomas hardys novels in the small graveyard at stinsford where hardys heart was buried they had asked an american tourist to take a photograph of them with owens camera it turned out a little blurred because the tourist hadnt quite mastered the art of manual focusing somehow seeing the photograph and handwriting reproduced in a sunday tabloid angered owen even more than the innuendos in the article michelle had obviously handed them over to the reporter it was a violation a deeper betrayal even than what she said about him he was quickly beginning to wish that he had killed michelle the whole article screamed out his guilt of course protested a miscarriage of justice though the writer never said as much not in so many words mostly he just posed questions owen wondered if he should consider suing for libel they were clever though these newspaper editors they vetted everything before they printed it they could afford a team of lawyers and they had the money put aside to finance large law suits still it was worth considering the pew in front of owen creaked and brought him back to the present he realized he was sweating really sweating and beginning to feel dizzy and nauseated too churches werent supposed to be this hot he hoped it wouldnt go on much longer he especially hoped that daniel wouldnt say anything about him they sang a hymn he remembered hearing once at a wedding then there were more readings prayers it seemed to be going on forever owen wanted to go to the toilet now too and he shifted uncomfortably in his seat one of the readers mentioned seeing something as in a mirror dimly and it took owen a moment or two to realize this was the approved modern version of through a glass darkly which he thought pretty much described his life how could they the english teacher in him wondered utterly destroy one of the most resonant lines in the bible even if people did have trouble understanding what it meant since when had religion been about clear literal logical meaning anyway finally it was over people relaxed stood chatted ambled towards the doors many of them glanced at him as they passed one or two managed brief flickering smiles some pointedly turned away and others whispered to one another owen waited until most of them had gone it had cooled down a little now with the doors open and most people gone home he still needed to go to the toilet but not so urgently he could wait now until he got to the vicarage that was the plan tea at the vicarage he could hardly believe it when there were only one or two stragglers left owen got up and walked to the door daniel and rebecca stood there chatting with a parishioner rebecca put her hand on his arm to stop him going immediately outside and smiled daniel shook his hand and introduced him to the old woman she looked down at her sensible shoes muttered some greeting or other and scurried off this would obviously take time well said daniel taking out a handkerchief and wiping his moist brow i suppose we should be grateful sir geoffrey and his wife werent here owen hadnt even thought of that if he had considered the mere possibility of bumping into deborah harrisons parents he wouldnt have gone near the place daniel obviously saw the alarm in owens expression because he reached out and touched his shoulder im sorry he said it was insensitive of me to say that its just that they used to attend anyway come on lets go owen walked outside with daniel and rebecca pleased to be in the breeze again and glad to know he wasnt entirely alone against the world then he saw four policemen hurrying down the tarmac path from the north market street gate he told himself to run but like daniel and rebecca he simply froze to the spot iii so we meet again owen said banks later that sunday in an interview room at eastvale divisional headquarters nice of you to assist us with our inquiries pierce shrugged i dont think i have a lot of choice just for the record im innocent this time too but i dont suppose that matters to you does it you wont believe me if its not what you want to hear you didnt last time very little light filtered through the barred grimy window and the bare bulb hanging from the ceiling was only thirty watts there were three people in the room banks susan gay and owen pierce one of the publicspirited parishioners at st marys had heard about the ellen gilchrist murder on the news driving home after the morning service and he had wasted no time in using his carphone to inform the police that the man they wanted had been at st marys church that very morning and might still be there if they hurried they did and he was in the distance banks could hear the mob chanting and shouting slogans outside the station they were after pierces blood word had leaked out that he had been taken in for questioning over the ellen gilchrist murder and the public were very quick when it came to adding two and two and coming up with whatever number they wanted people had started arriving shortly after the police delivered pierce to the station and the crowd had been growing ever since growing uglier too banks feared he now had a lynch mob and if pierce took one step outside hed be ripped to pieces they would have to keep him in if for no other reason than his own safety already a few spots of blood dotted the front of his white shirt a result of his resisting arrest according to the officers present there was also a bruise forming just below his right eye banks started the tape recorders issued the caution and gave the details of the interview time and those present they hit me you know pierce said as soon as the tape was running the policemen who brought me here as soon as they got me alone in the car they hit me you can see the blood on my shirt do you want to press charges no what good would it do i just want you to know thats all i just want it on record all right last night owen about eleven oclock where were you at home watching television what were you watching an old film on bbc what film educating rita what time did it start about half past ten until i dont know i was tired i fell asleep before the end do you usually do that start watching something and leave before the end if im tired as a matter of fact i fell asleep on the sofa in front of the television when i woke up there was nothing on the screen but snow you didnt check the time no why should i i wasnt going anywhere it must have been after two though the bbc usually closes down then his voice was flat banks noticed responses automatic almost as if he didnt care what happened but still the light burned deep in his eyes innocence or madness you see owen banks went on steadily there was another young girl killed last night a seventeenyearold schoolgirl from eastvale comprehensive its almost certain she was killed by the same person who killed deborah harrisonsame method same ritual elementsand we think you are that person ridiculous i was watching television alone im always alone these days youve seen to that so can you see our problem owen you were home alone watching an old film on television anyone could say that but im not just anyone am i hows the photography going owen what youre a keen photographer arent you i was just asking how it was going it isnt my house was broken into while i was on trial and the bastard who broke in killed my fish and smashed my cameras banks paused im sorry to hear that ill bet you are banks took out the plastic film container and held it up for owen to see know what that is of course i do is it yours how would i know there are millions of them around thing is owen we found this close to the body and we found your fingerprints on it owen seemed to turn rigid as if all his muscles tightened at once the blood drained from his face what we found your fingerprints on it owen can you explain to us how they got there ii he started shaking his head slowly from side to side it must be mine speak up owen what did you say it must be mine any idea how it got out in the country near skield skield thats right he shook his head i went up there the other day for a walk we know said susan gay speaking up for the first time we asked around the pub and the village and several people told us they saw you in the area on friday they recognized you not surprising didnt you know im notorious what were you doing owen banks asked reconnoitring checking out the location do you do a lot of advance preparation is that part of the fun i dont know what youre talking about i admit i was there i went for a walk but thats the only time ive been is it owen im trying to believe you honest i am i want to believe you ever since you got off ive been telling people that maybe you didnt do it maybe the jury was right but this looks bad youve disappointed me well excuse me banks shifted position these hard chairs made his back ache what is this thing you have for rummaging around in girls handbags or satchels i dont know what you mean do you like to take souvenirs of what something to focus on help you replay what you did what did i do what did you do owen you tell me how you get your thrills pierce said nothing he seemed to shrink in his chair his mouth clamped shut you can tell me owen banks went on i want to know i want to understand but you have to help me do you masturbate afterwards reliving what youve done or cant you contain yourself do you come in your trousers while youre strangling them help me owen i want to know still pierce kept quiet banks shifted again the chair creaked why am i here pierce asked you know that its because you think i did it before isnt it did you owen i got off yes you did so id be a fool to admit it wouldnt i even if i had done it did you do it did you kill deborah harrison no did you kill ellen gilchrist no banks sighed youre not making it easy for us owen im telling you the truth i dont think so i am owen youre lying to us you picked up ellen gilchrist on king street last night first you knocked her unconscious then you drove her to skield where you dragged her a short distance up witch fell and strangled her with the strap of her handbag why wont you tell me about it pierce seemed agitated by the description of his crime banks noticed guilty conscience what was it like owen he pressed on did she resist or did she just passively accept her fate know what i think i think youre a coward owen first you strangled her from behind so you didnt have to look her in the eye then you lay her down on the grass and tore her clothes away you imagined she was michelle chappel didnt you and you were getting your own back giving her what for she didnt have a chance she was beyond resistance but even then you couldnt get it up could you youre a coward owen a coward and a pervert no the suddenness with which pierce shot forward and slammed his fist into the desk startled banks he saw susan gay stand and make towards the door for help but waved her down tell me owen he said tell me how it happened pierce flopped back in his chair again as if the energy of his outburst had depleted his reserves i want my lawyer he said tiredly i want wharton im not saying another word you people are destroying me get me wharton and either arrest me or im leaving right now banks turned to susan and raised his eyebrows then sighed very well owen he said if thats the way you want it chapter i by late sunday evening it was clear that the crowd wasnt going to storm the bastille of eastvale divisional hq and by early monday morning there were only a few diehards left banks turned his walkman up loud as he passed the reporters by the front doors maria callas drowned out all their questions he said hello to sergeant rowe at the front desk grabbed a coffee and headed upstairs when he got to the cid offices he took the earphones out and walked on tiptoe listening for that snortingbull sound that usually indicated the presence of chief constable riddle silenceexcept for susan gays voice on the telephone muffled behind her closed door dr glendennings postmortem report on ellen gilchrist was waiting in bankss pigeon hole along with a preliminary report from the forensic lab who had put a rush on this one in the office banks closed his door and pulled up the venetian blinds on yet another fine day much more of this and life would start to get boring he reflected still there was a bit of cloud gathering to the south and the weather forecast threatened rain even the possibility of a thunderstorm he opened the window a couple of inches and watched the shopkeepers open their doors and roll down their awnings against the sunshine then he stretched until he felt something crack pleasantly in his back and sat down to study the report he tuned the portable radio he kept in his office to radio and listened to today as he read glendenning had narrowed the time of death to between eleven and one confirmed that the victim had been killed in the place where she was found and matched the strap of her shoulderbag to the weal in her throat the wound behind her ear was round and smooth he also confirmed about an inch in diameter and most likely delivered by a metal hammerhead this time unfortunately there was no scratched tissue beneath her fingernails in fact her fingernails were so badly chewed they had been treated with some viletasting chemical to discourage her from biting them according to the lab though there was no blood other than the deceaseds at the scene there were several hairs on her clothing that didnt come from her body that was understandable given that she had been at a crowded dance what was damning though was that four of the hairs matched those found on deborah harrisons school blazerthe ones that had already also been tested against the sample owen pierce had given almost eight months ago hairs could be dodgy evidence as pierces trial had shown banks read through a fair bit of jargon about melanin and fragmented medullas then considered the neutron activation analysis printout specifying the concentration of various elements in the hair such as antimony bromine lanthanum strontium and zinc the lab would need another sample of the suspects hair the report said because the ratios of these elements could have changed slightly since the last sample was taken but even at this point it was to one against the hair originating from anyone but pierce unfortunately none of the hairs had follicular tissue adhering to their roots in fact there were no roots so it was impossible to identify blood factors or carry out dna analysis as in the deborah harrison murder the swabs showed no signs of semen in the mouth vagina or anus and there was no other evidence of sexual activity but the hairs and the fingerprints vic manson had identified on the plastic film container would probably secure a conviction banks guessed pierce wasnt going to slip through the cracks this time in a way banks felt sad he had almost convinced himself that pierce had been an innocent victim of the system and that deborahs killer was closer to home now it looked as if he were wrong again he tuned in to radio where composer of the week featured gerald finziand started making notes for the meeting he would soon be having with stafford oakes things started to get noisy at around eleventhirty with pierce on his way to court for his remand hearing the phone ringing off the hook and reporters pressing their faces at every window in the building banks decided it was time to sneak out by the side exit and take an early lunch he opened the door and popped his head out to scan the corridor plenty of activity but nobody was really paying him much attention instead of going the regular way down to the front door he tiptoed towards the fire exit which came out on a narrow street opposite the golden grill called skinners yard he had hardly got to the end of the corridor when he heard someone call out behind him his heart lurched chief inspector thank god it wasnt jimmy riddle he turned it was di barry stott and he was looking troubled barry what is it what can i do for you can i have a word in private banks glanced around to see if anyone else was watching them no the coast was clear of course he said putting his hand on stotts shoulder and guiding him towards the fire door lets go for a drink shall we and get away from the mêlée ii it was a long time since rebecca had been to talk to the angel but that monday she felt the need again and this time she wasnt drunk as she turned off the tarmac path onto the gravel she wondered how she could have been so wrong about owen pierce she remembered how scared she was when she first saw him after his release then how like a little boy lost he had been when he came to talk to her when she had asked him the allimportant question and he had said he would answer truthfully she had believed him now it looked as if he had lied to her how could she be sure of anything any more of anyone even daniel the air around the inchcliffe mausoleum was warm and still the only sounds the drone of insects and the occasional car along kendal road or north market street the angel continued to gaze heavenward rebecca wished she knew what he could see there sober this time and feeling a little selfconscious she couldnt quite bring herself to speak out loud but her thoughts flowed and shaped themselves as she stood there feeling silly she wondered what the policeman chief inspector banks would think of her the police had claimed that owen pierce had killed another girl that meant they also believed he had killed deborah harrison there could be no way out for him now rebecca thought not with public feeling as strong as it was against him but he had visited her at the vicarage only that saturday afternoon full of talk about his innocence the need for support and understanding she couldnt get over that how convinced she had been was that the behavior of someone who was intending to go out later that night pick up a teenage girl and murder her rebecca didnt think so but what did she know experts had done studies on these kinds of peopleserial murderers they called themthough she didnt know if having killed only two people qualified owen for that designation she had however seen enough television programs about psychopaths to know that some could appear perfectly charming live quite normal lives outside their need to kill ted bundy for example had been a handsome and intelligent man who had killed god knew how many young women in america watch out for the nice friendly polite boy next door the message seemed to be not the raggedy man with the cruel eyes muttering to himself in a corner a fly settled on her bare forearm and she stared at its shiny blue and green carapace for a moment before brushing it off then she looked up at the angel again if only he could make things clear for her perhaps the police had arrested owen only because they still believed he had killed deborah harrison maybe they had no real evidence that he had killed the other girl she didnt know why she should care so much after all owen was still practically a stranger to herand for a long time she had believed him to be a killer why should she be so upset when it turned out that he really was she still couldnt help feeling that he had let her down somehow silly as the idea was why she asked surprised to find herself speaking out loud at last face turned up to look at the angel can you tell me why i care but she got no answer she already knew part of the answer talking to owen taking him under her wing had been a test for her in a way his presence had challenged her faith her christian feelings for when it came to christianity rebecca was a humanist not one of these coldfish theologians like some of the ministers she had met perhaps a better existence did await us in heaven but to rebecca christianity was useless if it forgot people and the here and now faith and belief she felt were no use without charity love and compassion religion was nothing if it focused entirely on the afterlife daniel had agreed that was why they had done so well together up to last year why am i telling you this she asked the angel what do you know of life on earth what is it i want from you can you tell me still the angel gazed fixedly heavenward his expression looked stern to rebecca but she put that down to a trick of the light am i to be a cynic now she asked after i put so much faith in owen and he turns out to be a killer after all again she didnt hear any answer but she did hear a movement coming from deeper in the woods the area behind the inchcliffe mausoleum was the most overgrown in the entire graveyard all the way back to the wall at kendal road the oldest yews grew there and the wild shrubbery was so dense in places you couldnt even walk through it easily if there were any graves nobody had visited them for a long time it must have been a small animal of some kind rebecca decided then she remembered that she had told the police and the court that the cry she heard that november evening could have come from an animal when she really thought about it she knew it never could have she had simply refused to acknowledge either to herself or to anyone else that the scream she heard was the last cry for help of a girl about to be murdered this sound too was too loud to be a dog a cat or a bird and there were no horses or sheep in the graveyard she took a step towards the back of the mausoleum aware as she did so that this was where deborahs body had been found is anybody there she called out no answer then she heard another rustling sound this time closer to the north market street wall rebecca turned and wandered thighdeep into the tangled undergrowth she felt nettles sting her legs as she walked is anyone there she called again still no answer she paused and listened for a moment all she could hear was her heart beating suddenly to her left through the trees she saw a dark figure break into a run it looked like a man dressed in brown and green but she couldnt be certain because of the way the colors blended in with the background whoever it was he couldnt get over the high wall before she caught up with him his only alternative was to head along the wall to the north market street gate if she hurried perhaps she could catch a glimpse of him before he got away she turned back towards the back of the inchcliffe mausoleum and the gravel path he was to her right now she could hear him running towards the gate before she could get out of the wooded area something snagged at her ankle and she tripped scratching her knees and hands on thorns it only delayed her a few seconds but when she got to her feet and ran past the mausoleum along the gravel path into the open area all she saw was the wooden gate slam shut she stood there and cursed whoever it was when she looked down she saw she had blood on her hands iii avoiding the queens arms which everyone knew was the eastvale cid local banks spirited stott along skinners yard down to the duck and drake on one of the winding alleys off king street the cobbled streets were chockablock with antique shops antiquarian booksellers and food specialists all with mullioned windows and creaky wooden floors the duck and drake was a small blackfronted sam smiths house with etched smokedglass windows and a couple of tatty hanging baskets over the door inside the entrance to the snug was so low that banks felt as if he were crawling under a particularly tight overhang in ingleborough cave the snug was also tiny with dark wood beams and whitewashed walls hung with hunting prints and brass ornaments they were the only two people in the place the bench creaked as banks sat down opposite stott with his pint of old brewery bitter and his ham and cheese sandwich stott hadnt wanted anything at all not even a glass of water what is it barry banks asked chomping on his sandwich off your food you look bloody awful thanks dont mention it stott was pale with dark bags under his eyes and a twoday stubble around his chin and cheeks his eyes themselves behind the glasses were dull distant and haunted banks had never seen him like this before normally you could depend on barry stott to look brighteyed and alert at all times not to mention well groomed but his suit was creased as if he had slept in it his tie was not properly fastened and his hair was uncombed he looked so miserable that even his ears seemed to droop you ill as a matter of fact said stott i havent been sleeping well not well at all something on your mind yes banks finished his sandwich took a sip of beer and lit a cigarette out with it then stott just pursed his lips and frowned in concentration barry are you sure its something you want to talk to me about i have to stott replied by all rights i should go to the super or even the cc god knows its bound to get that far eventually but i wanted to tell you first i dont know why respect perhaps its just so difficult ive been up wrestling with it all night and i cant see any other way out banks sat back he had never seen barry stott so upset so consumed by anything before except that day when pierce was found not guilty stott was a private person and banks wasnt sure how to handle him on a personal level outside the job was this a private intimate matter perhaps was stott going to admit he was homosexual not that it mattered banks knew for a fact that two of the uniformed officers at eastvale were gay so did everyone else they came in for a bit of baiting now and then from the more macho among their colleagues who werent entirely sure of their own sexuality and for a certain amount of righteous moral disapproval from the one or two christian fundamentalists in uniform but barry stott banks realized he didnt even know whether stott was married divorced or single is this off the record barry banks asked i mean is it something personal partly but not really he shook his head i cant understand it myself i was so sure so damn certain he banged the table bankss beerglass jumped sorry i think youd better just tell me stott paused he took a handkerchief from his pocket and cleaned the lenses of his glasses in the background banks could hear the radio playing jim reeves singing welcome to my world finally stott put his glasses back on nodded and took a deep breath all right he said i suppose the most important thing is that owen pierce is innocent at least of ellen gilchrists murder we have to let him go banks jaw dropped what are you talking about barry i was there stott said i know christ what was this a murder confession banks held his hand up hold on barry take it easy go slowly and be very careful what you say he almost felt as if he were giving stott a formal caution where were you king street skield stott shook his head and licked his lips no not either of those places i was outside owen pierces house doing what watching him ive been doing it ever since he got off so thats why youre looking so washed out stott rubbed his hand over his stubble havent had any sleep in a week soon as i finish at the station i grab a sandwich then head for his street and park if he goes out i follow him all night most of it at least till it looks like hes settled sometimes as late as three or four in the morning he doesnt go out much most nights he gets drunk and passes out in front of the telly and he hasnt spotted you i dont know i havent taken any great pains to hide myself but he hasnt said anything but why barry stott smoothed down his hair with his hand then shrugged i dont know i got obsessed i suppose i just couldnt stop myself i was so sure of his guilt so certain hed beaten the system and i knew hed do it again it was that kind of crime i could feel it i wanted to make sure he didnt kill another girl i thought if i watched him kept an eye on him then either id catch him stop him or if he knew i was onto him he wouldnt be able to do it again and the tension would get unbearable then maybe hed confess or something i wasnt thinking clearly banks stubbed out his cigarette but why barry youre a good copper brainy diligent logical you passed all your exams youve got a bloody university degree for christs sake youre on accelerated promotion you ought to know better stott shrugged i know i know i cant explain it something justwent in me like i said i thought if i watched him long enough id catch him one way or another banks shook his head okay lets get this straight you were parked outside owen pierces house on saturday night yes what time from about five oclock on until about twothirty in the morning when he turned the lights off he didnt go out at all except to buy a bottle of something at the offlicense around nine oclock youre absolutely certain positive the curtains werent quite closed i could see him clearly whenever he got up he was watching telly in the front room but every now and then hed get up to go to the toilet or pour a drink whatever and youre certain he was there all the time he didnt sneak out the back and come back stott shook his head he was there sir between the crucial times definitely i saw him get up and cross the room twice between eleven oclock and midnight are you sure it couldnt have been anyone else certain besides his car was parked in front of the house the whole time that didnt mean much pierce could have stolen a car to commit the crime and then returned it rather than risk using his own and having his license number taken down when that thought had passed through his mind banks had experienced another irritating sense of déjà vu he had felt the same thing the other day while going over the case files it couldnt really be déjà vu because it wasnt something he had already experienced but it came with the same sort of frisson what happened then he asked he must have fallen asleep in front of the telly as usual i could see the light from the screen it changed to snow at one fiftyfive when the programs ended but pierce didnt move again until twothirty then he drew the curtains fully turned out the lights and went upstairs to bed thats all thats all jesus christ barry do you have any idea what youve done of course i have but i had to speak out ive been struggling with my conscience all night i could have spoken up yesterday and saved pierce another night in jail but i didnt i didnt dare thats my cross to bear i was worried about the consequences to my career partly ill admit that but i was also trying to convince myself that i could have been wrong that he could have done it but theres no way hes innocent just like he says banks shook his head i dont see how we can cover this up barry im not sure whats going to happen stott sat bolt upright i dont want you to cover it up as i said i grappled with my conscience all night i prayed for an answer an easy way out there isnt one ill speak up for pierce im his alibi ive abused my position he reached in his inside pocket and brought out a white businesssize envelope which he placed on the table in front of banks this is my resignation iv owen was confused the magistrates court had bound him over without bail as he had expected but instead of being en route to armley jail he was back in the cell at eastvale and nobody would tell him anything wharton had received a message from one of the uniformed policemen just as they returned to the van after the court session and he seemed to have been running around like a bluearsed fly ever since something was going on and as far as owen was concerned it could only be bad he ate a lunch of greasy fish and chips ironically wrapped in sundays news of the world washed it down with a mug of strong sweet tea and paced his cell until shortly after one oclock wharton appeared in the doorway waistcoat buttons straining over his belly a scarlet crescent grin splitting his bluish jowls youre free to go he announced thumbs hooked in his waistcoat pockets owen flopped on the bed dont joke he said what do you want i told you wharton came close to what looked like dancing a little jig like scrooge on christmas morning youre free free free to go had he gone mad owen wondered had this new arrest been the straw that broke the camels back by all rights it should be owen going mad not his solicitor but there was no accounting for events these days please owen said putting his fists to his temples in an attempt to stop the clamor rising inside his head please stop tormenting me hes right owen said a new voice from behind wharton in the doorway owen looked up through the tears in his eyes and saw detective chief inspector banks leaning against the jamb tie loose hands in his pockets so it wasnt a dream it wasnt a lie owen hardly dared believe he didnt know how he felt now choked certainly his head spinning a whooshing sound in his ears mostly he was still confused that and tearful he felt very tearful you believe me he asked banks banks nodded yes i believe you thank god owen let his head fall in his hands and gave in to the tears he cried loud and long wet and shamelessly and it wasnt until he had finished and started to wipe his nose and eyes with a tissue that he noticed the two men had left him alone but that the cell door was still open gingerly he walked towards it and poked his head out afraid that it would slam on him nothing happened he walked along the tiled corridor towards the other locked door that led he knew upstairs then out to the world beyond worried that it wouldnt be opened for him but it was banks and wharton stood outside in the custody suite and owen now feared he would be rearrested for something else still anxious that it was all some sort of ruse when banks approached him he backed away in apprehension no said banks holding his hands out palms open i meant it owen no tricks its over youre a free man youre completely exonerated but id really appreciate it if you would come to my office with me for a chat you might be able help us find out who really did commit these murders murders you believe im innocent of both theyre too similar owen had to be the same person and that person couldnt have been you please come with me will you ill explain as owen preceded banks up the stairs he felt as if he were walking in a dream and halfexpected his feet to disappear right through the steps on the openplan ground floor everyone fell silent as he passed watching him and he felt as if he were floating weightless in space his vision blurred and his head started to spin as if he had had too much to drink but before he stumbled and fell he felt banks strong hand grasp his elbow and direct him towards the stairs its all right owen banks said well have some strong coffee and a chat youve nothing to worry about now instead of taking him into a dim smelly interview room as owen had been halfexpecting banks led him into what must be his own office it was hardly palatial but it had a metal desk some matching filing cabinets and two comfortable chairs on the wall was a dalesman calendar set at june and showing a photograph of a couple of ramblers with heavy rucksacks on their backs approaching gordale scar near malham oddly owen found himself thinking he could have done a better job of the photograph himself the venetian blinds were up and before he sat down owen glimpsed the cobbled market square full of parked cars freedom he sat down god he felt tired what happened he asked you were under surveillance said banks what so there wasi mean it was you not me exactly but someone did you know there was someone watching you i had a funny feeling once or twice but no i cant honestly say i knew owen started to laugh what is it banks asked owen wiped his arm over his eyes oh nothing just the irony of it thats all i was under surveillance because you thought id commit a crime but as it turns out the surveillance gives me an alibi dont you think thats funny banks smiled ironic yes but a young girl did get killed owen horribly just like deborah harrison i know i wasnt laughing at that and i didnt have anything to do with it i dont know how i can help you i think you do i dont believe you havent considered the problem over the past couple of days what problem banks sat forward and rested his palms on the blotter you want me to spell it out okay the reason we arrested you owen was partly because you had been accused of a very similar crime before and partly because we found strong physical evidence against you at the scene it still looks very much as if the same person killed both of those girls and we found evidence against you at both scenes the fingerprints and the hairs yes and youre right i have been thinking about how they could have got there any ideas owen shook his head i did go up skield way and i probably walked past the spot whereyou know i suppose i could have dropped such a film container but i dont think i had one with me i told you about my camera i didnt have it with me as for the hairs i suppose i must have shed a few during my walk but i cant explain how they got on the victims clothes unless yes the coffee arrived banks poured owen blew into his cup first then took a sip this is good thank you unless he went on and i know this sounds crazy paranoid even but i cant see how any of it could have happened unless someone the real killer had decided to capitalize on my bad reputation blame it on me the way he knew everyone else would it doesnt make sense unless someone tried to frame me for ellen gilchrists murder banks started tapping a pencil against his blotter go on he said well if you accept that premise then whoever it was must have broken into my house while i was in jail and wrecked the place to cover up his true intentions or he could have walked in easily after the place had been done over the front door was unlocked when i got back the lock was broken in fact this person must have thought there was a good chance id get off and he wanted some insurance in case that happened and suspicion turned back on him he must have found the empty film container in the wastepaper bin and guessed it would have my fingerprints on it i mean if it were empty and id opened it then he must have picked up some hairs from the pillow in the bedroom that would have been easy enough to do banks nodded why not choose something more obvious to link you to the crime failing my blood which he couldnt get hold of i cant think of anything more obvious than my hair and fingerprints can you banks smiled i meant something with your name on perhaps so there could be no mistake after all the prints on the film container might have been blurred he couldnt be certain theyd lead us to you but if you think about it owen said looking pointedly at banks he didnt need very much did he you all believed id murdered deborah harrison so it was easy to convince you id also killed ellen gilchrist there was no point risking anything more obvious like something with my name or photograph on it because that would only draw suspicion no all he needed were my prints and hair he knew my reputation would do the rest even without the prints he could have been fairly certain youd pick on me ill bet the minute you saw the film container you thought of me because you knew i was an amateur photographer that still leaves us one important question to answer banks said who of course it might be that the murderer was simply using you as a convenient scapegoatthat it was nothing personalbut it could have been someone who really wanted you to suffer have you any idea who would want to do that to you ive racked my brains about it but no the only person who hates me that much is michelle could it have been a woman i dont think michelle is tall enough banks said but yes it could have been a woman owen shook his head im sorry i wish i could help like you said it was probably nothing personal i mean whoever did it just wanted someone else to blame it didnt matter who youre probably right but if you think of anyone of course one of the neighbors might have seen someone you know they wouldnt speak out before because they all thought i was guilty and deserved having my house wrecked but now i dont know its worth asking them anyway you might start with that prick ivor and his wife siobhan next door well do that said banks standing up to indicate the interview was at an end owen finished his coffee stood awkwardly and moved towards the door he could still hardly believe that freedom was just a few steps away again what now banks asked him he shrugged i dont know ive got a lot to think about maybe ill go away for a while just get lost like everyone suggested i should do in the first place banks shook his head no need to run away he said we know you didnt do it now the press will fall all over themselves to support your cause and theyll crucify us for getting the wrong man police incompetence owen forced a smile maybe eventually and i cant say ill be sorry you deserve it i remember what youve put me through i remember all the terrible things you accused me of only yesterday perversion cowardice not to mention murder but i cant see me getting my job or my friends back can you and i imagine therell be a lot of people around these parts slow to change their minds no matter what shit sticks chief inspector thats one thing ive learned from all this banks nodded perhaps for a while owen paused at the door look he said i dont expect an apology or anything but could you just tell me again that you believe im innocent not just not guilty but innocent will you say it i need to hear it youre innocent owen its true youre free to go thank you owen turned and started to pull the door shut behind him owen banks called after him owen felt a little shiver of panic he turned yes i am sorry good luck to you owen nodded shut the door and left the building as fast as he could chapter i it wasnt until late tuesday afternoon that a number of things clicked into place for banks and what had been eluding him niggling him for days suddenly became clear so far there were no leads on the ellen gilchrist murder several cars had been spotted on king street that nightbig small light dark japanese frenchbut noone had any reason to take down license numbers or detailed descriptions if the killer had used his own car banks reflected then he may have parked out of sight just around the corner on one of the sidestreets a couple of tourists unable to sleep on a lumpy mattress at a gratly b amp b said they heard a car pass shortly after eleventhirty which would have been about the right time but they hadnt seen anything so far noone in skield had been disturbed by saturday nights events but that didnt surprise banks if the killer were clever which he apparently was then he would have parked off the road well out of the hamlet itself under superintendent gristhorpes coordination susan gay and jim hatchley were still out checking the victims friends and acquaintances to see if she could have been killed by someone who knew her or if anyone knew more than he or she was telling the more he thought about it though the more banks was convinced that the solution to ellen gilchrists murder lay in deborah harrisons also when banks arrived at the office that morning he found a telephone message in his pigeonhole from rebecca charters dated the previous afternoon asking him to phone her when he rang rebecca she told him about surprising someone in st marys graveyard the previous afternoon no she hadnt seen who it was couldnt even give a description she laughed at her fears now apologized for bothering him and said shed been a bit jumpy lately yesterday she hadnt hesitated to call but now she had had time to think about it probably just a kid she decided banks wasnt too sure but he put it on the back burner for the moment since stotts revelation after the inevitable bollocking from jimmy riddle and a reminder that he was close to the end of his allotted week banks and superintendent gristhorpe had also been engaged in damage control so far they had managed to keep stotts illegal surveillance from the press and owen pierce certainly wasnt interested in blowing the whistle as far as the media were concerned pierce had an unimpeachable alibi all that had happened was that another innocent person had spent a night in the cells because of police incompetence nothing new about that eastvale cid came out of it looking only like prize berks not like a combination of the gestapo and the kgb as for barry stott he hadnt resigned but he had taken some of the leave due to him god knew where he was wrestling with his conscience somewhere banks guessed as far as banks was concerned though stott was overreacting so he had let himself get a bit obsessed with pierces guilt so what things like that happened sometimes and they rarely had dire consequences after all stott had only watched pierce he hadnt beat him up or assassinated him despite the hours of work a murder inquiry consumed routine work still went on at eastvale divisional hq and routine papers still found their way to bankss desk on that tuesday afternoon when he was distracted by thoughts of ellen gilchrist deborah harrison barry stott and owen pierce a proposal requiring every patrol car be fitted with a dashboard computer passed over his desk for perusal after a report on the increase of car theft in north yorkshire because banks wasnt thinking about it because the words simply floated into that chaotic intuitive and creative part of his mind rather than engaging his sense of reason and logic he was struck with that rare feeling of epiphany as a missing piece fell into place it felt like the simultaneous telescoping and expansion of a chain of unrelated words into one inevitable conclusion each element rolled firmly into place like the balls with the winning lottery numbers car computer theft spinks it wasnt really intuition but a perfectly logical process taking a number of facts and relating them in a way that made sense it only felt like a sudden revelation on friday when banks had questioned john spinks about michael clayton and sylvie harrison it had been staring him in the face but he hadnt seen it on saturday after his talk with clayton he had felt close to something but he hadnt known what now he did he still had some dates to check but as he pushed the proposal aside he was certain that john spinks had stolen michael claytons car and computer in august of last year whether that actually meant anything remained to be seen excited by the theory banks checked the dates and dashed into gristhorpes office where he found the superintendent immersed in the statement of ellen gilchrists best friend gristhorpe stretched and rubbed his bushy eyebrows with his fingertips when banks entered after hed done they looked like birds nests alan what can i do for you banks explained about his chain of reasoning gristhorpe nodded here and there and when banks had finished put his forefinger to his lips and furrowed his brow so lady sylvie harrison and michael clayton found spinks and deborah drinking wine in the back garden on august right he said banks nodded and clayton reported his car stolen on august i remember it because when he came to inquire about our progress he thought he was so important he had to see the top man on the totem pole about a bloody stolen car i ask you im surprised he didnt go directly to jimmy riddle oh he did first off but riddles in northallerton and that was too far for clayton to go every day so riddle told him to keep checking with me i put barry and susan on it clayton was like a cat on a hot tin roof not over the car though the computer got it in one yes thats what susan said banks mused when clayton recognized her that time we went to talk to the harrisons i should have realized at the time gristhorpe smiled indulgently i think you can be forgiven that alan he said wasnt it about the same time the lead on pierce came up yes but anyway lets assume that spinks stole claytons car on august gristhorpe went on he did some damage but not much it was the missing notebook computer that really had clayton dancing on hot coals we know it was a very expensive one with all the bells and whistles but claytons a rich man he could afford a new one easily it was what was on the computer that he was worried about as i recollect it turned up on the market a couple of weeks later no worse for wear from what ive seen banks went on spinks would have about as much chance of operating claytons computer as an orangutan but the point is that he was still seeing deborah at that time theres a chance she knew what hed done she wouldnt necessarily tell clayton or her parents what happened not when she was right in the middle of being rebellious slumming it and deborah was bright good at sciences that computer would have probably been childs play to her so what if she found out something from it gristhorpe suggested something important maybe it wasnt that clayton was having an affair with lady harrison after all banks said thats what i thought earlier but maybe they were involved in some scam perhaps clayton had been cheating sir geoffrey or something you dont even need to go that far gristhorpe said remember harclay industries is big in the defense business big enough that sir geoffrey met in private with oliver jackson of special branch on the day his daughter was murdered and you think theres a connection im saying there could be microelectronics computers microchips weapons circuits that sort of thing theyre not only big money but they have a strong political dimension too if deborah came across something she shouldnt have seen if clayton was working for someone he shouldnt have beenselling weapons systems to enemy governments for example then either clayton or his bosses could have had deborah killed if she threatened to blow the whistle yes and whoever killed ellen gilchrist simply chose a random victim to implicate pierce gristhorpe shrugged nothing simpler not to people like that but they didnt bargain on barry stotts ego the best laid plans why wait so long banks asked thats what i dont understand deborah cracked the computer around august if indeed thats what happenedand she wasnt killed until november thats nearly three months gristhorpe scratched his stubbly chin youve got me there he said but there could be an explanation maybe it took her that long to fathom out what shed got or maybe it took clayton that long to figure out someone had been tampering you know how quickly things change alan maybe the information she got didnt actually mean anything until three months later when other things happened banks nodded its possible but im not sure even deborah was bright enough to understand claytons electronic schematics i know im not i saw some of them the other day and they left me dizzy well you know what a luddite i am when it comes to computers gristhorpe said but it could have been something obvious to her she didnt have to understand it fully just recognize a reference a name or something perhaps someone else she knew was involved okay said banks but were letting our imaginations run away with us would clayton even be likely to enter such important information in his notebook anyway ive got a simple suggestion why dont we bring spinks in see if we cant get the truth out of him good idea said gristhorpe and this time banks added i think we might even have something to bargain with ii where was he swiss cottage that was it london the cash register rang and the swell of smalltalk and laughter rolled up and down he thought he could hear the distant rumble of thunder from outside feel the tension before the storm that electrical smell in the air like burning dust in church after the police set him free he had gone back home pushed through the throng of reporters then got in his car and driven off leaving everything behind he hadnt known where he was heading at least not consciously mostly he was still in a daze over what had happened not only his release but the fact that someone must have deliberately set out to frame him and as he told the police the only person who hated him that much was michelle they didnt seem to suspect herthey were sure it was a man for a startbut owen knew her better he wouldnt put it past her if she hadnt done it herself she might have enlisted someone used her sex to manipulate some poor sick bastard the way she did so well so with these thoughts halfformed one moment seeming utterly fantastic and absurd and the next feeling so real they had to be true he had found himself heading for london and now he was drinking in swiss cottage trying to pluck up courage to go and challenge michelle directly he was interested to find out what she would have to say if he turned up on her doorstep even if she hadnt engineered the murders to discredit him she had slandered him in the newspapers he knew that for a fact oh yes he was looking forward to hearing what she had to say for herself are you all right mate pardon it was the man next to him he had turned his head in owens direction i said are you all right yes yesfine owen realized he must have been muttering to himself the man gave him a suspicious look and turned away time to go it was nine oclock what day of the week tuesday wednesday did it really matter there was a good chance shed be in people who work ninetofive usually stay in on weeknights or at least get home early he found the telephone and the wellthumbed directory hanging beside it some of the pages had been torn out or defaced with felttipped pens but not the one that counted he slid his finger down until he came to her name chappel no first name just the initials me michelle elizabeth there was her number owens chest tightened as he searched his pockets for a coin he felt dizzy and had to lean against the wall a moment before dialing two men passed on their way out and gave him funny looks when they had gone he took four deep breaths to steady himself picked up the phone put the coin in and dialed he let it ring once twice three times four and on the fifth ring a womans voice said rather testily yes who is it it was her voice no doubt about it owen would recognize that reedy quality with its littlegirlish hint of a lisp anywhere he held the phone away and heard her repeat the question more loudlylook who is it after he still said nothing she said pervert and hung up on him owen looked at the receiver for a moment then he smiled and walked out into the gathering storm iii john spinks didnt seem particularly surprised to find himself back at eastvale nick shortly after dark that evening as predicted he had been at the swainsdale center bragging to his mates about how he spent the weekend in jail and gone up before the magistrate the arrival of two large uniformed officers only added more credibility to his tales and he got quite a laugh the officers told banks when he stuck out his hands for the cuffs just like hed seen people do on television he did look surprised however to find himself in bankss office rather than a smelly interview room and he looked even more surprised when banks offered unlimited coffee cigarettes and biscuits gristhorpe and banks had decided to tackle him together to attempt a goodcop badcop approach spinks already knew banks but the superintendent was an unknown quantity and though his baby blue eyes had instilled fear into more villains than a set of thumbscrews gristhorpe could appear the very model of benevolence he also outranked banks which was another card to play they had stafford oakes waiting in gristhorpes own office should their plan be successful right john said banks i wont beat about the bush youre in trouble a lot of trouble spinks sniffed as if trouble were his business yeah right not only have we got you on taking and driving away banks went on but when our men searched your house they found sufficient quantities of crack cocaine ecstasy and lsd for us to bring some serious drugdealing charges against you i told you that stuff wasnt mine whose was it then i dont know her name just some slag spent the night there she mustve forgotten it you expect me to believe that someone would leave a fortune in drugs behind in your bedroom come off it john that stuffs yours until someone else claims it and itll be a cold day in hell before that happens spinks bit on his lower lip he was starting to look less like a hollywood dreamboy and more like a frightened teenager a lock of hair slid over his eye he started chewing his fingernails bravado could only take someone so far banks thought but he knew it would be a mistake to act as if he were shooting fish in a barrel stupidity along with stubbornness can be valuable resources when all the big guns are turned on you and they had served spinks well for eighteen years got anything to say banks asked spinks shrugged i told you its not mine you cant prove it is we can prove whatever we want banks said a judge or a jury has only to take one look at you to throw away the key my brief says these legalaid briefs are about as useful as a sieve in a flood john you ought to know that overworked and underpaid yeah well my brief says you cant pin it on me the drugs banks raised his eyebrows she did thats really bad news john he said shaking his head i thought things were pretty bad but i didnt realize that lawyers were setting up in practice before they even finished their degrees these days ha fucking ha the other chair creaked as gristhorpe leaned forward my chief inspector might be acting a little harshly towards you son he said see its personal with him he lost a son to drugs spinks squinted at banks tracy never said nothing about that she doesnt like to talk about it said banks quickly they had decided to improvise according to responses and circumstances but gristhorpe had thrown him a spinner here he smiled to himself why not play the game as far as he knew brian was alive and well and still studying architecture in portsmouth but there was no reason for spinks to know that like everyone his age banks went on he thought he was immortal indestructible he thought it couldnt happen to him anyone else sure but not him he leaned forward and clasped his hands now i dont give a tinkers whether you smoke so much crack your brains blow out of your arsehole but i do care very much that youre selling to others especially to a crowd that at one time included my daughter do we understand one another spinks shifted in his chair whats this all about what you after a confession im not saying anything my brief fuck your brief said banks thumping the rickety metal desk and fuck you do you understand what im saying spinks looked rattled gristhorpe cut in again and said to banks i dont think its really appropriate to talk that way to mr spinks chief inspector he said im sure he understands you perfectly well sorry sir said banks wiping his brow with the back of his hand got a bit carried away he fumbled for a cigarette and lit it you his boss spinks asked turning wideeyed to look at gristhorpe he called you sir i thought id already made that clear gristhorpe said then he winked dont worry son i wont let him off his leash he looked back at banks who had removed his jacket and was loosening his tie he ought to be locked up that one spinks went on emboldened and his mate the fat one hit me once he did bounced my nose off a fucking table aye well people get carried away sometimes said gristhorpe stress of the job the thing is though that hes right in a way you are in a lot of trouble right now were about the only friends youve got friends yes said banks catching his attention again believe it or not john im going to do you the biggest favor anyones ever done you in your life spinks narrowed his eyes oh yeah why should i believe you you should in years to come you might even thank me for it youre eighteen now john theres no getting around that with the kind of charges youre looking at youll go to jail no doubt about it hard time now i know youre a big boy a tough guy and all the rest but think about it think its not only a matter of getting buggered morning afternoon and evening of giving blowjobs at knifepoint maybe catching aids but its a life of total deprivation john the foods lousy the plumbing stinks and theres noone to complain to and when you get outif you get outhowever many years later youll have lost a good part of your youth all youll know is prison life and you know what john youll be back in there like a flash its called recidivism look it up john call it a sort of death wish but someone like you gets institutionalized and he cant survive on the outside he gets to need jail and as for the blowjobs and the buggery banks shrugged well im sure youd even get to like that after a while bankss monologue produced no discernible effect on spinks as he had suspected it wouldnt it was intended only to soften him to the point of accepting a deal banks knew that spinks was already doomed to exactly the kind of existence he had just laid out for him but that he couldnt wouldnt recognize the fact and wasnt capable of making the changes necessary to avoid it no what they were about to offer was simple temporary relief the chance for spinks to walk free and keep on doing exactly what he was doing until the next time he got caught if he didnt kill himself or someone else first a sprat to catch a mackerel very sad but very true so what is this big favor youre going to do me first said banks youre going to tell us the truth about what happened last august youre going to tell us how you stole michael claytons car and his computer and exactly what happened after that spinks paled a little but stood his ground why would i want to do something like that to avoid jail you mean confess to one crime and get off on another one something like that christ youre worse than the bloody criminals you lot are he turned to gristhorpe can he do that he asked has he got the authority i have said gristhorpe softly im a superintendent remember dont we need a lawyer or something whats wrong john said banks dont trust us i dont trust you anyway why talk to the monkey when the organgrinders here banks smiled it was working and he hadnt denied stealing claytons car yet theres a crown attorney in the building said gristhorpe and he can deal with the particulars about the charges and likely sentences if you want to talk to him spinks squinted maybe ill do that whats the deal you tell us what we want to know said gristhorpe and well see you stay out of jail dealing becomes simple possession thats not enough i want all charges dropped gristhorpe shook his head sorry son we cant do that you see the paperworks already in the system you can lose it maybe the odd sheet or two said gristhorpe but not all of it the lawyer will explain it spinks sat silently brow furrowed in thought banks stood up ive had enough of this he said to gristhorpe i told you it was no use his brains so addled he doesnt even recognize a piece of good fortune when he trips over it besides it makes me puke sitting with a drugdealing moron like him let him go to jail he belongs there let him catch aids see if i care and he headed towards the door wait just a minute said spinks holding his hand up hold your horses i havent said anything yet thats the problem said gristhorpe youd better make your mind up quickly sonny you dont get chances like this every day we can probably get it down to probation maybe a bit of community service but you cant just walk away from it spinks glared at banks who stood scowling with his hand on the doorknob then looked back at gristhorpe all benevolence and forgiveness then he put his feet on bankss desk all right he said all right youve got a deal get the brief in iv large raindrops blotched the pavement when owen left the pub lightning flickered in the north and the thunder grumbled like gods empty stomach the drinkers out on the muggy street hurried inside before the deluge arrived owen felt lightheaded after all the drinks and he knew he wasnt thinking clearly booze had made him just brave and foolhardy enough to face michelle he walked along the main road past pubs and shops open late head bowed jacket collar turned up in a futile attempt to keep dry shoplights and streetlights smeared the pavement and gutter hair that had been damp with sweat before was now plastered to his skull by rain he had forgotten exactly where he parked his car but it didnt matter michelles place couldnt be far he stopped a young couple coming out of a pub and asked them where her street was they gave him directions as they fiddled with their umbrella as he suspected it was only a couple of hundred yards up the road then left short right and left again he thanked them and walked on aware of them standing watching him from behind now he knew he was going to see her his mind shot off in all directions she wouldnt want to let him in of course not after what she had tried to do to him not after what she had said about him did he feel reckless enough to break in maybe he didnt know given the address her flat would probably be in one of those three or fourstory london houses perhaps if he waited outside for her to go out approached her in the streetshe might have to go to the shop or go out to meet someone but it was a bit late in the evening for that maybe if he waited until one of the other tenants went in he could get to the door before it locked and at least gain entry to the building a white sports car honked as he crossed a sidestreet against a red light he flicked the driver the v sign then caught his foot on the curb and stumbled bumping into an elderly man walking his dog in the rain the man gave him a dirty look adjusted his spectacles and walked on he turned left where the couple had told him to and found himself the only pedestrian in quiet backstreets the houses were all about three stories high divided into flats with a buzzer and intercom by the front door it wouldnt be easy many rooms were lit some without curtains and as he walked he looked in the windows and saw fragments of blue wall the top corner of a bookshelf a framed dali print an ornate chandelier flickering television pictures two people talking a cat sitting on the windowsill watching the raina panorama of life the walk had taken some of the steam out of owen but he still wanted to see michelle face to face if only to watch her squirm as he accused her of her crimes he climbed the steps and looked at the list by the door me chappel flat would that be on the first or second floor he didnt know he crossed the street and looked up both secondfloor windows were in darkness as were those on the ground floor on the first floor bluish light filtered through the curtains of one and the other was open to reveal a william morris wallpaper design that wasnt michelle at all the blue room was more like her he stood in the shadows wondering what to do rain drummed down an oily sheen on the street he didnt feel as brave now as he had on leaving the pub the booze had worn off and he had a headache he needed another drink but it was close to eleven the pubs would be closing besides michelle would probably be going to bed soon now he was here he couldnt wait until tomorrow a man and a woman huddled together under an umbrella approached the house turned up the path and climbed the steps the way they walked owen guessed they were a little tipsy probably unemployed and didnt have to go to work in the morning he shrank back into the shadows the man said something and the woman laughed she shook out her umbrella over the steps it wasnt michelle when she turned back to the door owen hurried across the street behind them it was a hell of a long shot but it might just work they had their backs turned the street wasnt well lit and they couldnt hear him because of the rain and the rumbles of thunder adrenalin pumped him up and seemed to rekindle some of the earlier bravado he was close now it all depended on how slowly the door closed on its spring behind them as soon as they were both inside and the man let go of the door owen dashed on tiptoe up the steps and put his hand out he stopped the door just before it had completely swung back and relatched he looked around at the houses across the street as far as he could make out nobody was watching him he heard another door open and close inside the building and the lights went on in one of the ground floor flats softly owen pushed the front door open and slipped inside v stafford oakes quickly assured spinks that the charges against him could be reduced to a manageable levelthe drugs especially add that he had no prior record that he had been upset over a missed job opportunity and any number of other mitigating circumstances that affected his stresslevel when he stole and crashed the car and hed probably get a few months community service lucky community so banks asked him when oakes had left why dont you tell us about it then well get the crown to put the lesser charges in writing more coffee cigarette spinks shrugged why not banks poured from the carafe he had had sent up off the record he asked did you steal michael claytons car on august last year spinks snapped the filter off the cigarette and lit it i dont remember the exact date but it was around then and i didnt steal it just borrowed it for a quick spin thats all why what do you mean why because he treated me like shit thats why fucking snob like i wasnt good enough to wipe his precious goddaughters nose with this was just after he and lady harrison found you and deborah drinking wine in the back garden yeah we werent doing no harm just having a barbie and a drop or two of the old vino he acted like it was too good for the likes of me it was only a fucking bottle of wine for christs sake hed no call to be so rude to me calling me an idle lout and a thickie and all that its not my fault i cant get a job is it and you did some damage to the car for revenge no it was an accident i was still learning wasnt i that cars got a very sensitive accelerator from what banks had heard of spinkss driving history so far it might be a good idea if the court could somehow prevent him from ever getting a license not that it seemed to have stopped him so far did you also take a notebook computer out of the car it was in the back seat under a coat did you take it spinks looked at gristhorpe its all right sonny the superintendent said you can answer any question chief inspector banks asks you with complete impunity uh come again no blame attached its all off the record none of it is being recorded or written down remember what the solicitor told you relax feel free spinks drank some coffee yes he said i thought it might be worth something and was it he shrugged piss all bloke on the market offered me seventyfive measly quid and the market vendor was reselling it for a hundred and fifty banks remembered a hundred and fifty quid for a sixthousandpound computer so you sold it to him thats right before you sold it did you use it at all me no dont know how to work those things do i what about deborah what about her she was a bright girl studied computers at school shed know how to get it going yeah well you were still seeing deborah at that time werent you yeah and did she ever visit your house yeah once or twice turned her nose up though said it smelled and it was dirty he laughed wouldnt use the toilet no matter how much she wanted to go right said banks now what id like to know john is did deborah have a go with the computer yeah well she did as a matter of fact he turned to gristhorpe as if for confirmation that he could continue with impunity gristhorpe nodded like a priest spinks went on yeah deb she was with me like when iyou knowwent for a ride deborah was with you when you stole michael claytons car yeah thats what i said only dont use that word stole i dont like it see it was even more in the family with her being there wasnt it just like borrowing the family car really did you ever tell him it was the two of you whod borrowed his car course not you think im stupid or something go on anyway she didnt like the idea at first no bottle hadnt deb but soon as i got us inside quiet as could be like and got that swedish engine purring she took to it like a duck to water didnt she it was deb noticed the computer said she was surprised clayton let it out of his sight given as how he was the kind of bloke couldnt even jot down a dental appointment without putting it on his computer i said lets just leave it but she said no she wanted to have a go on it so what did you do after wed finished with the car we went back to my house my mum was out as usual and i was feeling a bit randy by then after a nice fast drive i fancied a bit of the other but she went all funny like she did sometimes and after a while i didnt even want it any more she had a way like that you know she could be really offputting really cold the computer john yeah well once deb got it going i couldnt drag her away from it what about the password whatever it was if there was one it didnt take her very long i will say this though she seemed a bit surprised at how easy it was the password whatever it took to get the bloody thing going what did she say well bugger me not exactly those words mind you but that was the feeling she didnt like to swear didnt deb more like gosh or golly or something and then spinks shrugged then she just played around with it for a while i got bored and went upstairs for a liedown was she still playing with it when you went back down just finishing it looked like she was taking something out of it one of those little square things what do you call them a diskette thats right where did she get it from i dont know the computer was in a carrying case and there were a whole bunch of them there in little pockets like i suppose thats where she got it from what did she do with it put it in her pocket any idea what was on it no i asked her what she was up to but she told me to mind my own business did she do anything else with computer yeah she tapped a few keys watched the screen for a while smiled to herself funny like then turned it off and then she told me i could sell it if i wanted and keep the money he looked towards gristhorpe i mean she practically gave it to me right and it was in the family well he was her godfather anyway that has to count doesnt it its all right gristhorpe assured him youre doing fine just keep on answering the questions as fully and as honestly as you can spinks nodded did she tell you at any time what shed found on the computer no i mean i didnt pester her about it i could tell she didnt want to say anything if you ask me she found out hed been fiddling the books or something what makes you say that stands to reason doesnt it did she ever refer to the incident again no well it wasnt much more than a week or so later when her mother caught us in bed then it was cards for me on your bike mate do you know if michael clayton ever found out that you took it or that deborah used it i certainly didnt tell him maybe deb did but neither of them ever said anything to me about it and you got your seventyfive quid right is there anything else no thats everything ive told you everything he looked at gristhorpe can i go now alan banks nodded aye lad said gristhorpe off you go you wont forget our deal will you gristhorpe shook his head spinks cast a triumphant grin at banks and left christ said banks i need a drink to get the taste of shit out of my mouth after that gristhorpe laughed worth it though wasnt it come on ill buy weve got a bit of thinking to do before we decide on our next move but they hadnt got further than the starrs when banks heard his telephone ring he looked at his watch almost tenthirty id better take it he said why dont you go ahead ill meet you over there ill wait said gristhorpe it might be important they went into the office and banks picked up the phone chief inspector banks yes its vjeko vjeko batorac the voice sounded a little muffled and hoarse vjeko what is it is something wrong i thought i should tell you that ive jelačić was just here we fought he hit me what happened vjeko start from the beginning vjeko took a deep breath ive came here about a half an hour ago and he was a carrying a book of some kind a notebook i thought it was a diary bound in good leather written in english he said he thought it would make him rich he couldnt read english so he brought it to me to tell him what it said he said he would give me money vjeko paused that girl the one who was killed her name was deborah harrison wasnt it yes banks felt his grip tighten on the receiver go on vjeko it was her diary i asked him where he got it but he wouldnt tell me he wanted me to translate for him did you i looked at it then i told him it was nothing important not worth anything and he should leave it with me id throw it away what happened then he became suspicious he thought id found out something and wanted to cheat him out of his money i think he was hoping to find someone he could blackmail he said hed take it to mile mile can read some english too i said it was worthless and there was no point he tried to snatch it from my hand i held on and we struggled he is stronger than me chief inspector he hit me dragica was screaming and little jelena started crying it was terrible what happened ive ran away with the diary you said you read it some of it what did it say if i am right chief inspector that girl was in terrible trouble i think you should send someone to get it right away before ive does something crazy with it thanks vjeko banks said already reaching out to cut the call off stay where you are im calling west yorkshire cid right now jelačić was heading for mile paveličs house you said vi owen walked up the carpeted stairs in the dark to the firstfloor landing there he found a timerswitch on the wall and turned the light on he knocked on the door of flat noticing it didnt have a peephole and held his breath the odds were that if she had friends in the building especially friends who were in the habit of dropping by to borrow a carton of milk or to have a chat she would open it after all nobody had buzzed her and not just anyone could walk in from the street he heard the floor creak behind the door and saw the knob begin to turn what if it was on a chain what if she were living with someone his heart beat fast slowly the door opened yes michelle said no chain owen pushed michelle fell back into the room and the door swung fully open he shut it behind him and leaned back on it michelle had stumbled into her sofa she was wearing a darkblue robe silky in texture and it had come open at the front quickly she wrapped it around herself and looked at him you what the hell do you want there was more anger than fear in her voice thats a good question that is after what youve done to me youve been drinking youre drunk so what im going to call the police michelle lunged for the telephone but owen got there first and knocked it off its stand this wasnt going the way he had hoped he had just wanted to talk find out why she had it in for him but she was making it difficult they faced each other like hunter and prey for a few seconds completely still breathing hard muscles tense then she ran for the door owen got there first and pushed her away this time she tipped backwards over the arm of the sofa owen walked towards her her robe had risen up high over her thighs and split open at her loins to show the triangle of curly golden hair owen stopped in his tracks michelle gave him a cool scornful look covered herself up and sat down well then she said pushing her hair back behind her ears so youre here i must admit im a bit surprised but maybe i shouldnt be she reached for a cigarette and lit it with a heavy tablelighter blowing the smoke out through her nose he remembered the mingled taste of tobacco and toothpaste on her mouth in bed after lovemaking why dont you sit down she said arent you frightened michelle laughed and put her little pink tongue between her teeth should i be her blue eyes looked cool in control her long smooth neck rose out of the gown elegant and graceful even at twentyfour she still looked like a teenager it was partly the flawless marble complexion the delicately chiseled nose and lips whose fine lines any sculptor would be proud of but it was mostly in her character owen realized not her looks she was the cruel teenager who called others names the leader of the gang who suggested new cruelties new kicks with not a care in the world for the feelings of the ones she bullied and taunted if you really believe i murdered those women then you should be scared he said they looked like you you know you were killing me by proxy is that what youre saying can you give me one good reason why i shouldnt youre not afraid because you know i didnt do it am i right well michelle said i really found it hard to believe you had the guts ill admit but then i was mistaken enough to think it takes guts to strangle a woman and you found out different she frowned what do you mean you did it didnt you michelle im not sure about the first one about deborah harrison but you did the second didnt you you killed her to frame me or you got someone to do it michelle laughed and glanced towards the door again youre mad she said paranoid if you think id do something like that go to all that trouble youre insane she stood up and walked over to the cocktail cabinet her legs swished against the robe owen stayed close to her id offer you a drink she said but i think youve had too much already why did you do it michelle for gods sake why she raised her eyebrows why did i do what you know what i mean kill that girl to implicate me you broke into my house stole the film container with my fingerprints on it and took hairs from my pillow then you messed the place up to make it look like a hatecrime michelle shook her head youre crazy she poured neat scotch into a crystal glass owen could see her hand was shaking and what you said to the police about us he pressed on that stuff in the newspapers why did you tell those lies about me they paid well she laughed not the police the newspapers and i didnt kill anyone dont be an idiot owen i couldnt do anything like that besides i didnt tell any lies you know it didnt happen like that its all versions owen thats how it happened from my perspective im willing to admit yours might be different im sorry i know i shouldnt sound so ungrateful you did help me through college you helped me financially you gave me somewhere to live and you certainly helped with my marks it was fun for a while but youd no right to start spying on me following me everywhere i went you didnt own me and you had no right to throw me out in the street like that nobody ever treats me like that her eyes blazed like ice funfor a while michelle i was in love with you we were going toi cant believe youd say that make it all sound so meaningless why do you hate me so much she shrugged i dont hate you i just dont give a damn about you one way or another you bitch owen stepped towards her she stood her ground by the cabinet and sipped her drink then she jerked her head back to toss her hair over her shoulders again it was a gesture he remembered she looked at him down her nose lips curled in a sneer of contempt oh come on owen she said twisting the belt of her robe around one finger you can do better than that or cant you do you have to murder schoolgirls these days to get your rocks off the smile tormented him a little crooked icy in the eyes and wholly malevolent im glad youve found something that turns you on at last what are you going to do owen kill me too do you know what i dont think you can do it thats why you have to do it to the schoolgirls and pretend its me isnt that true owen owen snatched the tumbler from her hand and tossed it back in one more dutch courage is that what you need i still dont believe he didnt know how it happened one moment he was looking at his own reflection in her pupils and the next he had his hands around her throat he shoved her back against the cabinet knocking bottles and glasses over she clawed at his eyes but her arms werent long enough she scratched and pulled at his wrists making gurgling sounds deep in her throat back bent over the cabinet feet off the ground kicking him he was throttling her for everything shed ever done to him for being a faithless whore and spreading her legs for anyone who took her out for an expensive dinner for telling the whole country he was a sick pervert who would be in jail if there were any real sting in the justice system for framing him and he was strangling her for everything else too his arrest the humiliation and indignity of jail the loss of his friends his job the whole edifice that had been his life exploded in a red cloud and his veins swelled with rage for all that and for treating him like a fool like someone she could keep on a string and order around someone she didnt even believe had the courage to kill her he pressed his fingers deep into her throat one of her wild kicks found his groin he flinched in pain but held on shoving her hard up against the wall she was sitting on the top of the cabinet among the broken crystal and spilled liquor her legs wrapped around him in a parody of the sex act he could smell gin and whisky the robe under her thighs was sodden with blood and booze as if she had wet herself michelle continued to flail around knocking over more bottles making rasping sounds once she pushed forward far enough that her nails raked his cheek just missing his eyes but just as suddenly as it had started it was over owen loosened his grip on her throat and she slid off the cabinet onto the floor leaning back against it not moving someone hammered on the door and yelled michelle are you all right owen stood for a moment trying to catch his breath and grasp the enormity of what he had done then he opened the door and rushed past the puzzled neighbor back down to the street vii i think deborah harrison lied to her mother about losing her diary banks said to gristhorpe as they waited for ken blackstones call it was well after closingtime no hope of a pint now i think she kept it hidden so it would seem gristhorpe agreed the question is how did it get into jelačićs hands we already know he couldnt have been in eastvale the evening she was killed even if the diary had been in her satchel jelačić couldnt have taken it i think i know the answer to that banks said rebecca charters surprised someone in the graveyard yesterday in the wooded area behind the inchcliffe mausoleum i thought nothing of it at the timeshe didnt get a good look at whoever it wasbut now it seems too much of a coincidence ill bet you a pound to a penny it was jelačić it was hidden there banks nodded and he knew where hed seen her hide it when pierce was released and i went to question jelačić again last week he must have remembered it and thought there might be some profit in getting hold of it its ironic really that open satchel always bothered me when i first saw it i thought the killer might have taken something incriminating and most likely got rid of it but lady harrison told me deborah had lost her diary i saw no reason why either of them would lie about that unless there were secrets in it that deborah didnt want anyone to stumble across or lady harrison if you think about it either of them could have lied sir geoffrey had already told me that deborah did have a diary so his wife could hardly deny its existence but she could say deborah had told her she lost it and wed have no way of checking yes and we probably wouldnt even bother looking for it which we didnt didnt the socos search the graveyard the day after deborahs murder they did a ground search we werent looking for a murder weapon just deborahs knickers and anything the killer might have dropped in the graveyard all we found were a few empty fag packets and some butts most of those were down to jelačić who we knew had worked in the graveyard anyway we put the rest down to st marys girls sneaking out for a smoke besides its only in books that murderers stand around smoking in the fog while they wait for their victims especially since now everyone knows weve a good chance of getting dna from saliva what about the inchcliffe mausoleum deborah could have gained access to that couldnt she yes but we searched that too after we found the empty bottles at least the phone rang banks grabbed the receiver alan its ken blackstone sorry it took so long any luck weve got him great did he give you any trouble he picked up a bruise or two in the struggle turns out hed just left paveličs house when our lads arrived they followed him across the waste ground he saw them coming and made a bolt for it right across york road and down into richmond hill when they finally caught up with him he didnt have the diary bankss spirits dropped didnt have it but ken hold your horses mate seems he dumped it when he realized he was being chased didnt want to be caught with any incriminating evidence on him anyway our lads went back over the route hed taken and we found it in a rubbish bin on york road banks breathed a sigh of relief what do you want us to do with him blackstone asked its midnight now itll be going on for two in the morning by the time we get him to eastvale you can sit on him overnight banks said nobody in this case is going anywhere in a hurry have him brought up in the morning but ken yes it is deborah harrisons diary have you read it enough and if it means what i think it does alan its dynamite tell me about it and blackstone told him chapter i at ten oclock the next morning with jelačić cooling his heels in a cell downstairs banks sat at his desk coffee in hand lit a cigarette and opened deborah harrisons diary ken blackstone had given him the gist of it over the phone the previous eveningand he had not slept well in consequencebut he wanted to read it for himself before making his next move like the inside of the satchel flap it was inscribed with her name and address in gradually broadening circles from deborah catherine harrison to the universe first he checked the section for names addresses and telephone numbers but found nothing out of the ordinary only family and school friends then he started to flip the pages he soon found that many of her entries were factual with little attempt at analysis or poetic description some days she had left completely blank and it wasnt until summer when she had supposedly lost it that the diary got really interesting august yawn this must be the most boring summer there has ever been in my entire existence went shopping today in the swainsdale center just for something to do what a grim place absolutely no decent shoes there at all and full of local yokels and horrible scruffy women dragging around even more horrible dirty children i must work hard on mummy and persuade her to take me shopping to paris again soon or i swear i shall just die from the boredom of this terrible provincial town in the shopping center i met that common little tart tiffy huxtable from dressage she was with some friends and asked if id like to hang around with them they didnt look very interesting they were all just sitting around the fountain looking scruffy and stupid but there was one fit lad there so i said i might drop by one day life is so yawn boring that i really might do oh how i do so need an adventure there were no entries for the next few days then came this august tiffys crowd are a bunch of silly common bores just as i thought all they can talk about is television and football and sex and pop music i mean really darling who gives a damn im sure not one of them has read a book in years quite frankly id rather stay at home and watch videos tracy banks seems quite intelligent but it turns out that shes a policemans daughter of all things one boy looks a bit like that really cool actor from neighbors and wears a great leather jacket he really does have very nice eyes too with long lashes after that things started to move quickly august john oh such disappointment what a terribly common dull and ordinary name like tracy stole a car tonight and took me for a joyride me little miss goodytwoshoes it was brill if daddy knew about it he would have apoplexy it wasnt much of a car just a poky little astra but he drove it really fast out past helmthorpe and parked in a field it was so exciting even though i was a bit frightened wed get caught by the police when we parked he was like an octopus i told him im not the kind of girl who does it the first time you go out even if he did steal a car for me lads i ask you he asked me what he could do the first time and i told him we could just kiss i really didnt mind when he put his tongue in my mouth but i wouldnt let him touch my breasts i didnt tell him i had never done it before though i came close with pierre at montclair last year and if he hadnt been too much in a hurry and had that little accident first we might have done it then three days later she wrote august tonight in another borrowed car as john calls them we actually did it for the first time i made him take a van this time because its cramped in a little astra and we went in the back i wasnt going to go all the way at first but things just got out of control it didnt hurt like they say it does i dont know if i like it or not i did feel excited and sinful and wicked but i dont think i had an orgasm i dont really know because i dont know what they feel like but the earth didnt move or anything like that and i didnt hear bells ringing just a funny feeling between my legs and i felt a bit sore after i wonder if i will ever have multiple orgasms charlene gregory at school told me she can have orgasms just from the vibrations of the engine when shes on a bus but i dont believe her and kirsty mccracken says she can get them from rubbing against her bicycle saddle while shes riding maybe thats true i sometimes feel a bit funny when im horseriding anyway when he finished it was really disgusting the way he just tied a knot in the condom and threw it out of the window into the field and then he didnt even seem to want to talk to me all the way back is this what happens when you give in to lads and let them have what they want thats what mummy would say even though she is french and theyre supposed to be so sexy and all august john came to the house today mummy was out and he wanted us to go and do it upstairs but i was too frightened wed get caught anyway we barbecued some hot dogs on the back patio and i took a bottle of fathers special wine from the cellar and we drank that of course mother came home she was very nice about it really but i could tell she didnt like john uncle michael was there too and i could tell he really hated john on sight john says nobody ever gives him a chance august they all went to leeds todaymummy and daddy and uncle michaelto some naff cocktail party or other so i told john he could come over to the house again this time i knew theyd be gone a long time so we did it in my bed how sinful how wickedly deliciously sinful i dont know if i had an orgasm or not but i certainly tingled a bit and i didnt feel at all sore john wants me to do it without a condom but i told him not to be stupid i wouldnt even think of it i dont want to get pregnant with his baby or get some sexual disease that hurt him that i thought he would have some disease to pass on to me he can be so childish at times childish and boring but it wasnt until a later entry that banks found out for himself what ken blackstone meant when he said the diary might be dynamite august i can hardly believe it uncle michael is in love with me he says he has loved me since i was twelve and has even spied on me getting undressed at montclair he says i look like botticellis venus which is stretching it a bit if you ask me i remember seeing it in the uffizi when mummy and i went to florence last year and i dont look a bit like her my hairs not as long for a start and its a different color i never thought uncle michael knew literature and art at all some of what he wrote sounds very poetic and its all about me i dont know what i shall do for the moment it will be my little secret hes not really my uncle of course just my dads friend so i suppose it is all right for him to be in love with me its not incest it feels funny though because ive known him forever oops i forgot to say how i know last night john and me stole uncle michaels car because he was so beastly to him last week at the barbecue now i know why uncle michael must have been jealous well uncle michael had left his computer in the back seat we took it to johns house and thank the lord his horrible smelly mother was outshe really gives me the creepsand i couldnt get into all his technical stuff but it only took me about fifteen minutes to get the password to his wordprocessing directories its montclair of course after that it was easy uncle michael puts everything on his computer even his shoppinglists when id finished i reformatted his hard drive thatll show him banks put the diary aside and walked to the window midmorning on a hot and humid june day cobbled market square already full of cars and coaches he wondered if this summer was going to be as hot as the last one he hoped not naturally there was no airconditioning in eastvale divisional hq or in the whole of eastvale as far as he knew you just had to make do with open windows and fansnot a lot of use when theres no breeze and the air is hot the diary wasnt evidence of course deborah harrison had read some of michael claytons private files and discovered that he was sexually infatuated with her it didnt mean that he had killed her but as banks sat down again and read on it became increasingly clear that clayton in all likelihood had killed deborah the telephone rang banks picked it up and sergeant rowe told him there was a detective sergeant leaside calling from swiss cottage banks frowned he didnt recognize the name better put him on leaside came on its about a woman called michelle chappel he said i understand from the pnc that she was part of a case youve been involved in recently up there banks gripped the receiver tightly yes why whats happened shes been assaulted sir quite badly lacerations and bruises attempted strangulation rape no sir i was wonderingwe got a description of the suspect from a neighbor he read the description yes banks said when hed finished dammit yes that sounds like owen pierce all right thanks sergeant well keep an eye open for him ii ive jelačić was surly after his night in the cells banks had him brought up to an interview room and left him alone there for almost an hour before he and superintendent gristhorpe went in to ask their questions they didnt turn the tape recorder on well ive said banks youre in a lot of trouble now you know that what trouble i do nothing where did you get that diary what diary i never see that before you policeman put it on me banks sighed and rubbed his forehead he could see it was going to be one of those days ive he said patiently both mile pavelič and vjeko batorac have seen you with the diary you asked them to read it for you you even hit vjeko when he tried to hang onto it i remember nothing of this i do nothing wrong vjeko and i we quarrel is not big deal come on lad said gristhorpe help us out here i know nothing gristhorpe gestured for banks to follow him out of the room he did so and they stood silently in the corridor for a few minutes before going back inside it seemed to work jelačić was certainly more nervous than he had been before where you go he asked what you do listen to me ive said banks im only going to say this once and ill say it slowly so that you understand every word if it hadnt been for you an innocent man might not have spent over six months in jail suffered the indignity of a trial and incurred the wrath of the populace in other words you put owen pierce through hell and even though hes free now a lot of people still think he really killed the girls jelačić shrugged maybe he did maybe court was wrong but more important even than owen pierces suffering is ellen gilchrists life if it hadnt been for you ive jelačić that girl might not have had to die i tell you before in my country many people die nobody ca banks slammed his fist on the flimsy table shut up i dont want to hear any more of your whining selfjustification and selfpity you snivelling little turd do you understand me jelačićs eyes were wide open now he nodded and glanced over at gristhorpe for reassurance he wasnt going to be left alone with this madman gristhorpe remained expressionless because of you an innocent girl was brutally murdered now i might not be able to charge you with murder as i would like to do but ill certainly get something on you thatll put you away for a long long time understand me i want lawyer shut up youll get a lawyer when were good and ready to let you for the moment listen now i dont think well have much trouble getting daniel and rebecca charters to testify that you tried to extort money from them in order to alter the story you told against daniel charters thats extortion for a start and well also get you for tampering with evidence wasting police time and charges too numerous to mention and do you know what will happen ive well get you sent back to croatia is what no you cannot do that i am british citizen banks looked at gristhorpe and the two of them laughed well maybe thats true banks said but you do know who deborah harrisons father is dont you hes sir geoffrey harrison a very powerful and influential man when it comes to government affairs even you must know something of the way this countrys run ive what would you say for your chances now jelačić turned pale and started chewing his thumbnail are you going to cooperate i know nothing banks leaned forward and rested his elbows on the table ive ill say this once more and then its byebye if you dont tell us what you know and where you found the diary then ill personally see to it that youre parachuted right into the middle of the war zone clear jelačić sulked for a moment then nodded good im glad we understand one another and just because youve behaved like a total pillock theres one more condition jelačićs eyes narrowed you drop all charges against daniel charters and make a public apology jelačić bristled at this but after huffing and puffing for a minute or two agreed that he had in fact misinterpreted the ministers gesture banks stood up and took jelačićs arm right lets go they drove him to st marys and he led them along the tarmac path onto the gravel one and into the thick woods behind the inchcliffe mausoleum a good way in he paused in front of a tree and said here banks looked at the tree but could see nothing out of the ordinary no obvious hidingplace then jelačić reached his hand up and seemed to insert it right into the solid wood itself it was then that banks noticed something very odd about the yew trees not very tall but often quite wide in circumference they were hard strong and enduring some of the older ones must have been thirty feet around and had so many clustered columns they looked like a fluted pillar the one they stood before had probably been around since the seventeenth century the columns were actually shoots pushing out from the lower part of the bole growing upwards and appearing to coalesce with the older wood making the tree look as if it had several trunks all grafted together it also he realized provided innumerable nooks and crannies to hide things what deborah had sought out for a hidingplace and jelačić had seen her use was a knothole in this old yew angled in such a way that it was invisible when you looked at it straight on banks moved jelačić aside and reached his hand inside the tree all he felt was a bed of leaves and strips of bark that had blown in over the years but then when he started to dig down and sweep some of this detritus aside he was sure his fingers brushed something smooth and hard quickly he reached deeper estimating that deborah could have easily done the same with her long arms at last he grasped the package and drew it out gristhorpe and jelačić stood beside him watching looks like you missed the jackpot ive banks said it was a small square object wrapped in black binliner folded over several times for good insulation when banks unfolded it he brought out what he had hoped for a computer diskette iii back at the station banks handed the floppy disk to susan gay and asked her if she could get a printout of its contents he hoped it had survived winter in the knothole of the yew it should have done it had been wrapped in plastic and buried under old leaves wood chips and scraps of bark which would have helped preserve it and the winter hadnt been very cold ten minutes later susan knocked sharply on bankss office door and marched in brandishing a sheaf of paper her hand was shaking and she looked pale i think youd better have a look at this sir lets swap banks pushed the diary towards her and picked up the printout deborah deborah how the syllables of your name trip off my tongue like poetry when was it i first knew that i loved you i ask myself can i pinpoint the exact moment in time and space where that magical transformation took place and i no longer looked at a mere young girl but a shining girlchild upon whose every movement i fed hungrily when when did it happen oh deborah my sweet torturer why did i ever ever have to see you pass that moment from childhood to the flush of womanhood had you remained a mere child i could never have loved you this way i could never have entertained such thoughts about your straight and hairless childs body as i do about your womans body i seek you out yet i fly from you on the surface all appears normal but if people could see and hear inside me the moment you come into a room or sit beside me they would see my heart pulling at the reins and hear my blood roaring through my veins that day you won the dressage and walked towards me in your ridinggear that moist film of sweat glistening on the exquisite curve of your upper lipand you kissed me on the cheek and put your arm around mei felt your small breast press softly against my side and it was all i could do to remain standing let alone furnish the required and conventional praisewell donewell donewonderfulwell done my love my deborah the first time i saw you naked as a woman you were standing in the old bathtub at montclair looking like botticellis birth of venus remember my love there were no locks on the doors at montclair one simply knew when private rooms were engaged and refrained from entering mistakes were made of course but honest mistakes besides it was family they arent prudes about such things the french sylvies people i hoped only for a brief glimpse of your nakedness as you bathed i knew i couldnt linger that i must apologize and dash out as if i had a made a mistake before you even realized i had seen you so fast so fleeting a glimpse and even now i wonder what would have happened had i not witnessed you in your full glory for you were standing up reaching for the towel and your loveliness was on display just for me steam hung in the air and the sunlight that slanted through the high window cast rainbows all about you droplets of moisture had beaded on your flushed skin your wet hair clung to your neck and shoulders long strands pasted over the swellings of your new breasts where the nipples pink as opening rosebuds stood erect even that early in womanhood your waist curved in and swelled out at the narrow hips between your legs a tiny triangle of hair like spun gold lay on the mound of venus the paradise i dream of drops of water had caught among the fine curled hairs forming tiny prisms in the sunlight some just seemed to glitter in clear light like diamonds i have other images locked away inside me the thin black bra strap against your bare shoulder the insides of your thighs when you cross your legs and so it went on again it wasnt solid evidence but it was all they had banks had no choice but to act on it iv owen gazed out of the train window into the darkness rain streaked the dirty glass and all he could see was reflections of the lights behind him in the carriage he wished he could get another drink but he was on the local train now not the intercity and there was no bar service as the train rattled through a closed village station on the last leg of his journey owen thought again of how he had walked the london streets all night in the rain after killing michelle halfhoping the police would pick him up and get it over with halfafraid of going back to prison this time forever he had covered the whole urban landscape or so it seemed the west end where the bright neons were reflected in the puddles and the nightclubs were open occasional drunks and prostitutes shouting or laughing out loud rainswept wastelands of demolished houses where he had to pick his way carefully over the piles of bricks with weeds growing between them clusters of tower blocks surrounded by burnedout cars playgrounds with broken swings and broad treelined streets large houses set well back from the road he had walked through areas he wouldnt have gone near if he had cared what happened to him and if he hadnt been mugged or beaten up it wasnt for lack of carelessness but nothing had happened he had seen plenty of dangerouslooking people some hiding furtively in shop doorways or hanging around in groups smoking crack in the shadows of towerblock stairwells but noone had approached him police cars had passed him as he walked along finchley road or whitechapel high street but none had stopped to ask him who he was if he hadnt known different he would have said he was leading a charmed life at one point close to morning he had stood on a bridge watching the rain pit the rivers surface and felt the life of the city around him restful perhaps but never quite sleeping that hum of energy always there always running through it like the river did he didnt think it was westminster bridge but still wordsworths lines sprung into his mind words he had read and memorized in prison this city now doth like a garment wear the beauty of the morning silent bare ships towers domes theaters and temples lie open unto the fields and to the sky all bright and glittering in the smokeless air well perhaps the air wasnt exactly smokeless owen thought but one has to make allowances for time owen felt tired and empty so tired and so empty eastvale station was in the northeastern part of the town on kendal road a couple of miles east of north market street it was only a short taxiride to the town center but owen didnt want to go to the center or tired as he was home he was surprised the police werent waiting for him at the station as they probably would be at his house he didnt want to walk right into their arms and however empty he felt however final every second of continued freedom seemed he still didnt want to give it up just yet perhaps he thought he was like the cancer patient who knows theres no hope but clings onto life through all the pain hoping for a miracle hoping that the disease will just go away that it was all a bad dream besides he wanted another drink whatever his reasons he found himself walking along kendal road the day had been so hot and humid that the cooler evening air brought a mist that hung in the air like fog at the bridge he looked along the treelined banks towards town and saw the high threequarter moon and the floodlit castle on its hill reflected in the water all blurry in the haze of the summer mist walking on he came to the crossroads and saw the nags head well he thought with a smile it would do as well as anywhere he had come full circle v by the time banks and gristhorpe got chief constable riddles permission to bring michael clayton in for questioning which wasnt easy it was already dark one of the conditions was that riddle himself be present at the interview banks was pleased to see that clayton as expected was at least mildly intimidated by the sparse and dreary interview room with its faded institutionalgreen walls flyblown window table and chairs bolted to the floor and that mingled smell of urine and old cigarette smoke clayton made the expected fuss about being dragged away from his home like a common criminal to the police station but his confidence had lost a bit of its edge he was wearing sharpcreased gray trousers and a white shortsleeved shirt his glasses hung on a chain around his neck are you charging me with something clayton asked folding his arms and crossing his legs no said gristhorpe at least not yet chief inspector banks has a few questions he wants to ask you thats all jimmy riddle sat behind clayton in the far corner by the window so the suspect couldnt constantly look to him for comfort and reassurance riddle seemed folded in on himself legs and arms tightly crossed he had promised not to interfere but banks didnt believe it for a moment about what clayton asked about the murder of your goddaughter deborah harrison i thought youd finished with all that not quite he looked at his watch well youd better tell him to get on with it then ive got important work to do banks turned on the tape recorders made a note of the time and who was present then gave clayton the new caution the same one he had given owen pierce eight months ago formalities done he shuffled some papers on the desk in front of him and asked remember when we talked before mr clayton and i asked you if you had been having an affair with sylvie harrison clayton looked from gristhorpe to banks yes he said to the latter i told you it was absurd then and its still absurd now i know clayton swallowed what i said i know its absurd he shook his head so youre not still trying to accuse me of that then why and remember i suggested that deborah might have gained access to some sensitive business material or some government secret yes again ridiculous youre absolutely right you werent having an affair with sylvie harrison banks said slowly and deborah didnt gain access to any important government secrets we know that now i got it all wrong you were in love with your goddaughter with deborah thats why you killed her clayton paled thisthis is ludicrous he twisted around in his chair to look at riddle look jerry i dont know what theyre talking about youre their superior cant you do something riddle who had read both the diary and the computer journal shook his head slowly best answer the questions truthfully michael thats best for all of us while clayton was staring openmouthed at riddles betrayal superintendent gristhorpe dropped the printed computer journal on the table in front of him clayton first glanced at it then put his glasses on picked it up and read a few paragraphs then he pushed it aside what on earth is that he asked banks the product of a sick mind id say banks answered i hope youre not suggesting it has anything to do with me banks leaned forward suddenly snatched back the pages and slapped them down on the table oh stop mucking us about it came from your computer the one john spinks stole that day he took your car hes already told us all about that about how he saw deborah make a copy of the files onto a diskette you didnt know about that did you iwhere she kept it well hidden look you know its your journal dont deny it even in his shock clayton managed a thin smile and rallied his defenses deny it i most certainly do and im afraid youll have a hard job proving a wild accusation like that your suggestions are outrageous he glanced back at riddle and jerry knows it too theres absolutely nothing to link that printout with me it could have been written by anyone i dont think so said banks oh i know that deborah reformatted your hard drive well beyond anything an unerase or undelete command could bring back to life but you must admit the contents of the journal the circumstances all point to you very damning fiction said clayton pure fiction and fantasy just some poor lovestruck fool making things up theres nothing illegal in that theres no law against fantasies at least not yet maybe not said banks we never checked deborahs clothing for your hairs you know so you might not have left any blood or tissue but im willing to bet that if we went over the hair samples again now wed find a positive match that wouldnt be fantasy would it clayton shrugged so what it wouldnt surprise me deborah was my goddaughter after all we spent a lot of time togetheras a family besides i was in court for the socalled experts testimony hairs hardly prove a thing scientifically what about ellen gilchrist never heard ofwait a minute isnt that the other girl who was killed yes what if we found your hairs on her clothing too and hers on yours was she family a friend clayton licked his lips i never saw her in my life look i dont know what grounds youve got for assuming this but banks dropped a photocopy of deborahs diary in front of him read this he said clayton read his hands were shaking when he put the diary down fantasy he said straining to keep his voice steady thats not very much to go on is it it could be anyone come on michael said banks its all over admit it you know what happened youve just read her account deborah read your journal and found out youd been secretly lusting after her since she was twelve she was both shocked and excited by the idea but only by the idea she was flattered but still too much of a kid to know how serious it all was to you and she had a bit of a crush on you anyway so she teased you made up a bit of romance flirted a little the way young girls sometimes do to tease boys they know fancy them didnt she michael this is absurd youre not only insulting me youre also besmirching my goddaughters memory he looked around at riddle again sir geoff but banks cut him off besmirching thats a good word michael i like that besmirching sounds naughty very public school so lets talk about besmirching eventually when it became clear you wouldnt leave her alone deborah threatened to tell her father you knew that if sir geoffrey found out he would probably kill you at the very least it would mean the end of your business relationship that meant a lot to you didnt it michael the two old oxford boys still together after all these years sir geoffreys friendship meant a lot to you too but it didnt stop you lusting after his twelveyearold daughter a girl who wasnt even born when the two of you first met clayton glared the color drained from his face youll regret this he said glancing at both gristhorpe and riddle all of you will if you dont stop this right now banks could almost hear claytons teeth grinding together gristhorpe said nothing riddle polished his buttons with a virgin white handkerchief you waited for deborah in st marys graveyard banks continued calmly in the shrubbery that foggy monday evening when you knew she would be walking home alone from the chess club you were going to grab her and drag her into the bushes but when you saw her take the gravel path you followed her towards the inchcliffe mausoleum where you snatched her satchel and strangled her with the strap maybe she knew it was you and maybe she didnt maybe you talked first tried to persuade her not to say anything or maybe you didnt but thats what happened isnt it michael im saying nothing you didnt know she was going to pick up the diary shed been keeping and hiding ever since summer did you oh michael but if youd only been patient given her a few more seconds she would have led you straight to it and you probably wouldnt be here now isnt that how it happened i wont even dignify your accusation with a response when she told you shed read your computer journal deborah didnt tell you that shed copied the file about her onto a diskette did she but you knew she had a diary at one time you bought it for her thats another irony isnt it michael you knew shed told sylvie she lost it but i wouldnt be at all surprised if you had a good look around her room after you killed her after all you had your own key to sir geoffreys house and he and lady harrison were out even if they came back and found you there it wouldnt have surprised them and you opened deborahs school satchel too didnt you to see if she kept anything incriminating in there just in case the only place you couldnt really get access to was her school desk but you reasoned shed be unlikely to keep anything important or private there clayton put his hands over his ears this is ridiculous he said i dont have to listen to this youll never be able to prove anything i want now im only guessing banks went on so stop me if im wrong but i also think as you murdered deborah that you found out you liked it it stimulated you maybe you even had an orgasm as you tightened the strap around her neck i know you were far too clever to actually rape her because you know about dna and all that dont you but you did mess around with her clothing after you killed herpartly for pure pleasure id guess and partly to make it look like a genuine sex murder it was the same with ellen gilchrist wasnt it youd been over and over it in your mind all week planning how youd kill again anticipating the intimacy of it all and when you did it when you felt the strap tightening pulling her back against you feeling her soft flesh rubbing against you that excited you didnt it really banks chief constable riddle cut in from behind dont you think this is getting a little out of hand clayton turned and looked at riddle a cruel smile on his thin lips well thank you jerry for all your support youre absolutely right hes talking rubbish of course id never even met the girl that doesnt matter banks went on mentally kicking riddle and trying to ignore his interruption unlike deborah ellen gilchrist was a random victim wrong place wrong time you got lucky when owen pierce was arrested for the murder of deborah harrison didnt you you thought he would get convicted sentenced and that would be an end to it but when the trial was nearing its close you started to worry that he might get off the defense was good the prosecution had only circumstantial evidence and youd heard rumors about evidence that would have convicted pierce for certain had it been admissible but you saw it all slipping away and the focus perhaps shifting back towards you so you went to owen pierces house while the jury was deliberating and you either found the door open from a previous breakin or you broke in yourself and made it look like vandals it doesnt really matter which you took some hairs from owens pillow and you stole an open film container which you guessed would have his fingerprints on it you set out to deliberately frame owen pierce for the murder of ellen gilchrist knowing wed also put deborahs murder down to him too and close the file on both of them but you know what i think you also enjoyed it just the way you did with deborah and i think there would have been more if we hadnt caught you wouldnt there youve developed a taste for it this is insane clayton said and you cant prove a thing oh i think we can banks went on look what we proved against owen pierce and he didnt even do anything clayton smiled ah but he got off didnt he banks paused yes yes he did but maybe you should talk to him about that im sure hed be very interested to meet you getting off isnt all its cracked up to be in some cases see maybe youre right michael maybe we wont be able to convince a jury that a fine upstanding citizen like yourself murdered two young girls perhaps even with the evidence of the journal and the diary and the hairs if we find they match we wont be able to prove it to them but you know who will believe us dont you michael you know who knows quite well who uncle michael is who knows what montclair is and that there are no locks on the bathroom doors there you know exactly who will know who is the writer and whos the subject sir geoffrey will know and youll have gained nothing in some ways i think id rather take my chances with a jury or even go to jail than incur the wrath of sir geoffrey over such a matter as the murder of his only daughter by the man hes trusted for more than twenty years dont you clayton said nothing for a moment then he croaked i want my solicitor now get my solicitor right now im not saying another word bloody hell thought banks here we go again he called in the constable from outside the interview room take him down to the custody suite will you wigmore and make sure you let him call his lawyer vi owen sat in the nags head nursing his second pint and scotch chaser trying to pluck up the courage to go over the road and see rebecca and daniel the problem was he felt ashamed to face them they had believed in his innocence and he had let them down badly he knew that if there were to be any sort of salvation or reclamation in this business at all he would have to tell them the whole truth including what he had done to michelle and he didnt know if he could do that right now he could hardly even admit to himself that he had become exactly what everyone thought he was a murderer he looked around at the uninspiring decor of the pub and wondered what the hell he was doing here again it had seemed a nice irony when he saw the sign over the bridgefull circlebut now it didnt seem like such a good idea the nags head was boisterous with the landlord entertaining a group of cronies with dirty jokes around the bar and tables full of couples laughing and groups of underage kids whod had a bit too much he didnt know what he was going to do after he finished his drinks either go home and meet the police or have another and go face rebecca and daniel more drink wouldnt help with that though he realized he would feel less like facing them if he were drunk best drink up and turn himself in then return to the custody suite where he should feel quite at home by now what did you say owen looked up at the sound of the voice there was a lull in the conversation and laughter the landlord was collecting empty glasses he stood over owens table sorry mate he said i thought i heard you say something owen shook his head he realized he must have been muttering to himself he turned away from the landlords scrutiny he could still feel the man looking at him though recognition struggling to come to the surface he had a couple of days growth a few more pounds around the waist from lack of exercise and a prison pallor but other than that he didnt look too different from the person who had sat alone in that same pub one foggy night last november best finish his drinks and leave he decided tossing back the scotch in one and washing it down with beer then all of a sudden the landlord said bloody hell it is him i dont bloody believe it the nerve the men at the bar turned as one to look at owen its him the landlord repeated the one who was in here that night the one who murdered those two young lasses owen wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and stood up edging towards the door nay they let him off someone said aye but just because they hadnt got enough evidence another said dont you read tpapers it was a bloody coverup bleeding shame more like poor wee lasses a travesty of justice by the time owen actually got to the door a journey that felt like a hundred miles barstools were scraping against the stone floor and he was aware of a crowd surging towards him no time to sneak out surreptitiously now he dashed through the door and ran across kendal road luckily the traffic lights were in his favor when he got to the other side of the road he saw about five or six people standing outside the pub doors for a moment he thought they were going to give chase but someone shouted something he didnt hear and they went back inside owen still ran as if he were being chased there was only one place he could go now he dashed across north market street towards st marys church when he was through the gate running down the tarmac path he could see even in the mist that the kitchen light was on in the vicarage vii alone in his office at last banks went to close the blinds and looked out for a moment on the quiet cobbled market square and the welcoming lights of the queens arms maybe hed have a quick one there before going home still time finally he closed the blinds turned on the shaded tablelamp and lit a cigarette then he sifted through his tapes and decided on brittens third string quartet for a long time he just sat there smoking staring at the wall and letting brittens meditative quartet wash over him he thought about the clayton interview and especially about the new coldness in chief constable riddles manner towards his old lodge pal maybe riddle wasnt so bad after all at least he had an open enough mind to change his opinions when the facts started to weigh heavily against them then when his cigarette was finished banks turned to deborahs diary again striving once more to understand what had happened between her and clayton over the two months leading up to her death august disaster has struck mummy caught john and me in bed this afternoon she was supposed to be at one of her charity meetings but she wasnt feeling well and came home early it was a terrible scene with mummy and john shouting at one another and i didnt like to see john at all behaving like that i thought he was going to hit mummy in the end but he broke a vase on the wall and a piece of pottery cut mummys face then when hed gone mummy said i absolutely must not see him again or she would tell daddy then she cried and put her arms around me and i felt sorry for her john said such terrible things called her such horrible names and said he would do things to her i wont repeat even here in my private diary i dont care if i never see him again i hate him hes gross he even stole things from our house hes just a common thief a thief and a thickie what could i ever have seen in him august michael came to the house today while mummy and daddy were out he was absolutely livid about the other day with john i didnt know mummy had told him he called me names and i thought at one point he was going to hit me it was then i told him i couldnt help it i told him id read his journal about me and called him a dirty old man he went so white i thought he was going to faint then he asked me what i was going to do i said i didnt know id just have to wait and see wait for what he asked me to see what happens says i august michael really is rather handsome and much more intelligent and sophisticated than john mary taylor at school told me last term she had an affair with a married man a friend of her fathers who was years old and she says he was wonderful and considerate at sex and bought her presents and all sorts of things i think uncle michael might be even older than but hes not fat and ugly or anything like most old people september michael came for dinner tonight mummy and daddy were there of course i wore a tight black jumper and a short skirt out of the corner of my eye i could see him looking at my thighs and breasts when he thought i wasnt watching it really is amazing how he can seem so normal and ordinary when were all together but when theres just him and me hes so passionate and can hardly control himself september michael came again today when everyone was out he told me he felt such powerful desire for me he didnt know if he could control himself that was the word he used desire i dont think that anyone has ever desired me before it feels rather exciting of course he wanted to do it and when i said no he got all upset and said if i let a nogood lout like john spinks do it to me why wouldnt i let him i must admit i dont know the answer to that except that hes uncle michael and ive known him all my life september this is getting to be quite an adventure saw michael again today and let him kiss me again it made him happy for a while then he said he wanted to kiss my breasts i wouldnt let him do that but i let him touch them over my jumper while he was doing it he took my hand and held it to the front of his trousers so i could feel he was really hard i started to feel a bit scared because his grip was so strong and then i felt him go all wet and he gasped as if somebody had hit him just the way john used to do gross i cant explain why i felt it then but i started to panic a bit because id just been teasing really and this was uncle michael and even if he isnt really my uncle ive still known him since i was a little girl i just couldnt let him do it to me it wouldnt be right after hed finished he went all quiet so i left september school again sad sad sad saw mucky metcalfe in the corridor wonder if he knows i know hes been doing it with the vicars wife there were no more entries until october and banks assumed that deborah had been getting settled in at st marys again in the interim but even by late october michael clayton still hadnt got the message october cant uncle michael understand that whatever it was we had is over now ive told him i dont love him but it doesnt do any good he keeps coming to the house when he knows im here alone now he says he just wants to see me naked that he wont even touch me if i just take my clothes off in front of him and stand there the way i did in the bath at montclair i suppose its flattering in a way to have a sophisticated older man in love with you but to be honest he doesnt seem very sophisticated when he keeps wanting me to touch that hard thing in his pants i dont want to play any more i suppose he must still be living in hope but doesnt he understand that summers over and im back at school now obviously he didnt thought banks it hadnt been just a summer romance for michael clayton it had been a dark powerful obsession and beneath all the veneer of sophistication and experience deborah had simply been a naïve teenager misreading the depth of an older mans passion she was just a girl who thought she was a woman but even as deborah grew worried by claytons persistence she always kept her secret always lived in hope that he would simply give up and stop pestering her she clearly knew what dreadful consequences would occur if she told her parents and she wanted to avoid that if she could but clayton wouldnt give up and go away he couldnt he was too far gone her final entry dated the day before she died read november bonfire night yesterday uncle michael grabbed me and held my arm until it hurt and told me i had stolen his soul and all sorts of other rubbish i know it was cruel of me to tease him and to let him kiss me and stuff but it was just a game at first and he wouldnt let me stop it i want him to stop it now because im getting frightened the way he looks at me you still wouldnt believe it if you saw him with other people around but he really does change when hes only with me its like he has a split personality or something i told him if he doesnt promise to leave me alone ill tell daddy when i get home from school tomorrow i dont know if i will i dont really want to tell daddy because i know what he gets like and what trouble it will cause the house wont be worth living in anyway well see what happens tomorrow banks pushed the diary aside and lit another cigarette the gaslights around the market square glowed through the gaps in the blinds the quartet was reaching the end of its final movement now the moving introspective passacaglia written when britten was approaching death why do we feel compelled to record our thoughts and feelings in diaries and on tape banks wondered and our acts on video and in photographs perhaps he thought we need to read about ourselves or watch ourselves to know we are truly alive time after time it leads to nothing but trouble but still the politicians keep their diaries ticking away like time bombs and the sexual deviants keep their visual records and thank the lord they do without such evidence many a case might not even get to court when the music finished banks sat in silence for a while then stubbed out his cigarette just as he was about to get up and go for that pint before last orders the telephone rang he cursed and contemplated leaving it but his policemans sense of duty and his even deeperrooted curiosity wouldnt let him banks here sergeant rowe sir weve just had a report that owen pierce is at st marys vicarage who called it in rebecca charters sir the vicars wife she says pierce is ready to turn himself in for the murder of michelle chappel but shes not dead i suppose he doesnt know that all
