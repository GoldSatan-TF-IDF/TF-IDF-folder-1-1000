lois mcmaster bujold shards of honour to pat wrede for being a voice in the wilderness chapter one a sea of mist drifted through the cloud forest soft grey luminescent on the high ridges the fog showed brighter as the morning sun began to warm and lift the moisture although in the ravine a cool soundless dimness still counterfeited a predawn twilight commander cordelia naismith glanced at her team botanist and adjusted the straps of her biological collecting equipment a bit more comfortably before continuing her breathless climb she pushed a long tendril of fogdampened copper hair out of her eyes clawing it impatiently toward the clasp at the nape of her neck their next survey area would definitely be at a lower altitude the gravity of this planet was slightly lower than their home world of beta colony but it did not quite make up for the physiological strain imposed by the thin mountain air denser vegetation marked the upper boundary of the forest patch following the splashy path of the ravines brook they bent and scrambled through the living tunnel then broke into the open air a morning breeze was ribboning away the last of the fog on the golden uplands they stretched endlessly rise after rise culminating at last in the great grey shoulders of a central peak crowned by glittering ice this worlds sun shone in the deep turquoise sky giving an overwhelming richness to the golden grasses tiny flowers tussocks of a silvery plant like powdered lace dotted everywhere the two explorers gazed entranced at the mountain above enveloped by the silence the botanist ensign dubauer grinned over his shoulder at cordelia and fell to his knees beside one of the silvery tussocks she strolled to the nearest rise for a look at the panorama behind them the patchy forest grew denser down the gentle slopes five hundred meters below banks of clouds stretched like a white sea to the horizon far to the west their mountains smaller sister just broke through the updraftcurdled tops cordelia was just wishing herself on the plains below to see the novelty of water falling from the sky when she was jarred from her reverie now what the devil can rosemont be burning to make a stink like that she murmured an oily black column of smoke was rising beyond the next spur of the mountain slope to be smudged thinned and dissipated by the upper breezes it certainly appeared to be coming from the location of their base camp she studied it intently a distant whining rising to a howl pierced the silence their planetary shuttle burst from behind the ridge and boomed across the sky above them leaving a sparkling trail of ionized gases what a takeoff cried dubauer his attention wrenched skyward cordelia keyed her shortrange wrist communicator and spoke into it naismith to base one come in please a small empty hiss was her sole reply she called again twice with the same result ensign dubauer hovered anxiously at her elbow try yours she said but his luck was no better pack up your stuff were going back to camp she ordered double time they struggled toward the next ridge at a gasping jog and plunged back into the forest the spindly bearded trees at this altitude were often fallen tangled they had seemed artistically wild on the way up on the way down they made a menacing obstacle course cordelias mind ratcheted over a dozen possible disasters each more bizarre than the last so the unknown breeds dragons in map margins she reflected and suppressed her panic they slid down through the last patch of woods for their first clear view of the large glade selected for their primary base camp cordelia gaped shocked reality had surpassed imagination smoke was rising from five slagged and lumpy black mounds formerly a neat ring of tents a smouldering scar was burned in the grasses where the shuttle had been parked opposite the camp from the ravine smashed equipment was scattered everywhere their bacteriologically sealed sanitary facilities had been just downslope yes she saw even the privy had been torched my god breathed ensign dubauer and started forward like a sleepwalker cordelia collared him get down and cover me she ordered then walked cautiously toward the silent ruins the grass all around the camp was trampled and churned her stunned mind struggled to account for the carnage previously undetected aborigines no nothing short of a plasma arc could have melted the fabric of their tents the longlookedfor but still undiscovered advanced aliens perhaps some unexpected disease outbreak not forestalled by their monthlong robotic microbiological survey and immunizationscould it have been an attempt at sterilization an attack by some other planetary government their attackers could scarcely have come through the same wormhole exit they had discovered still they had only mapped about ten percent of the volume of space within a lightmonth of this system aliens she was miserably conscious of her mind coming full circle like one of her team zoologists captive animals racing frantically in an exercise wheel she poked grimly through the rubbish for some clue she found it in the high grass halfway to the ravine the long body in the baggy tan fatigues of the betan astronomical survey was stretched out full length arms and legs askew as though hit while running for the shelter of the forest her breath drew inward in pain of recognition she turned him over gently it was the conscientious lieutenant rosemont his eyes were glazed and fixed and somehow worried as though they still held a mirror to his spirit she closed them for him she searched him for the cause of his death no blood no burns no broken bonesher long white fingers probed his scalp the skin beneath his blond hair was blistered the telltale signature of a nerve disruptor that let out aliens she cradled his head in her lap a moment stroking his familiar features helplessly like a blind woman no time now for mourning she returned to the blackened ring on her hands and knees and began to search through the mess for comm equipment the attackers had been quite thorough in that department the twisted lumps of plastic and metal she found testified much valuable equipment seemed to be missing altogether there was a rustle in the grass she snapped her stun gun to the aim and froze the tense face of ensign dubauer pushed through the strawcolored vegetation its me dont shoot he called in a strangled tone meant to be a whisper i almost did why didnt you stay put she hissed back never mind help me look for a comm unit that can reach the ship and stay down they could come back at any time who could who did this multiple choice take your picknuovo brasilians barrayarans cetagandans could be any of that crowd reg rosemonts dead nerve disruptor cordelia crawled over to the mound of the specimen tent and carefully considered its lumps hand me that pole over there she whispered she poked tentatively at the most probable hump the tents had stopped smoking but waves of heat still rose from them to beat upon her face like the summer sun of home the tortured fabric flaked away like charred paper she hooked the pole over a halfmelted cabinet and dragged it into the open the bottom drawer was unmelted but badly warped and as she found when she wrapped her shirttail around her hand and pulled tightly stuck a few minutes more search turned up some dubious substitutes for a hammer and chisel a flat shard of metal and a heavy lump she recognized sadly as having once been a delicate and very expensive meterological recorder with these cavemans tools and some brute force from dubauer they wrenched the drawer open with a noise like a pistol shot that made them both jump jackpot said dubauer lets take it over by the ravine to try out said cordelia my skin is crawling anybody upslope could see us still crouching they made quickly for cover past rosemonts body dubauer stared back at it as they scuttled by ill at ease angry whoever did that is damn well going to pay for it cordelia just shook her head they knelt down in the brackenlike undergrowth to try the comm link the machine produced some static and sad whining hoots went dead then coughed out the audio half of its signal when tapped and shaken she found the right frequency and began the blind call commander naismith to survey ship rene magritte acknowledge please after an agony of waiting the faint staticscrambled reply wavered in lieutenant stuben here are you all right captain cordelia breathed again all right for now whats your status what happened dr ullerys voice came on senior officer in the survey party after rosemont a barrayaran military patrol surrounded the camp demanding surrender said they claimed the place by right of prior discovery then some triggerhappy loon on their side fired a plasma arc and all hell broke loose reg drew them off with his stunner and the rest of us made it to the shuttle theres a barrayaran ship of the general class up here were playing hideandseek with if you know what i mean remember youre broadcasting in the clear cordelia reminded her sharply dr ullery hesitated then went on right theyre still demanding surrender do you know if they captured reg dubauers with me is everybody else accounted for all but reg reg is dead a crackle of static hissed across stubens swearing stu youre in command cordelia cut in on him listen closely those twitchy militarists are not repeat not to be trusted on no account surrender the ship ive seen the secret reports on the general cruisers youre outgunned outarmored and outmanned but youve got at least twice the legs so get out of his range and stay there retreat all the way back to beta colony if you have to but take no chances with my people got that we cant leave you captain you cant launch a shuttle for a pickup unless you get the barrayarans off your neck and if we are captured the chances are better for getting us home through political channels than through some harebrained rescue stunt but only if you make it home to complain is that absolutely clear acknowledge she demanded acknowledged he replied reluctantly but captainhow long do you really think you can keep away from those crazy bastards theyre bound to get you in the end with scopes as long as possible as for youget going she had occasionally imagined her ship functioning without herself never without rosemont got to keep stuben from trying to play soldier she thought the barrayarans arent amateurs there are fiftysix lives depending on you up there you can count fiftysix is more than two keep it in mind all right naismith out cordelia good luck stuben out cordelia sat back and stared at the little communicator whew what a peculiar business ensign dubauer snorted thats an understatement its an exact statement i dont know if you noticed a movement in the mottled shade caught her eye she started to her feet hand moving toward her stunner the tall hatchetfaced barrayaran soldier in the green and grey splotched camouflage fatigues moved even faster dubauer moved faster still shoving her blindly behind him she heard the crackle of a nerve disruptor as she pitched backward into the ravine stunner and comm link flying from her hands forest earth stream and sky spun wildly around her her head struck something with a sickening starry crack and darkness swallowed her the forest mold pressed against cordelias cheek the damp earthy smell tickled her nostrils she breathed deeper filling her mouth and lungs and then the odor of decay wrung her stomach she turned her face from the muck pain exploded through her head in radiating lines she groaned inarticulately dark sparkling whorls curtained her vision then cleared she forced her eyes to focus on the nearest object about half a meter to the right of her head heavy black boots sunk in the mud and topped by green and grey splotched camouflage trousers encased legs spread apart in a patient parade rest she suppressed a weary whimper very gently she laid her head back in the black ooze and rolled cautiously onto her side for a better view of the barrayaran officer her stunner she stared into the little rectangle of its business end held steadily in a broad and heavy hand her eyes searched anxiously for his nerve disruptor the officers belt hung heavy with equipment but the disruptor holster on his right hip was empty as was the plasma arc holster on his left he was barely taller than herself but stocky and powerful untidy dark hair touched with grey cold intent grey eyesin fact his whole appearance was untidy by the strict barrayaran military standards his fatigues were almost as rumpled and muddy and stained with plant juices as her own and he had a raw contusion across his right cheekbone looks like hes had a rotten day too she thought muzzily then the sparkly black whirlpools expanded and drowned her again when her vision cleared again the boots were goneno there he was seated comfortably on a log she tried to focus on something other than her rebellious belly but her belly won control in a wrenching rush the enemy captain stirred involuntarily as she vomited but remained sitting she crawled the few meters to the little stream at the bottom of the ravine and washed out her mouth and face in its icy water feeling relatively better she sat up and croaked well the officer inclined his head in a shadow of courtesy i am captain aral vorkosigan commanding the barrayaran imperial war cruiser general vorkraft identify yourself please his voice was baritone his speech barely accented commander cordelia naismith betan astronomical survey we are a scientific party she emphasized accusingly noncombatants so i noticed he said dryly what happened to your party cordelias eyes narrowed werent you there i was up on the mountain assisting my team botanist and more urgently have you seen my botanistmy ensign he pushed me into the ravine when we were ambushed he glanced up to the rim of the gorge at the point where she had toppled inhow long ago was he a brownhaired boy her heart sank in sick anticipation yes theres nothing you can do for him now that was murder all he had was a stunner her eyes burned the barrayaran why were my people attacked he tapped her stunner thoughtfully in his palm your expedition he said carefully was to be interned preferably peacefully for violation of barrayaran space there was an altercation i was hit in the back with a stun beam when i came to i found your camp as you did good bitter bile soured her mouth im glad reg got one of you before you murdered him too if you are referring to that misguided but admittedly courageous blond boy in the clearing he couldnt have hit the side of a house i dont know why you betans put on soldiers uniforms youre no better trained than children on a picnic if your ranks denote anything but pay scale its not apparent to me he was a geologist not a hired killer she snapped as for my children your soldiers couldnt even capture them his brows drew together cordelia shut her mouth abruptly oh great she thought he hasnt even started to wrench my arms off and already im giving away free intelligence didnt they now vorkosigan mused he pointed upstream with the stunner to where the comm link lay cracked open in the brook a little sputtering of steam rose from the ruin what orders did you give your ship when they informed you of their escape i told them to use their initiative she murmured vaguely groping for inspiration in a throbbing fog he snorted a safe order to give a betan at least youre sure to be obeyed oh no my turn hey i know why my people left me behindwhy did yours leave you isnt ones commanding officer even a barrayaran one too important to mislay she sat up straighter if reg couldnt hit the side of a house who shot you thats fetched him she thought as the stunner with which he had been absently gesturing was swiveled back to aim on her but he said only that is not your concern have you another comm link oh howas this stern barrayaran commander dealing with a mutiny well confusion to the enemy no your soldiers trashed everything no matter muttered vorkosigan i know where to get another are you able to walk yet im not sure she pushed herself to her feet then pressed her hand to her head to contain the shooting pains its only a concussion vorkosigan said unsympathetically a walk will do you good how far she gasped about two hundred kilometers she fell back to her knees have a nice trip by myself two days i suppose you will take longer being a geologist or whatever astrocartographer get up please he unbent so far as to help her with a hand under her elbow he seemed curiously reluctant to touch her she was chilled and stiff she could feel the heat from his hand through the heavy cloth of her sleeve vorkosigan pushed her determinedly up the side of the ravine youre stone serious she said what are you going to do with a prisoner on a forced march suppose i bash in your head with a rock while you sleep ill take my chances they cleared the top cordelia draped herself around one of the little trees winded vorkosigan wasnt even breathing hard she noticed enviously well im not going anywhere till ive buried my officers he looked irritated its a waste of time and energy i wont leave them to the scavengers like dead animals your barrayaran thugs may know more about killing but not one of them could have died a more soldierly death he stared at her a moment face unreadable then shrugged very well cordelia began to make her way along the side of the ravine i thought it was here she said puzzled did you move him no but he cant have crawled far in his condition you said he was dead so he is his body however was still animate the disruptor must have missed his cerebellum cordelia traced the trail of broken vegetation over a small rise vorkosigan following silently dubauer she ran to the tailclad figure curled up in the bracken as she knelt beside him he turned and stretched out stiffly then began to shake all over in slow waves his lips drawn back in a strange grin cold she thought wildly then realized what she was seeing she yanked her handkerchief from her pocket folded it and forced it between his teeth his mouth was already bloody from a previous convulsion after about three minutes he sighed and went limp she blew out her breath in distress and examined him anxiously he opened his eyes and seemed to focus on her face he clutched ineffectually at her arm and made noises all moans and clotted vowels she tried to soothe his animal agitation by gently stroking his head and wiping the bloody spittle from his mouth he quieted she turned to vorkosigan tears of fury and pain blurring her vision not dead liar only injured he must have medical help you are being unrealistic commander naismith one does not recover from disruptor injuries so you cant tell the extent of the damage your filthy weapon has done from the outside he can still see and hear and feelyou cant demote him to the status of a corpse for your convenience his face seemed a mask if you wish he said carefully i can put him out of his suffering my combat knife is quite sharp used quickly it would cut his throat almost painlessly or should you feel it is your duty as his commander ill lend you the knife and you may use it is that what youd do for one of your men certainly and theyd do the same for me no man could wish to live on like that she stood and looked at him very steadily it must be like living among cannibals to be a barrayaran a long silence fell between them dubauer broke it with a moan vorkosigan stirred what then do you propose to do with him she rubbed her temples tiredly ransacking for an appeal that would penetrate that expressionless front her stomach undulated her tongue was woolly her legs trembled with exhaustion low blood sugar and reaction to pain just where is it youre planning to go she asked finally there is a supply cache locatedin a place i know hidden it contains communications equipment weapons foodpossession of it would put me in a position to ah correct the problems in my command does it have medical supplies yes he admitted reluctantly all right here goes nothing i will cooperate with yougive you my parole as a prisonerassist you in any way i can that does not actually endanger my shipif i can take ensign dubauer with us thats impossible he cant even walk i think he can if hes helped he stared at her in baffled irritation and if i refuse then you can either leave us both or kill us both she glanced away from his knife lifted her chin and waited i do not kill prisoners she was relieved to hear the plural dubauer was evidently promoted back to humanity in her strange captors mind she knelt down to try to help dubauer to his feet praying this vorkosigan would not decide to end the argument by stunning her and killing her botanist outright very well he capitulated giving her an odd intent look bring him along but we must travel quickly she managed to get the ensign up with his arm draped heavily over her shoulder she guided him on a shambling walk it seemed he could hear but not decode meaning from the noises of speech you see she defended him desperately he can walk he just needs a little help they reached the edge of the glade as the last level light of early evening was striping it with long black shadows like a tigers skin vorkosigan paused if i were by myself he said id travel to the cache on the emergency rations in my belt with you two along well have to risk scavenging your camp for more food you can bury your other officer while im looking around cordelia nodded look for something to dig with too ive got to tend to dubauer first he acknowledged this with a wave of his hand and started toward the wasted ring cordelia was able to excavate a couple of halfburned bedrolls from the remains of the womens tent but no clothes medicine soap or even a bucket to carry or heat water she finally coaxed the ensign over to the spring and washed him his wounds and his trousers as best she could in the plain cold water dried him with one bedroll put his undershirt and fatigue jacket back on him and wrapped the other bedroll around him sarong style he shivered and moaned but did not resist her makeshift ministrations vorkosigan in the meanwhile had found two cases of ration packs with the labels burned off but otherwise scarcely damaged cordelia tore open one silvery pouch added spring water and found that it was soyafortified oatmeal thats lucky she commented hes sure to be able to eat that whats the other case vorkosigan was conducting his own experiment he added water to his pouch mixed it by squeezing and sniffed the result im not really sure he said handing it to her it smells rather strange could it be spoiled it was a white paste with a pungent aroma its all right cordelia assured him its artificial blue cheese salad dressing she sat back and contemplated the menu at least its high in calories she encouraged herself well need calories i dont suppose you have a spoon in that utility belt of yours vorkosigan unhooked an object from his belt and handed it to her without comment it turned out to be several small useful utensils folded into a handle including a spoon thanks cordelia said absurdly pleased as if granting her mumbled wish had been a conjurors trick vorkosigan shrugged and wandered away to continue his search in the gathering darkness and she began to feed dubauer he seemed voraciously hungry but unable to manage for himself vorkosigan returned to the spring i found this he handed her a small geologists shovel about a meter long used for digging soil samples its a poor tool for the purpose but ive found nothing better yet it was regs cordelia said taking it it will do she led dubauer to a spot near her next job and settled him she wondered if some bracken from the forest might provide some insulation for him and resolved to get some later she marked out the dimensions of a grave near the place where rosemont had fallen and began hacking away at the heavy turf with the little shovel the sod was tough wiry and resistant and she ran out of breath quickly vorkosigan appeared out of the night i found some cold lights he cracked one pencilsized tube and laid it on the ground beside the grave where it gave off an eerie but bright bluegreen glow he watched her critically as she worked she stabbed away at the dirt resentful of his scrutiny go away you she thought and let me bury my friend in peace she grew selfconscious as a new thought struck hermaybe he wont let me finishim taking too long she dug harder at this rate well be here until next week if she moved fast enough she wondered irritably could she succeed in hitting him with the shovel just once go sit down with your botanist he was holding out his hand it dawned on her at last that he was volunteering to help dig oh she relinquished the tool he drew his combat knife and cut through the grasses roots where she had marked her rectangle and began to dig far more efficiently than she had what kind of scavengers have you found around here he asked between tosses how deep does this have to be im not sure she replied wed only been downside three days its a pretty complex ecosystem though and most imaginable niches seem to be filled hm lieutenant stuben my chief zoologist found a couple of those browser hexapeds killed and pretty well consumed he caught a glimpse of something he called a fuzzy crab at one of the kills how big were they asked vorkosigan curiously he didnt say ive seen pictures of crabs from earth and they dont seem very largeas big as your hand perhaps a meter may be enough he continued the excavation with short powerful bites of the inadequate shovel the cold light illuminated his face from below casting shadows upward from heavy jaw straight broad nose and thick brows he had an old faded lshaped scar cordelia noticed on the left side of his chin he reminded her of a dwarf king in some northern saga digging in a fathomless deep theres a pole over by the tents she offered i could fix that light up in the air so it shines on your work that would help she returned to the tents beyond the circle of cold light and found her pole where she had dropped it that morning returning to the gravesite she spliced the light to the pole with a few tough grass stems and fixed it upright in the dirt flinging the circle of light wider she remembered her plan to collect bracken for dubauer and turned to make for the forest then stopped did you hear that she asked vorkosigan what even he was beginning to breathe heavily he paused up to his knees in the hole and listened with her a sort of scuttling noise coming from the forest he waited a minute then shook his head and continued his work how many cold lights are there six so few she hated to waste them by running two at once she was about to ask him if he would mind digging in the dark for a while when she heard the noise again more distinctly there is something out there you know that said vorkosigan the question is the three creatures made a concerted rush into the ring of light cordelia caught a glimpse of fast low bodies entirely too many hairy black legs four beady black eyes set in neckless faces and razorsharp yellow beaks that clacked and hissed they were the size of pigs vorkosigan reacted instantly smashing the nearest accurately across its face with the blade of the shovel a second one flung itself across rosemonts body biting deep into the flesh and cloth of one arm and attempting to drag it away from the light cordelia grabbed her pole and ran full tilt upon it getting in a hard blow between its eyes its beak snapped the end off the aluminum rod it hissed and retreated before her by this time vorkosigan had his combat knife out he vigorously attacked the third shouting stabbing and kicking with his heavy boots blood spattered as claws plowed his leg but he got in a blow with his knife that sent the creature shrieking and hissing back to the shelter of the forest along with its pack mates with a moment to breathe he dug out her stun gun from the bottom of the toolarge disruptor holster where judging from his muttered swearing it had slipped down and stuck and peered into the night fuzzy crabs huh cordelia panted stuben im going to scrag you her voice squeaked upward and she clamped her teeth vorkosigan wiped the dark blood from his blade in the grass and returned it to its sheath i think your grave had better be a full two meters he said seriously maybe a little more cordelia sighed in agreement and returned the shortened pole to its original position hows your leg i can take care of it youd better see to your ensign dubauer drowsing had been aroused by the uproar and was attempting to crawl away again cordelia tried to soothe him then found herself having to deal with another seizure after which to her relief he went to sleep vorkosigan in the meanwhile had patched his scratch using the small emergency medical kit on his belt and returned to digging slowing down only a little getting down to shoulder depth he pressed her into hauling dirt up out of the grave using the emptiedout botanical specimen box as a makeshift bucket it was near midnight before he called from the dark pit that should be the last and clambered out could have done that in five seconds with a plasma arc he panted recovering his wind he was dirty and sweating in the cold night air tendrils of fog writhed up from the ravine and the spring together they dragged rosemonts body to the lip of the grave vorkosigan hesitated do you want his clothes for your ensign it was an unavoidably practical suggestion cordelia loathed the indignity of lowering rosemont naked into the earth but wished at the same time she had thought of it earlier when dubauer was so cold she horsed the uniform off over the stiffened limbs with the macabre sensation of undressing a giant doll and they tipped him into the grave he landed on his back with a muffled thump just a minute she dug out rosemonts handkerchief from his uniform pocket and jumped down into the grave slipping on the body she spread the handkerchief over his face it was a small realitydefying gesture but she felt better for it vorkosigan grasped her hand and pulled her up all right they shoveled and pushed the dirt back into the hole far more quickly than it had been excavated and packed it down as best they could by walking on it is there some ceremony you wish to perform vorkosigan asked cordelia shook her head not feeling up to reciting the vague official funeral service but she knelt by the grave for a few minutes making a more serious less certain inward prayer for her dead it seemed to fly upward and vanish in the void echoless as a feather vorkosigan waited patiently until she arose its rather late he said and we have just seen three good reasons not to go stumbling around in the dark we may as well rest here until dawn ill take the first watch do you still want to bash my head in with a rock not at the moment she said sincerely very well ill wake you later vorkosigan began his watch with a patrol of the perimeter of the glade taking the cold light with him it wavered through the black distance like a captive firefly cordelia lay down on her back beside dubauer the stars glimmered faintly through the gathering mist could one be her ship yet or vorkosigans not likely at the range they undoubtedly were by now she felt hollow energy will desire slipped through her fingers like shining liquid sucked away through some infinite sand she glanced at dubauer beside her and jerked her mind from the easy vortex of despair im still a commander she told herself sharply i have a command you serve me still ensign although you cannot now serve even yourself the thought seemed a thread to some great insight but it melted in her grasp and she slept chapter two they divided the meager spoils from the camp in makeshift backpacks and started down the mountain in the grey mist of morning cordelia led dubauer by the hand and helped him when he stumbled she was not sure how clearly he recognized her but he clung to her and avoided vorkosigan the forest grew thicker and the trees taller as they went down vorkosigan hacked through the undergrowth with his knife for a while then they took to the stream bed splashes of sunlight began to filter through the canopy picking out fiery green velvet humps of moss sparkling rills of water and stones on the stream bed like a layer of bronze coins radial symmetry was popular among the tiny creatures occupying the ecological niches held by insects on earth some aerial varieties like gasfilled jellyfishes floated in iridescent clouds above the stream like flocks of delicate soap bubbles delighting cordelias eye they seemed to have a mellowing effect on vorkosigan too for he called for a break from what seemed to her a killing pace they drank from the stream and sat a while watching the little radials dart and puff in the spray from a waterfall vorkosigan closed his eyes and leaned against a tree he was running on the ragged edge of exhaustion too cordelia realized temporarily unwatched she studied him curiously he had behaved throughout with curt but dignified military professionalism still she was bothered by a subliminal alarm a persistent sense of something of importance forgotten it popped out of her memory suddenly like a ball held underwater breaking the surface on release and arcing into the air i know who you are vorkosigan the butcher of komarr she immediately wished she had not spoken for he opened his eyes and stared at her a peculiar play of expressions passing across his face what do you know about komarr his tone added an ignorant betan just what everyone knows it was a worthless ball of rock your people annexed by military force for command of its wormhole clusters the ruling senate surrendered on terms and were murdered immediately after you commanded the expedition or surely the vorkosigan of komarr had been an admiral was it you i thought you said you didnt kill prisoners it was did they demote you for it she asked surprised she had thought that sort of conduct to be barrayaran standard not for that for the sequel he seemed reluctant to say more but he surprised her again by going on the sequel was more effectively suppressed i had given my wordmy word as vorkosiganthey were to be spared my political officer countermanded my order and had them killed behind my back i executed him for it good god i broke his neck with my own hands on the bridge of my ship it was a personal matter you see touching my honor i couldnt order a firing squadthey were all afraid of the ministry of political education that was the official euphemism for the secret police cordelia recalled of which political officers were the military branch and you arent theyre afraid of me he smiled sourly like those scavengers last night theyll run from a bold attack but one must not turn ones back im surprised they didnt have you hanged there was a great uproar behind closed doors he admitted reminiscently fingering his collar tabs but a vorkosigan cant be made to disappear in the night not yet i did make some powerful enemies ill bet this bald story told without adornment or apology had the ring of truth to her inner ear although she had no logical reason to trust him did you uh happen to turn your back on one of those enemies yesterday he glanced at her sharply possibly he said slowly there are some problems with that theory however like what im still alive i wouldnt have thought theyd risk starting the job without finishing it to be sure theyd be tempted by the opportunity to blame my death on you betans whew and i thought i had command troubles just keeping a bunch of betan intellectual prima donnas working together for months on end god keep me from politics vorkosigan smiled slightly from what ive heard of betans thats no easy task either i dont think i should care to trade commands it would irritate me to have every order argued over they dont argue every order she grinned as his crack ferreted up some particular memories you learn how to coax them along where do you suppose your ship is now wariness dropped across her amusement like a portcullis i suppose that depends on where your ship is vorkosigan shrugged and stood hitching his pack more securely to his shoulders then perhaps we should waste no more time finding out he gave her a hand to pull her up the soldiermask repossessing his features it took all the long day to descend the great mountain to the redsoiled plains a closer view found them cut and channeled by watercourses running turbid from the recent rains and confused by outcrops of rocky badlands they caught glimpses of groups of hexapedal grazers cordelia deduced from their wary herd behavior that associated predators must lurk nearby vorkosigan would have pushed on but dubauer was seized by a serious and prolonged convulsion followed by lethargy and sleepiness cordelia insisted adamantly on a halt for the night they made camp if one could so describe stopping and sitting down in an open gap in the trees perhaps three hundred meters above the levels they shared their simple supper of oatmeal and blue cheese dressing in a beatendown silence vorkosigan cracked another cold light as the last colors of a gaudy sunset drained from the sky and seated himself on a large flat boulder cordelia lay down and watched the barrayaran watching until sleep relieved her of her aching legs and head he woke her past the middle of the night her muscles seemed to screech and creak as she rose stiffly to take her watch this time vorkosigan gave her the stunner i havent seen anything close he commented but something out there makes a hellish racket from time to time it seemed an adequate explanation for the gesture of trust she checked dubauer then took her place on the boulder leaning back and staring up at the dark bulk of the mountain up there rosemont lay in his deep grave safe from the beaks and bellies of the carrion eaters but still doomed to slow decomposition she bent her nightwandering thoughts instead to vorkosigan lying nearly invisible in his camouflage fatigues in the border of the bluegreen light a puzzle within a puzzle he was clearly he must be one of the barrayaran warrior aristocrats of the old school at odds with the rising new men of the bureaucracy the militarists of both parties maintained a bastard uneasy alliance that controlled both government policy and the armed forces but at heart they were natural enemies the emperor subtly stabilized the delicate balance of power between them but there was not much doubt that on the clever old mans death barrayar was destined for a period of political cannibalism if not outright civil war unless his successor showed more strength than was currently expected she wished she knew more about the matrix of blood relationships and power on barrayar she could give the emperors family name vorbarra it being associated with the name of the planet but beyond that she was quite vague she absently fingered the little stunner and tantalized herself who now was the captive and who the captor but it would be nearly impossible to care for dubauer in this wilderness by herself she had to have supplies for him and since vorkosigan had been careful not to say exactly where his cache lay she needed the barrayaran to take her there besides she had given her parole it was a curious insight into vorkosigan that he should so automatically accept her bare word as binding he evidently thought along the same lines himself the east began to grow grey at last then peach green and gold in a pastel repeat of last nights spectacular sunset vorkosigan stirred and sat up and helped her take dubauer down to the stream to wash they had another breakfast of oatmeal and blue cheese dressing vorkosigan tried mixing his together this time for variety cordelia tried alternating bites to see if that would help neither commented aloud on the menu vorkosigan led northwest across the sandy brickcolored plain in the dry season it would have been neardesert now it was brightly decorated with fresh green and yellow growth and dozens of varieties of lowgrowing wildflowers dubauer did not seem to notice them cordelia saw sadly after about three hours at a brisk pace they came to their first check of the day a steep rocky valley with a coffeeandcreamcolored river rushing through it they walked along the edge of the escarpment looking for a ford that rock down there moved cordelia observed suddenly vorkosigan pulled his field scope from his belt and took a closer look youre right half a dozen coffeeandcreamcolored lumps that looked like rocks on a sandbar proved to be lowslung thicklimbed hexapeds basking in the morning sun they seem to be some sort of amphibian i wonder if theyre carnivores said vorkosigan i wish you hadnt interrupted my survey so soon cordelia complained then i could have answered all those questions there go some more of those soapbubble thingsgoodness i wouldnt have thought they could grow so big and still fly a flock of a dozen or so large radials transparent as wineglasses and fully a foot across came floating like a flight of lost balloons above the river a few of them drifted over to the hexapeds and settled gently on their backs flattening over their withers like weird berets cordelia borrowed the scope for a closer look do you suppose they could be like those birds from earth that pick the parasites off the cattle oh no i guess not the hexapeds roused themselves with hisses and whistles humping their bodies in a kind of obese bucking and slid into the river the radials colored now like wineglasses filled with burgundy inflated themselves and retreated into the air vampire balloons asked vorkosigan apparently what appalling creatures cordelia almost laughed at his revolted look as a carnivore yourself you cant really condemn them condemn no avoid yes ill go along with that they continued upstream past a frothing opaque tan waterfall after about a kilometer and a half they came to a place where two tributaries joined and stumbled across at the shallowest place they could find crossing the second branch dubauer lost his footing as a rock turned under him and went down with a wordless cry cordelia tightened her grip on his arm convulsively and perforce went with him slipping into a deeper area terror shook her that he might be swept downstream beyond her reachthose amphibious hexapeds sharp rocksthe waterfall careless of the water filling her mouth she grabbed him with both hands here they wentno something pulled her bodily with a tremendous countersurge against the rush of waters vorkosigan had grabbed her by the back of the belt and was hauling them both toward the shallows with the strength and style of a stevedore feeling undignified but grateful she scrambled to her feet and pushed the coughing dubauer up the far bank thanks she gasped to vorkosigan what did you think id let you drown he inquired wryly emptying his boots cordelia shrugged embarrassed wellat least we wouldnt be delaying you hm he cleared his throat but said no more they found a rocky place to sit eat their cereal and salad dressing and dry awhile before moving on kilometers fell behind them while their view of the great mountain to their right scarcely seemed to change at some point vorkosigan took a bearing known only to himself and led them more westerly with the mountain at their backs and the sun beginning to slant into their eyes they crossed another watercourse coming up over the lip of its valley cordelia nearly stumbled over a redcoated hexaped lying quite still in a depression and blending perfectly with its background it was a delicately formed thing as big as a middlesized dog and it rippled over the red plains in graceful bounds cordelia woke up abruptly that things edible the stunner the stunner cried vorkosigan she pressed it hastily into his hand he fell to one knee took aim and dropped the creature in one burst oh good shot cried cordelia ecstatically vorkosigan grinned like a boy over his shoulder at her and jogged after his prize oh she murmured stunned herself by the effect of the grin it had lit his face like the sun for that brief instant oh do that again she thought then shook off the thought duty stick to duty she followed him to where the animal lay vorkosigan had his knife out puzzling over where to begin he could not cut its throat for it had no neck the brain is located right behind the eyes maybe you could pith it going in between the first set of shoulder blades cordelia suggested that would be quick enough vorkosigan agreed and did so the creature shivered sighed and died its early to make camp but theres water here and driftwood from the river for a fire it will mean extra kilometers tomorrow though he warned cordelia eyed the carcass thinking of roast meat thats all right vorkosigan hoisted it to his shoulder and stood wheres your ensign cordelia looked around dubauer was not in sight oh lord she inhaled and ran back to the spot where they had been standing when vorkosigan had shot dinner no dubauer she approached the rim of the watercourse dubauer was standing by the stream arms hanging by his sides gazing upward blank and entranced floating softly down toward his upturned face was a large transparent radial dubauer no shrieked cordelia and scrambled down the bank toward him vorkosigan passed her with a bound and they raced for the waterside the radial settled over dubauers face and began to flatten and he flung up his hands with a cry vorkosigan arrived first he grabbed the halflimp thing with his bare hand and pulled it away from dubauers face a dozen dark tendrillike appendages were hooked into dubauers flesh and they stretched and snapped as the creature was ripped off its prey vorkosigan flung it to the sand and stamped on it as dubauer fell to the ground and curled up on his side cordelia tried to pull his hands away from his face he was making strange hoarse noises and his body shook another seizure she thoughtbut then realized with a shock that he was weeping she held his head on her lap to stop the wild rocking the spots where the tendrils had penetrated his skin were black in the center surrounded by rings of red flesh that were beginning to swell alarmingly there was a particularly nasty one at the corner of his eye she plucked one of the remaining embedded tendrils out of his skin and found it burned her fingers acidly apparently the creature had been coated all over with a similar poison for vorkosigan was kneeling with his hand in the stream she quickly pulled the rest of them and called the barrayaran over to her side have you got anything in your kit that will help this only the antibiotic he handed her a tube and she smeared some on dubauers face it was not really a proper burn ointment but it would have to do vorkosigan stared at dubauer a moment then reluctantly produced a small white pill this is a powerful analgesic i have only four it should carry him through the evening cordelia placed it on the back of dubauers tongue it evidently tasted bitter for he tried to spit it out but she caught it and forced him to swallow it in a few minutes she was able to get him to his feet and take him to the campsite vorkosigan chose overlooking the sandy channel vorkosigan meanwhile made a handsome collection of driftwood for a fire how are you going to light it inquired cordelia when i was a small boy i had to learn to start a fire by friction vorkosigan reminisced military school summer camp it wasnt easy took all afternoon come to think of it i never did get it started that way i lit it by dissecting a communicator for the power pack he was searching through his belt and pockets the instructor was furious i think it must have been his communicator no chemical starters cordelia asked with a nod to his ongoing inventory of his utility belt its assumed if you want heat you can fire your plasma arc he tapped his fingers on the empty holster i have another idea a bit drastic but i think it will be effective youd better go sit with your botanist this is going to be loud he removed a useless plasma arc power cartridge from a row on the back of his belt uh oh said cordelia moving away wont that be overkill and what are you going to do with the crater itll be visible from the air for kilometers do you want to sit there and rub two sticks together i suppose i had better do something about the crater though he thought a moment then trotted away over the edge of the little valley cordelia sat down beside dubauer putting an arm around his shoulders and hunching in anticipation vorkosigan shot back over the rim at a dead run and hit the ground rolling there was a brilliant bluewhite flash and a boom that shook the ground a large column of smoke dust and steam rose into the air and pebbles dirt and bits of melted sand began to patter down like rain all around vorkosigan disappeared over the edge again and returned shortly with a fine flaming torch cordelia went for a peek at the damage vorkosigan had placed the shortcircuited cartridge upstream about a hundred meters at the outer edge of a bend where the swift little river curved away to the east the explosion had left a spectacular glasslined crater some fifteen meters wide and five deep that was still smoking as she watched the stream eroded its edge and poured in billowing steam in an hour it would be scoured into a naturallooking backwater not bad she murmured approvingly by the time the fire burned down to a bed of coals they had cubes of dark red meat on sticks ready to broil how do you like yours vorkosigan asked rare medium i think it had better be well done suggested cordelia we hadnt completed the parasite survey yet vorkosigan glanced at his cube with a new dubiousness ah quite he said faintly they cooked it thoroughly then sat by the fire and tore into the smoking meat with happy savagery even dubauer managed to feed himself with small chunks it was gamey and tough burned on the outside and with a bitter undertaste but no one suggested a side dish of either oatmeal or blue cheese dressing cordelias humor was touched vorkosigans fatigues were filthy damp and splashed with dried blood from hacking up their dinner as were her own he had a threeday growth of beard his face glistened in the firelight with hexaped grease and he reeked with dried sweat barring the beard she suspected she looked no better and she knew she smelled no better she found herself disquietingly aware of his body muscular compact wholly masculine stirring senses she thought she had suppressed best think of something else from spaceman to caveman in three days she meditated aloud how we imagine our civilization is in ourselves when its really in our things vorkosigan glanced with a twisted smile at the carefully tended dubauer you seem able to carry your civilization on the inside cordelia flushed uncomfortably glad for the camouflaging firelight one does ones duty some people find their duty more elastic orwere you in love with him with dubauer heavens no im no cradle snatcher he was a good kid though id like to get him home to his family do you have a family sure my mom and brother back home on beta colony my dad used to be in the survey too was he one of those who never came back no he died in a shuttleport accident not ten kilometers from home hed been home on leave and was just reporting back my condolences oh that was years and years ago getting a little personal isnt he she thought but it was better than trying to deflect military interrogation she hoped fervently that the subject say of the latest betan equipment would not come up how about you do you have a family it suddenly occurred to her that this phrase was also a polite way of asking are you married my father lives he is count vorkosigan my mother was half betan you know he offered hesitantly cordelia decided that if vorkosigan full of military curtness was formidable vorkosigan trying to make himself pleasant was truly terrifying but curiosity overcame the urge to cut the conversation short thats unusual how did that happen my maternal grandfather was prince xav vorbarra the diplomat he held the post of ambassador to beta colony for a time in his youth before the first cetagandan war i believe my grandmother was in your bureau for interstellar trade did you know her well after my motherdied and yuri vorbarras civil war was brought to an end i spent some school vacations at the princes home in the capital he was at odds with my father though before and after that war being of different political parties xav was the leading light of the progressives in his day and of course my father wasispart of the last stand of the old military aristocracy was your grandmother happy on barrayar cordelia estimated vorkosigans school days were perhaps thirty years ago i dont think she ever adjusted completely to our society and of course yuris war he trailed off then began again outsidersyou betans particularlyhave this odd vision of barrayar as some monolith but we are a fundamentally divided society my government is always fighting these centrifugal tendencies vorkosigan leaned forward and tossed another piece of wood onto the fire sparks cascaded upward like a stream of little orange stars flowing home to the sky cordelia felt a sharp longing to fly away with them what party has your allegiance she asked hoping to keep the conversation on a less unnervingly personal plane do you stand with your father while he lives i always wanted to be a soldier and avoid all parties i have an aversion to politics theyve been death on my family but its past time someone took on those damned bureaucrats and their pet spies they imagine theyre the wave of the future but its only sewage flowing downhill if you express those opinions that forcibly at home its no wonder politics come looking for you she poked at the fire with a stick freeing more sparks for their journey dubauer sedated by the painkiller fell asleep quickly but cordelia lay long awake replaying the disturbing conversation in her mind still what did she care if this barrayaran chose to run his head into nooses no reason for her to get involved none at all surely not even if the shape of his square strong hands was a dream of power in form she awakened deep in the night with a start but it was only the fire flaring up as vorkosigan added an unusually large armload of wood she sat up and he came over to her im glad youre awake i need you he pressed his combat knife into her hand that carcass seems to be attracting something im going to pitch it into the river will you hold a torch sure she stretched got up and selected a suitable brand she followed him down into the watercourse rubbing her eyes the flickering orange light made jumpy black shadows that were almost harder to see into than plain starlight as they reached the waters edge she caught movement out of the corner of her eye and heard a scrambling among the rocks and a familiar hiss uh oh theres a group of those scavengers just upstream to the left right vorkosigan flung the remains of their dinner to the middle of the river where they vanished with a dim gurgle there was an extra splash a loud one not an echo aha cordelia thoughti saw you jump too barrayaran but whatever had splashed didnt show above the surface and its ripples were lost in the current there came some more hisses and a shattering shriek from downstream vorkosigan drew the stunner theres a whole herd of them out there cordelia commented nervously they stood back to back trying to penetrate the blackness vorkosigan rested the stunner across one wrist and let off a carefully aimed burst it buzzed quietly and one of the dark shapes slumped to the ground its comrades sniffed it curiously and moved in closer i wish your gun had more of a bang he aimed again and dropped two more without any effect on the rest he cleared his throat you know your stunners almost out of charge not enough to flatten the rest of them eh no one of the scavengers bolder than the rest darted forward vorkosigan met its charge with a shout and a rush of his own it retreated temporarily the breed of scavengers that ranged the plains was slightly larger than its mountain cousins and if possible uglier obviously it also traveled in larger groups the ring of beasts closed tighter as they attempted to retreat toward the valley rim oh hell said vorkosigan that does it a dozen silent ghostly globes were drifting in from above what a foul way to die well lets take as many with us as possible he glanced at her seemed about to say more but then only shook his head and braced for the rush cordelia heart lurching gazed up at the descending radials and was illuminated by an idea of awesome brilliance oh no she breathed thats not the last straw thats the home fleet coming to the rescue come my pretties she coaxed come to mama have you lost your mind asked vorkosigan you wanted a bang ill give you a bang what do you think holds those things up hadnt thought about it but of course it would almost have to be hydrogen bet you anything those darling little chemistry sets are electrolyzing water notice how they hang around rivers and streams wish i had some gloves allow me his grin winked out of the firestreaked dark at her he jumped up and hooked a radial out of the air by its writhing maroon tendrils and flung it to earth before the approaching scavengers cordelia holding her torch like a fencers foil thrust toward it at full extension sparks scattered as she jabbed two then three times the radial exploded in a ball of blinding flame that singed her eyebrows with a great bass whoom and an astonishing stench orange and green afterimages danced across her retinas she repeated the trick at vorkosigans next snatch one of the scavengers fur caught fire and it led a general retreat screeching and hissing she poked again at a radial in the air it went off with a flash that illuminated the whole reach of the river valley and the humping backs of the fleeing pack of scavengers vorkosigan was frantically patting her on the back it wasnt until the smell caught her that she realized shed set her own hair on fire he got it out the rest of the radials sailed high into the air and away except for one vorkosigan captured and held by standing on its tendrils ha cordelia war danced around him in triumph the adrenaline rush giving her a silly urge to giggle she drew a deep breath is your hand all right its a little burned he admitted he took off his shirt and bundled the radial into it it pulsated and stank we might want this later he rinsed his hand briefly in the stream and they jogged quickly back to their campsite dubauer lay undisturbed although a few minutes later one stray scavenger turned up at the edge of the firelight sniffing and hissing vorkosigan put it to flight with torch knife and swearingwhispered so as not to wake the ensign i think wed better live on field rations for the rest of the trip he said returning cordelia nodded heartfelt agreement she roused the men at the first grey light of dawn as anxious now as vorkosigan to complete the trip to the safety of the supply cache as quickly as possible the radial held captive in vorkosigans shirt had died and deflated during the night turning into a horrible gelid blob vorkosigan of necessity took a few minutes to wash it out in the stream but the stinks and stains it left made him the unquestioned frontrunner in the filthcollection contest cordelia felt they were having they had a quick snack of their dull but safe oatmeal and blue cheese dressing and started on their way as the sun rose sending their long shadows racing ahead of them across the rusty flowerstrewn levels near their noon halt vorkosigan took a break and disappeared behind a bush for biological necessity in a few moments a string of curses came floating around it followed shortly by the speaker himself hopping from foot to foot and shaking out the legs of his trousers cordelia gave him a look of innocent inquiry you know those light yellow cones of sand weve been seeing vorkosigan said unbuckling his pants yes dont stand on one to piss cordelia failed to strangle a giggle what did you find or should i say what found you vorkosigan turned his trousers inside out and began picking the little round white creatures running among their folds on cilialike legs cordelia appropriated one and held it on the palm of her hand for a closer look it was yet another model of the radials an underground form ow she brushed it away hastily stings doesnt it snarled vorkosigan a burble of laughter welled up within her but she was saved from a lapse of control when she noticed a more sobering feature of his appearance hey that scratch doesnt look too good does it the claw mark of the scavenger on his right leg that vorkosigan had collected the night they buried rosemont was swollen and bluish with ugly red streaks radiating from it up as far as his knee its all right he said firmly beginning to put on his deradialed pants it doesnt look all right let me see theres nothing you can do about it here he protested but submitted to a brief examination satisfied he inquired sarcastically and finished dressing i wish your micro people had been a little more thorough when they concocted that salve cordelia shrugged but youre right nothing to be done now they trudged on cordelia watched him more closely now from time to time he would begin to favor the leg then notice her scrutiny and march forward with a determinedly even stride but by the end of the day he had abandoned subterfuge and was frankly limping in spite of it he led on into the sunset the afterglow of the sunset and the gathering night until the cratered mountain toward which they had been angling was a black bulk on the horizon at last stumbling in the dark he gave up and called a halt she was glad for dubauer was flagging leaning on her heavily and trying to lie down they slept where they stopped on the red sandy soil vorkosigan cracked a cold light and took his usual watch as cordelia lay in the dirt and watched the unreachable stars wheel overhead vorkosigan had asked to be waked before dawn but she let him sleep until full light she didnt like the way he looked alternately pale and flushed or his shallow rapid breathing think youd better take one of your painkillers she asked him when he rose for he seemed barely able to put weight on the leg which was much more swollen not yet i have to save some for the end he cut a long stick instead and the three of them began the days task of walking down their shadows how far to the end cordelia asked i estimate a day day and a half depending on what kind of time we can make he grimaced dont worry youre not going to have to carry me im one of the fittest men in my command he limped on over forty how many men over forty are there in your command four cordelia snorted anyway if it becomes necessary i have a stimulant in my medkit that would animate a corpse but i want to save it for the end too what kind of trouble are you anticipating it all depends on who picks up my call i know radnovmy political officerhas at least two agents in my communications section he pursed his lips measuring her again you see i dont think it was a general mutiny i think it was a spurofthemoment assassination attempt on the part of radnov and a very few others using you betans they thought they could get rid of me without implicating themselves if im right everyone aboard ship thinks im dead all but one which one wouldnt i like to know the one who hit me on the head and hid me in the bracken instead of cutting my throat and dumping me in the nearest hole lieutenant radnov seems to have a ringer in his group and yetif this ringer were loyal to me all hed have to do is tell gottyan my first officer and hed have had a loyal patrol down to pick me up before now now who in my command is so confused in his thinking as to betray both sides at once or am i missing something maybe theyre all still chasing my ship suggested cordelia where is your ship honesty should be safely academic by now cordelia calculated well on its way back to beta colony unless theyve been captured no they were out of your range when i talked to them they may not be armed but they can run rings around your battle cruiser hm well its possible he doesnt sound surprised cordelia noted id bet his secret reports on our stuff would give our counterintelligence people colonic spasms how far will they pursue thats up to gottyan if he judges he cant possibly catch them hell return to the picket station if he thinks he can hes bound to make maximum effort why he glanced sidelong at her i cant discuss that i dont see why not im not going anywhere but a barrayaran prison cell for a while funny how ones standards change after this trek it will seem like the lap of luxury ill try to see it doesnt come to that he smiled his eyes bothered her and his smile his curtness she could meet and match with her own flippancy guarding herself as with a fencers foil his kindness was like fencing with the sea her strokes going soft and losing all volition she flinched from the smile and his face fell then became closed and grave again chapter three they walked in silence for a time after breakfast vorkosigan broke it first his fever seemed to be eating away at his original taciturnity converse with me it will take my mind off my leg what about anything she considered walking do you find commanding a warship very different from ordinary vessels he thought it over its not the ship thats different its the men leadership is mostly a power over imagination and never more so than in combat the bravest man alone can only be an armed lunatic the real strength lies in the ability to get others to do your work dont you find it so even in the fleets of beta colony cordelia smiled if anything even more so if it ever came down to exerting power by force it would mean id already lost it i prefer to maintain a light touch then i have the advantage because i find i can always keep my temper or whatever just a little longer than the next man she glanced around at the spring desert i think civilization must have been invented for the benefit of women certainly of mothers i cant imagine how my cavewoman ancestors cared for families under primitive conditions i suspect they worked together in groups said vorkosigan ill wager you could have handled it had you been born in those days you have the competence one would look for in a mother of warriors cordelia wondered if vorkosigan was pulling her leg he did seem to have a streak of dry humor save me from that to pour your life into sons for eighteen or twenty years and then have the government take them away and waste them cleaning up after some failure of politicsno thanks i never really looked at it that way allowed vorkosigan he was quiet for a time stumping along with his stick suppose they volunteered do your people have no ideal of service noblesse oblige but it was her turn to be silent a little embarrassed i suppose if they volunteered it would be different however i have no children so fortunately i wont have to face those decisions are you glad or sorry about children she glanced at his face he seemed to have no awareness of having hit a sore point dead on they just havent come my way i guess the thread of their talk was broken as they negotiated a rocky stretch of badlands full of sudden clefts opening at their feet it involved some tricky climbing and shoving dubauer through safely took all her attention on the far side they took a break by unspoken mutual agreement sitting leaning against a rock in exhaustion vorkosigan rolled up his pants leg and loosened his boot top for a look at the festering wound that was threatening to slow him to a halt you seem a fair nurse do you think it would help to open and drain it he asked cordelia i dont know id be afraid messing around with it would just make it dirtier she deduced the injury must be feeling very much worse for him to have mentioned it confirmed when he took half a painkiller from his precious and limited store they pressed on and vorkosigan began to talk again he told some sardonic anecdotes from his cadet days and described his father who had been a general commanding ground forces in his day and a contemporary and friend of the wily old man who was now emperor cordelia caught a faint faraway impression of a cold father whom a young son could never quite please even with his best efforts yet who shared with him a bond of underlying loyalty she described her mother a tougminded medical professional resisting retirement and her brother who had just purchased his second child permit do you remember your mother well cordelia asked she died when you were quite young i gather an accident like my father no accident politics his face became sober and distant had you not heard of yuri vorbarras massacre idont know much about barrayar ah well emperor yuri in the later days of his madness became extremely paranoid about his relations it became a selffulfilling prophecy in the end he sent his death squads out all in one night the squad sent for prince xav never got past his liveried men and for some obscure reason he didnt send one for my father presumably because he wasnt a descendant of emperor dorca vorbarra i cant imagine what old yuri thought he was about to kill my mother and leave my father alive that was when my father threw his corps behind ezar vorbarra in the civil war that followed oh her throat seemed dry and thick in the dusty afternoon she had evoked a coldness in him so that the film of sweat on his forehead seemed suddenly like a condensation its been on my mind you were talking about the peculiar things people do in a panic earlier and i remembered it hadnt thought of it in years when yuris men blew in the door my god you werent present oh yes i was on the list too of course each assassin was assigned a particular target the one assigned to my motheri grabbed this knife a table knife by my plate and struck at him but right in front of me on the table there had been a good carving knife if only i had grabbed it instead i might as well have struck him with a spoon he just picked me up and threw me across the room how old were you eleven small for my age i was always small for my age he cornered her against the far wall he fired a he sucked his lower lip between his teeth and chewed it just short of breaking the skin to bleed odd how many details come back when you talk about something i thought i had forgotten more he glanced at her white face and grew suddenly contrite ive disturbed you with this babble im sorry it was all very long ago i dont know why im talking so much i do thought cordelia he was pale and no longer sweating in spite of the heat halfunconsciously he fastened the top of his shirt he feels cold she thought fever going up how far up plus whatever effect those pills have this could get very scary an obscure impulse made her say i know what you mean though about talking bringing it back first there was the shuttle going up like a bullet as usual and my brother waving which was silly because he couldnt possibly see usand then there was this smear of light across the sky like a second sun and a rain of fire and this stupid feeling of total comprehension you wait for the shock to set in and relieve youand it never does then the blank vision not blackness but this silverpurple glow for days after i had almost forgotten about being blinded till just now he stared at her thats exactlyi was about to say he fired a sonic grenade into her stomach i couldnt hear anything after that for quite some time as if all sound had gone off the scale of human reception total noise emptier of meaning than silence yes how strange that he should know exactly what i felthe says it better though i suppose my determination to be a soldier stems from that date i mean the real thing not the parades and the uniforms and the glamour but the logistics the offensive advantage the speed and surprisethe power a betterprepared stronger tougher faster meaner sonofabitch than any who came through that door my first combat experience not very successful he was shivering now but then so was she they walked on and she sought to turn the subject ive never been in combat whats it like he paused thoughtfully measuring me again thought cordelia and sweating fever must be topping out for the moment thank heavens at a distance in space theres the illusion of a clean and glorious fight almost abstract it might be a simulation or a game reality doesnt break in unless your ship is hit he gazed at the ground in front of him as if choosing his path but the ground was very level there murdermurder is different that day at komarr when i killed my political officeri was angrier that day than the day ithan another time but close up feeling the life pass out under your hands seeing that blank unoccupied corpse you see your own death in the face of your victim yet he had betrayed my honor im not sure i quite understand that yes anger seems to make you stronger not weaker like me i wish i understood how you do that it was another one of his weird unmanageable compliments she fell silent looking at her feet the mountain ahead the sky anywhere but his unreadable face so she was the first to notice the contrail glowing in the westering sun hey does that look like a shuttle up there to you indeed it does lets watch from the shade of that big bush directed vorkosigan dont you want to try and attract their attention no he turned his hand palm up in response to her look of inquiry my best friends and my deadliest enemies all wear the same uniform i prefer to make my presence known as selectively as possible they could hear the distant roar of the shuttles engines now as it vanished behind the greygreen wooded mountain to the west they seem to be headed for the cache commented vorkosigan that complicates things he compressed his lips what are they doing back there i wonder could gottyan have found the sealed orders surely hed inherit all your orders yes but i didnt have my files in the standard location not wishing to share all my affairs with the council of ministers i dont think korabik gottyan could find what eludes radnov radnovs a clever spy is radnov a tall broadshouldered man with a face like an axeblade no that sounds like sergeant bothari where did you see him he was the man who shot dubauer in the woods by the ravine oh really vorkosigans eyes lit and he smiled wolfishly much becomes clear not to me cordelia prodded sergeant bothari is a very strange man i had to discipline him rather severely last month severely enough to make him a candidate for radnovs conspiracy ill wager radnov thought so im not sure i can make you understand about bothari nobody else seems to hes a superb ground combat soldier he also hates my guts as you betans would phrase it he enjoys hating my guts it seems to be necessary for his ego somehow would he shoot you in the back never strike me in the face yes in fact it was for decking me that he was disciplined last time vorkosigan rubbed his jaw thoughtfully but arming him to the teeth and leading him into battle at my back is perfectly safe he sounds like an absolute looney odd a number of people have said that i like him and you accuse us betans of running a circus vorkosigan shrugged amused well its useful for me to have someone to work out with who doesnt pull his punches surviving handtohand combat practice with bothari gives me a real edge i prefer to keep that phase of our relationship confined to the practice ring however i can imagine how radnov might be misled into including bothari without examining his politics too closely he acts like just the sort of fellow one might stick with the dirty workby god ill bet thats just what radnov did good old bothari cordelia glanced at dubauer standing blankly beside her im afraid i cant share your enthusiasm he nearly killed me i cant pretend hes a moral or intellectual giant hes a very complex man with a very limited range of expression whos had some very bad experiences but in his own twisty way hes honorable the ground rose almost imperceptibly as they approached the mountains base the change was marked by the gradual encroachment of vegetation thin woods watered by a multitude of small springs from the mountains secret sources they struck south around the base of the dusty green cone that rose steeply some meters above the more gradually sloping shoulderland pulling the stumbling dubauer along cordelia mentally cursed for what seemed the thousandth time vorkosigans choice of weapons when the ensign fell cutting his forehead her grief and irritation erupted into words why cant you people use civilized weapons anyway id as soon give a disruptor to a chimpanzee as a barrayaran triggerhappy goons dubauer sat dizzily and she mopped at the blood with her dirty handkerchief then sat too vorkosigan lowered himself awkwardly to the ground beside them bad leg out straight silently endorsing the break he gazed at her tense unhappy face and offered her a serious answer i have an aversion to stunners in that sort of situation he said slowly nobody hesitates to rush one and if there are enough of them they can always get it away from you in the end ive seen men killed relying on stunners who could have walked right through with a disruptor or plasma arc a disruptor has real authority on the other hand nobody hesitates to fire a stunner said cordelia suggestively and it gives you a margin for error what would you hesitate to fire a disruptor yes i might as well not have it at all ah curiosity prodded her mulling on his words how in the world did they kill him with a stunner the man you saw they didnt kill him with the stunner after they took it away from him they kicked him to death oh cordelias stomach tightened notnot a friend of yours i hope as it happens he was he shared something of your attitude toward weaponry soft he frowned into the distance they struggled up and trudged on through the woods the barrayaran tried to help her more with dubauer for a time but dubauer recoiled from him and between the ensigns resistance and his own bad leg the awkward attempt failed vorkosigan withdrew into himself and became less talkative after that all his concentration seemed focused on pushing himself ahead just one more step but he muttered to himself alarmingly cordelia had a nasty vision of collapse and fevered delirium and no faith at all in her ability to take over his role of identifying and contacting a loyal member of his crew it was plain that an error in judgment could be lethal and while she could not say that all barrayarans looked alike to her she was forcibly reminded of the old conundrum that starts all cretans are liars near sunset threading their way through a patch of denser woods they came suddenly on a little glade of astonishing beauty a waterfall foamed down over a bed of black rocks that glistened like obsidian a cascade of lace alive with light the grass that bordered the streambed was backlit by the sun in a translucent gold glow the surrounding trees tall dark green and shady set it like a gem vorkosigan leaned on his stick and gazed at it a while cordelia thought she had never seen a tireder looking human being but then she had no mirror we have about fifteen kilometers to go he said i dont wish to approach the cache in the dark well stop here tonight rest and take it in the morning they flopped down in the soft grass and watched the glorious flaming sunset in silence like an old married couple too tired to get up and turn it off at last the failing light forced them into action they washed hands and faces in the stream and vorkosigan shared his barrayaran field rations at last even after four days of oatmeal and blue cheese dressing they were a disappointment are you sure this isnt instant boots asked cordelia sadly for in color taste and smell they closely resembled pulverized shoe leather pressed into wafers vorkosigan grinned sardonically theyre organic nutritious and theyll keep for yearsin fact they probably have cordelia smiled around a dry and chewy mouthful she handfed dubauer hishe was inclined to spit them outthen washed and settled him for the night he had had no seizures this day which she hoped might be a sign of partial improvement in his condition the earth still breathed a comfortable warmth from the heat of the day and the stream purled softly in the stillness she wished she could sleep for a hundred years like an enchanted princess instead she rose and volunteered for the first watch i think youd better have the extra sleep tonight she told vorkosigan ive had the short watch two nights out of three its your turn theres no need he began if you dont make it i dont make it she pointed out bluntly and neither does he she jerked her thumb at the quiescent dubauer i intend to see that you make it tomorrow vorkosigan took another half painkiller and lay back where he sat conceding the argument still he remained restless sleep evading him and he watched her through the dimness his eyes seemed to gleam feverishly he finally propped himself up on one elbow as she finished a patrol around the edge of the glade and sat down crosslegged on the ground beside him i he began and trailed off youre not what i expected a female officer to be oh well youre not what i expected a barrayaran officer to be either so i guess that makes two of us she added curiously what did you expect imnot sure youre as professional as any officer ive ever served with without once trying to be an an imitation man its extraordinary theres nothing extraordinary about me she denied beta colony must be a very unusual place then its just home nothing special lousy climate so ive heard he picked up a twig and dug little furrows into the soil with it until it snapped they dont have arranged marriages on beta colony do they she stared certainly not what a bizarre concept sounds almost like a civil rights violation heavensyou dont mean to say they do on barrayar in my caste almost always doesnt anybody object theyre not forced arranged by the parents usually itseems to work for many people well i suppose its possible how ahhow do you arrange yourselves with no gobetweens it must be very awkward i mean to refuse someone to their face i dont know its something lovers work out after theyve known each other quite a time usually and wish to apply for a child permit this contractual thing you describe must be like marrying a total stranger naturally it would be awkward hm he found another twig in the time of isolation on barrayar for a man to take a woman of the soldier caste for a lover was regarded as stealing her honor and he was supposed to die a thiefs death for it a custom more honored in the breach im sure although its a favorite subject for drama today we are betwixt and between the old customs are dead and we keep trying on new ones like badly fitting clothes its hard to know whats right anymore after a moment he added what had you expected from a barrayaran i dont know something criminal i suppose i wasnt too crazy about being taken prisoner his eyes fell iveseen what youre talking about of course i cant deny it exists its an infection of the imagination that spreads from man to man its worst when it goes from the top down bad for discipline bad for morale i hate most how it affects the younger officers when they encounter it in the men they should be molding themselves on they havent the weight of experience to fight it in their own minds nor distinguish when a man is stealing the emperors authority to cloak his own appetites and so they are corrupted almost before they know whats happening his voice was intense in the darkness id actually only thought about it from the prisoners point of view myself i take it i am fortunate in my choice of captors theyre the scum of the service but you must believe a small minority although ive no use for those who pretend not to see either and they are not such a minority as make no mistake its not an easy infection to fight off but you have nothing to fear from me i promise you idalready figured that out they sat in silence for a time until the night crept up out of the low places to drain the last turquoise from the sky and the waterfall ran pearly in the starlight she thought he had fallen asleep but he stirred and spoke again she could barely see his face but for a little glint from the whites of his eyes and his teeth your customs seem so free and calm to me as innocent as sunlight no grief no pain no irrevocable mistakes no boys turned criminal by fear no stupid jealousy no honor ever lost thats an illusion you can still lose your honor it just doesnt happen in a night it can take years to drain away in bits and dribbles she paused in the friendly dark i knew this woman oncea very good friend of mine in survey she was rathersocially inept everyone around her seemed to be finding their soulmates and the older she grew the more panicky she got about being left out quite pathetically anxious she finally fell in with a man with the most astonishing talent for turning gold into lead she couldnt use a word like love or trust or honor in his presence without eliciting clever mockery pornography was permitted poetry never they were as it happened of equal rank when the captaincy of their ship fell open shed sweated blood for this command worked her tail offwell im sure you know what its like commands are few and everybody wants one her lover persuaded her partly by promise that turned out to be lies laterchildren in factto stand down in his favor and he got the command quite the strategist it ended soon after thoroughly dry she had no stomach for another lover after that so you see i think your old barrayarans may have been on to something after all the ineptneed rules for their own protection the waterfall whispered in the silence iknew a man once his voice came out of the darkness he was married at twenty to a girl of high rank of eighteen arranged of course but he was very happy with it he was away most of the time on duty she found herself free rich alone in the capital in the society of peoplenot altogether vicious but older than herself rich parasites their parasites users she was courted and it went to her head not her heart i think she took lovers as those around her did looking back i dont think she felt any more emotion for them than vanity and pride of conquest but at the time he had built up a false picture of her in his mind and having it suddenly shattered this boy had a very bad temper it was his particular curse he resolved on a duel with her lovers she had two on her string or her on theirs i cant say which he didnt care who survived or if he were arrested he imagined he was dishonored you see he arranged to have each meet him at a deserted place about half an hour apart he paused for a long time cordelia waited barely breathing uncertain whether to encourage him to go on or not he continued eventually but his voice went flatter and he spoke in a rush the first was another pigheaded young aristocrat like himself and he played out the game by the rules he knew the use of the two swords fought with flair and almost killed mmy friend the last thing he said was that hed always wanted to be killed by a jealous husband only at age eighty by this time the little slip was no surprise to cordelia and she wondered if her story had been as transparent to him it certainly seemed so the second was a high government minister an older man he wouldnt fight although he knocked him down and stood him up several times afterafter the other who had died with a joke in his mouth he could hardly bear it he finally slew him outright in the middle of his begging and left them there he stopped at his wifes apartment to tell her what hed done and returned to his ship to wait for arrest this all happened in one afternoon she was enraged full of wounded prideshe would have dueled with him if she couldand she killed herself shot herself in the head with his service plasma arc i wouldnt have thought it a womans weapon poison or cutting the wrists or something but she was true vor it burned her face entirely away shed had the most beautiful imaginable face things worked out very strangely it was assumed the two lovers had killed each otheri swear he never planned it that wayand that shed killed herself in despondency no one ever asked him the first question about it his voice slowed and intensified he went through that whole afternoon like a sleepwalker or an actor saying the expected lines going through the expected motions and at the end his honor was no better for it nothing was served no point was proved it was all as false as her love affairs except for the deaths they were real he paused so you see you betans have one advantage you at least permit each other to learn from your mistakes imgrieved for your friend does it seem very long ago sometimes over twenty years they say that senile people remember things from their youth more clearly than those of last week maybe hes getting senile i see she took the story in like some strange spiked gift too fragile to drop too painful to hold he lay back silent again and she took another turn around the glade listening at the woods edge to a silence so profound the roaring of the blood in her ears seemed to drown it out when shed completed the round vorkosigan was asleep restless and shivering in his fever she filched one of the halfburned bedrolls from dubauer and covered him up chapter four vorkosigan woke about three hours before dawn and made her lie down to snatch a couple hours sleep in the grey before sunup he roused her again he had evidently bathed in the stream and used the singleapplication packet of depilitory he had been saving in his belt to wipe away the itchy fourday growth on his face i need some help with this leg i want to open and drain it and cover it back up that will hold until this afternoon and after that it wont matter right vorkosigan stripped off boot and sock and cordelia had him hold his leg under a rushing spout at the edge of the waterfall she rinsed his combat knife then laid open the grossly swollen wound in a deep quick stroke vorkosigan went white around the lips but said nothing it was cordelia who winced the cut squirted blood and pus and oddsmelling clotted matter which the stream washed away she tried not to think about what new microbes they might be introducing by the procedure it only needed to be a temporary palliative she packed the wound with the last of the tube of his rather ineffective antibiotic and stripped out the tube of plastic bandage to cover it it feels better but vorkosigan stumbled and almost fell when he attempted to walk normally right he muttered the time has come ceremoniously he removed the last painkiller and a small blue pill from his firstaid kit swallowed them and threw the empty case away cordelia somewhat absently picked it up found herself with no place to put it and surreptitiously dropped it again these things work great he told her until they give out when you fall down like a marionette with the strings cut im good for about sixteen hours now indeed by the time theyd finished the field rations and readied dubauer for the days march he looked not merely normal but fresh and rested and full of energy neither referred to the previous nights conversation he led them in a wide arc around the mountains base so that by noon they were approaching the cratered side from nearly due west they made their way through woods and glades to a spur opposite a great bowl that was all that remained of the lower mountainside from the days before an ancient volcanic cataclysm vorkosigan crawled out on a treeless promontory taking care not to show himself above the tall grass dubauer wan and exhausted curled up on his side in their place of concealment and fell asleep cordelia watched him until his breathing was slow and steady then crept out beside vorkosigan the barrayaran captain had his field scope out sweeping over the hazy green amphitheater theres the shuttle theyre camped in the cache caves see that dark streak beside the long waterfall thats the entrance he lent her the scope for a closer look oh theres somebody coming out you can see their faces on high magnification vorkosigan took back the scope koudelka hes all right but the thin man with him is darobey one of radnovs spies in my communications section remember his faceyoull need to know when to keep your head down cordelia wondered if vorkosigans air of enjoyment was an artifact of the stimulant or a primitive anticipation of the clash to come his eyes seemed to gleam as he watched counted and calculated he hissed through his teeth sounding a bit like one of the local carnivores himself theres radnov by god wouldnt i like to get my hands on him but this time i can take the ministry men to trial id like to see them try to get one of their pets out from under a bona fide charge of mutiny the high command and the council of counts will be with me this time no radnov youre going to liveand regret it he settled on stomach and elbows and devoured the scene he stiffened suddenly and grinned its time my luck changed theres gottyan armed so he must be in charge were nearly home come on they crept back to the cloaking shelter of the trees dubauer was not where theyd left him oh lord breathed cordelia turning and peering into the brush in all directions which way did he go he cant have gone far reassured vorkosigan although he too looked worried they each made a circle of a hundred meters or so through the woods idiot cordelia castigated herself furiously in her panic you just had to go peek they met back at the original spot without seeing any mark made by the wandering ensign look we havent the time to search for him now said vorkosigan as soon as ive regained command ill send a patrol out to look for him with proper searchscopes they could find him faster than we can cordelia thought of carnivores cliffs deep pools barrayaran patrols with twitchy trigger fingers weve come so far she began and if i dont regain command soon neither of you will survive anyway torn but obedient to reason she allowed vorkosigan to take her by the arm only leaning on her slightly he picked a way down through the woods as they neared the barrayaran camp he put a thick finger to his lips go as quietly as you can i havent come this far to be shot by one of my own pickets ah lie down here he placed her in a spot behind some fallen logs and kneehigh vegetation overlooking a faint new path beaten through the brush youre not just going to knock on the front door no why not if your gottyan is all right because theres something else wrong i dont know why this landing party is here he meditated a moment then handed her back the stunner if you have to use a weapon it had better be one you can handle it still has a bit of chargeone or two shots this path runs between sentry points and sooner or later someones going to come down it keep your head down until i call you he loosed his knife in its sheath and took a concealed position on the other side of the path they waited a quarter of an hour then another the woodland drowsed in the warm soft white air then down the path came the sound of boots scuffing through the leaf litter cordelia went rigidly still trying to peer through the weeds without raising her head a tall form in the wonderfully effective barrayaran camouflage fatigues resolved itself as a greyhaired officer as he passed vorkosigan rose from his hiding place as if resurrected korabik he said softly but with genuine warmth in his voice he stood grinning arms folded waiting gottyan spun about one hand drawing the nerve disruptor at his hip after a beat a look of surprise came over his face aral the landing party reported the betans had killed you and he stepped not forward as cordelia had expected from the tone of vorkosigans voice but back the disruptor was still in his hand as if he had forgotten to put it away but gripped firmly not dangling cordelias stomach sank vorkosigan looked faintly puzzled as if disappointed by the cool controlled reception im glad to know youre not superstitious he joked i should have known better than to think you dead until id seen you buried with a stake through your heart said gottyan sadly ironic whats wrong korabik asked vorkosigan quietly youre no ministers lickspittle at these words gottyan brought the disruptor up to undisguised aim vorkosigan stood very still no he answered frankly i thought the story radnov told about you and the betans smelled and i was going to make damn sure it went through a board of inquiry when we got home he paused but theni would have been in command after being acting captain for six months id be sure to be confirmed what do you think the chances of command are at my age five percent two zero theyre not as bad as you think said vorkosigan still quietly there are some things coming up that very few people have heard about more ships more openings the usual rumors gottyan dismissed this so you didnt believe i was dead probed vorkosigan i was sure you were i took overwhere did you put the sealed orders by the way we turned your cabin inside out looking for them vorkosigan smiled dryly and shook his head i shall not increase your temptations no matter gottyans aim did not waver then day before yesterday that psychopathic idiot bothari came to see me in my cabin he gave me the real story of what happened at the betans camp surprised the hell out of meid have thought hed be delighted at a chance to slit your throat so we came back here to practice ground training i was sure youd turn up sooner or lateri expected you before this i was delayed vorkosigan shifted position slightly away from cordelias line of fire toward gottyan wheres bothari now solitary confinement vorkosigan winced thats very bad for him i take it you didnt spread the news of my narrow escape not even radnov knows he still thinks bothari gutted you smug is he smug as a cat id have taken great pleasure in wiping his face at the board if only youd had the good grace to meet with an accident on your hike vorkosigan grimaced wryly it seems to me you havent quite made up your mind what you really want to do may i suggest it is not too late even now to change course you could never overlook this stated gottyan uncertainly in my younger and more stiffnecked days perhaps not but to tell you the truth im getting a little tired of slaying my enemies to teach them a lesson vorkosigan raised his chin and held gottyans eyes if you like you can have my word you know the worth of it the disruptor trembled slightly in gottyans hand as he wavered on the edge of his decision cordelia barely breathing saw water standing in his eyes one does not weep for the living she thought but for the dead in that moment while vorkosigan still doubted she knew he intended to fire she brought her stunner up took careful aim and squeezed off a burst it buzzed weakly but it was enough to bring gottyan head turning at the sudden movement to his knees vorkosigan pounced on the disruptor then relieved him of his plasma arc and knocked him to the ground damn you croaked gottyan halfparalyzed havent you ever been outmaneuvered if i had i wouldnt be here shrugged vorkosigan he subjected gottyan to a rapid search confiscating his knife and a number of other objects who do you have posted as pickets sens to the north koudelka to the south vorkosigan removed gottyans belt and bound his hands behind his back you really did have trouble making up your mind didnt you in an aside to cordelia he explained sens is one of radnovs koudelkas mine rather like flipping a coin and this was your friend cordelia raised her eyebrows seems to me the only difference between your friends and your enemies is how long they stand around chatting before they shoot you yes vorkosigan agreed i could take over the universe with this army if i could ever get all their weapons pointed in the same direction since your pants will stay up without it commander naismith may i please borrow your belt he finished securing gottyans legs with it gagged him then stood a moment looking up then down the path all cretans are liars murmured cordelia then more loudly north or south an interesting question how would you answer it i had a teacher who used to reflect back my questions that way i thought it was the socratic method and it impressed me immensely until i found out he used it whenever he didnt know the answer cordelia stared at gottyan whom they had placed in the spot that had so effectively concealed her wondering whether his directions marked a return to loyalty or a lastditch effort to complete vorkosigans botched assassination he stared back in puzzlement and hostility north she said reluctantly at last she and vorkosigan exchanged a look of understanding and he nodded briefly come on then they started quietly up the path over a rise and through a hollow dense with greygreen thickets have you known gottyan long we served together for the last four years since my demotion he was a good career officer i thought apolitical thorough he has a family do you think you couldget him back later forgive and forget i gave him a chance at that he turned me down twice if youre right in your choice of directions they were climbing another slope the sentry post is at the top whoevers there will be able to scope us in a moment drop back here and cover me if you hear firing he paused use your initiative cordelia smothered a short laugh vorkosigan loosed his disruptor in its holster and walked openly up the path making plenty of noise sentry report she heard his voice call firmly nothing new sincegood god its the captain followed by the most honestly delighted laugh she felt shed heard in centuries she leaned against a tree suddenly weak and just when was it she asked herself that you stopped being afraid of him and started being afraid for him and why is this new fear so much more gutwrenching than the first you dont seem to have come out ahead on the trade have you you can come out now commander naismith vorkosigans voice carried back to her she rounded the last stand of underbrush and climbed a grassy knoll camped upon it were two young men looking very neat and military in their clean fatigues one taller than vorkosigan by a head with a boys face on a mans body she recognized from her view through the scope as koudelka he was shaking his captains hand with unabashed enthusiasm assuring himself of its unghostly reality the other mans hand went to his disruptor when he saw her uniform we were told the betans killed you sir he said suspiciously yes its a rumor ive had difficulty living down said vorkosigan as you can see its not true your funeral was splendid said koudelka you should have been there next time perhaps vorkosigan grinned oh you know i didnt mean it that way sir lieutenant radnov made the best speech im sure hed probably been working on it for months koudelka a little quicker on the uptake than his companion said oh his fellow merely looked puzzled vorkosigan went on permit me to introduce commander cordelia naismith of the betan astronomical survey she is he paused and cordelia waited interestedly to hear what status she was to be assigned ah sounds like she murmured helpfully vorkosigan closed his lips firmly pressing a smile out straight my prisoner he chose finally on parole except for access to classified areas she is to be extended every courtesy the two young men looked impressed and wildly curious shes armed koudelkas companion pointed out and a good thing too vorkosigan did not enlarge on this but went on to more urgent affairs who is in the landing party koudelka rattled off a list of names his memory jogged occasionally by his cohort all right vorkosigan sighed radnov darobey sens and tafas are to be disarmed as quietly and cleanly as possible and placed under arrest on a charge of mutiny there will be some others later i dont want any communication with the general vorkraft until theyre under lock and key do you know where lieutenant buffa is in the caverns sir koudelka was starting to look a little miserable as he began to deduce what was happening yes are you sure about tafas nearly vorkosigan gentled his voice theyll be tried thats the purpose of a trial to separate the guilty from the innocent yes sir koudelka accepted this limited guarantee for the welfare of a man cordelia guessed must be his friend with a little bow of his head do you begin to see why i said the statistics about civil war conceal the most reality said vorkosigan yes sir koudelka met his eye squarely and vorkosigan nodded sure of his man all right you two come with me they started off vorkosigan taking her arm again and scarcely limping neatly concealing how much weight he was putting on her they followed another path through the woodlands up and down uneven ground coming out within sight of the camouflaged door to the cache caverns the waterfall that spun down beside it ended in a little pool spilling over into a pretty stream which ran off into the woods a strange group was assembled beside it cordelia could not at first make out what they were doing two barrayarans stood watching while two more knelt by the water as they approached the two kneelers stood hauling a dripping tanclad figure hands tied behind his back from a prone position to his feet he coughed struggling for breath in sobbing gasps its dubauer cried cordelia what are they doing to him vorkosigan who seemed to know instantly just what they were doing to him muttered oh hell and started forward at a jerky jog thats my prisoner he roared out as they neared the group hands off him the barrayarans braced so fast it looked like a spinal reflex dubauer released fell to his knees still drawing breath in long sobs cordelia running past them to dubauer thought she had never seen a more astonishedlooking array of men dubauers hair swollen face scanty new beard and collar were soaking wet his eyes were red and he continued to cough and sneeze horrified she finally realized the barrayarans had been holding his head underwater by way of torture what is this lieutenant buffa vorkosigan pinned the senior of the group with a thunderous frown i thought the betans killed you sir said buffa they didnt vorkosigan said shortly what are you doing with this betan tafas captured him in the woods sir weve been trying to question himfind out if theres any more around he glanced at cordelia but he refuses to talk hasnt said a word and i always thought betans were soft vorkosigan rubbed his hand over his face for a moment as if praying for strength buffa he said patiently this man was hit by disruptor fire five days ago he cant talk and if he could he wouldnt know anything anyway barbarians cried cordelia kneeling on the ground dubauer had recognized her and was clutching her you barrayarans are nothing but barbarians scoundrels and assassins and fools dont leave out fools vorkosigan withered buffa with a glare a couple of the men had the good grace to look rather ill as well as ill at ease vorkosigan let out his breath with a sigh is he all right seems to be she admitted reluctantly but hes pretty shaken up she was shaking herself in her outrage commander naismith i apologize for my men said vorkosigan formally and loudly so that no one there could mistake that their captain humbled himself before his prisoner because of them dont click your heels at me muttered cordelia savagely for his ear alone at his bleak look she relented a little and said more loudly it was an error in interpretation her eye fell on lieutenant buffa attempting to make his considerable height appear to melt into the ground any blind man could have made it oh hell she added for dubauers terror and distress were triggering another convulsion most of the barrayarans looked away variously embarrassed vorkosigan who was getting practiced knelt to give her what aid she needed when the seizure subsided he stood tafas give your weapons to koudelka he ordered tafas hesitated glancing around then slowly complied i didnt want any part of it sir he said desperately but lieutenant radnov said it was too late youll get a chance to speak for yourself later on said vorkosigan wearily whats going on asked the bewildered buffa have you seen commander gottyan sir ive given commander gottyanseparate orders buffa you are now in charge of the landing party vorkosigan repeated his orders for the arrest of his short list and detached a group to carry out the task ensign koudelka take my prisoners to the cave and see that theyre given proper food and whatever else commander naismith requires then see that the shuttle is ready to go well be leaving for the ship as soon as theother prisoners are secured he avoided the word mutineers as though it were too strong like blasphemy where are you going asked cordelia im going to have a talk with commander gottyan alone hm well dont make me regret my own advice which was as close as she could come at the moment to saying be careful vorkosigan acknowledged all her meanings with a wave of his hand and turned back for the woods he was limping more noticeably now she helped dubauer to his feet and koudelka led them to the caves mouth the young man seemed so much like dubauers opposite number she found it hard to maintain her hostility what happened to the old mans leg koudelka asked her glancing back over his shoulder hes got an infected scratch she understated inclined to endorse his evident policy of keeping up a good show for the benefit of his unreliable crew it should get some high grade medical attention as soon as you can get him to slow down for it thats the old man for you ive never seen anybody that age with that much energy that age cordelia raised an eyebrow well of course he wouldnt seem old to you koudelka allowed and looked puzzled when she burst out laughing energy isnt quite what i wanted to say though how about power she suggested curiously glad that vorkosigan had at least one admirer energy applied to work thats very good he applauded gratified cordelia decided not to mention the little blue pill either he seems an interesting person she said angling for another view of vorkosigan how did he ever get in this fix you mean radnov she nodded well i dont want to criticize the old man buti dont know of anyone else whod tell a political officer when he came on board to stay out of his sight if he wanted to live to the end of the voyage koudelka was hushed in his awe cordelia making the second turning behind him in the halls of the cave was jerked alert by her surroundings most peculiar she thought vorkosigan misled me the labyrinthine series of caverns was partly natural but mostly carved out by plasma arc cool moist and dimly lit the huge spaces were stuffed with supplies this was no cache it was a fullscale fleet depot she pursed her lips soundlessly staring around suddenly awake to a whole new range of unpleasant possibilities in one corner of the caverns stood a standard barrayaran field shelter a semicircular ribbed vault covered with a fabric like the betans tents this one was given over to a field kitchen and mess hall crude and bleak a lone yeoman was cleaning up after lunch the old man just turned up alive koudelka greeted him huh i thought the betans had cut his throat said the yeoman surprised and we did the funeral dinner up so nice these two are the old mans personal prisoners koudelka introduced them to the cook whom cordelia suspected was more combat soldier than gourmet chef and you know what hes like on that subject the guys got disruptor damage he said theyre to have proper food so dont try to poison them with the usual swill everyones a critic muttered the yeomancook as koudelka vanished about his other chores whatll you have anything anything but oatmeal or blue cheese she amended hastily the yeoman disappeared into the back room and returned a few minutes later with two steaming bowls of a stewlike substance and real bread with genuine vegetable oil spread cordelia fell to it wolfishly how is it asked the yeoman tonelessly hunching down into his shoulders sdelishoush she said around a large mouthful swonderful really he straightened up you really like it really she stopped to shove a few spoonfuls into the dazed dubauer the taste of the warm food cut across his postseizure sleepiness and he chewed away with something like her enthusiasm herecan i help you feed him the yeoman offered cordelia beamed upon him like the sun you certainly may in less than an hour she had learned that the yeomans name was nilesa heard most of his lifes history and been offered the complete if severely limited range of dainties a barrayaran field kitchen had to offer the yeoman was evidently as starved for praise as his fellows were for home cooking for he followed her around racking his brain for small personal services to offer her vorkosigan came in by himself and sat wearily down beside cordelia welcome back sir the yeoman greeted him we thought the betans had killed you yes i know vorkosigan waved away this bynowfamiliar greeting how about some food whatll you have sir anything but oatmeal he too was served with bread and stew which he ate without cordelias appetite for the fever and stimulant combined to kill it how did things work out with commander gottyan cordelia asked him quietly not bad hes back on the job how did you do it untied him and gave him my plasma arc i told him i couldnt work with a man who made my shoulder blades itch and this was the last chance i was going to give him for instant promotion then i sat down with my back to him sat there for about ten minutes we didnt say a word then he gave the arc back and we walked back to camp i wondered if something like that might work although im not sure i could have done it if i were you i dont think i could have done it either if i wasnt so damn tired it felt good to sit down his tone became slightly more animated as soon as they get the arrests made well lift off for the general its a fine ship im assigning you the visiting officers cabinadmirals quarters they call it although its no different from the others vorkosigan pushed the last bites of stew around in the bottom of his dish how was your food wonderful thats not what most people say yeoman nilesa has been most kind and thoughtful are we talking about the same man i think he just needs a little appreciation for his work you might try it vorkosigan elbows on the table propped his chin on his hands and smiled ill take it under advisement they both sat silent tired and digesting at the simple metal table vorkosigan leaned back in his chair with his eyes closed cordelia leaned on the table with her head pillowed on one arm in about half an hour koudelka entered weve got sens sir he reported but we hadare havinga little trouble with radnov and darobey they tumbled on to it somehow and escaped into the woods i have a patrol out searching now vorkosigan looked like he wanted to swear should have gone myself he muttered did they have any weapons they both had their disruptors we got their plasma arcs all right i dont want to waste any more time down here recall your patrol and seal all the cavern entrances they can find out how they like spending a few nights in the woods his eyes glinted at the vision we can pick them up later theyve nowhere to go cordelia pushed dubauer ahead of her into the shuttle a bare and rather decrepit troop transport and settled him in a free seat with the arrival of the last patrol the shuttle seemed crammed with barrayarans including the huddled and subdued prisoners hapless subordinates of the escaped ringleaders bound in back they all seemed such large and muscular young men indeed vorkosigan was the shortest one shed seen so far they stared at her curiously and she caught snatches of conversation in two or three languages it wasnt hard to guess their content and she smiled a bit grimly youth it appeared was full of illusions as to how much sexual energy two people might have to spare while hiking forty or so kilometers a day concussed stunned diseased on poor food and little sleep alternating caring for a wounded man with avoiding becoming dinner for every carnivore within rangeand with a coup to plan for at the end old folks too of thirtythree and forty plus she laughed to herself and closed her eyes shutting them out vorkosigan returned from the forward pilots compartment and slid in beside her are you doing all right she gave him a nod yes rather overwhelmed by all these herds of boys i think you barrayarans are the only ones who dont carry mixed crews why is that i wonder partly tradition partly to maintain an aggressive outlook they havent been annoying you no amusing me only i wonder if they realize how they are used not a bit they think they are the emperors of creation poor lambs thats not how id describe them i was thinking of animal sacrifice ah thats closer the shuttles engines began to whine and they rose into the air they circled the cratered mountain once then struck east and upward to the sky cordelia watched out the window as the land they had so painfully traversed on foot swept under them in as many minutes as they had taken days they soared over the great mountain where rosemont lay rotting close enough to see the snowcap and glaciers gleaming orange in the setting sun they passed on east through nightrise and dead of night the horizon curved away and they broke into the perpetual day of space as they approached the general vorkraft s parking orbit vorkosigan left her again to go forward and supervise he seemed to be receding from her absorbed back into the matrix of men and duty from which he had been torn well surely they would have some quiet times together in the months ahead quite a few months by what gottyan had said pretend youre an anthropologist she told herself studying the savage barrayarans think of it as a vacationyou wanted a long vacation after this survey tour anyway well here it is her fingers were picking loose threads from the seat and she stilled them with a slight frown they made their docking very cleanly and the mob of hulking soldiers rose gathered their equipment and clattered out koudelka appeared at her elbow and informed her he was assigned as her guide guard more likelyor babysittershe did not feel very dangerous this moment she gathered dubauer and followed him aboard vorkosigans ship it smelled different from her survey ship colder full of bare unpainted metal and costeffective shortcuts taken out of comfort and decor like the difference between a living room and a locker room their first destination was sickbay to drop off dubauer it was a clean austere series of rooms much larger even proportionally than her survey ships prepared to handle plenty of company it was nearly deserted now but for the chief surgeon and a couple of corpsmen whiling away their duty hours doing inventory and a lone soldier with a broken arm kicking his heels and kibitzing dubauer was examined by the doctor whom cordelia suspected was more expert at disruptor injuries than her own surgeon and turned over to the corpsmen to be washed and bedded down youre going to have another customer shortly cordelia told the surgeon who was one of vorkosigans four men over forty your captain has a really filthy infection going on his shin its gone systemic also i dont know what those little blue pills are you fellows have in your medkits but by what he said the one he took this morning ought to be running out just about now that damned poison the doctor bitched sure its effective but they could find something less wearing not to mention the trouble we have hanging on to them cordelia suspected this last was the crux of the matter the doctor busied himself setting up the antibiotic synthesizer and preparing it for programming cordelia watched the expressionless dubauer put to bed the start she saw of an endless series of hospital days as straight and same as a tunnel to the end of his life the cold whispering doubt of whether she had done him a service would be forever added to her inventory of night thoughts she dawdled around him for a while covertly waiting for the arrival of her other excharge vorkosigan came in at last accompanied in fact supported by a couple of other officers she had not yet met and giving orders he had obviously cut his timing too fine for he looked frighteningly bad he was white sweating and trembling and cordelia thought she could see where the lines on his face would be when he was seventy havent you been taken care of yet he asked when he saw her wheres koudelka i thought i told himoh there you are shes to have the admirals cabin did i say that and stop by stores and get her some clothes and dinner and a new charge for her stunner im fine hadnt you better lie down yourself said cordelia anxiously vorkosigan still on his feet was wandering around in circles like a windup toy with a damaged mainspring got to let bothari out he muttered hell be hallucinating by now you just did that sir reminded one of the officers the surgeon caught his eye and jerked his head meaningfully toward the examining table together they intercepted vorkosigan in his orbit propelled him semiforcibly to it and made him lie down its those damned pills the surgeon explained to cordelia taking pity on her alarmed look hell be all right in the morning except for lethargy and a hell of a headache the surgeon turned back to his task to cut the taut trouser away from the swollen leg and swear under his breath at what he found beneath koudelka glanced over the surgeons shoulder and turned back to cordelia with a false smile pinned over a green face cordelia nodded and reluctantly withdrew leaving vorkosigan in the hands of his professionals koudelka seeming to enjoy his role as courier even though it had caused him to miss the show of his captains return on board led her off to stores for clothing disappeared with her stunner and dutifully returned it fully charged it seemed to go against his grain theres not a whole lot i could do with it anyway she said at the dubious look on his face no no the old man said you were to have it im not going to argue with him about prisoners its a sensitive subject with him so i understand i might point out if it will help your perspective that our two governments are not at war as far as i know and that i am being unlawfully detained koudelka puzzled over this attempted readjustment of his pointofview then let it bounce harmlessly off his impermeable habits of thought carrying her new kit he led her to her quarters chapter five stepping out of her cabin door next morning she found a guard posted the top of her head was level with his broad shoulders and his face reminded her of an overbred borzoi narrow hooknosed with his eyes too close together she realized at once where she had seen him before at a distance in a dappled wood and had a moment of residual fear sergeant bothari she hazarded he saluted her the first barrayaran to have done so maam he said and fell silent i want to go to sickbay she said uncertainly yes maam his voice was a deep bass monotonous in its cadence he executed a neat turn and led off guessing that he had relieved koudelka as her guide and keeper she pattered after him she was not quite ready to attempt light conversation with him so asked him no questions en route he offered her only silence watching him it occurred to her that a guard on her door might be as much to keep others out as her in her stunner seemed suddenly heavy on her hip at sickbay she found dubauer sitting up and dressed in insignialess black fatigues like the ones she had been issued his hair had been cut and he had been shaved there was certainly nothing wrong with the physical care he was receiving she spoke to him a while until her own voice began to sound inane in her ears he looked at her but gave little other reaction she caught a glimpse of vorkosigan in a private chamber off the main ward and he motioned her to enter he was dressed in plain green pajamas of the standard design and was sitting up in bed stabbing away with a light pen at a computer interface swung over it curiously although he was clothed almost civilian style bootless and weaponless her impression of him was unchanged he seemed a man who could carry on stark naked and only make those around him feel overdressed she smiled a little at this private image and greeted him with a sketchy wave one of the officers who had escorted him to sickbay last night was standing by the bed commander naismith this is lieutenant commander vorkalloner my second officer excuse me a moment captains may come and captains may go but the administration goes on forever amen vorkalloner looked very much the professional barrayaran soldier he might have stepped out of a recruiting advertisement yet there was a certain underlying humor in his expression that made her think him a tolerable preview of ensign koudelka in ten or twelve years time captain vorkosigan speaks highly of you said vorkalloner making small talk a slight frown from his captain at this opening escaped his notice i guess if we could only catch one betan you were the best choice vorkosigan winced cordelia gave him a slight shake of her head signaling to let the gaffe pass he shrugged and began tapping out something on his keyboard as long as all my people are safely on their way home ill take it as a fair trade almost all of them anyway rosemonts ghost breathed coldly in her ear and vorkalloner seemed suddenly less amusing why were you all so anxious to put us in a bottle anyway why orders said vorkalloner simply like an ancient fundamentalist who answers every question with the tautology because god made it that way then a little agnostic doubt began to creep over his face actually i thought we might have been sent out here on guard duty as some kind of punishment he joked the remark caught vorkosigans humor for your sins your cosmology is too egocentric aristede leaving vorkalloner to unravel that he went on to cordelia your detention was intended to be free of bloodshed it would have been too but for that other little matter cropping up in the middle of it it is a worthless apology for some and she knew he shared the memory of rosemonts burial in the cold black fog but it is the only truth i can offer you the responsibility is no less mine for that as i am sure someone in the high command will point out when this arrives he smiled sourly and continued typing well i cant say im sorry to have messed up their invasion plans she said daringly there lets see what that stirs up what invasion asked vorkalloner waking up i was afraid youd figure that out once you saw the cache caverns said vorkosigan to her it was still being hotly debated when we left and the expansionists were waving the advantage of surprise as a big stick to beat the peace party speaking as a private personwell i have not that right while in uniform let it go what invasion probed vorkalloner hopefully with luck none answered vorkosigan allowing himself to be persuaded to partial frankness one of those was enough for a lifetime he seemed to look inward on private unpleasant memories vorkalloner plainly found this a baffling attitude from the hero of komarr it was a great victory sir with very little loss of life on our side vorkosigan finished typing his report and signed it off then entered a request for another form and began fencing at it with the light pen thats the idea isnt it it depends on whether you mean to stay or are just passing through a very messy political legacy was left at komarr not the sort of thing i care to leave in trust for the next generation how did we get onto this subject he finished the last form who were they thinking of invading asked cordelia doggedly why havent i heard anything about it asked vorkalloner in order that is classified information and it is not being discussed below the level of the general staff the central committee of the two councils and the emperor that means this conversation is to go no farther aristede vorkalloner glanced at cordelia pointedly shes not on the general staff come to think of it neither am i anymore vorkosigan conceded as for our guest ive told her nothing she couldnt deduce for herself as for myself my opinion was requested oncertain aspects they didnt like it once theyd got it but they did ask for it his smile was not at all nice is that why you were shipped out of town asked cordelia perceptively feeling she was beginning to get the hang of how things were done on barrayar so lieutenant commander vorkalloner was right about pulling guard duty was your opinion requested by uh a certain old friend of your fathers it certainly wasnt requested by the council of ministers said vorkosigan but refused to be drawn any further and changed the subject firmly have my men been treating you properly quite well yes my surgeon swears he will release me this afternoon if i am good and stay in bed this morning may i stop by your cabin to speak with you privately later there are some things i need to make clear sure she responded thinking the request was phrased rather ominously the surgeon came in aggrieved youre supposed to be resting sir he glared pointedly at cordelia and vorkalloner oh very well send these off with the next courier aristede he pointed to the screen along with the verbals and the formal charges the doctor herded them out as vorkosigan began typing again she wandered around the ship for the rest of the morning exploring the limits of her parole vorkosigans ship was a confusing warren of corridors sealable levels tubes and narrow doors designed she realized at last to be defensible from boarding parties in handtohand combat sergeant bothari kept pace with slow strides looming silently as the shadow of death at her shoulder except when she would begin to make a turn into some forbidden door or corridor when he would halt abruptly and say no maam she was not permitted to touch anything though as she found when she ran a hand casually over a control panel eliciting another monotonous no maam from bothari it made her feel like a twoyearold being taken on a toddle she made one attempt to draw him out have you served captain vorkosigan long she inquired brightly yes maam silence she tried again do you like him no maam silence why not this at least could not have a yesorno answer for a while she thought he wasnt going to answer at all but he finally came up with hes a vor class conflict she hazarded i dont like vors im not a vor she suggested he stared through her glumly youre like a vor maam unnerved she gave up that afternoon she made herself comfortable on her narrow bunk and began to explore the menu the library computer had to offer her she picked out a vid with the unalarming grade school title of people and places of barrayar and punched it up its narration was as banal as the title had promised but the pictures were utterly fascinating it seemed a green delicious sunlit world to her betan eyes people went about without nose filters or rebreathers or heat shields in the summer the climate and terrain were immensely varied and it had real oceans with moonraised tides in contrast to the flat saline puddles that passed for lakes at home a knock sounded at her door enter she called and vorkosigan appeared around it greeting her with a nod odd hour of the day for him to be in dress uniform she thoughtbut my word he cleans up good nice very nice sergeant bothari accompanied him he remained standing stolidly outside the halfopened door vorkosigan walked around the room for a moment as if searching for something he finally emptied her lunch tray and used it to prop the door open a narrow crack cordelia raised her eyebrows at this is that really necessary i think so at the current rate of gossip im bound to encounter some joke soon about the privileges of rank that i cant pretend not to hear and ill have to quash the unlucky er humorist i have an aversion to closed doors anyway you never know whats on the other side cordelia laughed outright it reminds me of that old joke where the girl says lets not and tell everybody we have vorkosigan grimaced agreement and seated himself on the bolteddown swivel chair by the metal desk built into the wall and swung to face her he leaned back with his legs stretched out before him and his face became serious cordelia cocked her head halfsmiling he began obliquely nodding toward the screen swung over her bed what have you been viewing barrayaran geography its a beautiful place have you ever been to the oceans when i was a small boy my mother used to take me to bonsanklar every summer it was a sort of upperclass resort town with a lot of virgin forest backing up to the mountains behind it my father was away mostly at the capital or with his corps midsummers day was the old emperors birthday and they used to have the most fantastic fireworksat least they seemed so to me at the timeout over the ocean the whole town would turn out on the esplanade nobody even armed no duels were permitted on the emperors birthday and i was allowed to run all over the place freely he looked at the floor beyond the toes of his boots i havent been back there for years i should like to take you there someday for the midsummers festival should the opportunity present itself id like that very much will your ship be returning to barrayar soon not for some time im afraid youre in for a long period as a prisoner but when we return in view of the escape of your ship there should be no reason to continue your internment you should be freed to present yourself at the betan embassy and go home if you wish if i wish she laughed a little uncertainly and sat back against her hard pillow he was watching her face intently his posture was a fair simulation of a man at his ease but one boot was tapping unconsciously his eye fell on it he frowned and it stopped why shouldnt i wish i thought perhaps when we arrive on barrayar and you are free you might consider staying to visitwhere you said bonsanklar and so on i dont know how much leave ill have butsure i like to see new places id like to see your planet not a visit permanently asas lady vorkosigan his face brightened with a wry smile im making a hash of this i promise ill never think of betans as cowards again i swear your customs take more bravery than the most suicidal of our boys contests of skill she let her breath trickle out through pursed lips you dontdeal in small change do you she wondered where the phrase about hearts leaping up came from it felt far more like the bottom dropping out of her stomach her consciousness of her own body shot up with a lurch she was already overwhelmingly conscious of his he shook his head thats not what i want for you with you you should have the best im hardly that you must know by now but at least i can offer you the best that i have dear ccommander am i too sudden by betan standards ive been waiting for days for the right opportunity but there never seemed to be one days how long have you been thinking along these lines it first occurred to me when i saw you in the ravine what throwing up in the mud he grinned at that with great composure by the time we finished burying your officer i knew she rubbed her lips anybody ever tell you youre a lunatic not in this context iyouve confused me not offended you no of course not he relaxed just slightly you neednt say yes or no right now of course it will be months before were home but i didnt want you to thinkit makes things awkward your being a prisoner i didnt want you to think i was offering you an insult not at all she said faintly there are some other things i should tell you he went on his attention seemingly caught by his boots again it wouldnt be an easy life i have been thinking since i met you that a career cleaning up after the failures of politics as you phrased it might not be the highest honor after all maybe i should be trying to prevent the failures at their source it would be more dangerous than soldieringchances of betrayal false charges assassination maybe exile poverty death evil compromises with bad men for a little good result and that not guaranteed not a good life but if one had childrenbetter me than them you sure know how to show a girl a good time she said helplessly rubbing her chin and smiling vorkosigan looked up uncertain of his hope how does one set about a political career on barrayar she asked feeling her way i presume youre thinking of following in your grandfather prince xavs steps but without the advantage of being an imperial prince how do you get an office three ways imperial appointment inheritance and rising through the ranks the council of ministers gets its best men through the last method its their great strength but closed to me the council of counts by inheritance thats my surest route but it waits on my fathers death it can just go on waiting its a moribund body anyway afflicted with the narrowest conservatism and stuffed with old relics only concerned with protecting their privileges im not sure anything can be done with the counts in the long run perhaps they should finally be allowed to dodder over the brink of extinction dont quote that he added as an afterthought its the weirdest design for a government it wasnt designed it grew maybe what you need is a constitutional convention spoken like a true betan well perhaps we do although it sounds like a prescription for civil war in our context that leaves imperial appointment its quick but my fall could be as sudden and spectacular as my rise if i should offend the old man or he dies the light of battle was in his eyes as he spoke planning my one advantage with him is that he enjoys plain speaking i dont know how he acquired the taste for it because he doesnt get much of it do you know i think youd like politics at least on barrayar maybe because its so similar to what we call war elsewhere there is a more immediate political problem though with respect to your ship and some other things he paused losing momentum maybemaybe an insoluble one it really may be premature for me to be discussing marriage until i know which way its going to fall out but i couldnt let you go on thinkingwhat were you thinking anyway she shook her head i dont think i want to say just now ill tell you someday its nothing youll dislike i dont believe he accepted that with a little hopeful nod and went on your ship she frowned uneasily you wont be getting into any trouble over my ship getting away will you it was just the situation we were on our way out here to prevent the fact that i was unconscious at the time should be a mitigating factor balancing that are the views i aired at the emperors council theres bound to be suspicion i let it escape on purpose to sabotage an adventure i deeply disapprove another demotion he laughed i was the youngest admiral in the history of our fleeti might end up the oldest ensign too but no he sobered there will almost certainly be a charge of treason laid by the war party in the ministries until thats settled one way or another he met her eyes it may be difficult to settle any personal affairs either is treason a capital crime on barrayar she asked morbidly curious oh yes public exposure and death by starvation he raised a quizzical eyebrow at her appalled look if its any consolation highborn traitors always seem to be smuggled some neat means to private suicide before the event it saves stirring up any unnecessary public sympathy i think i should not give them the satisfaction though let it be public and messy and tedious and embarrassing as all hell he looked alarmingly fey would you sabotage the invasion if you could he shook his head eyes going distant no i am a man under authority thats what the syllable in front of my name means while the question is still being debated ill continue to argue my case but if the emperor puts his word to the order ill go without question the alternative is civil chaos and weve had enough of that whats different about this invasion you must have favored komarr or they wouldnt have put you in charge of it komarr was a unique opportunity almost a textbook case when i was designing the strategy for its conquest i made maximum use of those chances he ticked off the points on his thick fingers a small population all concentrated in climatecontrolled cities no place for guerillas to fall back and regroup no allieswe werent the only ones whose trade was being strangled by their greedy tariffs all i had to do was let it leak out that we were going to drop their twentyfive percent cut of everything that passed through their nexus points to fifteen and the neighbors that should have supported them fell into our pockets no heavy industry fat and lazy from living off unearned incomethey didnt even want to do their own fighting until those scraggly mercenaries theyd hired found out what they were up against and turned tail if id had a free hand and a little more time i think it could have been taken without a shot being fired a perfect war it should have been if the council of ministers hadnt been so impatient remembered frustrations played themselves out before his eyes and he frowned into the past this other planwell i think youll understand if i tell you its escobar cordelia sat up shocked you found a jump through here to escobar no wonder then the barrayarans had not announced their discovery of this place of all the possibilities she had revolved in her mind that was the last escobar was one of the major planetary hubs in the network of wormhole exits that strung scattered humanity together large old rich temperate it counted among its many neighbors beta colony itself theyre out of their minds do you know thats almost exactly what i said before the minister of the west started shouting and count vortala threatenedwell became very rude to him vortala can be more obnoxious without actually swearing than any man i know beta colony would be drawn in for sure why half our interstellar trade passes through escobar and tau ceti five and jacksons whole at the very least i should think vorkosigan nodded agreement the idea was to make it a quick operation and present the potential allies with a fait accompli being intimately familiar with everything that went wrong with my perfect plan for komarr i told them they were dreaming or words to that effect he shook his head i wish id kept my temper better i could still be back there arguing against it instead for all i know the fleet is being readied even now and the further preparations go the harder they will be to stop he sighed war cordelia mused immensely disturbed you realize if your fleet goesif barrayar goes to war with escobartheyll be wanting navigators at home even if beta colony doesnt get directly involved in the fight were sure to be selling them weapons technical assistance shiploads of supplies vorkosigan started to speak then stopped himself i suppose you would he said bleakly and we would be trying to blockade you she could feel the blood beating in her ears in the silence that followed the little noises and vibrations of vorkosigans ship still drifted through the walls bothari stirred in the corridor and footsteps passed by she shook her head im going to have to think about this its not as easy as it looked at first no its not he turned his hand palmoutward a gesture of completion and rose stiffly his leg still bothering him thats all i wanted to say you need not say anything she nodded grateful for the release and he withdrew collecting bothari and shutting the door firmly behind him she sighed distress and deep uncertainty and lay back staring at the ceiling until yeoman nilesa brought dinner chapter six next morning ship time she remained quietly in her cabin reading she wanted time to assimilate yesterdays conversation before she saw vorkosigan again she was as unsettled as if all her star maps had been randomized leaving her lost but at least knowing she was lost a step backwards toward truth she supposed better than mistaken certainties she hungered forlornly for certainties even as they receded beyond reach the ships library offered a wide range of barrayaran material a gentleman named abell had produced a turgid general history full of names dates and detailed descriptions of forgotten battles all of whose participants were irrelevantly dead by now a scholar named aczith had done better with a vivid biography of emperor dorca vorbarra the just the ambiguous figure whom cordelia calculated was vorkosigans greatgrandfather and whose reign had straddled the end of the time of isolation deeply involved in the multitude of personalities and convoluted politics of his day she did not even look up at the knock on her door but called enter a pair of soldiers wearing greenandgrey planetside camouflage fatigues fell through the door and shut it hastily behind them what a rattylooking pair she thought finally a barrayaran soldier shorter than vorkosigan it was only on the third thought that she recognized them as from the corridor outside muffled by the door an alarm klaxon began to hoot rhythmically looks like im not going to make it to the bs captain cried lieutenant stuben are you all right all the crushing weight of old responsibility descended on her at the sight of his face his shoulderlength brown hair had been sacrificed to an imitation barrayaran military burr that looked as though it had been grazed over by some herbivore and his head seemed small naked and strange without it lieutenant lai beside him slight and thin with a scholarly stoop made an even less likely looking warrior the toolarge uniform he wore folded up at the wrists and ankles with one ankle coming unfolded and getting under the heel of his boot she opened her mouth once to speak closed it then finally ripped out why arent you on your way home i gave you an order lieutenant stuben anticipating a warmer reception was momentarily nonplussed we took a vote he said simply as though it explained everything cordelia shook her head helplessly you would a vote right she buried her face in her hands a moment and sobbed a laugh why she asked through her fingers we identified the barrayaran ship as the general vorkraft looked it up and found out who was in command we just couldnt leave you in the hands of the butcher of komarr it was unanimous she was momentarily diverted how the devil did you get a unanimous vote out ofno never mind she cut him off as he began to answer a selfsatisfied gleam starting in his eye i shall beat my head against the wallno got to have more information and so does he do you realize she said carefully that the barrayarans were planning to bring an invasion fleet through here to attack escobar by surprise if you had reached home and reported this planets existence their chance of surprise would have been destroyed now all bets are off where is the rene magritte now and how did you ever get in here lieutenant stuben looked astonished how did you find all that out time time lieutenant lai reminded him anxiously tapping his wrist chronometer stuben went on let me tell you on the way to the shuttle do you know where dubauer is he wasnt in the brig yes what shuttle nobegin at the beginning ive got to know everything before we set foot in the corridor i take it they know youre aboard the beat of the klaxon still sounded outside and she cringed in expectation of her door bursting inward at any moment no they dont thats the beauty of it said stuben proudly we had the greatest piece of luck they pursued us for two days when we first ran off i didnt put on full powerjust enough to stay out of their range and keep them trailing us i thought we might still get a chance to circle back and pick you up somehow then all of a sudden they stopped turned around and started back here we waited until they were well away then turned around ourselves we hoped you were still hiding in the woods no i was captured the first night go on we got everything lined up put on max boost then cut everything we could think of that made electromagnetic noise the projector worked fine as a muffler by the way just like rosss simulation last month we waltzed right past em and they never blinked for gods sake stu stick to the point muttered lai we havent got all day he bounced on his heels in impatience if that projector falls into barrayaran hands began cordelia in rising tones it wont i tell you anyway the rene magrittes making a parabola around the sunas soon as they get close enough to be masked by its noise theyre supposed to brake and boost then shoot back through here for a pickup well have a twohour time window to match velocities startingwell starting about ten minutes ago too chancey criticized cordelia all the possible disasters inherent in this scenario parading through her imagination it worked defended stuben at least its going to work then we struck it lucky we found these two barrayarans wandering in the woods while we were looking for you and dubauer cordelias stomach tightened radnov and darobey by chance stuben stared how did you know go on just go on they were the ringleaders of a conspiracy to unseat that homicidal maniac vorkosigan vorkosigan was after them so they were glad to see us ill bet just like manna from heaven a barrayaran patrol shuttled down after them we set up an ambushstunned them all except for one radnov shot with a nerve disruptor those guys really play for keeps do you happen to know whichno never mind go on her stomach churned we took their uniforms took their shuttle and slid on up to the general as neat as you please radnov and darobey between em knew all the countersigns we made it to the brigthat was easy it was where they were expecting their patrol to go anywaywe thought you and dubauer would be there radnov and darobey let all their buddies out and went to take over the engine room they can cut off any system from there weapons life support anything theyre supposed to cut weapons when we make our break with the shuttle i wouldnt count on that cordelia warned no matter said stuben cheerfully the barrayarans will be so busy fighting each other we can walk right through think of the splendid irony the butcher of komarr shot by his own men now i know how judo is supposed to work splendid she echoed hollowly his head she thoughtim going to beat his head against the wall not mine how many of us are aboard six two at the shuttle two looking for dubauer and we two to get you nobody left planetside no all right she rubbed her face tensely ravenous for inspiration that would not come what a mess dubauers in sickbay by the way disruptor damage she decided not to detail his condition just then filthy killers said lai i hope they choke each other she turned to the library interface by her bed and dialed up the crude schematic map of the general vorkraft minus technical data that the library was programmed to allow her study this and figure out your route to sickbay and the shuttle hatch im going to find something out stay here and dont answer the door who are the other two wandering around out there mcintyre and big pete well at least they have a better chance of passing for barrayarans close up than you two do captain where are you going why cant we just go ill explain it when i have a week to spare this time follow your damned orders stay here she slipped out the door and dogtrotted toward the bridge her nerves screamed to run but it would draw too much attention she passed a group of four barrayarans hurrying somewhere they barely spared her a glance she had never been more glad to be a wallflower she found vorkosigan on the bridge with his officers clustered intently around the intercom from engineering bothari was there too looming like vorkosigans sad shadow whos that guy on the comm she whispered to vorkalloner radnov yes sh the face was speaking vorkosigan gottyan and vorkalloner one by one at twominute intervals unarmed or all life support systems will be cut off throughout the ship you have fifteen minutes before we start letting in the vacuum ah have you patched it in good better not waste time captain his inflection made the rank a deadly insult the face vanished but the voice returned ghostlike over the loudspeaker system soldiers of barrayar it blared your captain has betrayed the emperor and the council of ministers dont let him betray you too turn him over to the proper authority your political officer or we will be forced to slay the innocent with the guilty in fifteen minutes we will cut life support cut that off said vorkosigan irritably cant sir said a technician bothari more direct unslung his plasma arc and with a negligent gesture fired from the hip the speaker exploded off the wall and several men ducked the molten fragments hey we might need that ourselves began vorkalloner indignantly never mind vorkosigan waved him down thank you sergeant a distant echo of the voice continued from loudspeakers all over the ship theres no time for anything more elaborate im afraid vorkosigan said apparently winding up a planning session go ahead with your engineering idea lieutenant saint simon if you can get it in place in time so much the better im sure wed all rather be clever than brave the lieutenant nodded and hurried out if he cant im afraid well have to rush them vorkosigan went on they are perfectly capable of killing everyone aboard and rerecording the log to prove anything they please between darobey and tafas they have the technical knowhow i want volunteers myself and bothari of course a unanimous chorus put themselves forward gottyan and vorkalloner are both out i need somebody who can explain things afterward now the battle order first me then bothari then siegels patrol then kushs stunners only i dont want stray shots smashing up engineering a number of men glanced at the hole in the wall where the speaker had been sir said vorkalloner desperately i question that battle order theyll be using disruptors for sure the first men through the door havent got a chance vorkosigan took a few seconds and stared him down he dropped his eyes miserably yes sir lieutenant commander vorkalloner is right sir an unexpected bass voice put in cordelia realized with a start it was bothari the first place is mine by right ive earned it he faced his captain narrow jaw working its mine their eyes met in a weird understanding very well sergeant conceded vorkosigan you first then me then the rest as ordered lets go vorkosigan paused before her as they herded out im afraid im not going to make that walk on the esplanade in the summer after all cordelia shook her head helplessly the glimmer of a terrifying idea beginning in the back of her brain iii have to withdraw my parole now vorkosigan looked puzzled then waved it aside for a more immediate concern if i should chance to end up like your ensign dubauerremember my preferences if you can bring yourself to it i would like it to be by your hand ill tell vorkalloner can i have your word yes youd better stay in your cabin until this is over he reached out to her shoulder to touch one curl of red hair resting there then turned away cordelia fled down the corridor radnovs propaganda droning senselessly in her ears her plan blossomed furiously in her mind her reason yammered protest like a rider on a runaway horse you have no duty to these barrayarans your duty is to beta colony to stuben to the rene magritteyour duty is to escape and warn she swung into her cabin wonder of wonders stuben and lai were still there they looked up alarmed by her wild appearance go to sickbay now pick up dubauer and take him to the shuttle when were pete and mac supposed to report back there if they couldnt find him in lai checked his time ten minutes thank god when you get to sickbay tell the surgeon that captain vorkosigan ordered you to bring dubauer to me lai you wait in the corridor youd never fool the surgeon dubauer cant talk dont act surprised by his condition when you get to the shuttle waitlet me see your chrono laitill our ship time then take off if im not back by then im not coming full power and dont look back exactly how many men did radnov and darobey have with them ten or eleven i guess stuben said all right give me your stunner go go go captain we came here to rescue you cried stuben bewildered words failed her utterly she put a hand on his shoulder instead i know thank you she ran approaching engineering from one deck above she came to an intersection of two corridors down the larger was a group of men assembling and checking weapons down the smaller were two men covering an entry port to the next deck a last checkpoint before territory covered by radnovs fire one of them was yeoman nilesa she pounced on him captain vorkosigan sent me down she lied he wants me to try one last effort at negotiation as a neutral in the affair thats a waste of time observed nilesa so he hopes she improvised itll keep them tied up while hes getting ready can you get me in without alarming anybody i can try i guess nilesa went forward and undogged a circular hatch in the floor at the end of the corridor how many guards on this entrance she whispered two or three i think the hatch swung up revealing a manwidth access tube with a ladder up one side and a pole down the middle hey wentz he shouted down it whos that a voice floated up me nilesa captain vorkosigan wants to send that betan frill down to talk to radnov what for how the hell should i know youre the ones whore supposed to have comm pickups in everybodys bunks maybe shes not such a good lay after all nilesa shrugged an apology toward her and she accepted it with a nod there was a whispered debate below is she armed cordelia readying both stunners shook her head would you give a weapon to a betan frill nilesa called back rhetorically watching her preparations in puzzlement all right put her in dog the hatch and let her drop if you dont close the hatch before she drops well shoot her got that yo whatll i be looking at when i get to the bottom she quizzed nilesa nasty spot youll be standing in a sort of niche in the storeroom off the main control room you can only get one man at a time through it and youre pinned in there like a target with the wall on three sides its designed that way on purpose no way to rush them through it i mean youre not planning to no way in hell good thanks cordelia climbed down into the tube and nilesa closed the hatch over her with a sound like the lid of a coffin all right came the voice from below drop its a long way down she called back having no trouble sounding tremulous im afraid screw it ill catch you all right she wrapped her legs and one arm around the pole her hand shook as she jammed the second stunner into her holster her stomach pumped sour bile into the back of her throat she swallowed took a deep breath to keep it there held her stunner pointed ready and dropped she landed facetoface with the man below his nerve disrupter held casually at the level of her waist his eyes widened as he saw her stunner here the barrayaran custom of allmale crews on warships paid her for he hesitated just a fraction of a second to shoot a woman in that fraction she fired first he slumped heavily over her head lolling on her shoulder bracing she held him as a shield before her her second shot laid out the next guard as he was bringing his disruptor to aim the third guard got off a hasty burst that was absorbed by the back of the man she held although the nimbus of it seared the outer edge of her left thigh the pain of it flared screamingly but no sound escaped her clenched teeth with a wild berserker accuracy that seemed no part of herself she felled him too then looked frantically around for a place of concealment some conduits ran overhead people entering a room usually look down and around before thinking to look up she stuck the stunner in her belt and with a leap she could never have duplicated in cold blood pulled herself up between the conduits and the armored ceiling breathing silently through her open mouth she drew her stunner again and prepared for whatever might come through the oval door to the main engineering bay what was that noise whats going on in there throw in a grenade and seal the door we cant our men are in there wentz report silence you go in tafas why me because i order you tafas crept cautiously around the door stepping over the threshold almost on tiptoe he turned around and around staring afraid that they would close and lock the door at another firing she waited until he at last looked up she smiled winningly at him and gave a little wave of her fingers close the door she mouthed silently pointing he stared at her with a very odd expression on his face baffled hopeful and angry all at once the bell of his disruptor seemed large as a searchlight pointed quite accurately at her head it was like looking into the eye of judgment a standoff of sorts vorkosigan is right she thought a disruptor does have real authority then tafas called i think there may be some kind of gas leak or something better close the door a second while i check it swung closed obediently behind him cordelia smiled down from the ceiling eyes narrowed hi want to get out of this mess what are you doing herebetan excellent question she thought ruefully trying to save a few lives dont worryyour friends over there are only stunned i wont mention the one hit by friendly firedead perhaps because of a moments mercy for me come on over to our side she coaxed madly echoing a childs game captain vorkosigan will forgive youexpunge the record give you a medal she promised recklessly what medal how should i know any medal you want you dont even have to kill anybody i have another stunner what guarantee do i have desperation made her daring vorkosigans word you tell him i pledged it to you who are you to pledge his word lady vorkosigan if we both live a lie truth hopeless fantasy tafas gave a whistle staring up at her belief began to illuminate his face you really want to be responsible for letting a hundred fifty of your friends breathe vacuum just to save that ministerial spys career she added cogently no he said firmly at last give me the stunner now shall trust be tested she dropped it down to him three down and seven to go whats the best approach i can lure a couple more in here the others are at the main entrance we can rush them from behind if were lucky go ahead tafas opened the door it was a gas leak he coughed convincingly help me drag these guys out and well seal the door i could swear i heard a stunner go off a while ago said his companion entering maybe they were trying to attract attention the mutineers face flared with suspicion as the stupidity of this suggestion sank in they didnt have stunners he began fortunately the second man entered at this point cordelia and tafas fired in unison five down five to go cordelia said dropping to the floor her left leg buckled it wasnt moving quite right odds are getting better all the time it had better be quick if its going to work at all warned tafas suits me they slid out the door and ran lightly across the engineering bay which continued its automatic tasks indifferent to its masters identity some blackuniformed bodies were piled carelessly to one side tafas held up his hand for caution as they rounded the corner jabbing a finger significantly cordelia nodded tafas walked around the corner quietly and cordelia pinned herself to its very edge waiting as tafas raised his stunner she oozed around searching for a target the chamber narrowed in this l ending in the main entrance to the deck above five men stood with their attention riveted to the clanks and hisses penetrating dimly through a hatch at the top of some metal stairs theyre getting ready to storm said one its time to let their air out famous last words she thought and fired once and twice tafas fired too rapidly fanning the group and it was over and i will never she pledged silently call one of stubens stunts harebrained again she wanted to throw down her stunner and howl and roll in reaction but her own job was not finished tafas she called ive got to do one more thing he came to her side looking shaky himself ive gotten you out of this and i need a favor in return how can i cut control to the longrange plasma weapons so you cant get it back for an hour and a half why do you want to do that did the captain order it no she said honestly the captain didnt order any of this but hell like it when he sees it dont you think tafas confused agreed if you short this panel he suggested it should slow things down quite a bit give me your plasma arc need i she wondered looking over the section yes he would fire on us just as surely as im cutting for home trust is one thing treason another i have no wish to test him to destruction now if tafas isnt fooling me by pointing out the controls to the toilets or something she blasted the panel and stared with a moments primitive fascination as it popped and sparked now she said handing the plasma arc back i want a couple of minutes head start then you can open the door and be a hero i suggest you call first and warn them sergeant botharis in front right thanks she glanced up at the main entry hatch about three meters away he is now she thought an uncrossable gulf so in the physics of the heart distance is relative its time thats absolute the seconds spun like spiders down her spine she chewed her lip eyes devouring tafas last chance to leave a message for vorkosiganno the absurdity of transmitting the words i love you through tafass mouth shook her with painful inward laughter my compliments sounded rather swelledheaded under the circumstances my regards too cold as for the simplest of all yes she shook her head silently and smiled at the puzzled soldier then ran back to the storeroom and scrambled back up the ladder she beat a rhythmic tattoo upon the hatch in a moment it opened she found herself nose to nose with a plasma arc held by yeoman nilesa ive got some new terms to carry back to your captain she said glibly theyre a little screwy but i think hell like them nilesa surprised let her out and resealed the hatch she walked away from him glancing down the main corridor as she passed several dozen men were assembled in it a technical team had half the panels off the walls sparks flared from a tool she could just see sergeant botharis head on the far side of the crowd and knew him to be standing next to vorkosigan she reached the ladder at the end of the corridor ascended it and began to run threading her way level by level through the maze of the ship laughing crying out of breath and shaking violently she arrived at the shuttle hatch corridor dr mcintyre stood guard trying to appear grim and barrayaran is everybody here he nodded looking at her with delight pile in lets go they sealed the doors behind them and fell into their seats as the shuttle pulled away at maximum acceleration with a crunch and a jerk pete lightner was piloting manually for his betan pilots neurological implant would not interface to the barrayaran control system without an interpreter coupler and cordelia braced herself for a terrifying ride she lay back in her seat still gasping lungs raw from her mad dash stuben joined her seething and staring worriedly at her uncontrollable trembling its a crime what they did to dubauer he said i wish we could blow up their whole damn ship is radnov still covering us do you know their longrange weapons will be out for a while she reported not volunteering details could she ever make him understand oh i meant to askwho was the barrayaran hit by disruptor fire planetside i dont know doc mac got his uniform hey macwhats the name on your pocket uh let me see if i can sound out their alphabet his lips moved silently koukoudelka cordelia bowed her head was he killed he wasnt dead when we left but he sure didnt look very healthy what were you doing all that time aboard the general asked stuben paying off a debt of honor all right be like that ill get the story later he was silent then added with a short nod i hope you got the bastard good whoever he was look stui appreciate all youve done but ive really got to be alone for a few minutes sure captain he gave her a look of concern and moved off muttering damned monsters under his breath cordelia leaned her forehead against the cold window and wept silently for her enemies chapter seven captain cordelia naismith betan expeditionary force fed the last normal space navigational observations into her ships computer beside her pilot officer parnell adjusted the leads and cannulae to his headset and settled more comfortably into his padded chair ready for the neurological control of the upcoming wormhole jump her new command was a slow bulk freighter unarmed a steady workhorse of the beta colony escobar trade run but there had been no direct communication with escobar for over sixty days now since the barrayaran invasion fleet had plugged the escobaran side of the exit as effectively as a cork in a bottle at last word the barrayaran and escobaran fleets were still maneuvering in a deadly gavotte for tactical position with little actual engagement the barrayarans were not expected to commit their ground forces until their control of escobaran space was secure cordelia intercomed engineering naismith here you about ready down there the face of her engineer a man she had first met but two days ago appeared on the screen he was young and pulled from survey like herself no point in wasting experienced and knowledgeable military personnel on this excursion like cordelia he wore survey fatigues the expeditionary force uniforms were rumored to be in the works but no one had seen them yet all set captain no fear trembled his voice well she reflected perhaps he was not old enough yet to have really come to believe in death after life she took one last look around settled herself and drew a breath pilot the ship is yours ship accepted maam he replied formally a few seconds ticked by an unpleasant wave of nausea passed over her and she had the gluey unsettling sensation of just waking up from a bad dream she could not remember the jump was over ship is yours maam muttered the pilot wearily the few seconds she had experienced translated to several subjective hours for him ship accepted pilot she grabbed for the comconsole and began punching up a look at the tactical situation into which they had popped there had been nothing through this passage for a month she hoped fervently the barrayaran crews would be bored and slow on the uptake there they were six ships two of them starting to move already so much for slow on the uptake right through the middle of em pilot she ordered keying data to him its best if we can draw em all off their stations the two moving ships neared rapidly and began firing with leisurely accuracy they were taking their time and making every shot count just a little target practice thats all we are she thought ill give you target practice all nonshield power systems dimmed and the ship seemed to groan as the plasma fire engulfed it then they cut across the tickling limit of the barrayarans range she called engineering projection ready ready and steady go twelve thousand kilometers behind them as if just emerged from the wormhole a betan dreadnought sprang into being it accelerated astonishingly for so large a craft indeed its speed matched their own it followed them like an arrow aha she clapped her hands in delight and cried into the intercom weve fetched em theyre all moving now oh better and better their pursuit ships slowed preparing to turn and attack this much bigger prize the four ships that had previously remained properly on station began to wheel away also minutes sped by as they jockeyed for position the last barrayaran ships wasted little fire on them scarcely more than a salute their attention all drawn to big brother behind them the barrayaran commanders undoubtedly felt themselves to be in a fine tactical position spread out in a gauntlet and beginning a withering fire the little ship preceding the warship was on the far side of them from escobar with nowhere to go they could pick it off at their leisure her own shields were down now and acceleration failing as the ghastly power drain of the projector took its toll but minute by precious minute the barrayaran blockaders were being drawn farther from their assigned mousehole we can keep this up for about ten more minutes the engineer called up all right save enough power to slag it when youre done if were captured command doesnt want one molecule left connected to another for the barrayarans to puzzle back together what a crime its such a beautiful machine im dying for a look inside you might too if the barrayarans capture us she thought she directed all her ships eyes back along their route far far back at the wormhole exit the first real betan freighter winked into existence and began to boost for escobar unopposed it was the newest addition to the merchant fleet stripped of weapons and shields rebuilt to do two things only now carry a heavy payload and go like hell then the second and the third that was it they were away and with a start the barrayarans could never hope to close the betan dreadnought exploded with a spectacular radioactive light show unfortunately there was no way to fake debris i wonder how long it will take the barrayarans to figure out theyve been had she thought i sincerely hope they have a sense of humor her ship drifted dead in space now its power nearly depleted she felt light in the head and realized it wasnt psychosomatic the artificial gravity was failing they rendezvoused with the engineer and his two assistants at the shuttle hatch traveling with gazellelike leaps that turned into birdlike swoops as the gravity gave up the ghost the shuttle which was to be their lifeboat was a strippeddown model cramped and comfortless into it they floated and sealed the hatch the pilot slid into the control chair and lowered his headset and the shuttle kicked away from the side of their dying ship the engineer floated to her and handed her a little black box i thought you ought to do the honors captain ha i bet you wouldnt kill your own dinner either she replied trying to lighten the mood they had served their ship together for barely five hours but it still hurt are we out of range parnell yes captain gentlemen she said and paused gathering them in by eye i thank you all look away from the left port please she pulled the lever on the box there was a soundless flash of brilliant blue light and a general rush for the tiny port immediately after to see the last red glow as the ship folded into itself carrying its military secrets to a wandering grave they shook hands solemnly all around some right side up some upside down some floating at other angles then secured themselves cordelia pulled herself into the navigation station beside parnell strapped in and ran a quick check of its systems now comes the tricky part murmured parnell id still be happier with a straight max boost and try to outrun em we could get away from those fat battlewagons maybe cordelia conceded but their fast couriers would eat us alive at least we look like a rock she added thinking of the artistic probereflective camouflage that encased the lifeboat like a shell several minutes of silence followed as she concentrated on her work all right she spoke at last lets sneak out of this neighborhood its going to be overcrowded very soon she did not fight the acceleration but let it press her back into her seat tired she hadnt thought it possible to be more tired than she was afraid this war nonsense was a great psychological education that chronometer had to be wrong surely it had been a year and not an hour a small light blinked on her control panel fear washed the weariness back out of her body with a rush kill everything she ordered tapping controls herself and was instantly plunged into weightless darkness parnell give us a little realistic tumble her inner ear and a greasy queasiness in her belly told her she was obeyed now her sense of time began to be truly disordered darkness and silence reigned but for an occasional whisper of movement fabric on plastic as someone stirred in his seat in her imagination she felt the barrayaran probes touching her ship touching her icy fingers up her back i am a rock i am a void i am a silence in the rear the silence was broken by the noise of someone vomiting and some muffled swearing blast this tumble hope he had time to grab a bag there came a jerk and a pressure of weight at an odd angle parnell spat an oath like a sob tractor tow thats it she sighed without relief and reached out to key the shuttle back to life wincing at the blinding brightness of the little lights well lets see whats caught us her hands flicked over the panels she took a glance at her exterior monitors and hastily pressed the red button that crashed the lifeboats computer memory and recognition codes what the hell have we got out there asked the engineer anxiously noting the gesture as he made his way to her shoulder two cruisers and a fast courier she informed him we appear to be slightly outnumbered he snorted unhappily a disembodied voice blared from the comm at too great a volume she turned it down quickly not acknowledge surrender we will destroy you this is lifeboat shuttle aa she responded modulating her voice carefully captain cordelia naismith betan expeditionary force commanding we are an unarmed lifeboat the comm emitted a surprised peh and the voice added another damned woman you people are slow learners there was an unintelligible murmur in the background and the voice returned to its original official tone you will be taken in tow at the first sign of resistance you will be obliterated understood acknowledged cordelia responded we surrender parnell shook his head angrily she killed the comm and raised an eyebrow i think we should try and make a break he said no these guys are professional paranoids the sanest one i ever met didnt like being in a room with a closed doorclaimed you never knew what was on the other side if they say theyll shoot youd better believe em parnell and the engineer exchanged a look go ahead nell said the engineer tell her parnell cleared his throat and moistened dry lips we wanted to let you know captainthat if you think uh blowing up the lifeboat might be the best thing for all concerned were with you nobody else is looking forward to being taken prisoner either cordelia blinked at this offer thatsvery courageous of you pilot officer but totally unnecessary dont flatter yourself we were handpicked for our ignorance not our knowledge you all only have guesses about what was aboard that convoy and even i dont know any technical details if we cooperate on the surface weve at least some chance of getting through this alive itwasnt spilling intelligence we were thinking about maam its their other habits a sticky silence fell cordelia sighed spiraling in a vortex of grieving doubt its all right she said at last their reputation is way overblown quite decent fellows some of them especially one her mind mocked and even assuming hes still alive do you really think you could find him in all this mess or finding him save him from the gifts you yourself have brought from hells hardware store without betraying your duty or is this a secret suicide pact do you even know yourself know thyself parnell watching her face shook his head grimly you sure ive never killed anybody in my life im not going to start with people on my own side for pitys sake parnell acknowledged the justice of this with a little quizzical shrug not quite concealing an underlying relief anyway ive got things to live for this war cant last forever somebody back home he asked and as her eyes turned to the probe readouts added wisely or out there uh yeah out there somewhere he shook his head in sympathy thats a tough one he studied her still profile and added encouragingly but youre right the big boys will blast those bastards out of the sky sooner or later she gave vent to a small mechanical ha and massaged her face with her fingertips trying to rub out the tension she had a sudden waking vision of a great warship cracked open spilling its living guts like some monstrous seedpod frozen sterile seeds adrift on no wind bloated from decompression and turning forever could one recognize a face after that she wondered she turned her chair half away from parnell signifying an end to the conversation a barrayaran fast courier took them in tow within an hour it was the familiar smell that hit her first the metalandmachineoil ozoneredolent lockerroom smell of a barrayaran warship the two tall soldiers in black who escorted her each keeping a hand firmly on her elbow maneuvered her through one last narrow oval doorway to what she guessed must be the main prison area of the great flagship she and her four men were stripped ruthlessly searched in minute and paranoid detail medically examined holographed retinaprinted identified and issued shapeless orange pajamas her men were led away separately in spite of her words to parnell she was sickened by dread of them being peeled layer by layer for information they did not hold gently now reason argued surely the barrayarans would save them for prisoner exchange the guards snapped to attention turning she saw a highranking barrayaran officer enter the processing chamber the bright yellow of the collar tabs on his dark green dress uniform marked a rank she had not seen before and with a shock she identified it as the color for a viceadmiral knowing what he was she knew at once who he was and studied him with grave interest vorrutyer that was his name cocommander of the barrayaran armada along with crown prince serg vorbarra she supposed he was the one who did the real work shed heard he was slated to be the barrayarans next minister of war so that was what a rising star looked like in a way he was a little like vorkosigan a bit taller about the same weight but less of it in bone and muscle and more of it in fat he had dark hair too curlier than vorkosigans and with less grey in it was a similar age and rather more handsome his eyes were quite different a deep velvet brown fringed by long black lashes by far the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen in a mans face they triggered a small subliminal wailing deep in her mind crying you thought you had faced fear earlier today but you were mistaken here is the real thing fear without exhilaration or hope which was strange for they ought to have attracted her she broke eye contact telling herself firmly the unease and instant dislike were mere nerves and waited identify yourself betan he growled it gave her a disjointed sense of dejavu she fought for equilibrium giving him a snappy salute and saying smartly captain cordelia naismith betan expeditionary we are a military party combatants this private joke of course passed by him hah strip her and turn her about he stepped back watching the two grinning soldiers guarding her obeyed i dont like the way this is starting out she forced her face to blandness holding on to all her secret sources of serenity calm calm this one wants to rattle you you can see it in his eyes his hungry eyes calm a little old but shell do ill send for her later the guard shoved the pajamas back at her she dressed slowly to annoy them like a striptease in reverse with precise controlled motions of the sort suitable for a japanese tea ceremony one growled and the other shoved her roughly in the back toward her cell she smiled sourly at her success thinking well at least i have that much control over my destiny should i award myself points if i can goad them into beating me up they bundled her into a bare metal room and left her she continued the ploy for her own thin amusement by kneeling gracefully on the floor with the same sort of movements right toe crossed correctly over the left hands resting motionless upon her thighs the touch reminded her of the patch on her left leg that was devoid of all sensation heat cold pain pressure legacy of her last encounter with the armies of barrayar she halfclosed her eyes and let her mind drift hoping to give her captors an unsettling impression of deep and possibly dangerous psychic meditations pretend aggression was better than nothing after an hour or so of stillness by which time her unaccustomed muscles were protesting the kneeling position most painfully the guard returned admiral wants you he said laconically come along she had a guard at each elbow again for the trip through the ship one grinned and undressed her with his eyes the other looked at her with pity far more disturbing she began to wonder just how much her time with vorkosigan had led her to discount the risks of capture they came to officers country and stopped before an oval metal door in a row of identical ones the grinning guard knocked and was bidden to enter this admirals quarters were very different from her austere cabin aboard the general vorkraft for one thing the bulkheads had been knocked out of the two adjoining chambers giving a triple share of space it was full of personal furnishings of a most luxurious order admiral vorrutyer rose from a velvetcovered seat as she entered but she did not mistake it for a gesture of courtesy he walked slyly around her as she stood silent watching her gaze travel around the room a step up from that cell eh he probed for the guards benefit she replied looks like a whores boudoir the grinning guard choked and the other one laughed outright but cut it off quickly at a glare from vorrutyer didnt think it was that funny she puzzled some of the details of the decor began to penetrate and she realized shed spoken more truly than she knew what an extremely odd little statuette in that corner for instance although it had a certain redeeming artistic merit she supposed one with very unusual customers she added buckle her in ordered vorrutyer and return to your posts ill call you when im done she was placed on her back across his wide nonregulation bed arms and legs stretched to the four corners and tautly attached by soft bracelets to short chains attached in turn to the bedframe simple chilling quite beyond her strength to break the guard who pitied whispered to her under his breath as he buckled a wrist strap hidden almost inaudibly in a sigh sorry its all right she breathed back their eyes passed over each other hiding the secret transaction from the watching vorrutyer ha thats what you think now murmured the other through his grin fastening the other strap shut up muttered the first and shot him a fierce look an unclean silence filled the room until the guards withdrew looks like a permanent installation she observed to vorrutyer horribly fascinated it was like a sick joke come to life what do you do when you cant catch betans call for volunteers a frown appeared between his eyes briefly then smoothed keep it up he encouraged it amuses me it will make the ultimate denouement so much more piquant he loosened his uniform collar poured himself a glass of wine from a very nonregulation portable bar in one corner and seated himself on the bed beside her with the chatty air of a man visiting a sick friend he looked her over minutely beautiful brown eyes liquid with anticipation she tried to string herself along maybe hes only a rapist it might be possible to handle a simple rapist such direct childlike souls hardly offensive at all even vileness has a relative range i dont know any military secrets worth a thing she fenced this isnt really worth your time i didnt think you did he replied easily although you will undoubtedly insist on telling me everything you know over the next few weeks quite tedious im not in the least interested if i want your information my medical staff can have it out of you in a trice he sipped his wine although its curious you should bring up the subjectperhaps i will send you to sickbay later today her stomach knotted fool she shrieked silently at herself did you just blow a chance of ducking interrogation but no it had to be standard operating procedurehes just working you over subtle calm he drank again do you know i think i shall enjoy having an older woman for a change the young ones may look pretty but theyre too easy no sport i can tell already youre going to be great sport a very great fall requires a very great height to fall from not so she sighed and gazed up at the ceiling well im sure it will be educational she tried to remember how shed occupied her mind during sex with her old lover in the bad times before shed finally shed him this might well be no worse vorrutyer smiling put his wine down on a bedside table and took from its drawer a small knife sharp as an oldfashioned scalpel with a jeweled handle that glittered before his hand eclipsed it rather desultorily he began slicing away at the orange pajamas peeling them away from her like the skin of a fruit isnt that government property she inquired but was sorry shed spoken for a tremble made the word property squeaky it was like throwing a tidbit to a hungry dog likely to make him jump higher he chuckled pleased oops deliberately he let the knife slip it sliced half an inch into her thigh he watched her face avidly for her reaction it was in the area without sensation she could not even feel the wet trickle of blood that welled from the wound his eyes narrowed in disappointment she even kept from glancing down she wished shed studied more about trance states im not going to rape you today he offered conversationally if thats what youve been thinking it had crossed my mind i cant imagine what suggested it theres scarcely time he explained today is but the as it were hors douevre of the banquet or a simple clear soup very pristine all the complicated things will be saved for dessert in a few weeks i never eat dessert weight you know he chuckled again you are a delight he put the knife down and took another sip of wine you know officers always delegate their work now i am an aficionado of earth history my favorite century is the eighteenth id have guessed the fourteenth or the twentieth in a day or two i shall teach you not to interrupt where was i ah yes well in my reading i came upon the loveliest scene where a certain great lady he raised the wineglass to her in a toast was raped by a diseased servant on the orders of his master very piquant venereal disease is alas a thing of the past but i am able to command a diseased servant although his disease is mental rather than physical a real bona fide paranoid schizophrenic like master like man she shot at random i cannot keep this up much longer my heart shall fail me soon this won a rather sour smile he hears voices you know like joan of arc except that he tells me they are demons not saints he has visual hallucinations too on occasion and hes a very large man ive used him before many times hes not the sort of fellow who finds it easy to er attract women there was a timely knock on the door and vorrutyer went to it ah come in sergeant i was just talking about you bothari she breathed ducking his head through the door came the tall frame and familiar borzoi face of vorkosigans soldier how how could he have hit on her personal nightmare a kaleidoscope of images spun through her memory a dappled wood the crackle of disruptors the faces of the dead and the halfdead a looming shape like the shadow of death she focused on the present reality would he recognize her his eyes had not yet touched her they were fixed on vorrutyer too close together those eyes and not quite on the same level they gave his face an unusual degree of asymmetry that added much to his remarkable ugliness her boiling imagination lurched to his body his bodyit was all wrong somehow hunched in his black uniform not like the straight figure she had last seen demanding pride of place from vorkosigan wrong wrong terribly wrong a head taller than vorrutyer yet he seemed almost to creep before his master his spine was coiled with tension as he glowered down at historturer what she wondered might a mind molester like vorrutyer do with the material presented by bothari god vorrutyer do you imagine in your amoral flashy freakiness in your monstrous vanity that you control this elemental and you dare play games with that sullen madness in his eyes her thoughts kept time with her racing pulse there are two victims in this room there are two victims in this room there are two there you go sergeant vorrutyer hooked a thumb over his shoulder at cordelia spreadeagled on the bed rape me this woman he pulled up a chair and prepared to watch closely and gleefully go on go on bothari face as unreadable as ever unfastened his trousers and approached the foot of the bed he looked at her for the first time any last words captain naismith vorrutyer inquired sarcastically or have you finally run out of words she stared at bothari shaken by a pity almost like love he seemed nearly in a trance lust without pleasure anticipation without hope poor sod she thought what a mess theyve made of you no longer fencing for points she searched her heart for words not for vorrutyer but for bothari some healing wordsi would not add to his madness the air of the room seemed clammy cold and she shivered feeling unutterably weary resistless and sad he crouched over her heavy and dark as lead making the bed creak i believe she said slowly at last that the tormented are very close to god im sorry sergeant he stared at her his face a foot from hers for so long she wondered if hed heard her his breath was not good but she did not flinch then to her astonishment he stood up and refastened his pants trembling slightly no sir he said in his bass monotone what vorrutyer sat up amazed why not he demanded the sergeant groped for words shes commodore vorkosigans prisoner sir vorrutyer stared first puzzled then illuminated so youre vorkosigans betan his cool amusement evaporated at the name with a hiss like a drop of water on a redhot coil vorkosigans betan a brief hope flared within her that vorkosigans name might be a password to safety but it died the chance of this creature being any kind of a friend of his was surely something well under zero he was looking now not at her but through her like a window on some more wonderful view vorkosigans betan ive got that stiffnecked puritan sonofabitch by the balls now he breathed fiercely this could be even better than the day i told him about his wife the expression on his face was strange and startling the mask of suavity seeming to melt and run off in patches it was like stumbling suddenly over the center of a caldera he seemed to remember the mask and clutched its pieces around him halfeffectually do you know you have quite overwhelmed me the possibilities you presenteighteen years were not too long to wait for so ideal a revenge a woman soldier ha he probably thought you the ideal solution to our mutualdifficulty my perfect warrior my dear hypocrite aral you have much to learn of him i wager but do you know i somehow feel quite certain he hasnt mentioned me to you not by name she agreed possibly by category and what category was that i believe the term he used was scum of the service he grinned sourly i shouldnt recommend namecalling to a woman in your position oh you embrace the category then her response was automatic but her heart was shrinking within her leaving an echoing hollowness what is vorkosigan doing in the center of this ones madness his eyes look like botharis now his smile tightened ive embraced a number of things in my time not least of which was your puritan lover let your imagination dwell on that a while my dear my sweet my pet youd scarcely believe it to meet him now but he was quite a merry widower before he gave himself over so irritatingly to these random outbreaks of righteousness he laughed your skin is very white has he touched itso he ran one fingernail up the inside of her arm and she shuddered and your hair i am quite certain he must be fascinated by that twining hair so fine and such an unusual color he twisted a strand gently between his fingers i must think what can be done with that hair one might remove the scalp entirely of course but there must be something more creative yet perhaps ill take a bit with me and take it out and play with it quite casually at the staff meeting let it slip silkily through my fingerssee how long it takes to lock his attention on it feed the doubt and the growing fear with oh one or two casual remarks i wonder how much it would take to start him scrambling those annoyingly perfect reports of hisha then send him off for about a week of detached duty still wondering still in doubt he picked up the jeweled knife and sawed off a thick strand to coil up and place carefully in his breast pocket smiling down at her the while one must be careful of course not to goad him quite into violencehe becomes so tediously unmanageable he ran one finger in an lshaped motion across the left side of his chin in the exact position of vorkosigans scar much easier to start than stop although hes become remarkably temperate of late your influence my pet or is he simply growing old he tossed the knife carelessly back on the bedside table then rubbed his hands together laughed out loud and draped himself beside her to murmur lovingly in her ear and after escobar when we need no longer regard the emperors watchdog there will be no limit to what i can do so many choices he gave vent to a stream of plans for torturing vorkosigan through her glistening with obscene detail he was taut with his vision his face pale and moist you cant possibly get away with anything like that she said faintly there was fear in her face now and tears running down from the corners of her eyes in iridescent trails to wet the tendrils of hair around her ears but he was scarcely interested she had believed she had fallen into the deepest possible pit of fear but now that floor opened beneath her and she fell again endlessly turning in the air some measure of control seemed to return to him and he walked around the foot of the bed looking at her well how very refreshing do you know i am quite energized i believe i shall do it myself after all you should be glad im much better looking than bothari not to me he dropped his trousers and prepared to climb on her do you forgive me too sweetheart she felt cold and dry and vanishingly small im afraid ill have to leave that to the infinitely merciful you exceed my capacity later in the week he promised mistaking her defeat for flippancy and clearly excited by what he took for a continued show of resistance sergeant bothari had been mooning around the room head moving from side to side and narrow jaw working as cordelia had seen it once before a sign of agitation vorrutyer intent on cordelia paid no attention to the movements behind him so his moment of utter astonishment was very brief when the sergeant grabbed him by his curly hair yanked his head back and drew the jeweled knife most expertly around his neck slicing through all four of the major vessels in a swift double movement the blood spurted over cordelia in a fountain horribly hot and flowing vorrutyer gave one convulsive twist and lost consciousness as the blood pressure in his brain fell to nothing sergeant bothari let go of the hair and vorrutyer dropped between her legs and slithered down out of sight over the end of the bed the sergeant stood hulkingly breathing heavily by the end of the bed cordelia could not remember if shed screamed no matter odds were no one paid much attention to screams coming out of this room anyway she felt frozen and bloodless in her hands face feet her heart hammered she cleared her throat uh thank you sergeant bothari that was a very uh knightly deed do you suppose you could unbuckle me too her voice squeaked uncontrollably and she swallowed irritated at it she regarded bothari with terrorized fascination there was absolutely no way of predicting what he might do next muttering to himself with a look of bewilderment on his face he fumbled apart the buckle on her left wrist swiftly stiffly she rolled over and loosed the right wrist then sat up and undid the ankles she sat crosslegged a moment in the center of the bed stark naked and dripping with blood rubbing ankles and wrists and trying to get her paralyzed brain into motion clothes clothes she muttered to herself she peeked over the end of the bed at the crumpled form of the late admiral vorrutyer pants about his ankles and his last look of surprise frozen on his face the great brown eyes had lost their liquid glow and were already beginning to film over she slipped out of the side of the bed away from bothari and began searching frantically through the metal drawers and cupboards that lined the room a couple of the drawers contained his toy collection and she shut them hastily nauseated finally understanding what hed meant by his last words the mans taste in perversions had certainly had remarkable scope some uniforms all with too much yellow insignia at last she found a set of plain black fatigues she wiped the blood from her body with a soft dressing gown and flung them on sergeant bothari meanwhile had sat on the floor curled up with his head resting on his knees talking under his breath she knelt beside him was he starting to hallucinate she had to get him to his feet and out of here they could not count on being undiscovered much longer yet where could they hide or was it adrenaline not reason that demanded flight was there a better option as she hesitated the door slammed suddenly open she cried out for the first time but the man standing whitefaced in the aperture with the plasma arc in his hand was vorkosigan chapter eight she sighed shakily at the sight of him and the paralyzing panic streamed out of her in that long breath my god you almost gave me heart failure she managed in a small tight voice come in and close the door his lips moved silently around the shape of her name and he entered a sudden panic in his face almost matching her own then she saw he was followed by another officer a lieutenant with brown hair and a bland puppy face so she did not fling herself upon him and shriek into his shoulder as she passionately wished but said instead cautiously theres been an accident close the door illyan said vorkosigan to the lieutenant his features became tightly controlled as the young man came even with him youre going to have to witness this with the greatest attention his lips pressed to a white slit vorkosigan walked slowly around the room noting the details some of which he pointed out silently to his companion the lieutenant said er ah at the first gesture which was with the plasma arc vorkosigan stopped before the body looked at the weapon in his hand as though seeing it for the first time and put it in its holster been reading the marquis again have you he addressed the corpse with a sigh he turned it over with the toe of his boot and a little more blood ran out of the meaty slice in its neck a little learning is a dangerous thing he glanced up at cordelia which of you should i congratulate she moistened her lips im not sure how annoyed is everyone going to be about this the lieutenant was going through vorrutyers drawers and cupboards also using a handkerchief to open them and from his expression finding that his cosmopolitan education was not so complete as he had supposed he remained staring for a long time into the drawer that cordelia had shut so hastily the emperor for one will be delighted said vorkosigan butstrictly in private in fact i was tied up at the time sergeant bothari uh did the honors vorkosigan glanced at bothari still sitting curled up on the floor hm he gazed around the room one last time theres something about this that reminds me forcibly of that remarkable scene when we broke into my engine room it has your personal signature my grandmother had a phrase for itsomething about late and a dollar a day late and a dollar short suggested cordelia involuntarily yes that was it he bit an ironic twist from his lips a very betan remarki begin to see why his face maintained a mask of cool neutrality but his eyes searched her in secret agony was i ah short not at all she reassured him youre um very timely i was just dithering around in a panic wondering what to do next he was facing away from illyan and a quickly suppressed grin crinkled his eyes briefly it seems i am rescuing my fleet from you then he murmured between his teeth not exactly what i had in mind when i came up here but im glad to rescue something he raised his voice as soon as youre done illyan i suggest we adjourn to my cabin for further discussion vorkosigan knelt by bothari studying him that bloody bastard has about ruined him again he growled he was almost well after his time with me sergeant bothari he said more gently can you walk a little way with me bothari muttered something unintelligible into his knees come here cordelia said vorkosigan it was the first time she had heard her first name in his mouth see if you can get him up i dont think id better touch him just now she got down into the line of his sight bothari bothari look at me youve got to get up and walk a little way she took his bloodcoated hand and tried to think of a line of reason or more likely unreason that might reach him she tried a smile look see youre washed in blood blood washes away sin right youre going to be all right now uh the bad man is gone and in a little while the bad voices will go away too so you come along with me and ill take you where you can rest during this speech he gradually focused on her and at the end he nodded and stood still holding his hand she followed vorkosigan out illyan bringing up the rear she hoped her psychological bandaid would hold an alarm of any sort might touch him off like a bomb she was astonished when vorkosigans cabin proved to be just one door down across the corridor are you captain of this ship she asked his collar tabs now that she got a better look at them proclaimed him a commodore now were you here all the time no im on the staff my courier just got in from the front a few hours ago ive been in conference with admiral vorhalas and the prince ever since it just broke up i came up straight away when the guard told me about vorrutyers new prisoner youin my foulest nightmare i never dreamed it might be you vorkosigans cabin seemed tranquil as a monks cell compared to the carnage they had left across the hall everything regulation a proper soldiers room vorkosigan locked the door behind them he rubbed his face and sighed drinking her in are you sure youre all right just shaken up i knew i was running risks when i was selected but i wasnt expecting anything quite like that man he was a classic im surprised you served him his face became shuttered i serve the emperor she became conscious of illyan standing silent and watchful what would she say if vorkosigan asked her about the convoy he was a greater danger to her duty than torture she had begun to think in the past months that their separation must eventually diminish her hearthunger for him but seeing him live and intense before her made it ravenous no telling what he felt though right now he looked tired uncertain and strained wrong all wrong ah permit me to introduce lieutenant simon illyan of the emperors personal security staff hes my spy lieutenant illyan commander naismith its captain naismith now she put in automatically the lieutenant shook her hand with a bland calm innocence wholly at odds with the bizarre scene they had just left he might have been at an embassy reception her touch left a streak of blood on his palm who do you spy on i prefer the term surveillance he said bureaucratic weaselwording put in vorkosigan he added to cordelia the lieutenant spies on me he represents a compromise between the emperor the ministry of political education and myself the phrase the emperor used said illyan distantly was ceasefire yes lieutenant illyan also has an eidetic memory biochip you may think of him as a recording device with legs which the emperor may play back at will cordelia stared covertly at him its too bad we couldnt meet again under more auspicious circumstances she said carefully to vorkosigan there are no auspicious circumstances here lieutenant illyan cleared his throat glancing at bothari who stood twining and untwining his fingers and staring at the wall what now sir hm there is entirely too much physical evidence in that room not to mention witnesses as to who went in and when to attempt to monkey with the scenario personally i should prefer for bothari not to have been there at all the fact that he is clearly non compos mentis will carry no weight with the prince when he gets wind of this he stood thinking furiously you will simply have to have escaped before illyan and i arrived on the scene i dont know how long it will be possible to hide bothari in heremaybe i can get some sedatives for him his eye fell on illyan how about the emperors staff agent in the medical section illyan looked noncommittal its possible something might be arranged good man he turned to cordelia youre going to have to stay in here and keep bothari under control illyan and i must go at once or there will be too many unaccounted minutes between the time we left vorhalas and the time we sound the alarm the princes security men will be going over that room thoroughly and everyones movements as well were vorrutyer and the prince in the same party she asked feeling for footing in the riptides of barrayaran politics vorkosigan smiled bitterly they were just good friends and he was gone leaving her alone with bothari and utter confusion she had bothari sit down in vorkosigans desk chair where he fidgeted silently and incessantly she sat crosslegged on the bed trying to radiate an air of calm control and good cheer not easy from a spirit filled with panic frenzied for expression bothari stood and began to pace about the room talking to himself no not to himself she realized and most certainly not to her the choppy whispered flow of words made no sense to her at all time flowed by slowly viscous with fear both she and bothari jumped when the door clicked open but it was only illyan bothari fell into a knifefighters crouch as he slipped in servants of the beast are the beasts hands he said he feeds them on the wifes blood bad servants illyan eyed him nervously and pressed some ampules into her hand here you give it to him one of these would knock out a charging elephant cant stay he slipped back out again coward she muttered after him but he was probably right she might well have a better chance than he of getting it into the sergeant botharis agitation was approaching an explosive level she set the bulk of the ampules aside and approached him with a sunny smile its effect was diminished by her eyes large with fear botharis eyes were flickering slits commodore vorkosigan wants you to rest now he sent some medicine to help you he backed warily before her and she stopped cautious of forcing him into a corner its just a sedative see the beasts drugs made the demons drunk they sang and shouted bad medicine no no this is good medicine it will make the demons go to sleep she promised this was walking a tightrope in the dark she tried another tack come to attention soldier she said sharply inspection it was a wrong move he batted the ampule nearly out of her hand as she tried to stick it in his arm and his hand closed around her wrist like a hot iron band her breath hissed inward at the pain but she just managed to twist her fingers around and press the administrative spray end of the ampule against the inside of his wrist before he picked her up bodily and flung her across the room she landed on her back skidding across the friction matting with what seemed to her a dreadful amount of noise fetching up with a bang against the door bothari lunged after her can he kill me before the stuff cuts in she wondered wildly and forced herself to go limp as if unconscious surely unconscious people were very nonthreatening evidently not to bothari for his hands closed around her neck one knee pressed into her rib cage and she felt something go painfully wrong in the region she popped her eyes open in time to see his eyes roll back his hands slackened in their twisting and he rolled off her to his hands and knees head wagging dizzily then slumped to the deck she sat up leaning against the wall i want to go home she muttered this wasnt in my job description the feeble joke did nothing to dissolve the clot of hysteria rising in her throat so she fell back on an older and more serious discipline whispering its words aloud by the time she finished selfcontrol had returned she could not lift bothari to the bunk she raised his heavy head and slipped the pillow under it and pulled his arms and legs into a more comfortablelooking position when vorkosigan and his shadow returned they could have a go at it the door opened at last and vorkosigan and illyan entered closing it quickly and walking carefully around bothari well said cordelia how did it go with machinelike precision like a wormhole jump to hell vorkosigan replied he turned his hand palm upward in a familiar gesture that caught her heart like a hook she looked her puzzlement at him youre as baffling as bothari how did they take the murder it went just fine im under arrest and confined to quarters for suspicion of conspiracy the prince thinks i put bothari up to it he explained god knows how uh i know im very tired she said and not thinking too clearly but you did say just fine commodore vorkosigan sir interrupted illyan keep in mind that im going to have to report this conversation what conversation said vorkosigan you and i are alone in here remember youre not required to observe me when im alone as everyone knows theyll start wondering why youre lingering in here before long lieutenant illyan frowned over this jesuitry the emperors intention yes tell me all about the emperors intention vorkosigan looked savage the emperors intention as communicated to me was that you be discouraged from incriminating yourself i cannot edit my report you know that was your argument four weeks ago you saw the result illyan looked perturbed vorkosigan spoke low and controlled everything the emperor requires of me will be accomplished hes a great choreographer and he shall have his dance of dreamers down to the last step vorkosigans hand closed in a fist and opened again i have withheld nothing that is mine from his service not my life not even my honor grant me this he pointed at cordelia you gave me your word on it then do you intend to take it back will someone please tell me what you are talking about interrupted cordelia lieutenant illyan is having a little conflict at the moment between duty and conscience said vorkosigan folding his arms and staring at the far wall it is not solvable without redefining one or the other and he must now choose which you see there was another incident illyan jerked his thumb in the direction of vorrutyers quarters like that with a prisoner a few weeks ago commodore vorkosigan wanted to er do something about it then i talked him out of it afterafterwards i agreed that i would not interfere with any action he chose to take should the situation come up again did vorrutyer kill her asked cordelia morbidly no said illyan he stared moodily at his boots come on illyan said vorkosigan wearily if they arent discovered you can give the emperor your true report and let him edit it if they are found herethe public integrity of your reports is not going to be your most pressing worry believe me damn captain negri was right said illyan he usually iswhat was the instance he said that permitting private judgments to turn my duty in the smallest matter would be just like getting a little bit pregnantthat the consequences would very soon get beyond me vorkosigan laughed captain negri is a very experienced man but i can tell you thatvery rarelyeven he has been known to make a private judgment but security is tearing the place apart out there theyre going to arrive back here eventually just by process of elimination the moment it occurs to someone to suspect my integrity its all over in time agreed vorkosigan how much time do you estimate theyll complete the search sweep of the ship in a few hours then youll just have to redirect their efforts widen their search areadidnt any ships depart the flag during the time window after vorrutyers death and before the security cordon was started yes two but good use your imperial influence there volunteer all the assistance that you as captain negris most trusted aide can supply mention negri frequently suggest recommend doubt better not bribe or threaten thats too obvious although it may come to that slander their inspection procedures make records evaporatewhatever is necessary to muddy the waters buy me fortyeight hours illyan thats all i ask all choked illyan all try to be sure its you and no one else who brings meals and so on and try to slip in some extra rations when you do vorkosigan relaxed measurably when he had gone and turned to her with a sad and awkward smile that was good as a touch well met lady she sketched him a salute and returned the smile i hope i havent messed things up for you too much personally that is by no means in fact you have simplified them enormously east is west up is down and being falsely arrested for getting your cos throat cut is a simplification i must be on barrayar i dont suppose youd care to explain whats going on around here no but at last i understand why there have been so many madmen in barrayaran history they are not its cause they are its effect he sighed and spoke so low it was almost a whisper oh cordelia you have no idea how much i need one sane clean person near me you are water in the desert you look pretty uhyou look like youve lost weight he looked she thought ten years older than six months ago oh me he ran his hand over his face im not thinking you must be exhausted do you want to go to sleep or something im not sure i can yet but id like to wash up didnt think i ought to run the shower when you werent here in case its monitored good thinking go ahead she rubbed her hand over her nerveless thigh black cloth sticky with blood uh have you got a change of clothes for me these are messed up besides they were vorrutyers they have a psychic stink right his face darkened is that your blood yeah vorrutyer was playing surgeon it doesnt hurt ive got no nerves there hm vorkosigan fingered his scar and smiled a little yes i think i have just the thing for you he unlocked one of his drawers with an eightdigit number code sorted down to the bottom layer and to cordelias astonishment pulled out the survey fatigues she had left behind on the general vorkraft now cleaned mended pressed and neatly folded i havent got the boots with me and the insignia are obsolete but i rather imagine these will fit vorkosigan remarked blandly handing them over yousaved my clothes as you see good heavens uhwhy his mouth crimped ruefully wellit was all you left except for the shuttle your people abandoned downside which would have made a rather awkward memento she ran her hand over the tan cloth feeling suddenly shy but just before disappearing into the bathroom with the clothes and a firstaid kit she said abruptly ive still got my barrayaran uniform at home wrapped in paper in a drawer she gave him a firm nod his eyes lit when she came out again the room was dim and nightquiet but for a light over the desk where vorkosigan was studying a disk at his computer interface she hopped onto his bed and sat crosslegged again wriggling her bare toes whats all that homework its my official function on vorrutyersthe late admiral vorrutyersstaff he smiled a little as he corrected himself like the famous tiger of the limerick when he returned from the ride with the lady inside im charged with planning and keeping the contingency orders up to date in case we are forced to fall back as the emperor said in the council meeting since i was so convinced it was going to be a disaster i could bloody well do the planning for it im regarded as a bit of a fifth wheel around here at the moment things going well for your side are they she asked oppressed were becoming nicely overextended some people regard that as progress he entered some new data then shut down the interface she sought to turn the subject from the dangerous present i take it you didnt get charged with treason after all she asked thinking back to their last conversation long ago and far away above another world ah that turned out something of a draw i was recalled back to barrayar after you escaped minister grishnovhes head of political education and third in real power after the emperor and captain negriwas practically drooling on himself he was so convinced hed got me at last but my case against radnov was airtight the emperor stepped in before we could draw blood and forced a compromise or more correctly an abeyance i havent actually been cleared the charges are still pending in some legal limbo howd he do it sleight of hand he was giving grishnov and the whole war party everything theyd asked for the entire escobar scheme on a platter and more he gave them the prince and all the credit after the conquest of escobar grishnov and the prince each think theyre going to be the de facto ruler of barrayar he even made vorrutyer swallow my promotion pointed out hed have me directly under his command vorrutyer saw the light at once vorkosigans teeth set at some searing memory his hand opening and closing once unconsciously how long have you known him she asked cautiously thinking of the bottomless well of hatred she had fallen down his eyes slid away from her we were in school and lieutenants together back when he was only a common voyeur he grew worse i understand in recent years since he started associating with prince serg and thinking he could get away with anything god help us he was nearly right bothari has done a great public service you knew him better than that my breath thought cordelia was that your infection of the imagination so hard to fight off bothari has done a great private service too it seems speaking of botharinext time you sedate him he went wild when i came at him with the ampule ah yes i think i understand why it was in one of captain negris reports vorrutyer was in the habit of drugging his uh players with a variety of concoctions when he wanted a better show im fairly certain bothari was one of his victims that way vile she felt sick her muscles cramped around the ache in her side whos this captain negri you keep talking about negri he does keep a low profile but hes hardly secret he heads the emperors personal security staff illyans boss they call him ezar vorbarras familiar if you think of the ministry of political education as the emperors right hand then negri is his left the one the right is not permitted to know he watches internal security on the highest levelsthe ministry heads the counts the emperors familythe prince vorkosigan frowned introspectively i came to know him rather well during the preparations for this strategists nightmare curious fellow he could have any rank he wanted but forms are meaningless to him hes only interested in substance is he a good guy or bad guy what an absurd question i just thought he might be the power behind the throne hardly if ezar vorbarra said youre a frog hed hop and croak no there is only one emperor on barrayar and he permits no one to get behind him he still remembers how he came to power she stretched and winced at the pain in her side something wrong he asked instantly concerned oh bothari got me with his knee when we had that goround about the sedative i thought for sure theyd hear us scared me to death may i see his fingers slid gently along her ribs it was only in her imagination that they left a trail of rainbow light ow yes you have two cracked ribs thought so im lucky it wasnt my neck she lay hack and he made shift to tape them with strips of cloth then sat beside her on his bunk have you ever considered chucking it all and moving someplace nobody ever bothers with cordelia asked earth for example he smiled often i even had a little fantasy about emigrating to beta colony and turning up on your doorstep do you have a doorstep not as such but go on i cant imagine what id do for a living there im a strategist not a technician or navigator or pilot so i couldnt go into your merchant fleet they would scarcely take me in your military and i cant see myself being elected to office cordelia snorted wouldnt that startle steady freddy is that what you call your president i didnt vote for him the only employment i can think of would be as a teacher of martial arts for sport would you marry a judo instructor dear captain but no he sighed barrayar is bred in my bones i cannot shake it no matter how far i travel this struggle god knows has no honor in it but exile for no other motive than easethat would be to give up all hope of honor the last defeat with no seed of future victory in it she thought of the deadly cargo she had convoyed now safe on escobar compared to all the lives that hung on it her own and vorkosigans weighed less than a feather he misread the grief in her face she thought for fear it isnt exactly like waking from the nightmare to see your face he touched it gently fingertips on the curve of her jaw thumb laid a moment across her lips lighter than a kiss more like knowing while dreaming still that beyond the dream there is a waking world i mean to join you in that waking world someday youll see youll see he squeezed her hand and smiled reassuringly on the floor bothari stirred and groaned ill take care of him vorkosigan said get some sleep while you can chapter nine she woke to movement and voices vorkosigan was rising from his chair and illyan was standing before him taut as a bowstring saying vorhalas and the prince here now sonofa vorkosigan turned on his heel eyes raking the little room itll have to be the bathroom fold him into the shower swiftly vorkosigan took botharis shoulders and illyan his feet bumping through the narrow door and dumping him pellmell into the fixture should he have more sedative asked illyan maybe hed better cordelia give him another ampule its too early but its death for you both if he makes a noise now he bundled her into the closetsized room shoving the drug into her hand and killing the light no noise no movement door shut asked illyan partway lean on the frame look casual and dont let the princes bodyguard wander into your psychological space cordelia feeling her way in the dimness knelt and pressed another shot of sedative into the unconscious sergeants arm seating herself in the logical spot she found she could just see a slice of vorkosigans cabin in the mirror reversed and disorienting she heard the cabin door open and new voices unless you mean to officially relieve him of his duties as well i will continue to follow standard procedure i saw that room your charge is nonsensical we will see replied the second voice tight and angry hello aral the owner of the first voice an officer of perhaps fifty in dress greens shook vorkosigans hand and presented him with a packet of data disks were off to escobar within the hour courier just brought thesethe latest hardcopy updates ive ordered you to be kept up on events the escos are falling back through the whole volume theyve even abandoned that slugging match for the wormhole jump to tau ceti weve got them on the run the owner of the second voice also wore dress greens more heavily encrusted with gilt than any she had ever seen jeweled decorations on his breast glinted and winked like lizards eyes in the light from vorkosigans desk lamp he was about thirty black haired with a rectangular tense face hooded eyes and thin lips compressed now with annoyance youre not both going are you said vorkosigan the senior officer ought properly to stay with the flag now that vorrutyer is dead his duties devolve on the prince that dogandpony show you had planned was based on the assumption that he would still be at his post prince serg went stiff with outrage i will lead my troops on escobar let my father and his cronies try to say i am no soldier now you will said vorkosigan wearily sit in that fortified palace that half the engineers are going to be tied up constructing and party in it and let your men do your dying for you until youve bought your ground by the sheer weight of the corpses piled on it because thats the kind of soldiering your mentor has taught you and then send bulletins home about your great victory maybe you can have the casualty lists declared top secret aral careful warned vorhalas shocked you go too far the prince snarled especially for a man who will get no closer to the fighting than clinging to the wormhole exit for home if you want to talk ofundue caution his tone clearly made the phrase a euphemism for an uglier term you can hardly order me confined to quarters and then accuse me of cowardice for not being at the front sir even minister grishnovs propaganda has to simulate logic better than that youd just love that wouldnt you vorkosigan hissed the prince stick me back here and grab all the glory for yourself and that wrinkled clown vortala and his phoney progressives over my dead body youre going to sit in here till you grow mold vorkosigans teeth were clenched his eyes narrowed and unreadable his lips curled back on a white smile but closed again instantly i must formally protest by landing with the ground troops on escobar you are leaving your proper post protest away the prince approached him closely leaning into his face and dropping his voice but even my father cant live forever and when that day comes your father wont be able to protect you anymore you and vortala and all his cronies will be first against the wall i promise you he looked up remembering illyan leaning silently against the doorjamb or perhaps youll find yourself back on the leper colony for another five years of patrol duty in the bathroom bothari stirred uncomfortably in his semicoma and to cordelias horror began to snore lieutenant illyan was seized by a spasmodic coughing fit excuse me he gasped and retreated into the bathroom shutting the door firmly he hit the light and traded a silent look of panic with cordelia for an equally silent grimace of despair with difficulty they turned botharis deadweight to one side in the constricted space until he breathed quietly again cordelia gave illyan the thumbsup signal and he nodded and squeezed back out the door the prince had left admiral vorhalas lingered a moment to exchange a last word with his subordinate put it in writing ill sign it before we go at least dont travel in the same ship begged vorkosigan seriously vorhalas sighed i appreciate your trying to get him out of my hair but somebody has to clean his cage for the emperor with vorrutyer out thank god he wont have you so it looks like im elected why cant you just lose your temper with subordinates like normal men instead of with superiors like a lunatic i thought you were cured of that after what i saw you take from vorrutyer thats dead and buried now aye vorhalas made a superstitious sign automatically evidently a gestural relic from childhood empty of belief but full of habit by the bywhats the leper colony asked vorkosigan curiously you never heard that wellmaybe i can see why not did you never wonder why you received such a remarkable percentage of screwups incorrigibles and neardischarges among your crew i hadnt expected to get the cream of the service they used to call it vorkosigans leper colony at headquarters with myself as leperinchief eh vorkosigan seemed more amused than offended well if they were the worst the service has to offer perhaps we shall not do so badly after all take care of yourself i dont fancy being his secondincommand vorhalas chuckled and they shook hands he started for the door then paused do you think theyll counterattack my god of course theyll counterattack this isnt some trade outpost these people are fighting for their homes when vorkosigan hesitated sometime after youve started disembarking ground troops but well before its completed wouldnt you worst time to have to start a retreat shuttles not knowing whether to go up or down their mother ships scattering to hell and gone under fire supplies needed not landed supplies landed not needed the chain of command disruptedan inexperienced commander in absolute control you give me the shivers yes welltry to hold the start for as long as possible and make sure your troopship commanders have their contingency orders crystal clear the prince doesnt see it your way yes hes itching to lead a parade what do you advise im not your commander this time rulf not my fault i recommended you to the emperor i know i wouldnt take it i recommended you instead so we ended up with that sodomizing sonofabitch vorrutyer vorhalas shook his head bleakly something wrong there vorkosigan chivvied him gently out the door blew out his breath with a sigh and remained standing caught up in his vision of the future he looked up and met cordelias eyes with unhappy irony wasnt there some character when the old romans held their triumphs who rode along whispering in the honored partys ear that he was mortal and death waited for him the old romans probably thought he was a pain in the neck too she held her peace vorkosigan and illyan went to retrieve sergeant bothari from his makeshift and uncomfortable hiding place they were halfway through the door with him when vorkosigan swore hes stopped breathing illyan hissed explosively and they laid bothari out quickly on the friction matting on his back vorkosigan laid his ear to his chest and felt his neck for a pulse sonofabitch he doubled his fists and brought them down sharply against the sergeants sternum then listened again nothing he rolled back on his heels looking fierce illyan whoever you got that lizards piss from go find him and get a shot of the antidote quickly and quietly very quietly how did youwhat ifshouldnt youis it worth began illyan he threw up his hands helplessly and fled out the door vorkosigan looked at cordelia do you want to push or blow push i guess she knelt by botharis side and vorkosigan went to his head tilted it back and gave him his first breath of air cordelia pressed the heels of her hands on his sternum and pushed with all her strength setting up the rhythm push push push blow over and over dont stop after a short time her arms were shaking and sweat beaded on her hairline she could feel her own ribs grind with each push screamingly and her chest muscles knotted spasmodically got to switch good im hyperventilating they changed places vorkosigan taking over the heart massage cordelia pinching botharis nostrils shut and closing her mouth over his his mouth was wet from vorkosigans saliva the parody of a kiss was horrible but to shrink from it beneath contempt they went on and on lieutenant illyan returned at last breathless he knelt and pressed the new ampule against botharis corded neck over the carotid artery nothing happened vorkosigan kept pumping suddenly bothari shuddered then stiffened arching his back he took an irregular gasping gulp of air then stopped again come on urged cordelia half to herself with a sharp spasmodic intake he began to breathe again raggedly but persistently cordelia slumped from her knees to a sitting position on the floor and gazed at him in joyless triumph suffering bastard i thought you saw meaning in that sort of thing said vorkosigan in the abstract most days its just stumbling around in the dark with the rest of creation smashing into things and wondering why it hurts vorkosigan gazed at bothari too sweat runneling down his face then he jumped to his feet and hurried to his desk the protest have to get it written and filed before vorhalas leaves or it will be no damned good he slid into his chair and began rapidly keying his console whats so important about it asked cordelia sh later he typed furiously for ten minutes then set it electronically in pursuit of his commander bothari in the meanwhile continued to breathe although his face retained a deathly greenish pallor what do we do now asked cordelia wait pray that the dosage is right he glanced irritably at illyan and that it wont send him into some kind of manic state shouldnt we be thinking of some way to get them both out of here protested illyan think away vorkosigan began plugging the new data disks into his console and viewing the tactical readouts but as a hiding place it has two advantages not shared by any other spot on the ship if youre as good as you claim its not monitored by either the chief political officer or the princes men im quite sure i got them all id stake my reputation on it right now youre staking your life on it so youd better be correct second there are two armed guards in the corridor to keep everybody out you could scarcely ask for more i admit its a bit crowded illyan rolled his eyes in exasperation ive diddled the security search to the limit i dare i cant do any more without drawing more attention than i divert will it hold twentysix more hours maybe illyan frowned at his charge baffled and bothered you have something planned dont you sir it was not a question i his fingers worked the keys of his console and reflections of colored light from the readouts played over his impassive face im merely waiting in hope of some reasonable opportunity when the prince leaves for escobar most of his own security people will go with him patience illyan he keyed his console again vorkosigan to tactics room commander venne here sir oh good venne id like hourly updates piped down here from the time the prince and admiral vorhalas leave and let me know immediately regardless of time if you start getting anything unusual anything not in the plans yes sir the prince and admiral vorhalas are leaving now sir very good carry on vorkosigan out he sat back and drummed his fingers on the desk now we wait it will be about twelve hours before the prince reaches escobar orbit theyll be starting landings soon after that an hour for signals to reach us from escobar an hour for signals to return so much lag a battle can be over in two hours we could cut the lag by threequarters if the prince would let us move off station his casual tone barely masked his tension in spite of his advice to illyan the room in which he sat scarcely seemed to exist for him his mind moved with the armada wheeling in a tightening constellation around escobar fast glittering couriers grim cruisers sluggish troop carriers bellies crammed with men a light pen turned forgotten in his fingers around and over around and over hadnt you better eat sir suggested illyan what oh yes i suppose and you cordeliayou must be hungry go ahead illyan illyan left to forage vorkosigan worked at his desk console for a few more minutes before shutting it down with a sigh i suppose id better think about sleep too last time i slept was on board the general vorhartung closing on escobara day and a half ago i guess about the time you were being captured we were captured a bit before that we were in tow for almost a day yes congratulations by the way on a very successful maneuver that wasnt a real battle cruiser i take it i really cant say somebody wants to claim it as a kill cordelia suppressed a grin fine by me she braced herself for more questioning but strangely he turned the subject poor bothari i wish the emperor might give him a medal im afraid the best ill be able to do for him is get him properly hospitalized if the emperor disliked vorrutyer so why did he put him in charge because he was grishnovs man and widely famous as such and the princes favorite putting all the bad eggs in one basket so to speak he cut himself off with a fistclosing gesture he made me feel like id met the ultimate in evil i dont think anything will really scare me after him ges vorrutyer he was just a little villain an oldfashioned craftsman making crimes oneoff the really unforgivable acts are committed by calm men in beautiful green silk rooms who deal death wholesale by the shipload without lust or anger or desire or any redeeming emotion to excuse them but cold fear of some pretended future but the crimes they hope to prevent in that future are imaginary the ones they commit in the presentthey are real his voice fell as he spoke so that by the end he was almost whispering commodore vorkosiganaralwhats eating you youre so keyed up i expect you to start pacing the ceiling any minute hagridden she thought he laughed a little i feel like it its the waiting i expect im bad at waiting not a good thing in a soldier i envy your ability to wait in patience you seem calm as moonlight on the water is that pretty very it sounds nice we dont have either one at home she was absurdly pleased by the implied compliment illyan returned with a tray and she got no more out of vorkosigan they ate and vorkosigan took a turn at sleeping or at least lying on the bed with his eyes shut but getting up every hour to view the new tacticals lieutenant illyan watched over his shoulder and vorkosigan pointed out salient features of the strategy to him as they came up it looks pretty good to me illyan commented once i dont see why youre so anxious we really could carry it off in spite of the escos superior command of resources in the long run wont do them any good if its all over in the short run afraid to put bothari back into a deep coma they let him return to nearconsciousness he sat in the corner in a miserable knot drifting in and out of sleep with bad dreams in both states eventually illyan took himself off to his own cabin to sleep and cordelia had another nap herself she slept a long time not waking until illyan returned with another tray of food she was becoming disoriented with respect to time locked in this changeless room vorkosigan however was tracking time by the minute now after they ate he vanished into the bathroom to wash and shave and returned in fresh dress greens as neat as though ready for a conference with the emperor he checked through the last tactical update for the second time have they started landing troops yet cordelia asked he checked his chronometer almost an hour ago we should be getting the first reports through any minute he sat now without fidgeting like a man in deep meditation face like stone that hours tactical update arrived and he began sorting through its reports apparently checking key items in the middle of it his screen was overridden by the face of commander venne commodore vorkosigan were getting something very strange here do you want me to shunt a copy of raw incoming straight down there yes please immediately vorkosigan searched through an assortment of chatter of all kinds and picked out a verbal from a ship commander a dark and heavyset man who spoke into his log with a guttural accent tinged by fear here it comes moaned cordelia inwardly attacking with shuttles theyre returning our fire shot by shot plasma shields at maximum nowwe cant put more power into them and still keep firing we must either drop shields and try to increase our firepower or give up the attack the transmission was interrupted by static dont know how theyre doing it they cant possibly have packed enough engine in those shuttles to generate this more static the transmission abruptly broke off vorkosigan selected another illyan leaned over his shoulder anxiously cordelia sat on the bed silent head bowed listening the cup of victory bitter on the tongue heavy in the stomach sad as defeat the flagship is under heavy fire reported another commander cordelia recognized the voice with a start and craned her neck for a view of his face it was gottyan evidently he had his captaincy at last im going to drop shields altogether and attempt to knock one out with a maximum burst dont do it korabik vorkosigan shouted hopelessly the decision whatever it was had been made an hour ago its consequences ineradicably fixed in time gottyan turned his head to one side ready commander vorkalloner we are attempting he began and was drowned by static then silence vorkosigan struck his fist on the desk hard damn how the hell long is it going to take them to figure he stared into the snow then reran the transmission transfixing it with a frightening expression grief and rage and nausea mixed he then selected another band this time a computer graphic of the space around escobar and the ships as little colored lights winking and diving through it it looked tiny and bright and simple like a childs game he shook his head at it lips tight and bloodless vennes face interrupted again he was pale with peculiar lines of tension running down to the corners of his mouth sir i think youd better come to the tactics room i cant venne without breaking arrest wheres commodore helski or commodore couer helski went forward with the prince and admiral vorhalas sir commodore couer is here now youre the ranking flag officer aboard now the prince was quite explicit the princei believe the prince is dead sir vorkosigan closed his eyes and a sigh went out of him joylessly he opened them again and leaned forward is that confirmed do you have any new orders from admiral vorhalas itsadmiral vorhalas was with the prince sir their ship was hit venne turned away to view something over his shoulder then turned back its he had to clear his throat its confirmed the princes flagship has beenobliterated theres nothing left but debris youre in command now sir vorkosigans face was cold and unhappy then transmit contingency blue orders at once all ships cease firing immediately put all power into shields this ship to make course for escobar now at maximum boost weve got to cut down on our transmission time lag contingency blue sir thats full retreat i know commander i wrote it but full retreat commander venne the escobarans have a new weapon system its called a plasma mirror field its a new betan development it turns the attackers burst back on itself our ships are shooting themselves down with their own firepower my god what can we do not a damn thing unless we want to start boarding their ships and strangling the bastards by hand one at a time attractive but impractical transmit those orders and order the commander of engineers and the chief pilot officer to the tactics room and get the guard commander down here to relieve his men i dont care to be stunned on the way out the door yes sir venne broke off got to get those troopships turned around first muttered vorkosigan rising from his swivel chair he turned to find both cordelia and illyan staring at him how did you know began illyan about the plasma mirrors finished cordelia vorkosigan was quite expressionless you told me cordelia in your sleep while illyan was out under the influence of one of the surgeons potions of course youll suffer no ill effects from it she stood upright aghast thatyou miserabletorture would have been more honorable oh smooth sir congratulated illyan i knew you were all right vorkosigan shot him a look of dislike it doesnt matter the information was confirmed too late to do us any good there was a knock on the door come on illyan its time to take my soldiers home chapter ten illyan came back promptly for bothari barely an hour later this was followed for cordelia by twelve hours alone she considered escaping the room as her soldierly duty and engaging in a little onewoman sabotage but if vorkosigan was indeed directing a full retreat it would hardly do to interfere she lay on his bed in a black weariness he had betrayed her he was no better than the rest of them my perfect warrior my dear hypocriteand it appeared vorrutyer had known him better than she after allno that was unjust he had done his duty in extracting that information she had done the same in concealing it for as long as possible and as one soldier to another even if an ersatz onefive hours active service was itshe had to agree with illyan it had been smooth she could detect no aftereffects at all in herself from whatever he had used for the secret invasion of her mind whatever he had used what indeed could he have used where had he cadged it and when illyan hadnt brought it to him he had been as surprised as she when vorkosigan dropped that bit of intelligence one must either believe he kept a secret stash of interrogation drugs hidden in his quarters or dear god she whispered not a curse but a prayer what have i stumbled into now she paced the room the connections clicking unstoppably into place heartcertainty vorkosigan had never questioned her he had known about the plasma mirrors in advance it appeared further that he was the only man in the barrayaran command who knew vorhalas had not the prince certainly had not nor illyan put all the bad eggs in one basket she muttered anddrop the basket oh it couldnt have been his own plan surely not she had a sudden horrific vision of it all complete the most wasteful political assassination plot in barrayaran history and the most subtle the corpses hidden in a mountain of corpses forever inextricable but he must have had the information from somewhere somewhere between the time she had left him with no worse troubles than an engine room full of mutineers and now struggling to pull a disarmed armada back to safety before the destruction they had unleashed crashed back on them somewhere in a quiet green silk room where a great choreographer designed a dance of death and the honor of a man of honor was broken on the wheel of his service vorrutyer of the demonic vanity shrank and shrank before the swelling vision to a mouse to a flea to a pinprick my god i thought aral seemed twitchy he must be halfmad and the emperorthe prince was his son can this be real or have i gone as crazy as bothari she forced herself to sit then lie down but the plots and counterplots still turned in her brain an gallery of betrayal within betrayal lining up abruptly at one point in space and time to accomplish its end the blood beat in her brain thick and sick maybe its not true she consoled herself at last ill ask him and thats what hell say he just questioned me in my sleep we got the drop on them and im the heroine who saved escobar hes just a simple soldier doing his job she turned on her side and stared into the dimness pigs have wings and i can fly home on one illyan relieved her at last and took her to the brig the atmosphere there was somewhat changed she noticed the guards did not look at her in the same way in fact they seemed to try to avoid looking at her the procedures were still stark and efficient but subdued very subdued she recognized a face the guard who had escorted her to vorrutyers quarters the one whod pitied her seemed to be in charge now a pair of new red lieutenants tabs pinned hastily and crookedly to his collar she had donned vorrutyers fatigues again for the trip down this time she was permitted to change in to the orange pajamas in physical privacy she was then escorted to a permanent cell not a holding area the cell had another occupant a young escobaran woman of extraordinary beauty who lay on her bunk staring at the wall she did not look up at cordelias entrance nor respond to her greeting after a time a barrayaran medical team arrived and took her away she went wordlessly but at the door she started to struggle with them at a sign from the doctor a corpsman sedated her with an ampule which cordelia thought she recognized and after another moment she was carried out unconscious the doctor who from his age and rank cordelia guessed might be the chief surgeon stayed a short time to attend to her ribs after that she was left alone with nothing but the periodic delivery of rations to mark the time and occasional changes in the slight noises and vibrations from the walls around her on which to base guesses about what was happening outside about eight ration packs later as she was lying on her bunk bored and depressed the lights dimmed they came back but dimmed again almost immediately awk she muttered as the bottom dropped out of her stomach and she began to float upward she made a hasty grab and held on to her bunk firmly her foresight was rewarded a moment later when she was crushed back into it at about three gees the lights flickered on and off again and she was weightless once more plasma attack she murmured to herself shields must be overloaded a tremendous shock rattled the ship she was flung from her bunk across the cell into total blackness weightlessness silence direct hit she ricocheted off the far wall flailing for a handhold banging an elbow painfully ona wall the floor the ceiling she spun in midair crying out friendly fire she thought hystericallyim going to be killed by friendly fire the perfect end to my military career she clamped her jaw and listened with fierce concentration too much silence had they lost air she had a nasty vision of herself as the only one left alive trapped in this black box and doomed to float until either slow suffocation or slow freezing squeezed out her life the cell would be her coffin to be unsealed months later by some salvage crew and more horribly could the hit have been on the bridge the nerve center where vorkosigan would surely be on which the escobarans would surely concentrate their firewas he smashed by flying debris flash frozen in vacuum burned up in plasma fire pinned somewhere between crushed decks her fingers found a surface at last and scrabbled for a hold a corner good she braced herself in it curled up on the floor breath firing in and out of her lungs in uneven gasps an unknowable time passed in the stygian dark her arms and legs trembled with the effort of bracing herself in place then the ship groaned about her and the lights came back on oh hell she thought this is the ceiling the gravity returned and smashed her to the floor pain flashed up her left arm and numbness she scrambled back to the bunk taking a whiteknuckle grip on its rigid bars with her right hand sticking one foot through as well bracing herself again nothing she waited there was a wetness soaking her orange shirt she looked down to see a shard of pinkishyellow bone poking through the skin of her left forearm and blood welling around it she slipped awkwardly out of her smock top wrapping it around one arm and trying to stanch the flow the pressure woke the pain she tried rather experimentally calling out for help surely the cell was monitored no one came over the next three hours she varied the experiment with screaming speaking reasonably banging on the door and walls endlessly with her good hand or simply sitting on the bunk crying in pain the gravity and lights flipflopped several more times finally she had the familiar sensation of being pulled insideout through a pot of glue marking a wormhole jump and the environment steadied when the door of the cell opened at last it startled her so she recoiled into the wall banging her head but it was the lieutenant in charge of the brig with a medical corpsman the lieutenant had an interesting reddishpurple bruise the size of an egg on his forehead the corpsman looked harried this is the next worst one said the lieutenant to the corpsman after that you can just go down the row in order whitefaced and exhausted into silence she unwrapped her arm for examination and repair the corpsman was competent but lacked the delicacy of touch of the chief surgeon she nearly fainted before the plastic cast was at last applied there were no more signs of attack a clean prisoners uniform was delivered through a wall slot two ration packs later she felt another wormhole jump her thought revolved endlessly on the wheel of her fears her sleep was all dreams and her dreams were all nightmares it was lieutenant illyan who came to escort her at last along with an ordinary guard she nearly kissed him in her joy at seeing a familiar face instead she cleared her throat diffidently and asked with what she hoped would pass for nonchalance was commodore vorkosigan all right after that attack his eyebrows rose and he shot her a look of bemused study from beneath them of course of course of course that of course even suggested uninjured her eyes puddled with relief which she attempted to mask with an expression of cool professional interest where are you taking me she asked him as they left the brig and started down the corridor shuttle youre to be transferred to the pow camp planetside until the exchange arrangements are made and they begin shipping you all home home what about the war its over over she assimilated that over that was quick why arent the escobarans pursuing their advantage they cant weve blocked the wormhole exit blocked not blockaded he nodded how the devil do you block a wormhole in a way its a very old idea fireships huh send a ship in set up a major matterantimatter explosion at a midpoint between nodes it sets up a resonancenothing else can get through for weeks until it dies down cordelia whistled cleverwhy didnt we think of that how do you get the pilot out maybe thats why you didnt think of it we dont godwhat a death her vision of it was clear and instant they were volunteers she shook her head numbly only a barrayaran she probed for some less horrifying subject did you take many prisoners not very maybe a thousand in all we left over eleven thousand ground troops behind on escobar it makes you rather valuable if we have to try to trade you more than ten for one the prisoners shuttle was a windowless craft and she shared it with only two others one of her own engineers assistants and the darkhaired escobaran girl who had been in her cell her tech was eager to exchange stories although he didnt have much to trade he had spent the whole time locked in one cell with his other three shipmates who had been taken downside yesterday the beautiful escobaran a young ensign who had been captured when her ship was disabled in the fighting for the wormhole jump to beta colony over two months ago had even less to tell i must have lost track of time somewhere she said uneasily not hard to do in that cell seeing no one except that i woke up in their sickbay yesterday and couldnt remember how id come there and if that surgeons as good as he looked you never will thought cordelia do you remember admiral vorrutyer who never mind the shuttle landed at last and the hatch was opened a shaft of sunlight and a breath of summerscented air fell through it sweet green air that made them suddenly realize they had been breathing reek for days wow where is this place said the technician awed as he stepped through the hatch prodded by the guards its beautiful cordelia followed him and laughed out loud although not happily in instant recognition the prison camp was a triple row of barrayaran field shelters ugly grey halfcylinders surrounded by a force screen set at the bottom of a kilometerswide amphitheater of dry woodland and waterfall beneath a turquoise sky it was a hazy warm quiet afternoon that made cordelia feel she had never left yes there was even the entrance to the underground depot not camouflaged anymore but widened with a great paved area for landing and loading gouged out before it alive with shuttles and activity the waterfall and pool were gone she turned about as they walked gazing at her planet now that she thought about it it seemed inevitable that they should end up here quite logical really she shook her head helplessly she and her young escobaran companion were signed in by a neat and expressionless guard and directed to a shelter halfway down one row they entered to find it occupied by eleven women in a space meant for fifty they had their choice of bunks they were pounced upon by the older prisoners frantic for news a plump woman of about forty restored order and introduced herself im lieutenant marsha alfredi im ranking officer in this shelter insofar as there is order in this cess pit do you know what the hell is going on im captain cordelia naismith betan expeditionary thank god i can dump it on you oh my cordelia braced herself fill me in its been hell the guards are pigs then all of a sudden yesterday afternoon this bunch of highranking barrayaran officers came trooping through at first we thought they were shopping for rapees like the last bunch but this morning about half the guards had disappearedthe worst of the lotand been replaced by a crew that look like theyre on parade and the barrayaran camp commandanti couldnt believe it they paraded him out on the shuttle tarmac this morning and shot him in full view of everyone i see said cordelia rather tonelessly she cleared her throat uhhave you heard yet the barrayarans have been run completely out of escobaran local space theyre probably sending around the long way for a formal truce and some sort of negotiated settlement by now there was a stunned silence then jubilation some laughed some cried some hugged each other and some sat alone some broke away to spread the news to neighboring shelters and from there up and down the whole camp cordelia was pressed for details she gave a brief precis of the fighting leaving out her own exploits and the source of her information their joy made her a little happier for the first time in days well that explains why the barrayarans have straightened up all of a sudden said lieutenant alfredi i guess they didnt expect to be held accountable before theyve got a new commander explained cordelia hes got a thing about prisoners win or lose thered have been changes with him in charge alfredi didnt look convinced oh who is he a commodore vorkosigan cordelia said neutrally vorkosigan the butcher of komarr my god were in for it now alfredi looked genuinely afraid i should think you had an adequate pledge of good faith on the shuttle pad this morning i should think it just proves hes a lunatic said alfredi the commandant didnt even participate in those abuses he wasnt the worst by a long shot he was the man in charge if he knew about them he should have stopped them if he didnt know he was incompetent either way he was responsible cordelia hearing herself defending a barrayaran execution stopped abruptly i dont know she shook her head im not vorkosigans keeper the noise of nearriot penetrated from outside and their shelter was invaded by a deputation of fellow prisoners all eager to hear the rumors of peace confirmed the guards withdrew to the perimeter and let the excitement play itself out she had to repeat her precis twice her own crew members led by parnell came over from the mens side parnell jumped up on a bunk to address the orangeclad crowd shouting over the glad babble this lady isnt telling you everything i had the real story from one of the barrayaran guards after we were taken aboard the flagship she escaped and personally assassinated the barrayaran commander admiral vorrutyer thats why their advance collapsed lets hear it for captain naismith thats not the real story she objected but was drowned out by shouts and cheers i didnt kill vorrutyer here put me down her crew ringled by parnell hoisted her to their shoulders for an impromptu parade around the camp its not true stop this awk it was like trying to turn back the tide with a teacup the story had too much innate appeal to the battered prisoners too much wishfulfillment come to life they took it in like balm for their wounded spirits and made it their own vicarious revenge the story was passed around elaborated built up seachanged until within twentyfour hours it was as rich and unkillable as legend after a few days she gave up trying the truth was too complicated and ambiguous to appeal to them and she herself suppressing everything in it that had to do with vorkosigan was unable to make it sound convincing her duty seemed drained of meaning dull and discolored she longed for home and her sensible mother and brother and quiet and one thought that would connect to another without making a chain of secret horror chapter eleven camp returned to routine soon or what routine should always have been there followed weeks of waiting for the slow negotiations for prisoner exchange to be completed with everyone honing elaborate plans for what they would do when they got home cordelia gradually came to a nearly normal relationship with her shelter mates although they still tried to give her special privileges and services she heard nothing from vorkosigan she was lying on her bunk one afternoon pretending to sleep when lieutenant alfredi roused her theres a barrayaran officer out here who says he wants to talk to you alfredi trailed her to the door suspicion and hostility in her face i dont think we should let them take you away by yourself were so close to going home theyve surely got it in for you oh its all right marsha vorkosigan stood outside the shelter in the dress greens worn daily by the staff accompanied as usual by illyan he seemed tense deferential weary and closed captain naismith he said formally may i speak with you yes butnot here she was acutely conscious of the eyes of her fellows upon her can we take a walk or something he nodded and they started off in shared silence he clasped his hands behind his back she shoved hers into the pockets of her orange smock top illyan trailed them doglike impossible to shake they left the prison compound and headed into the woods im glad you came said cordelia there are some things ive been meaning to ask you yes i wanted to see you sooner but winding this thing up properly has been keeping me rather busy she nodded toward his yellow collar tabs congratulations on your promotion oh that he touched one briefly its meaningless just a formality to expedite the work im doing now which is what dismantling the armada guarding the local space around this planet shuffling politicians back and forth between barrayar and escobar general housecleaning now the partys over supervising prisoner exchange they were following a wide beaten path through the greygreen woods up the slope out of the craters bowl i wanted to apologize for questioning you under drugs i know it offended you deeply need drove me it was a military necessity you have nothing to apologize for she glanced back at illyan i must know quite literally nothing i eventually realized he was silent i see he said at last you are very acute on the contrary i am very baffled he swung to face illyan lieutenant i crave a boon from you i wish a few minutes alone with this lady to discuss a very personal matter i shouldnt sir you know that i once asked her to marry me she never gave me her answer if i give you my word that we will discuss nothing but what touches on that may we have a few moments privacy oh illyan frowned your word sir my word as vorkosigan welli guess its all right then illyan seated himself glumly on a fallen log to wait and they walked on up the path they came out at the top on a familiar promontory overlooking the crater the very spot where vorkosigan had planned the repossession of his ship so long ago they seated themselves on the ground watching the activity of the camp made silent by distance time was you would never have done that cordelia observed pledged your word falsely times change nor lied to me that is so nor shot a man out of hand for crimes he didnt participate in it wasnt out of hand he had a summary courtmartial first and it did get things straightened around in a hurry anyway it will satisfy the interstellar judiciarys commission ill have them on my hands too come tomorrow investigating prisoner abuses i think youre getting bloodglutted individual lives are losing their meaning for you yes there have been so many its nearly time to quit expression was deadened in his face and words how did the emperor buy you for thatextraordinary assassination you of all men was it your idea or his he did not evade or deny his idea and negris i am but his agent his fingers pulled gently on the grass stems breaking them off delicately one by one he didnt come out with it directly first he asked me to take command of the escobar invasion he started with a bribethe viceroyalty of this planet in fact when its colonized i turned him down then he tried a threat said hed throw me to grishnov let him have me up for treason and no imperial pardon i told him to go to hell not in so many words that was a bad moment between us then he apologized called me lord vorkosigan he called me captain when he wished to be offensive then he called in captain negri with a file that didnt even have a name and the playacting stopped reason logic argument evidence we sat in that green silk room in the imperial residence at vorbarr sultana one whole mortal week the emperor and negri and i going over it while illyan kicked his heels in the hall studying the emperors art collection you are correct in your deduction about illyan by the way he knows nothing about the real purpose of the invasion you saw the prince briefly i may add that you saw him at his best vorrutyer may have been his teacher once but the prince surpassed him some time ago but if only he had had some saving notion of political service i think his father would have forgiven him even his vilest personal vices he was not balanced and he surrounded himself with men whose interests lay in making him even less balanced a true nephew of his uncle yuri grishnov meant to rule barrayar through him when he came to the throne on his owngrishnov would have been willing to wait i thinkthe prince had engineered two assassination attempts on his father in the last eighteen months cordelia whistled soundlessly i almost begin to see but why not just put him out of the way quietly surely the emperor and your captain negri could have managed it between them if anyone could the idea was discussed god help me i even volunteered to lend myself to it as an alternative to thisbloodbath he paused the emperor is dying he has run out of time to wait for the problem to solve itself its become an obsession with him to try to leave his house in order the problem is the princes son hes only four sixteen years is a long time for a regency government with the prince dead grishnov and the whole ministerial party would just slide right into the power vacuum if they were left intact it was not enough to kill the prince the emperor felt he had to destroy the whole war party so effectively that it would not rise again for another generation so first there was me bitching about the strategic problems with escobar then the information about the plasma mirrors came through negris own intelligence network military intelligence didnt have it then me again with the news that surprise had been lost do you know he suppressed part of that too it could only be a disaster and then there was grishnov and the war party and the prince all crying for glory he had only to step aside and let them rush to their doom grass was being pulled up in bunches now it all fit so well there was a hypnotizing fascination to it but chancy there was even a possibility leaving events to themselves that everyone might be killed but the prince i was placed where i was to see the script was followed goading the prince making sure he got to the front lines at the right time hence that little scene you witnessed in my cabin i never lost my temper i was just putting another nail in the coffin i suppose i can see why the other agent wasthe chief surgeon quite lovely isnt it though he lay back on the grass looking through the turquoise sky i couldnt even be an honest assassin do you recall me saying i wanted to go into politics i believe im cured of that ambition what about vorrutyer were you supposed to get him killed too no in the original script he was cast as the scapegoat it would have been his part after the disaster to apologize to the emperor for the mess in the full old japanese sense of the phrase as part of the general collapse of the war party for all he was the princes spiritual advisor i did not envy him his future all the while he was riding me i could see the ground crumbling away beneath his feet it baffled him he always used to be able to make me lose my temper it was great sport for him when we were younger he couldnt understand why hed lost his touch his eyes remained focused somewhere in the high blue emptiness not meeting hers for what its worth to you his death just then saved a great many lives he would have tried to continue the fight much longer to save his political skin that was the price that bought me in the end i thought if only i were in the right place at the right time i could do a better job of running the pullout than anyone else on the general staff so we are all of us just ezar vorbarras tools said cordelia slowly bellysick me and my convoy you the escobaranseven old vorrutyer so much for patriotic hoopla and righteous wrath all a charade thats right it makes me feel very cold was the prince really that bad there was no doubt of it i shall not sicken you with the details of negris reports but the emperor said if it wasnt done now we would all be trying to do it ourselves five or ten years down the road and probably botching the job and getting all our friends killed in a fullscale planetwide civil war hes seen two in his lifetime that was the nightmare that haunted him a caligula or a yuri vorbarra can rule a long time while the best men hesitate to do what is necessary to stop him and the worst ones take advantage the emperor spares himself nothing reads the reports over and overhe had them all nearly wordperfect this wasnt something undertaken lightly or casually wrongly perhaps but not lightly he didnt want him to die in shame you see it was the last gift he could give him she sat numbly hugging her knees memorizing his profile as the soft airs of the afternoon rustled in the woods and stirred the golden grasses he turned his face toward her was i wrong cordelia to give myself to this thing if i had not gone he would simply have had another ive always tried to walk the path of honor but what do you do when all choices are evil shameful action shameful inaction every path leading to a thicket of death youre asking me to judge you someone must im sorry i can love you i can grieve for you or with you i can share your pain but i cannot judge you ah he turned on his stomach and stared down at the camp i talk too much to you if my brain would ever grant me release from reality i believe i would be the babbling sort of madman you dont talk to anyone else like that do you she asked alarmed good god no you areyou arei dont know what you are but i need it will you marry me she sighed and laid her head upon her knees twisting a grass stem around her fingers i love you you know that i hope but i cant take barrayar barrayar eats its children it isnt all these damnable politics some people get through their whole lives practically unconscious of them yes but youre not one of them he sat up i dont know if i could get a visa for beta colony not this year i suspect nor next all barrayarans are considered war criminals there at the moment politically speaking we havent had this much excitement in years theyre all a little drunk on it just now and then there is komarr i see i should have trouble getting a job as a judo instructor then and i could hardly write my memoirs all things considered right now i should think youd have trouble avoiding lynch mobs she looked up at his bleak face a mistake it wrenched her heart ivegot to go home for a while anyway see my family and think things through in peace and quiet maybe we can come up with some alternate solution we can write anyway yes i suppose he stood and helped her up where will you be after this she asked you have your rank back well im going to finish up all this dirty work a wave of his arm indicated the prison camp and by implication the whole escobaran adventure and then i believe i too shall go home and get drunk i cannot serve him anymore hes used me up on this the death of his son and the five thousand men who escorted him to hell will always hang between us now vorhalas gottyan dont forget the escobarans and a few betans too i shall remember them he walked beside her down the path is there anything you need in camp ive tried to see that everything was provided generally within the limits of our supplies but i may have missed something camp seems to be all right now i dont need anything special all we really need is to go home nocome to think of it i do want a favor name it he said eagerly lieutenant rosemonts grave it was never marked i may never get back here while its still possible to find the remains of our camp could you have your people mark it i have all his numbers and dates i handled his personnel forms often enough i still have them memorized ill see to it personally wait he paused and she held out a hand to him his thick fingers engulfed her tapering ones his skin was warm and dry and scorched her before we go pick up poor lieutenant illyan again he took her in his arms and they kissed for the first time for a long time oh she muttered after perhaps that was a mistake it hurts so much when you stop well let me his hand stroked her hair gently then desperately wrapped itself in a shimmering coil they kissed again uh sir lieutenant illyan coming up the path cleared his throat noisily had you forgotten the staff conference vorkosigan put her from him with a sigh no lieutenant i havent forgotten may i congratulate you sir he smiled no lieutenant he unsmiled idont understand sir thats quite all right lieutenant they walked on cordelia with her hands in her pockets vorkosigan with his clasped behind his back most of the escobaran women had already gone up by shuttle to the ship that had arrived to transport them home late next afternoon when a spruce barrayaran guard appeared at the door of their shelter requesting captain naismith admirals compliments maam and he wishes to know if youd care to check the data on the marker he had made for your officer its in his office yes certainly cordelia for gods sake hissed lieutenant alfredi dont go in there alone its all right she murmured back impatiently vorkosigans all right oh so what did he want yesterday i told you to arrange for the marker that didnt take two solid hours do you realize thats how long you were gone i saw how he looked at you and youyou came back looking like death warmed over cordelia irritably waved away her concerned protests and followed the extremely polite guard to the cache caverns the planetside administrative offices of the barrayaran force were set up in one of the side chambers they had a carefully busy air that suggested the nearby presence of staff officers and indeed when they entered vorkosigans office his name and rank emblazoned over the smudge that had been his predecessors they found him within illyan a captain and a commodore were grouped around a computer interface with him evidently undergoing some kind of briefing he broke off to greet her with a careful nod which she acknowledged in kind i wonder if my eyes look as hungry as his she thought this minuet of manners we go through to conceal our private selves from the mob will be for nothing if we dont hide our eyes better its on the clerks desk corcaptain naismith he directed her with a wave of his hand go ahead and look it over he returned his attention to his waiting officers it was a simple steel tablet standard barrayaran military issue and the spelling numbers and dates were all in order she fingered it briefly it certainly looked like it ought to last vorkosigan finished his business and came to her side is it all right fine she gave him a smile could you find the grave yes your camps still visible from the air at low altitude although another rainy season will obliterate it the duty guards voice floated in over a commotion at the door so you say for all i know they could be bombs you cant take that in there followed by another voice replying he has to sign it personally those are my orders you guys act like you won the damn war the second speaker a man in the dark red uniform of an escobaran medical technician backed through the door followed by a floatpallet on a control lead looking like some bizarre balloon it was loaded with large canisters each about half a meter high studded with control modules and access apertures cordelia recognized them at once and stiffened feeling sick vorkosigan looked blank the technician stared around i have a receipt for these that requires admiral vorkosigans personal signature is he here vorkosigan stepped forward im vorkosigan what are these um medtech cordelia whispered in cue medtech vorkosigan finished smoothly although the exasperated glance he gave her suggested that was not the cue hed wanted the medtech smiled sourly were returning these to the senders vorkosigan walked around the pallet yes but what are they all your bastards said the medtech cordelia catching the genuine puzzlement in vorkosigans voice added theyre uterine replicators um admiral selfcontained independently poweredthey need servicing though every week agreed the medtech viciously cordial he held up a data disk they sent you instructions with them vorkosigan looked appalled what the hell am i supposed to do with them thought you were going to make our women answer that question did you replied the medtech taut and sarcastic personally id suggest you hang them around their fathers necks the paternal gene complements are marked on each one so you should have no trouble telling who they belong to sign here vorkosigan took the receipt panel and read it through twice he walked around the pallet again counting looking deeply troubled he came up beside cordelia in his circuit and murmured i didnt realize they could do things like that they use them all the time at home they must be fantastically complex and expensive too im surprisedmaybe they just didnt want to argue about taking them home with any of the mothers a couple of them were pretty emotionally divided about abortions this puts the blood guilt on you her words seemed to enter him like bullets and she wished shed phrased herself differently theyre all alive in there sure see all the green lights placentas and all they float right in their amniotic sacs just like home moving i suppose so he rubbed his face staring hauntedly at the canisters seventeen god cordelia what do i do with them surgeon of course but he turned to the fascinated clerk get the chief surgeon down here on the double he turned back to cordelia keeping his voice down how long will those things keep working the whole nine months if necessary may i have my receipt admiral said the medtech loudly i have other duties waiting he stared curiously at cordelia in her orange pajamas vorkosigan scribbled his name absently on the bottom of the receipt panel with a light pen thumbprinted it and handed it back still slightly hypnotized by the pallet load of canisters cordelia morbidly curious walked around them too inspecting the readouts the youngest one seems to be about seven weeks old the oldest is over four months must have been right after the war started but what do i do with them he muttered again she had never seen him more at a loss what do you usually do with soldiers byblows surely the situation has come up before not on this scale maybe we usually abort bastards in this case it seems to have already been done in a sense so much troubledo they expect us to keep them alive floating fetusesbabies in cans i dont know cordelia sighed thoughtfully what a thoroughly rejected little group of humanity they are exceptbut for the grace of god and sergeant bothari one of those canned kids might have been mine and vorrutyers or mine and botharis for that matter he looked quite ill at the thought he lowered his voice almost to a whisper and began again but what do iwhat would you have me do with them youre asking me for orders ive nevercordelia pleasewhat honorable it must be quite a shock to suddenly find out youre pregnant seventeen times overat your age too she thought she squelched the black humorhe was so clearly out of his depthand took pity on his real confusion take care of them i suppose i have no idea what that will entail butyou did sign for them he sighed quite pledged my word in a sense he set the problem up in familiar terms and found his balance therein my word as vorkosigan in fact right good objective defined plan of attack proposedwere in business the surgeon entered and was taken aback at the sight of the float pallet what the helloh i know what they are i never thought id see one he ran his fingers over one canister in a sort of technical lust are they ours all ours it seems replied vorkosigan the escobarans sent them down the surgeon chuckled what an obscene gesture one can see why i suppose but why not just flush them some unmilitary notion about the value of human life perhaps said cordelia hotly some cultures have it the surgeon raised an eyebrow but was quelled as much by the total lack of amusement on his commanders face as by her words there are the instructions vorkosigan handed him the disk oh good can i empty one out and take it apart no you may not said vorkosigan coldly i pledged my wordas vorkosiganthat they would be cared for all of them how the devil did they maneuver you into that oh well ill get one later maybe he returned to his examination of the glittering machinery have you the facilities here to handle any problems that may arise asked vorkosigan hell no imp mil would be the only place and they dont even have an obstetrics department but i bet research would love to get hold of these babies it took cordelia a dizzy moment to realize he was referring to the uterine replicators and not their contents they have to be serviced in a week can you do it here i dont think the surgeon set the disk into the monitor at the clerks station and began flashing through it there must be ten written kilometers of instructionsah no we dont haveno too bad admiral im afraid youll have to eat your word this time vorkosigan grinned wolfishly and without humor do you recall what happened to the last man who called me on my word the surgeons smile faded into uncertainty these are your orders then vorkosigan went on clipped in thirty minutes you personally will lift off with thesethings for the fast courier and it will arrive in vorbarr sultana in less than a week you will go to the imperial military hospital and requisition by whatever means necessary the men and equipment needed tocomplete the project get an imperial order if you have to directly not through channels im sure our friend negri will put you in touch see them set up serviced and report back to me we cant possibly make it in under a week not even in the courier youll make it in five days boosting six points past emergency max the whole way if the engineers been doing his job the engines wont blow until you hit eight quite safe he glanced over his shoulder couer scramble the courier crew please and get their captain on the line i want to give him his orders personally commodore couers eyebrows rose but he moved to obey the surgeon lowered his voice glancing at cordelia is this betan sentimentality at work sir a little odd in the emperors service dont you think vorkosigan smiled narroweyed and matched his tone betan insubordination doctor you will oblige me by directing your energies to carrying out your orders instead of evolving excuses why you cant hell of a lot easier just to open the stopcocks and what are you going to do with them once theyrecompleted born whatever you call it whos going to take responsibility for them then i can sympathize with your wish to impress your girlfriend but think ahead sir vorkosigans eyebrows snapped together and he growled down in his throat the surgeon recoiled vorkosigan buried the growl in a throatclearing noise and took a breath that will be my problem my word your responsibility will end there twentyfive minutes doctor if youre on time i may let you ride up on the inside of the shuttle he grinned a small white grin eloquently aggressive you can have three days home leave after theyre in place at impmil if you wish the surgeon shrugged wry defeat and vanished to collect his things cordelia looked after him doubtfully will he be all right oh yes it just takes him a while to turn his thinking around by the time they get to vorbarr sultana hell be acting like he invented the project and theuterine replicators vorkosigans gaze returned to the float pallet those are the damnedest things a guard entered pardon me sir but the escobaran shuttle pilot is asking for captain naismith theyre ready to lift couer spoke from the communications monitor sir i have the courier captain on line cordelia gave vorkosigan a look of helpless frustration acknowledged by a small shake of his head and each turned wordlessly to the demands of duty she left meditating on the doctors parting shot and we thought we were being so careful we really must do something about our eyes chapter twelve she traveled home with about others mostly escobarans on a tau cetan passenger liner hastily converted for the purpose there was a lot of time spent exchanging stories and sharing memories among the exprisoners sessions subtly guided she realized shortly by the heavy sprinkling of psych officers the escobarans had sent with the ship after a while her silence about her own experiences began to stand out and she learned to spot the casuallooking roundup techniques for the onlyapparentlyimpromptu group therapy and make herself scarce it wasnt enough she found herself quietly but implacably pursued by a brightfaced young woman named irene whom she deduced must be assigned to her case she popped up at meals in the corridors in the lounges always with a novel excuse for starting a conversation cordelia avoided her when she could and turned the conversation deftly or sometimes bluntly to other topics when she couldnt after another week the girl disappeared back into the mob but cordelia returned to her cabin one day to discover her roommate gone and replaced by another a steadyeyed easygoing older woman in civilian dress who was not one of the exprisoners cordelia lay on her bed glumly and watched her unpacking hi im joan sprague the woman introduced herself sunnily time to get explicit good afternoon dr sprague i am correct i think in identifying you as irenes boss sprague paused youre quite right but i prefer to keep things on a casual basis no you dont you prefer to keep things looking like theyre on a casual basis i appreciate the difference you are a very interesting person captain naismith yes well theres more of you than there are of me suppose i agree to talk to you will you call off the rest of your dogs im here for you to talk tobut when you are ready so ask me what you want to know lets get this over with so we can both relax i could use a little therapy at that cordelia thought wistfully i feel so lousy sprague seated herself on the bed a mild smile on her face and the utmost attention in her eyes i want to try and help you remember what happened during the time you were a prisoner aboard the barrayaran flagship getting it into your consciousness however horrible it was is your first step to healing um i think we may be at crosspurposes i remember everything that happened during that time with the utmost clarity i have no trouble getting it into my consciousness what i would like is to get it out at least long enough to sleep now and then i see go on why dont you describe what happened cordelia gave an account of events from the time of the wormhole jump from beta colony until after the murder of vorrutyer but ended it before vorkosigans entrance saying vaguely i moved around to different hiding places on the ship for a couple of days but they caught me in the end and put me back in the brig so you dont remember being tortured or raped by admiral vorrutyer and you dont remember killing him i wasnt and i didnt i thought i made that clear the doctor shook her head sorrowfully its reported you were taken away from camp twice by the barrayarans do you remember what happened during those times yes of course can you describe it she balked no the secret of the princes assassination would be nothing to the escobaransthey could hardly dislike the barrayarans any more than they did alreadybut the mere rumor of the truth could be devastating to civil order on barrayar riots military mutiny the downfall of vorkosigans emperorthose were just the beginnings of the possible consequences if there was a civil war on barrayar could vorkosigan be killed in it god please thought cordelia wearily no more death sprague looked tremendously interested cordelia felt pounced on she amended herself there was an officer of mine who was killed during the betan survey of that planetyou know about that i hope the doctor nodded they made arrangements to put a marker on his grave at my request thats all i understand sprague sighed we had another case like yours the girl had also been raped by vorrutyer or some of his men and had it covered up by the barrayaran medical people i suppose they were trying to protect his reputation oh i believe i met her aboard the flagship she was in my shelter too right spragues surprised look confirmed it although she made a little vague gesture indicating professional confidence youre right about her cordelia went on im glad shes getting what she needs but youre wrong about me youre wrong about vorrutyers reputation too the whole reason they put out this stupid story about me was because they thought it would look worse for him to be killed by a weak woman than by one of his own combat soldiers the physical evidence from your medical examination alone is enough to make me question that said sprague what physical evidence asked cordelia momentarily bewildered the evidence of torture the doctor replied looking grim even a little angry not angry at her cordelia realized what i was never tortured yes an excellent coverup outrageousbut they couldnt hide the physical traces are you aware that you had a broken arm two broken ribs numerous contusions on your neck head hands armsyour whole body in fact and your biochemistryevidence of extreme stress sensory deprivation considerable weight loss sleep disorders adrenal excessshall i go on oh said cordelia that oh that echoed the doctor raising an eyebrow i can explain that said cordelia eagerly she laughed a little in a way i suppose i can blame it on you escobarans i was in a cell on the flagship during the retreat it took a hitshook everything around like gravel in a can including me thats where i got the broken bones and so on the doctor made a note very good very good indeed subtle but not subtle enoughyour bones were broken on two different occasions oh said cordelia and how am i going to explain bothari without mentioning vorkosigans cabin a friend tried to strangle me i would like you to think said dr sprague carefully about the possibility of drug therapy the barrayarans have done an excellent coverup on you even better than the other and it took very deep probing indeed for her i think its going to be even more necessary in your case but we must have your voluntary cooperation thank god for that cordelia lay back on her bed and pulled her pillow over her face thinking of drug therapy it made her blood run cold she wondered how long she could take deep probing for memories that werent there before she started manufacturing them to meet the demand and worse the very first effect of probing must be to bring up those secret agonies that were uppermost on her mindvorkosigans secret wounds she sighed removed the pillow from her head and hugged it to her chest and looked up to find sprague regarding her with deep concern you still here ill always be here cordelia thatswhat i was afraid of sprague got no more from her after that she was afraid to sleep now for fear of talking or even being questioned in her sleep she took little catnaps waking with a start whenever there was movement in the cabin such as her roommate getting up to go to the bathroom in the night cordelia did not admire ezar vorbarras secret purposes in the late war but at least they had been accomplished the thought of all that pain and death being made vain as smoke haunted her and she resolved that all vorkosigans soldiers yes even vorrutyer and the camp commandant would not be made to have died for nothing through her she ended the trip far more frayed than she had begun it floating on the edge of real breakdown plagued by pounding headaches insomnia a mysterious lefthand tremula and the beginnings of a stutter the trip from escobar to beta colony was much easier it only took four days in a betan fast courier sent she was surprised to find especially for her she viewed the news reports on her cabin holovid she was deathly tired of the war but she caught by chance a mention of vorkosigans name and could not resist following it up to find out what the public view of his part was horrified she discovered that his work with the judiciarys investigative commission led the betan and escobaran press to blame him for the way the prisoners had been treated as if he had been in charge of them from the beginning the old false komarr story was dragged out on parade and his name was reviled everywhere the injustice of it all made her furious and she gave up the news in disgust at last they orbited beta colony and she haunted nav and com for a glimpse of home theres the old sandbox at last the captain cheerfully keyed her a view theyre sending a shuttle up for you but theres a storm over the capital and its a bit delayed till it subsides enough for them to drop screens at the port i may as well wait till i get down to call my mom cordelia commented shes probably at work now no point bothering her there hospitals not far from the shuttleport i can get a nice relaxing drink while i wait for her to get off shift and pick me up the captain gave her a peculiar look uh yeah the shuttle arrived eventually cordelia shook hands all around thanking the courier crew for the ride and went aboard the shuttle stewardess greeted her with a pile of new clothes whats all this by heavens the expeditionary force uniforms at last better late than never i guess why dont you go ahead and put them on urged the stewardess smiling extraordinarily why not she had been wearing the same borrowed escobaran uniform for quite some time now and was thoroughly tired of it she took the sky blue cloth and the shiny black boots amused why jackboots in gods name theres scarcely a horse on beta colony except in the zoos i admit they do look wicked finding she was the sole passenger on the shuttle she changed on the spot the stewardess had to help her with the boots whoever designed these should be forced to wear them to bed cordelia muttered or perhaps he does the shuttle descended and she went to the window eager for the first look at her hometown the ochre haze parted at last and they spiraled neatly down to the shuttleport and taxied to the docking bay seems to be a lot of people out there today yes the presidents going to make a speech said the stewardess its very exciting even if i didnt vote for him steady freddy got that many people to show up for one of his speeches just as well i can blend with the crowd this thing is a bit bright i think id rather be invisible today she could feel the letdown beginning and wondered how far down it would end the escobaran doctor had been right in her principles if not in her facts there was an emotional debt yet to be paid knotted somewhere under her stomach the shuttles engines whined to silence and she rose to thank the grinning stewardess uneasy theres not going to be a rreception committee out there for me is there i really dont think i could handle it today youll have some help the stewardess assured her here he comes now a man in a civilian sarong entered the shuttle smiling broadly how do you do captain naismith he introduced himself im philip gould the presidents press secretary cordelia was shocked press secretary was a cabinetlevel post its an honor to meet you she was tumbling fast youre not pplanning some kind of of ddog and pony show out there are you i rreally just want to go home well the president is planning a speech and he has a little something for you he said soothingly in fact he was hoping he might make several speeches with you but we can discuss that later now we hardly expect the heroine of escobar to suffer from stage fright but we have prepared some remarks for you ill be with you all the time and help you with the cues and the press he passed her a hand viewer do try and look surprised when you first step out of the shuttle i am surprised she scanned the script rapidly ththis is a ppack of lies he looked worried have you always had that little speech impediment he asked cautiously nno its my souvenir from the escobaran psych service and the llate war who came up with this ggarbage anyway the line that particularly caught her eye referred to the cowardly admiral vorkosigan and his pack of ruffians vorkosigans the bravest man i ever met gould took her firmly by the upper arm and guided her to the shuttle hatch we have to go now to make the holovid timing maybe you can just leave that line out all right now smile i want to see my mother shes with the president here we go they exited the tube from the shuttle hatch into a milling mob of men women and equipment they all began shouting questions at once cordelia began to shake all over in waves that began in the pit of her stomach and radiated outward i dont know any of these people she hissed to gould keep walking he hissed back through a fixed smile they mounted a reviewing stand set up on the balcony overlooking the shuttleport concourse the concourse was packed solidly with a colorful crowd in a holiday mood they blurred before cordelias eyes she saw a familiar face at last her mother smiling and crying and she fell into her arms to the delight of the press who recorded it copiously get me out of this as fast as you can she whispered fiercely into her mothers ear im about to lose it her mother held her at arms length not understanding still smiling her place was taken by cordelias brother his family clustered nervously and proudly behind him looking at her she felt with eyes that devoured her she spotted her crew also dressed in the new uniforms standing with some government officials parnell gave her a thumbsup grinning dementedly she was bundled over to stand behind a rostrum with the president of beta colony steady freddy seemed larger than life to her confused eyes big and booming perhaps that was why he projected over the holovid so well he grasped her hand and held it up in his to the cheers of the crowd it made her feel like an idiot the president gave a fine performance with his speech not even using the prompter it was full of the jingoistic patriotism that had so intoxicated the place when shed left and not one word in a dozen touched the real truth even from the betan point of view he worked up gradually and with perfect showmanship to the medal cordelias heart began to pound lumpishly as she caught the drift of it she tried desperately to evade the knowledge turning to the press secretary is this on behalf of mmy crew for the plasma mirrors they have theirs already was he ever going to stop smiling this is your very own i ssee the medal it appeared was to be awarded for her brave onewoman assassination of admiral vorrutyer steady freddy actually avoided the word assassination along with blunt terms like murder and killing favoring more liquid phrases like freeing the universe of a viper of iniquity the speech lumbered to its close and the glittering medal on its colorful ribbon beta colonys highest honor was lowered over her head by the presidents own hand gould positioned her in front of the rostrum and pointed out the glowing green words of the prompter marching across thin air before her eyes start reading he whispered am i on oh uh people of beta colony my beloved home that was all right so far when i left you to meet the mmenace of barrayaran tyranny ssuccoring our friend and ally escobar it was with no idea that fate was to bring me facetoface with a nnobler ddestiny it was here she departed from the script watching herself go helplessly like a doomed sea ship sinking beneath the waves i dont see whats so nnoble about bbutchering that sadistic ass vorrutyer and i wouldnt take a medal for mmurdering an unarmed mman even if i had done it she pulled it off over her head the ribbon caught in her hair and she yanked it free painfully angrily for the last time i did not kill vorrutyer one of his own men killed vorrutyer he ccaught him from behind and cut his throat from ear to ear i was there damn it he bled all over me the press from both sides are stuffing you with lies about that sstupid war ddamn voyeurs vorkosigan was not in charge of the prison camp when the atrocities took place as ssoon as he was in charge he stopped them shshshot one of his own officers just to feed your llust for vengeance and it cost him in his honor too i can tell you the sound going out from the rostrum was cut off suddenly she turned to steady freddy tears of fury blurring her view of his astonished face and flung the medal back at him with all the force of her arm it missed his head and glittered down over the balcony into the crowd her arms were pinned from behind it triggered some buried reflex and she kicked out frantically if only the president hadnt tried to dodge he would have been all right as it was the toe of her jackboot caught him in the groin with perfect unplanned accuracy his mouth made a soundless o and he went down behind the rostrum cordelia hyperventilating uncontrollably began to cry as a dozen more hands grabbed her arms waist legs pplease dont lock me up again i couldnt take it i just wanted to go home get that goddamn ampule away from me no no no drugs please please im sorry she was hustled out and the media event of the year collapsed just like steady freddy she was taken to a quiet room one of the shuttleports administrative offices immediately afterwards the presidents personal physician arrived after a time and took charge had everyone removed but himself and her mother and gave her some breathing space to regain her selfcontrol it took her almost an hour to stop crying once she had started the embarrassment and outrage stopped seesawing at last and she was able to sit up and talk in a voice like a bad cold please apologize to the president for me if only someone had warned me or asked me about it first im nnot in very good shape right now we should have realized it ourselves said the physician sorrowfully your ordeal after all was much more personal than the usual soldiers experience it is we who must apologize for subjecting you to an unnecessary strain we thought it would be a nice surprise added her mother it was a surprise all right i only hope i dont get myself locked in a padded cell im a bit off cells at the moment the thought tightened her throat and she breathed carefully to calm back down she wondered where vorkosigan was now what he was doing getting drunk sounded better all the time and she wished she were with him doing so she pressed thumb and forefinger to the bridge of her nose rubbing out the tension may i be permitted to go home now is there still a crowd out there asked her mother im afraid so well try to keep them back with the doctor on one side and her mother on the other she dwelt in vorkosigans kiss all during the long walk to her mothers groundcar the crowd still pressed upon her but in a hushed respectful almost frightened way a great contrast to their earlier holiday mood she felt sorry to have taken away their party there was a crowd at her mothers apartment shaft too in the foyer by the lift tubes and even in the hallway to her door cordelia smiled and waved a little cautiously but just shook her head at questions not trusting herself to speak coherently they made their way through and closed the door at last whew i suppose they meant well but my lordi felt like they wanted to eat me alive there was so much excitement about the war and the expeditionary forceanyone in a blue uniform is getting star treatment and when the prisoners got home and your story came outim glad i knew you were safe by then my poor darling cordelia got another hug and welcomed it well that explains where they got the nonsense it was the wildest rumor the barrayarans started it and everyone just ate it up i couldnt stop it what did they do to you they kept following me around pestering me with these offers of therapythey thought the barrayarans had been messing with my memory oh i see you mean what did the barrayarans do to me nothing much vvorrutyer might have liked to but he met with his accident before hed got half started she decided not to disturb her mother with the details something important did happen though she hesitated i ran into aral vorkosigan again that horrible man i wondered when i heard the name in the news if it was the same fellow who killed your lieutenant rosemont last year no yes i mean he didnt kill rosemont one of his people did but hes the same one i dont understand why youre so sympathetic to him you ought to appreciate him now he saved my life hid me in his cabin during those missing two days after vorrutyer was killed id have been executed for it if theyd caught me before the change in command her mother looked more disturbed than appreciative did hedo anything to you the question was filled with unanswerable irony cordelia dared not tell even her mother about the intolerable burden of truth he had laid on her her mother misunderstood the haunted look on her face oh dear im so sorry huh no damn it vorkosigans no rapist hes got this thing about prisoners wouldnt touch one with a stick he asked me she trailed off looking into the kind concerned and loving wall of her mothers face we talked a lot hes all right he doesnt have a very good reputation yeah ive seen some of it its all lies hesnot a murderer then well cordelia foundered on the truth he has kkilled a lot of people i suppose hes a soldier you know its his job it cant help spilling over a bit i only know about three that werent in the line of duty though only three repeated her mother faintly there was a pause hes not a a sex criminal then certainly not although i gather he went through a rather strange phase after his wife committed suicidei dont think he realizes how much i know about it not that that maniac vorrutyer should be trusted as a source of information even if he was there i suspect its partly true at least about their relationship vorrutyer was clearly obsessed with him and aral went awfully vague when i asked him about it looking at her mothers appalled face cordelia thought its a good thing i never wanted to be a defense lawyer all my clients would be in therapy forever it all makes a lot more sense if you meet him in person she offered hopefully cordelias mother laughed uncertainly he surely seems to have charmed you what does he have then conversation good looks im not sure he mostly talks barrayaran politics he claims to have an aversion to them but it sounds more like an obsession to me he cant leave them alone for five minutes its like theyre in him is thata very interesting subject its awful said cordelia frankly his bedtime stories can keep you awake for weeks it cant be his looks sighed her mother ive seen a holovid of him in the news oh did you save it asked cordelia instantly interested where is it im sure theres something in the vid files her mother allowed staring but really cordeliayour reg rosemont was ten times better looking i suppose he was cordelia agreed by any objective standard so what does the man have anyway i dont know the virtues of his vices perhaps courage strength energy he could run me into the ground any day he has power over people not leadership exactly although theres that too they either worship him or hate his guts the strangest man i ever met did both at the same time but nobody falls asleep when hes around and which category do you fall in cordelia asked her mother bemused well i dont hate him cant say as i worship him either she paused a long time and looked up to meet her mothers eyes squarely but when hes cut i bleed oh said her mother whitely her mouth smiled her eyes flinched and she busied herself with unnecessary vigor in getting cordelias meager belongings settled on the fourth afternoon of her leave cordelias commanding officer brought a disturbing visitor captain naismith this is dr mehta from the expeditionary force medical service commodore tailor introduced them dr mehta was a slim tanskinned woman about cordelias age with dark hair drawn back cool and antiseptic in her blue uniform not another psychiatrist cordelia sighed her muscles knotted up the back of her neck more interrogationsmore twisting more evasions evershakier webs of lies to cover the gaps in her story where vorkosigans bitter truths dwelt commodore spragues reports finally caught up with your file a little late it seems tailors lips thinned sympathetically ghastly im sorry if wed had them earlier we might have been able to spare you last week and everybody else cordelia flushed i didnt mean to kick him he kind of ran into me it wont happen again commodore tailor suppressed a smile well i didnt vote for him steady freddy is not my main concern although he cleared his throat he has taken a personal interest in your case youre a public figure now like it or not oh nonsense its not nonsense you have an obligation who are you quoting bill thought cordelia thats not your voice she rubbed the back of her neck i thought id discharged all my obligations what more do they want from me tailor shrugged it was thoughti was given to understandthat you could have a future as a spokesman forfor the government due to your war experience once youre well cordelia snorted theyve got some awfully strange illusions about my soldierly career lookas far as im concerned steady freddy can put on falsies and go woo the hermaphrodite vote in quartz but im nnot going to play the part of a a propaganda cow to be milked by any party ive an aversion to politics to quote a friend well he shrugged as though he too had discharged a duty and went on more firmly be that as it may getting you fit for work again is my concern imill be all right after mmy months leave i just need a rest i want to go back to survey and so you can just as soon as youre medically cleared oh the implications of that took a moment to sink in oh nowait a minute i had a little pproblem with dr sprague very nice lady her reasoning was sound but her premises were wrong commodore tailor gazed at her sadly i think id better turn you over to dr mehta now shell explain everything you will cooperate with her wont you cordelia cordelia pursed her lips chilled let me get this straight what youre saying is if i cant make your shrink happy ill never set foot on a survey ship again no ccommandno job in fact thatsa very harsh way of putting it but you know yourself for survey with small groups of people isolated together for extended periods of time the psych profiles are of the utmost importance yes i know she twitched her mouth into a smile ill ccooperate ssure chapter thirteen now said dr mehta cheerfully setting up her box on a table in the naismiths apartment next afternoon this is a completely noninvasive method of monitoring you wont feel a thing it wont do a thing to you except give me clues as to which subjects are of subconscious importance to you she paused to swallow a capsule remarking allergy excuse me think of it as an emotional dowsing rod looking for those buried streams of experience telling you where to drill the well eh exactly do you mind if i smoke go ahead mehta lit an aromatic cigarette and set it casually in an ashtray she had brought with her the smoke drifted toward cordelia she squinted at its acridity odd perversion for a doctor well we all have our weaknesses she eyed the box suppressing irritation now for a baseline said mehta july am i supposed to say august or something no its not a freeassociation testthe machine will do the work but you may if you wish thats all right twelve apostles thought cordelia eggs days of christmas death birth thought cordelia those upperclass barrayarans put everything into their children name property culture even their governments continuity a huge burden no wonder the children bend and twist under the strain birth death thought cordelia a man without a son is a walking ghost there with no part in their future and when their government fails they pay the price in their childrens lives five thousand mehta moved her ashtray a little to the left it didnt help made it worse in fact sex not likely with me here and him there seventeen canisters thought cordelia wonder how those poor desperate little scraps of life are doing dr mehta frowned uncertainly at her readouts seventeen she repeated eighteen cordelia thought firmly dr mehta made a note admiral vorrutyer poor butchered toad you know i think you spoke the truthyou must have loved aral once to have hated him so what did he do to you i wonder rejected you most likely i could understand that pain we have some common ground after all perhaps mehta adjusted another dial frowned again turned it back admiral vorkosigan ah love let us be true to one another cordelia focused wearily on mehtas blue uniform shell get a geyser if she drills her well thereprobably knows it already shes making another note mehta glanced at her chronometer and leaned forward with increased attention lets talk about admiral vorkosigan lets not thought cordelia what about him does he work much in their intelligence section do you know i dont think so his main line seems to be staff tactician whenwhen he isnt on patrol duty the butcher of komarr thats a damned lie said cordelia automatically then wished she hadnt spoken who told you that asked mehta he did he did ah ill get you for that ahno cooperation calm i do feel calm wish that woman would either finish smoking that thing or put it out stings my eyes what proof did he offer you none cordelia realized his word i guess his honor rather intangible she made another note and you believed him yes why itseemed consistent with what i saw of his character you were his prisoner for six days were you not on that survey mission thats right mehta tapped her light pen and said hm absently looking through her you seem quite convinced of this vorkosigans veracity you dont think he ever lied to you then wellyes but after all i was an enemy officer yet you seem to accept his statements unquestioningly cordelia tried to explain a mans word is something more to a barrayaran than a vague promise at least for the oldfashioned types heavens its even the basis for their government oaths of fealty and all that mehta whistled soundlessly you approve of their form of government now do you cordelia stirred uncomfortably not exactly im just starting to understand it a little is all it could be made to work i suppose so this word of honor businessyou believe he never breaks it well he does then i have seen him do so but the cost was huge he breaks it for a price then not for a price at a cost i fail to see the distinction a price is something you get a cost is something you lose he lostmuch at escobar the talk was drifting onto dangerous ground got to change the subject cordelia thought drowsily or take a nap mehta glanced at the time again and studied cordelias face intently escobar said mehta aral lost his honor at escobar you know he said he was going to go home and get drunk afterwards escobar broke his heart i think aral you call him by his first name he calls me dear captain i always thought that was funny very revealing in a way he really does think of me as a lady soldier vorrutyer was right againi think i am the solution to a difficulty for him im glad the room was getting warm she yawned the wisps of smoke wound tendrillike about her soldier he loves his soldiers you know he really does hes stuffed with this peculiar barrayaran patriotism all honor to the emperor the emperor hardly seems worthy of it emperor poor sod tormented as bothari may be as mad bothari who is bothari he talks to demons the demons talk back youd like bothari aral does i do good guy to have with you on your next trip to hell he speaks the language mehta frowned twiddled her dials again and tapped her readout screen with a long fingernail she backtracked emperor cordelia could hardly keep her eyes open mehta lit another cigarette and set it beside the stub of the first prince said cordelia mustnt talk about the prince prince repeated mehta mustnt talk about the prince that mountain of corpses cordelia squinted in the smoke the smokethe odd acrid smoke from cigarettes once lit never again lifted to the mouth youredruggingme her voice broke in a strangled howl and she staggered to her feet the air was like glue mehta leaned forward lips parted in concentration she then jumped from her chair and back in surprise as cordelia lurched toward her cordelia swept the recorder from the table and fell upon it as it smashed to the floor beating on it with her good hand her right hand never talk no more death you cant make me blew ityou cant get away with it im sorry watchdog remembers every word im sorry shot him please talk to me please let me out please let me out pleaseletmeout mehta was trying to lift her from the floor speaking soothingly cordelia caught pieces in the outwash of her own babble not supposed to do thatidiosyncratic reactionmost unusual please captain naismith come lie down something glittered at mehtas fingertips an ampule no screamed cordelia rolling on her back and kicking at her she connected the ampule arced away to roll under a low table no drugs no drugs no no no mehta was pale olive all right all right but come lie downthats it like that she darted away to turn up the airconditioning full blast and stub out the second cigarette the air cleared quickly cordelia lay on the couch regaining her breath and trembling so closeshe had come so close to betraying himand this was only the first session gradually she began to feel cooler and clearer she sat up her face buried in her hands that was a dirty trick she observed in a flat voice mehta smiled thin as plastic over an underlying excitement well it was a little but its been an enormously productive session far more than i ever expected ill bet thought cordelia enjoyed my performance did you mehta was kneeling on the floor picking up pieces of the recorder sorry about your machine cant imagine what came over me did idestroy your results yes you should have just fallen asleep strange and no rather triumphantly she pulled a data cartridge from the wreck and set it carefully on the table you wont have to go through that again its all right here very good what do you make of it asked cordelia dryly through her fingers mehta regarded her with professional fascination you are without doubt the most challenging case ive ever handled but this should relieve your mind of any lingering doubts about whether the barrayarans have ah violently rearranged your thinking your readouts practically went off the scales she nodded firmly you know said cordelia im not too crazy about your methods i have aparticular aversion to being drugged against my will i thought that sort of thing was illegal but necessary sometimes the data are much purer if the subject is not aware of the observation its considered sufficiently ethical if permission is obtained post facto post facto permission eh cordelia purred fear and fury wound a double helix up her spine coiling tighter and tighter with an effort she kept her smile straight not letting it turn into a snarl thats a legal concept id never thought of it soundsalmost barrayaran i dont want you on my case she added abruptly mehta made a note and looked up smiling thats not a statement of emotion cordelia emphasized thats a legal demand i refuse any further treatment from you mehta nodded understandingly was the woman deaf enormous progress said mehta happily i wouldnt have expected to uncover the aversion defense for another week yet what you didnt expect the barrayarans would put that much work into you and not plant defenses around it did you of course you feel hostile just remember those are not your own feelings tomorrow we will work on them oh no we wont the muscles up her scalp were tense as wire her head ached fiercely youre fired mehta looked eager oh excellent did you hear me demanded cordelia where did that shrieky whine in my voice come from calm calm captain naismith i remind you that we are not civilians i am not in the ordinary legal physicianpatient relationship with you we are both under military discipline pursuing i have reason to believe a militarynever mind suffice it to say you did not hire me and you cant fire me tomorrow then cordelia remained seated for hours after she left staring at the wall and swinging her leg in absent thumps against the side of the couch until her mother came home with supper the next day she left the apartment early in the morning on a random tour of the city and didnt return until late at night that night in her weariness and loneliness she sat down to write her first letter to vorkosigan she threw away her original attempt halfway through when she realized his mail was probably read by other eyes perhaps illyans her second was more neutrally worded she made it handwritten on paper and being alone kissed it before she sealed it then smiled wryly at herself for doing so a paper letter was far more expensive to ship to barrayar than an electronic one but he would handle it as she had it was as close to a touch as they could come the next morning mehta called early on the comconsole to tell cordelia cheerily she could relax something had come up and their session that afternoon was canceled she did not refer to cordelias absence the previous afternoon cordelia was relieved at first until she began thinking about it just to be sure she absented herself from home again the day might have been pleasant but for a dustup with some journalists lurking around the apartment shaft and the discovery about midafternoon that she was being followed by two men in very inconspicuous civilian sarongs sarongs were last years fashion this year it was exotic and whimsical body paint at least for the brave cordelia wearing her old tan survey fatigues lost them by trailing them through a pornographic feelieshow but they turned up again later in the afternoon as she puttered through the silica zoo at mehtas appointed hour the next afternoon the door chimed cordelia slouched reluctantly to answer it how am i going to handle her today she wondered im running low on inspiration so tired her stomach sank now what framed in the doorway were mehta commodore tailor and a husky medtech that one cordelia thought staring up at him looks like he could handle bothari backing up a bit she led them into her mothers living room her mother retreated to the kitchen ostensibly to prepare coffee commodore tailor seated himself and cleared his throat nervously cordelia i have something to say that will be a little painful im afraid cordelia perched on the arm of a chair and swung her leg back and forth baring her teeth in what she hoped was a bland smile ssticking you with the dirty work eh one of the joys of command go ahead were going to have to ask you to agree to hospitalization for further therapy dear god here we go the muscles of her belly trembled beneath her shirt it was a loose shirt maybe they wouldnt notice oh why she inquired casually were afraidwere very much afraid that the barrayaran mind programming you underwent was a lot more extensive than anyone realized we think in fact he paused taking a deep breath that theyve tried to make you an agent is that an editorial or an imperial we bill tried or succeeded tailors gaze wavered mehta fixed him with a cold stare our opinion is divided on that note class how sedulously he avoids the i of personal responsibilityit suggests the worst we of all the guilty wewhat the hell are they planning but that letter you sent day before yesterday to the barrayaran admiral vorkosiganwe thought you should have a chance to explain it first i ssee you dared not an official lletter how could it be you know vorkosigans retired now but perhaps her eye nailed tailor you would care to explain by what right you are intercepting and reading my private mail emergency security for the war wars over he looked uncomfortable at that but the espionage goes on probably true she had often wondered how ezar vorbarra came by the knowledge of the plasma mirrors until the war the most closely guarded new weapon in the betan arsenal her foot was tapping nervously she stilled it my letter my heart on paperpaper wraps stone she kept her voice cool and what did you learn from my letter bill well thats a problem weve had our best cryptographers our most advanced computer programs working on it for the better part of two days analyzed it right down to the molecular structure of the paper frankly he glanced rather irritably at mehta im not convinced they found anything no cordelia thought you wouldnt the secret was in the kiss not subject to molecular analysis she sighed glumly did you send it on after you were done wellim afraid there wasnt anything left by then scissors cut paper im no agent i ggive you my word mehta looked up alertly i find it hard to believe myself tailor said cordelia tried to hold his eyes he looked away you do believe it she thought what happens if i refuse to have myself committed then as your commanding officer i must order you to do so ill see you in hell firstno calm must stay calm keep them taking maybe i can talk my way out of this yet even if its against your private judgment this is a serious security matter im afraid it doesnt admit private judgments oh come on even captain negri has been known to make a private judgment they say shed said something wrong the temperature in the room seemed to drop suddenly how do you know about captain negri said tailor frozenly everybody knows about negri they were staring at her oh ccome on if i were an agent of negris youd never know it hes not so inept on the contrary said mehta in a clipped tone we think hes so good that youd never know it garbage said cordelia disgusted how do you figure that mehta answered literally my hypothesis is that you are being controlledunconsciously perhapsby this rather sinister and enigmatic admiral vorkosigan that your programming began during your first captivity and was completed probably during the late war you were destined to be the linchpin of a new barrayaran intelligence network here to replace the one that was just rooted out a mole perhaps put in place and not activated for years until some critical moment sinister cordelia interrupted enigmatic aral i could laugh i could weep he is obviously your control said mehta complacently you have apparently been programmed to obey him unquestioningly i am not a computer thump thump went her foot and aral is the one person who has never constrained me a point of honor i believe you see said mehta to tailor she didnt look at cordelia all the evidence points one way only if youre sstanding on your head cried cordelia furious she glared at tailor thats not an order i have to take i can resign my commission we need not have your permission said mehta calmly even as a civilian if your next of kin will agree to it my motherd never do that to me weve already discussed it with her at length shes very concerned for you i ssee cordelia subsided abruptly glancing toward the kitchen i wondered why that coffee was taking so long guilty conscience eh she hummed a snatch of tune under her breath then stopped you people have really done your homework covered all the exits tailor summoned up a smile and offered it to her placatingly you dont have anything to be afraid of cordelia youll have our very best people working for with on thought cordelia you and when youre done youll be able to return to your old life as if none of this had ever happened erase me will you erase him analyze me to death like my poor timid love letter she smiled back at him ruefully sorry bill i just have this awful vision of being ppeeled like an onion looking for the seeds he grinned onions dont have seeds cordelia i stand corrected she said dryly and frankly he went on if you are right and uh we are wrongthe fastest way you can prove it is to come along he smiled the smile of reason yes true but for that little matter of a civil war on barrayarthat tiny stumbling blockthat stonepaper wraps stone sorry cordelia he really was its all right remarkable ploy of the barrayarans mehta expounded thoughtfully concealing an espionage ring under the cover of a love affair i might even have bought it if the principals had been more likely yes cordelia agreed cordially writhing within one doesnt expect a thirtyfouryearold to fall in love like an adolescent quite an unexpectedgift at my age even more unexpected at fortyfour i gather exactly said mehta pleased by cordelias ready understanding a middleaged career officer is hardly the stuff of romance tailor behind her opened his mouth as if to speak then shut it again he stared meditatively at his hands think you can cure me of it asked cordelia oh yes ah sergeant bothari where are you now too late you leave me no choice curious delay whispered her mind look for an opportunity if you cant find one make one pretend this is barrayar where anything is possible is it all right if i gget a showerchange clothes pack i assume this is going to be a lengthy business of course tailor and mehta exchanged a relieved look cordelia smiled pleasantly dr mehta without the medtech accompanied her to her bedroom opportunity thought cordelia dizzily ah good she said closing the door behind the doctor we can chat while i pack sergeant botharithere is a time for words and there is a time when even the very best words fail you were a man of very few words but you didnt fail i wish id understood you better too late mehta seated herself on the bed watching her specimen perhaps as it wriggled on its pin her triumph of logical deduction are you planning to write a paper on me mehta wondered cordelia dourly paper wraps stone she puttered around the room opening drawers slamming cabinets there was a belttwo beltsand a chain belt there were her identity cards bank cards money she pretended not to see them as she moved she talked her brain seethed stone smashes scissors you know you remind me a bit of the late admiral vorrutyer you both want to take me apart see what makes me tick vorrutyer was more like a little kid though had no intention of picking up his mess afterwards you on the other hand will take me apart and not even get a giggle out of it of course you fully intend to put the pieces back together afterwards but from my point of view that scarcely makes any difference aral was right about people in green silk rooms mehta looked puzzled youve stopped stuttering she noted yes cordelia paused before her aquarium considering it curiously so i have how strange stone smashes scissors she removed the top the old familiar nausea of funk and fear wrung her stomach she wandered aimlessly behind mehta the chain belt and a shirt in her hands i must choose now i must choose now i choosenow she lunged wrapping the belt around the doctors throat yanking her arms up behind her back securing them painfully with the other end of the belt mehta emitted a strangled squeak cordelia held her from behind and whispered in her ear in a moment ill give you your air back how long depends on you youre about to get a short course in the real barrayaran interrogation techniques i never used to approve of them but lately ive come to see they have their useswhen youre in a tearing hurry for instance cant let her guess im playacting playacting how many men does tailor have planted around this building and what are their positions she loosened the chain slightly mehta eyes stunned with fear choked none all cretans are liars cordelia muttered bills not inept either she dragged the doctor over to the aquarium and pushed her face into the water she struggled wildly but cordelia larger stronger in better training held her under with a furious strength that astonished herself mehta showed signs of passing out cordelia pulled her up and allowed her a couple of breaths care to revise your estimate yet god help me what if this doesnt work theyll never believe im not an agent now oh please mehta gasped all right back you go she held her down again the water roiled splashing over the sides of the aquarium cordelia could see mehtas face through the glass strangely magnified deathly yellow in the odd reflected light from the gravel silver bubbles broke around her mouth and flowed up over her face cordelia was temporarily fascinated by them air flows like water underwater she thought is there an aesthetic of death now how many where no really have another drink at her next breath mehta gasped you wouldnt kill me diagnosis doctor hissed cordelia am i a sane woman pretending to be mad or a madwoman pretending to be sane grow gills her voice rose uncontrollably she shoved mehta back under and found she was holding her own breath and what if shes right and im wrong what if i am an agent and dont know it how do you tell a copy from the original stone smashes scissors she had a vision trembling to her fingers of holding the womans head under and under until her resistance drained away until unconsciousness took her and a full count beyond that to assure brain death power opportunity willshe lacked nothing so this is what aral felt at komarr she thought now i understandno now i know how many where four mehta croaked cordelia melted with relief two outside the foyer two in the garage thank you said cordelia automatically courteous but her throat was tightened to a slit and squeezed her words to a smear of sound im sorry she could not tell if mehta livid heard or understood paper wraps stone she bound and gagged her as she had once seen vorkosigan do gottyan she shoved her down behind the bed out of sight from the door she stuffed bank cards ids money into her pockets she turned on the shower she tiptoed out the bedroom door breathing raggedly through her mouth she ached for a minute just one minute to collect her shattered balance but tailor and the medtech were goneto the kitchen for coffee probably she dared not risk the opening even to pause for boots no god tailor was standing in the archway to the kitchen just raising a cup of coffee to his lips she froze he went still and they stared at each other her eyes cordelia realized must be huge as some nocturnal animals she never could control her eyes tailors mouth twisted oddly watching her then slowly he raised his left hand and saluted her the incorrect hand but the other was holding the coffee he took a sip of his drink gaze steady over the rim of his cup cordelia came gravely to attention returned the salute and slipped quietly out the apartment door to her temporary terror she found a journalist and his vidman in the hallway one of the most persistent and obnoxious the one shed had thrown out of the building yesterday she smiled at him dizzy with exhilaration like a sky diver just stepping into air still want to do that interview he jumped at the bait slow down now not here im being watched you know she dropped her voice conspiratorially the governments doing a coverup what i know could blow the administration skyhigh things about the prisoners you couldmake your reputation where then he was avid how about the shuttleport their bars quiet ill buy you a drink and we canplan our campaign time ticked in her brain she expected her mothers apartment door to slam open any second its dangerous though there are two government agents up in the foyer and two in the garage id have to get past them without being seen if it were known i was talking to you you might not get a chance at a second interview no rough stuffjust a little quiet disappearance in the night and the ripple of a rumor about gone for medical tests know what i mean she was fairly sure he didnthis media service dealt mainly in sex fantasiesbut she could see a vision of journalistic glory growing in his face he turned to his vidman jon give her your jacket your hat and your holovid she tucked her hair up in the broadbrimmed hat concealed her fatigues under the jacket and carried the vid ostentatiously they took the lift tube up to the garage there were two men in blue uniforms waiting by its exit she placed the vid casually on her shoulder her arm halfconcealing her face as they walked past them to the journalists groundcar at the shuttleport bar she ordered drinks and took a large gulp of her own ill be right back she promised and left him sitting there with the unpaidfor liquor in front of him the next stop was the ticket computer she punched up the schedule no passenger ships leaving for escobar for at least six hours far too long the shuttleport would surely be one of the first places searched a woman in shuttleport uniform walked past cordelia collared her pardon me could you help me find out something about private freighter schedules or any other private ships leaving soon the woman frowned then smiled in sudden recognition youre captain naismith her heart lurched and pounded drunkenly nosteady on yes um the press have been giving me a rather hard time im sure you understand cordelia gave the woman a look that raised her to an inner circle i want to do this quietly maybe we could go to an office i know youre not like them you have a respect for privacy i can see it in your face you can the woman was flattered and excited and led cordelia away in her office she had access to the full traffic control schedules and cordelia keyed through them rapidly hm this looks good starts for escobar within the hour has the pilot gone up yet do you know that freighter isnt certified for passengers thats all right i just want to talk to the pilot personally and privately can you catch him for me ill try she succeeded hell meet you in docking bay but youll have to hurry thanks um you know the journalists have been making my life miserable theyll stop at nothing theres even a pair whove gone so far as to put on expeditionary force uniforms to try and get in call themselves captain mehta and commodore tailor a real pain if any of them come sniffing around do you suppose you could sort of forget you saw me why sure captain naismith call me cordelia youre firstrate thanks the pilot was a very young one getting his first experience on freighters before taking on the larger responsibilities of passenger ships he too recognized her and promptly asked for her autograph i suppose youre wondering why you were chosen she began as she wrote it out for him without the faintest idea of where she was going but only with the thought that he looked the sort of person who had never won a contest in his life me maam believe me the security people went over your life from end to end youre trustworthy thats what you are really trustworthy ohthey cant have found out about the cordolite alarm struggled with response to flattery resourceful too cordelia extemporized wondering what cordolite was shed never heard of it just the man for this mission what mission sh not so loud im on a secret mission for the president personally its so delicate even the department of war doesnt know about it thered be heavy political repercussions if it ever got out i have to deliver a secret ultimatum to the emperor of barrayar but no one must know ive left beta colony am i supposed to take you there he asked amazed my freight run i believe i could talk this kid into running me all the way to barrayar on his employers fuel she thought but it would be the end of his career conscience controlled soaring ambition no no your freight run must appear to be exactly the same as usual im to meet a secret contact on escobar youll simply be carrying one article of freight that isnt on the manifest me im not cleared for passengers maam good heavens dont you think we know that why do you suppose you were picked over all the other candidates by the president himself wow and i didnt even vote for him he took her aboard the freighter shuttle and made her a seat among the lastminute cargo you know all the big names in survey dont you maam lightner parnell do you suppose you could ever introduce me i dont know butyou will get to meet a lot of the big names from the expeditionary force and security when you get back from escobar i promise will you ever may i ask you a personal question maam why not everyone else does why are you wearing slippers she stared down at her feet imsorry pilot officer mayhew thats classified oh he went forward to lift ship alone at last she leaned her forehead against the cool smooth plastic side of a packing case and wept silently for herself chapter fourteen it was about noon local time when the lightflyer she had rented in vorbarr sultana brought her over the long lake the shore was bordered by vinegarlanded slopes backed in turn by steep scrubcovered hills the population here was thinly scattered except around the lake which had a village at its foot a cliffed headland at the waters edge was crowned by the ruins of an old fortification she circled it rechecking her map on which it was a principle landmark counting northward from it past three large properties she brought her flyer down on a driveway that wound up the slope to a fourth a rambling old house built of native stone blended with the vegetation into the side of the hill she retracted the wings killed the engine pocketed the keys and sat staring uncertainly at its sunwarmed front a tall figure in a strange brown and silver uniform ambled around the corner he bore a weapon in a holster on his hip and his hand rested on it caressingly she knew then that vorkosigan must be nearby for it was sergeant bothari he looked to be in good health at least physically she hopped out of the lightflyer uh good afternoon sergeant is admiral vorkosigan at home he stared at her narroweyed then his face seemed to clear and he saluted her captain naismith maam yes youre looking a lot better than when we last met maam on the flagship at escobar he looked troubled icant remember escobar admiral vorkosigan says i was there i see took away your memory did they or did you do it yourself no telling now im sorry to hear that you served bravely did i i was discharged after oh whats the uniform count vorkosigans livery maam he took me into his personal guard imsure youll serve him well may i see admiral vorkosigan hes around back maam you can go up he wandered away evidently making some kind of patrol circuit she trudged around the house the sun warm on her back lacking at the unaccustomed skirts of her dress and making them swirl about her knees she had bought it yesterday in vorbarr sultana partly for fun mostly because her old tan survey fatigues with the insignia taken off collected stares in the streets its dark floral pattern pleased her eye her hair hung loose parted in the middle and held back from her face by two enameled combs also purchased yesterday a little farther up the hill was a garden surrounded by a low grey stone wall no not a garden she realized as she approached a graveyard an old man in old coveralls was working in it kneeling in the dirt planting young flowers from a flat he squinted up at her as she pushed through the little gate she did not mistake his identity he was a little taller than his son and his musculature had gone thin and stringy with age but she saw vorkosigan in the bones of his face general count vorkosigan sir she saluted him automatically then realized how peculiar it must look in the dress he rose stiffly to his feet my name is capmy name is cordelia naismith im a friend of arals i dont know if he mentioned me to you is he here how do you do madam he came more or less to attention and gave her a courteous halfnod that was achingly familiar he said very little and it did not lead me to think i might meet you a smile creaked across his face as if those muscles were stiff from long disuse you have no idea how pleased i am to be wrong he gestured over his shoulder up the hill there is a little pavilion at the top of our property overlooking the lake he ah sits up there most of the time i see she spotted the path winding up past the graveyard um im not sure how to put this is he sober he glanced at the sun and pursed leathery lips probably not by this hour when he first came home he only drank after dinner but the time has been creeping up gradually very disturbing but there isnt much i can do about it although if that gut of his starts bleeding again i may he broke off looking her over with intense uncertain speculation he has taken this escobar failure unnecessarily personally i think his resignation was not in the least called for she deduced the old count was not in the emperors confidence on this matter and thought it wasnt its failure that slew his spirit sir it was its success aloud she said loyalty to your emperor was a very great point of honor for him i know almost its last bastion and your emperor chose to flatten it to its foundations in the service of his great need why dont you go on up suggested the old man although this isnt a very good day for him i had better warn you thank you i understand he stood looking after her as she left the walled enclosure and went on up the winding walk it was shaded by trees most of them earth imports and some other vegetation that had to be local the hedge of bushlike things with flowersshe assumed they were flowers dubauer would have knownthat looked like pink ostrich feathers was particularly striking the pavilion was a faintly oriental structure of weathered wood commanding a fine view of the sparkling lake vines climbed it seeming to claim it for the rocky soil it was open on all four sides and furnished with a couple of shabby chaises a large faded armchair and footstool and a small table holding two decanters some glasses and a bottle of a thick white liquid vorkosigan lay back in the chair eyes closed bare feet on the stool a pair of sandals kicked carelessly over the side cordelia paused at the pavilions edge to study him with a sort of delicate enjoyment he wore an old pair of black uniform trousers and a very civilian shirt a loud and unexpected floral print he obviously had not shaved that morning his toes she noticed had a little wiry black hair on them like the backs of his fingers and hands she decided she definitely liked his feet indeed could easily become quite foolishly fond of every part of him his generally seedy air was less amusing tired and more than tired ill he opened his eyes to slits and reached for a crystal tumbler filled with an amber liquid then appeared to change his mind and picked up the white bottle instead a small measuring cup stood beside it which he ignored knocking back a slug of the white liquid directly from its source instead he sneered briefly at the bottle then traded it for the crystal tumbler and took a drink rinsing it around in his mouth and swallowing he hunched back down in the armchair at a slightly lower level than before liquid breakfast cordelia inquired is it as tasty as oatmeal and blue cheese dressing his eyes snapped open you he said hoarsely after a moment are not a hallucination he started to get up then appeared to think better of it and sank back in frozen selfconsciousness i never wanted you to see she mounted the steps to the shade pushed a chaise closer to him and seated herself blast she thought ive embarrassed him catching him all awry like this off balance how to put him at his ease i would have him at his ease always i tried to call ahead when i first landed yesterday but i kept missing you if hallucinations are what you expect that must be remarkable stuff pour me one too please i think youd prefer the other he poured from the second decanter looking shaken curious she tasted from his glass faugh thats not wine brandy at this hour if i start after breakfast he explained i can generally achieve total unconsciousness by lunch pretty close to lunch now she thought his speech had misled her at first being perfectly clear only slower and more hesitant than usual there must be less poisonous general anesthetics the strawpale wine he had poured her was excellent although dry for her taste you do this every day god no he shuddered two or three times a week at most one day drinking the next day being illa hangover is quite as good as being drunk for taking your mind off other thingsthe next day running errands and such for my father hes slowed down a great deal in the last few years he was gradually pulling himself into better focus as his initial awkward terror of being repellant to her ebbed he sat up and rubbed his hand over his face in the familiar gesture as if to scrub away the numbness and made a stab at light conversation thats a pretty dress a great improvement over those orange things thanks she said falling in immediately with his lead im sorry i cant say the same for your shirtdoes that represent your own taste by chance no it was a gift im relieved something of a joke some of my officers got together and purchased it on the occasion of my first promotion to admiral before komarr i always think of them when i wear it well thats nice in that case i guess i can get used to it three of the four are dead now two died at escobar i see so much for light chitchat she swirled her wine around in the bottom of her glass you look like hell you know pasty yes i stopped exercising botharis quite offended im glad bothari didnt get in too much trouble over vorrutyer it was touch and go but i got him off illyans testimony helped yet they discharged him honorably on a medical did you put your father up to hiring him yes it seemed like the right thing to do hell never be normal as we think of it but at least he has a uniform and a weapon and regulations of a sort to follow it seems to give him an anchor he ran a finger slowly around the rim of the brandy tumbler he was vorrutyers batman for four years you see he was not too well when he was first assigned to the general vorkraft on the verge of a split personalityseparating memories the works rather scary being a soldier seems to be about the only human role he can meet the demands of it allows him a kind of selfrespect he smiled at her you on the other hand look like heaven can you ahstay long there was a hesitant hunger in his face soundless desire suppressed by uncertainty we have hesitated so long she thought its become a habit then it dawned on her that he feared she might only be visiting hell of a long trip for a chat my love you are drunk as long as you like i discovered when i went homeit was changed or i was changed nothing fit anymore i offended nearly everybody and left one step ahead of um a whole lot of trouble i cant go back i resigned my commissionmailed it in from escobarand everything i own is in the back of that flyer down there she savored the delight that ignited his eyes during this speech as it finally penetrated that she was here to stay it contented her i would get up he said sliding to the side of his chair but for some reason my legs go first and my tongue last id rather fall at your feet in some more controlled fashion ill improve shortly meantime will you come sit here gladly she changed chairs but wont i squash you im kind of tall not a bit i loathe tiny women ah thats better yes she nestled down with him arms around his chest resting her head on his shoulder and hooking one leg over him as well to emphatically complete his capture the captive emitted something between a sigh and a laugh she wished they might sit like that forever youll have to give up this suicidebyalcohol thing you know he cocked his head i thought i was being subtle not noticeably well it suits me its extraordinarily uncomfortable yes youve worried your father he gave me the funniest look not his glare i hope he has a very withering glare perfected over a lifetime not at all he smiled good god a grin crinkled the corners of his eyes she laughed and craned her neck for a look at his face that was better ill shave too he promised in a burst of enthusiasm dont go overboard on my account i came to retire too a separate peace as they say peace indeed he nuzzled her hair breathing its scent his muscles unwound beneath her like an overtaut bow unstrung a few weeks after their marriage they took their first trip together cordelia accompanying vorkosigan on his periodic pilgrimmage to the imperial military hospital in vorbarr sultana they traveled in a groundcar borrowed from the count bothari taking what was evidently his usual role as combination driver and bodyguard to cordelia who was just beginning to know him well enough to see through his taciturn facade he seemed on edge he glanced uncertainly over her head seated between him and vorkosigan did you tell her sir yes everything its all right sergeant cordelia added encouragingly i think youre doing the right thing sergeant im um very pleased he relaxed a little and almost smiled thank you milady she studied his profile covertly her mind ranging over the array of difficulties he would be taking back to the hired village woman at vorkosigan surleau this day gravely doubtful of his ability to handle them she risked probing a little have you thought aboutwhat youre going to tell her about her mother as she grows older shes bound to want to know eventually he nodded was silent then spoke going to tell her shes dead tell her we were married its not a good thing to be a bastard here his hand tightened on the controls so she wont be no one must call her that i see good luck she thought she turned to a lighter question do you know what youre going to name her elena thats pretty elena bothari it was her mothers name cordelia was surprised into an unguarded remark i thought you couldnt remember escobar a little time went by and he said you can beat the memory drugs some if you know how vorkosigan raised his eyebrows evidently this was new to him too how do you do that sergeant he asked carefully neutral someone i knew once told me you write down what you want to remember and think about it then hide itthe way we used to hide your secret files from radnov sirthey never figured it out either then first thing when you get back before your stomach even settles take it out and look at it if you can remember one thing on the list you can usually get the rest before they come back again then do the same thing again and again it helps if you have an an object too did you have ah an object asked vorkosigan clearly fascinated piece of hair he fell silent again for a long time then volunteered she had long black hair it smelled nice cordelia boggled and bemused by the implications of his story settled back and found something to look at out the canopy vorkosigan looked faintly illuminated like a man whod found a key piece in a difficult puzzle she watched the varied scenery enjoying the clear sunlight summer air so cool one needed no protective devices and the little glimpses of green and water in the hollows of the hills she also noticed something else vorkosigan saw the direction of her glance ah you spotted them did you bothari smiled slightly the flyer that doesnt outpace us said cordelia do you know who it is imperial security do they always follow you to the capital they always follow me all the time it hasnt been easy to convince people i was serious about retiring before you came i used to amuse myself flushing them out do things like go drunk driving in my flyer in those canyons to the south on the moonlit nights its new very fast that used to drive them to distraction heavens that sounds positively lethal did you really do that he looked mildly ashamed of himself im afraid so i didnt think youd be coming here then it was a thrill i hadnt gone adrenalinetripping on purpose since i was a teenager the service rather supplied that need im surprised you didnt have a wreck i did once he admitted just a minor crackup that reminds me i must check on the repairs they seem to be taking forever at it the alcohol made me limp as a rag i suppose and i never quite had the nerve to do without the shoulder harness no harm done except to the flyer and captain negris agents nerves twice commented bothari unexpectedly i beg your pardon sergeant you wrecked it twice the sergeants lips twitched you dont remember the second time your father said he wasnt surprised we helped um pour you out of the safety cage you were unconscious for a day vorkosigan looked startled are you pulling my leg sergeant no sir you can go look at the pieces of the flyer theyre scattered for a kilometer and a half down dendarii gorge vorkosigan cleared his throat and shrunk down in his seat i see he was quiet then added howunpleasant to have a blank like that in ones memory yes sir agreed bothari blandly cordelia glanced up at the following flyer through a gap in the hills have they been watching us all this time me too vorkosigan smiled at the look on her face from the moment you set foot in the vorbarr sultana shuttleport i should imagine i happen to be politically hot after escobar the press which is ezar vorbarras third hand here has me set up as a kind of heroinretreat snatching victory spontaneously from the jaws of defeat and so onabsolute tripe makes my stomach hurt even without the brandy i should have been able to do a better job knowing what i knew in advance sacrificed too many cruisers covering the troopshipsit had to be traded off that way sheer arithmetic demanded it though she could mark by his face as his thoughts wandered into a welltrodden labyrinth of military mighthavebeens damn escobar she thought and damn your emperor damn serg vorbarra and ges vorrutyer damn all the chances of time and place that combined to squeeze a boys dream of heroism into a mans nightmare of murder crime and deceit her presence was a great palliative for him but it was not enough still something remained unwell in him out of tune as they approached vorbarr sultana from the south the hill country flattened out into a fertile plain and the population grew more concentrated the city straddled a broad silver river with the oldest government buildings ancient converted fortresses most of them hugging the bluffs and high points commanding the rivers edge the modern city spilled back from them to the north and south the newer government offices efficient blocky monoliths were concentrated between they passed through this complex making for one of the citys famous bridges to cross the river to the north my god what happened there asked cordelia as they passed one whole block of burntout buildings blackened and skeletal vorkosigan smiled sourly that was the ministry of political education before the riots two months ago i heard a little about those at escobar on my way here i had no idea they were so extensive they werent really quite carefully orchestrated personally i thought it was a damn dangerous way to get the job done although i suppose it was a step up in subtlety from yuri vorbarras defenestration of the privy council a generation of progress of sorts i didnt think ezar was going to get that genie back in the bottle but he seems to have managed it as soon as grishnov was killed all the troops theyd called for which for some reason all seemed to have been diverted to guard the imperial residence he snorted turned up and cleared the streets and the riot just melted away except for a few fanatics and some wounded spirits whod lost kin at escobar that got ugly but it was suppressed in the news they crossed the river and came at length to the large and famous hospital almost a city within a city spread out in its walled park they found ensign koudelka alone in his room lying glumly on his bed in the green uniform pajamas cordelia thought at first that he waved to them but abandoned the idea as his left arm continued to move up and down from the elbow in slow rhythm he did sit up and smile as his excommander entered and exchange nods with bothari the smile broadened to a grin as he saw her in vorkosigans wake his face was much older than it used to be captain naismith maam lady vorkosigan i should say i never thought id see you again i thought the same glad to be mistaken she smiled back and congratulations sir thanks for sending the note i sort of missed you the past few weeks buti can see you had better things to do his grin made this comment stingless thank you ensign ahwhat happened to your arm koudelka grimaced i had a fall this morning somethings shorted out doc should be coming around to fix it in a few minutes it could have been worse the skin on his arms cordelia noted was covered with a network of fine red scars marking the lines of the prosthetic nerve implants youre walking then thats good to hear vorkosigan encouraged yeah sort of he brightened and at least theyve got my guts under control now i dont care that i cant feel anything from that department now that ive finally got rid of that damned colostomy are you in very much pain asked cordelia diffidently not much koudelka tossed off she felt he was lying but the worst part besides being so clumsy and outofbalance are the sensations not pain but weird things false intelligence reports like tasting colors with your left foot or feeling things that arent there like bugs crawling all over you or not feeling things that are there like heat his gaze fell on his bandaged right ankle a doctor entered and conversation stopped while koudelka removed his shirt the doctor attached a scope to his shoulder and went fishing for the short circuit with a delicate surgical hand tractor koudelka went pale and stared fixedly at his knees but at last the arm stopped its slow oscillation and lay limply at his side im afraid im going to have to leave it out of commission for the rest of the day apologized the doctor well get it tomorrow when you go in for the work on that adductor group on your right leg yeah yeah koudelka waved him away with his working right hand and he gathered his tools and moved on i know it must seem to you to be taking forever said vorkosigan looking at koudelkas frustrated face but it seems to me every time i come in here youve made more progress you are going to get out of here he said confidently yeah the surgeon says theyre going to kick me out in about two months he smiled but they say ill never be fit for combat again the smile slid away and his face crumpled oh sir theyre going to discharge me all this endless hacking around for nothing he turned his face away from them rigid and embarrassed until his features were under control again vorkosigan too looked away not inflicting his sympathy until the ensign looked back again with his smile carefully reattached i can see why koudelka said brightly nodding to the silent bothari propping up the wall and apparently content just to listen a few good body blows like the ones you used to give me in the practice ring and id be flopping around like a fish not a good example to set my men i guess ill just have to findsome kind of desk work he glanced at cordelia whatever happened to your ensign the one that got hit in the head the last time i saw him after escobari visited him just two days before i left home i guess hes the same he did get out of the hospital his mother quit her job and stays home to take care of him now koudelkas eyes fell and cordelia was wrenched by the shame in his face and i bitch my head off about a few twitches sorry she shook her head not trusting herself to speak later alone with vorkosigan in the corridor a moment cordelia leaned her head against his shoulder and was taken in his arms i can see why you started drinking after breakfast on the days after this i could use a stiff one myself just now ill take you to lunch after the next stop and we can all have one he promised the research wing was their next destination the military doctor in charge greeted vorkosigan cordially and only looked a little blank when cordelia was introduced without explanation as lady vorkosigan i hadnt realized you were married sir recently oh congratulations im glad you decided to come see one of these sir before theyre all done its really almost the most interesting part would milady wish to wait here while we take care of this little business he looked embarrassed lady vorkosigan has been fully briefed besides added cordelia brightly i have a personal interest the doctor looked puzzled but led on to the monitoring room cordelia stared doubtfully at the half dozen remaining canisters lined up in a row the technician on duty joined them trundling some equipment obviously borrowed from some other hospitals obstetrics department good morning sir he said cheerfully going to watch us hatch this chick today i wish youd find some other term for it said the doctor yes but you cant call it being born he pointed out reasonably technically theyve all been born once already you tell me what it is then they call it cracking the bottle at home suggested cordelia helpfully watching the preparations with interest the technician laying out measuring devices and placing a bassinet under a warming light shot her a look of great curiosity youre betan arent you milady my wife caught the admirals marriage announcement in the news way down in the fine print i never read the vital statistics section myself the doctor looked up startled then returned to his checklist bothari pretended to lean against the wall eyes half closed concealing his sharp attention the doctor and the technician finished their preparations and motioned them closer got the soup ready sir muttered the technician to the doctor right here inject into feed line c the correct hormone mixture was inserted into the right aperture the doctor rechecking the instruction disk on his monitor repeatedly five minute wait marknow the doctor turned to vorkosigan fantastic machine sir have you heard any more about getting funding and engineering personnel to try and duplicate them no replied vorkosigan im out of this project officially as soon as the last live child isreleased finished whatever you call it youre going to have to work on your own regular superiors for it and youll have to think up a military application to justify it or at least something that sounds like one to camouflage it the doctor smiled thoughtfully its worth pursuing i think it might be a nice change from thinking up novel ways of killing people time mark sir said the technician and he turned back to the current project placental separation looks goodtightening up just like its supposed to you know the more i study this the more impressed i am with the surgeons who did the sections on the mothers weve got to get more medical students off planet somehow getting those placentas out undamaged must be the mostthere there and there break seal he completed the adjustments and lifted the top cut the membraneand out she comes suction quickly please cordelia realized that bothari still pinned to the wall was holding his breath the wet and squirming infant took a breath and coughed as the cold air hit her bothari breathed too she looked rather pretty to cordelia unbloodied and much less red and squashedlooking than the vids of vivo newborns she had seen the infant cried loud and strong vorkosigan jumped and cordelia laughed out loud why she looks quite perfect cordelia hovered at the shoulders of the two medical men who were making their measurements and taking their samples from their tiny astonished bewildered and blinking charge why is she crying so loudly asked vorkosigan nervously like bothari still in his original spot because she knows shes been born on barrayar was the comment cordelia suppressed on her lips instead she said what youd cry too if a bunch of giants hooked you out of a nice warm doze and tossed you around like a bag of beans cordelia and the technician exchanged a look halfamused halfglowering all right milady surrendered the technician as the doctor turned back to his precious machine my sisterinlaw says youre supposed to hold them close like this not out at arms length id squall too if i thought i was being held over a pit about to be dropped there baby smile or something for auntie cordelia thats it nice and calm were you old enough to remember your mothers heartbeat i wonder she hummed at the infant who smacked her lips and yawned and tucked the receiving blanket around her more firmly what a long strange journey youve had want a look at the inside of this sir the doctor went on you too sergeantyou were asking so many questions the last time you were here bothari shook his head but vorkosigan went over for the technical exposition the doctor was obviously itching to supply cordelia carried the baby over to the sergeant want to hold her is it all right milady heavens you dont have to ask me for permission if anything the other way around bothari picked her up gingerly his large hands seeming almost to engulf her and stared into her face are they sure its the right one i thought shed have a bigger nose theyve been checked and rechecked cordelia reassured him hoping he wouldnt ask her how she knew but it seemed a safe assumption all babies have little noses you dont know what kids are going to look like till theyre eighteen maybe shell look like her mother he said hopefully cordelia seconded the hope silently the doctor finished dragging vorkosigan through the guts of his dream machine vorkosigan politely managing to look only a little unsettled want to hold her too aral cordelia offered quite all right he excused himself hastily get some practice maybe youll need it someday they exchanged a look of their private hope and he loosened up and permitted himself to be talked into it hm ive held cats with more heft this isnt really my line he looked relieved when the medical men repossessed her to complete their technical log um lets see said the doctor this is the one we dont take to the imperial orphanage right where do we take her after the observation period ive been asked to take care of that personally said vorkosigan smoothly for the sake of her familys privacy ilady vorkosigan and i will be delivering her to her legal guardian the doctor looked extremely thoughtful oh i see sir he didnt look at cordelia youre the man in charge of the project you can do what you like with them no one will ask any questions ii assure you sir he said earnestly fine fine how long is the observation period four hours sir good we can go to lunch cordelia sergeant uh may i stay here sir imnot hungry vorkosigan smiled certainly sergeant captain negris men can use the exercise on the way to the groundcar vorkosigan asked her what are you laughing about im not laughing your eyes are laughing twinkling madly in fact it was the doctor im afraid we combined to mislead him quite unintentionally didnt you catch it apparently not he thinks that kid we uncorked today is mine or maybe yours or perhaps both i could practically see the wheels turning he thinks hes finally figured out why you didnt open the stopcocks good god he almost turned around no no let it go said cordelia youll only make it worse if you try to deny it i know ive been blamed for botharis sins before just let him go on wondering she fell silent vorkosigan studied her profile now what are you thinking youve lost your twinkle just wondering what happened to her mother im certain i met her long black hair named elena on the flagshipthere could only have been one incredibly beautiful i can see how she caught vorrutyers eye but so young to deal with that sort of horror women shouldnt be in combat said vorkosigan grimly glum neither should men in my opinion why did your people try to cover up her memories did you order it no it was the surgeons idea he felt sorry for her his face was tense and his eyes distant it was the damnedest thing i didnt understand it at the time i do now i think when vorrutyer was done with herand he outdid himself on her even by his standardsshe was catatonic iit was too late for her but thats when i decided to kill him if it happened again and to hell with the emperors script first vorrutyer then the prince then myself should have left vorhalas in the clear anyway botharibegged the body from him so to speak took her off to his own cabin vorrutyer assumed to continue torturing her presumably in imitation of his sweet self he was flattered and left them alone bothari fuzzed his monitors somehow nobody had the foggiest idea what he was doing in there every minute of his off duty time but he came to me with this list of medical supplies he wanted me to sneak to him anesthetic salves some things for treatment of shock really a wellthoughtout list he was good at first aid from his combat experience it occurred to me then that he wasnt torturing her he just wanted vorrutyer to think so he was insane not stupid he was in love in some weird way and had the motherwit not to let vorrutyer guess that doesnt sound altogether insane under the circumstances she commented remembering the plans vorrutyer had had for vorkosigan no but the way he went about iti caught a glimpse or two vorkosigan blew out his breath he took care of her in his cabinfed her dressed her washed herall the while keeping up this whispered dialogue he supplied both halves he had apparently worked out this elaborate fantasy in which she was in love with him married in facta normal sane happy couple why shouldnt a madman dream of being sane it must have terrified the hell out of her during her periods of consciousness lord i feel almost as sorry for him as i do for her not quite he slept with her too and i have every reason to believe he didnt limit that marriage fantasy thing to just words i can see why i suppose can you imagine bothari getting within a hundred kilometers of such a girl under any normal circumstances mm hardly the escobarans fielded their best against you but that i believe is what he chose to try and remember from escobar it must have taken incredible strength of will he was in therapy for months whew breathed cordelia haunted by the visions his words conjured she was glad she would have a few hours to settle before seeing bothari again lets go get that drink now all right chapter fifteen summer was waning when vorkosigan proposed a trip to bonsanklar they were about half packed on the morning selected when cordelia looked out of their front bedroom window and said in a constricted voice aral a flyer just landed out front and there are six armed men getting out of it theyre spreading out all over your property vorkosigan instantly alert came to her side to look then relaxed its all right those are count vortalas men he must be coming to visit my father im surprised he found time to break away from the capital just now i heard the emperors been keeping him jumping a few minutes later a second flyer landed beside the first and cordelia had her first view of barrayars new prime minister prince sergs description of him as a wrinkled clown was an exaggeration but a just one he was a lean man shrunken with age but still moving briskly he carried a stick but from the way he swung it around cordelia guessed it was an affectation clipped white hair fringed a bald and liverspotted head that shone in the sunshine as he and a pair of aides or bodyguards cordelia was not sure which passed under her line of sight to the front door the two counts were standing chatting in the front hall as cordelia and vorkosigan came down the stairs the general saying ah here he comes now vortala looked them over with a bright and penetrating twinkle aral my boy good to see you looking so well and is this your betan penthesileia congratulations on a remarkable capture milady he bent over her hand and kissed it with a sort of manic savoir faire cordelia blinked at this description of herself but managed a how do you do sir in return vortala met her eyes calculatingly nice that you could get away for a visit sir said vorkosigan my wife and i the phrase was emphasized in his mouth like a sip of wine with a superior bouquet very nearly missed you im promised to take her to the ocean today just so this isnt a social call as it happens im playing messenger boy for my master and my time is unfortunately tight vorkosigan gave a nod ill leave you gentlemen to it then ha dont try to weasel off on me boy the message is for you vorkosigan looked wary i didnt think the emperor and i had anything further to say to each other i thought i made that clear when i resigned yes well he was perfectly content to have you out of the capital while that dirty work on the ministry of political education was in progress but i am charged to inform you he gave a little bow that you are requested and required to attend him this afternoon your wife too he added as an afterthought why asked vorkosigan bluntly frankly ezar vorbarra was not in my plans for the dayor any other day vortala grew serious hes run out of time to wait for you to get bored in the country hes dying aral vorkosigan blew out his breath hes been dying for the last eleven months cant he die a little longer vortala chuckled five months he corrected absently then frowned speculation at vorkosigan hm well it has been very convenient for him hes flushed more rats out of the wainscotting in the last five months than the past twenty years you could practically mark the shakedowns in the ministries by his medical bulletins one week condition very grave next week another deputy minister caught out on charges of peculation or whatever he became serious again but its the real thing this time you must see him today tomorrow could be too late two weeks from now will definitely be too late vorkosigans lips tightened what does he want me for did he say ah i believe he has a post in mind for you in the upcoming regency government the one you didnt want to hear about at your last meeting vorkosigan shook his head i dont think theres a post in the government that would tempt me to step back into that arena well maybeno not even the ministry of war its too damn dangerous i have a nice quiet life here his arm circled cordelias waist protectively were going to have a family ill not risk them in those gladiator politics yes i can just picture you whiling away your twilight yearsat age fortyfour ha picking grapes sailing your boatyour father told me about your sailboat i hear theyre going to rename the village vorkosigan sourleau in your honor by the way vorkosigan snorted and they exchanged an ironic bow anyway you will have to tell him so yourself id becurious to see the man murmured cordelia if its really the last chance vortala smiled at her and vorkosigan yielded reluctantly they returned to his bedroom to dress cordelia in her most formal afternoon wear vorkosigan in the dress greens he had not worn since their wedding why so jumpy asked cordelia maybe he just wants to bid you farewell or something were talking about a man who can make even his own death serve his political purposes remember and if theres some way to govern barrayar from beyond the grave you can bet hes figured it out ive never come out ahead on any dealing ive ever had with him on that ambiguous note they joined the prime minister for the flight back to vorbarr sultana the imperial residence was an old building almost a museum piece thought cordelia as they climbed the worn granite steps to its east portico the long facade was heavy with stone carving each figure an individual work of art the aesthetic opposite of the modern faceless ministry buildings rising a kilometer or two to the east they were ushered into a room half hospital half antique display tall windows looked out on the formal gardens and lawns to the north of the residence the rooms principal inhabitant lay in a huge carved bed inherited from some splendorminded ancestor his body pierced in a dozen places by the utilitarian plastic tubes that kept him alive this day ezar vorbarra was the whitest man cordelia had ever seen as white as his sheets as white as his hair his skin was white and wrinkled over his sunken cheeks his eyelids were white heavy and hooded over hazel eyes whose like she had seen once before dimly in a mirror his hands were white with blue veins standing up on their backs his teeth when he spoke were ivory yellow against their bloodless backdrop vortala and vorkosigan and after an uncertain beat cordelia went down on one knee beside the bed the emperor waved his attendant physician out of the room with a little effortful jerk of one finger the man bowed and left they stood vortala rather stiffly so aral said the emperor tell me how i look very ill sir vorbarra chuckled and coughed you refresh me first honest opinion ive heard from anyone in weeks even vortala beats around the bush his voice cracked and he cleared his throat of phlegm pissed away the last of my melanin last week that damned doctor wont let me out into my garden anymore during daylight he snorted for disapproval or breath so this is your betan eh come here girl cordelia approached the bed and the white old man stared into her face hazel eyes intent commander illyan has told me of you captain negri too ive seen all your survey records you know and that astonishing flight of fancy of your psychiatrists negri wanted to hire her just to generate ideas for his section vorkosigan being vorkosigan has told me much less he paused as if for breath tell me quite truly nowwhat do you see in him a brokendown ah what was that phrase hired killer aral has told you something it seems she said startled to hear her own words in his mouth she stared back at him with equal curiosity the question seemed to demand an honest answer and she struggled to frame it i supposei see myself or someone like myself were both looking for the same thing we call it by different names and look in different places i believe he calls it honor i guess id call it the grace of god we both come up empty mostly ah yes i recall from your file that you are some sort of theist said the emperor i am an atheist myself a simple faith but a great comfort to me in these last days yes i have often felt the pull of it myself hm he smiled at that a very interesting answer in light of what vorkosigan said about you what was that sir asked cordelia her curiosity piqued you must get him to tell you it was in confidence very poetic too i was surprised he waved her away as if satisfied and motioned vorkosigan closer vorkosigan stood in a kind of aggressive parade rest his mouth was sardonic but his eyes cordelia saw were moved how long have you served me aral asked the emperor since my commission twentysix years or do you mean body and blood body and blood i always counted it from the day old yuris death squad slew your mother and uncle the night your father and prince xav came to me at green army headquarters with their peculiar proposition day one of yuri vorbarras civil war why is it never called piotr vorkosigans civil war i wonder ah well how old were you eleven sir eleven i was just the age you are now strange so body and blood you have served medamn you know this thing is starting to affect my brain now thirtythree years sir god thank you not much time left from the cynical expression on his face cordelia gathered that vorkosigan was not in the least convinced of the emperors selfproclaimed senility the old man cleared his throat again i always meant to ask what you and old yuri said to each other that day two years later when we finally butchered him in that old castle ive developed a particular interest in emperors last words lately count vorhalas thought you were playing with him vorkosigans eyes closed briefly in pain or memory hardly oh i thought i was eager for the first cut until he was stripped and held before me theni had this impulse to strike suddenly at his throat and end it cleanly just be done with it the emperor smiled sourly eyes closed what a riot that would have started mm i think he knew by my face i was funking out he leered at me strike little boy if you dare while you wear my uniform my uniform on a child that was all he said i said you killed all the children in that room which was fatuous but it was the best i could come up with at the time then took my cut out of his stomach i often wished id saidsaid something else later but mostly i wished id had the guts to follow my first impulse you looked pretty green out on the parapet in the rain hed started screaming by then i was sorry my hearing had come back the emperor sighed yes i remember you stagemanaged it somebody had to he paused resting then added well i didnt call you here to chat over old times did my prime minister tell you my purpose something about a post i told him i wasnt interested but he refused to convey the message vorbarra closed his eyes wearily and addressed apparently the ceiling tell melord vorkosiganwho should be regent of barrayar vorkosigan looked as if hed just bitten into something vile but was too polite to spit it out vortala too old hed never last sixteen years the princess then the general staff would eat her alive vordarian the emperors eyes snapped open oh for gods sake gather your wits boy he does have some military background we will discuss his drawbacks at lengthif the doctors give me another week to live have you any other jokes before we get down to business quintillan of the interior and that is not a joke the emperor grinned yellowly so you do have something good to say for my ministers after all i may die now ive heard everything youd never get a vote of consent out of the counts for anyone without a vor in front of his name said vortala not even if he walked on water so make him one give him a rank to go with the job vorkosigan said vortala aghast hes not of the warrior caste neither are many of our best soldiers were only vor because some dead emperor declared one of our dead ancestors so why not start the custom up again as a reward for merit better yet declare everybody a vor and be done with the whole bloody nonsense forever the emperor laughed then choked and coughed sputtering wouldnt that pull the rug out from under the peoples defense league what an attractive counterproposal to assassinating the aristocracy i dont believe the most wildeyed of them could come up with a more radical proposal youre a dangerous man lord vorkosigan you asked for my opinion yes indeed and you always give it to me strange the emperor sighed you can quit wriggling aral you shall not wriggle out of this allow me to put it in a capsule what the regency requires is a man of impeccable rank no more than middleaged with a strong military background he should be popular with his officers and men wellknown to the public and above all respected by the general staff ruthless enough to hold nearabsolute power in this madhouse for sixteen years and honest enough to hand over that power at the end of those sixteen years to a boy who will no doubt be an idioti was at that age and as i recall so were youand oh yes happily married reduces the temptation of becoming bedroom emperor via the princess in short yourself vortala grinned vorkosigan frowned cordelias stomach sank oh no said vorkosigan whitely youre not going to lay that thing on me its grotesque me of all men to step into his fathers shoes speak to him with his fathers voice become his mothers advisorits worse than grotesque its obscene no vortala looked puzzled at his vehemence a little decent reticence is one thing aral but lets not go overboard if youre worried about the vote its already bagged everyone can see youre the man of the hour everyone most certainly will not vordarian will become my instant enemy and so will the minister of the west and as for absolute power you sir know what a false chimera that notion is a shaky illusion based ongod knows what magic sleight of hand believing your own propaganda the emperor shrugged carefully cautious of dislodging his tubing well it wont be my problem it will be prince gregors and his mothers and that ofwhatever individual can be persuaded to stand by them in their hour of need how long do you think they could last without help one year two six months muttered vortala vorkosigan shook his head you pinned me with that what if argument before escobar it was false thenalthough it took me some time to realize itand its false now not false the emperor denied either then or now i must so believe vorkosigan yielded a little yes i can see that you must his face tensed in frustration as he contemplated the man in the bed why must it be me vortala has more political acuity the princess has a better right quintillan has a better grasp of internal affairs you even have better military strategists vorlakial or kanzian you cant name a third though murmured the emperor wellperhaps not but you must see my point i am not the irreplaceable man which for some reason you choose to imagine me on the contrary you have two unique advantages from my point of view i have kept them in mind from the day we killed old yuri i always knew i wouldnt live forevertoo many latent poisons in my chromosomes absorbed when i was fighting the cetagandans as your fathers military apprentice and careless about my clean techniques not expecting to live to grow old the emperor smiled again and focused on cordelias intent uncertain face of the five men with a better right by blood and law to the imperium of barrayar than mine your name heads the list ha he added i was right didnt think youd told her that tricky aral cordelia faint turned wide grey eyes to vorkosigan he shook his head irritably not true salic descent a debate we shall not continue here be that as it may anyone who wishes to dislodge prince gregor using argument based on blood and law must first either get rid of you or offer you the imperium we all know how hard you are to kill and you are the one manthe only man on that list who i am absolutely certain by the scattered remains of yuri vorbarra truly does not wish to be emperor others may believe you coy i know better thank you for that sir vorkosigan looked extremely saturnine as an inducement i point out that you can be no better placed to prevent that eventuality than as regent gregor is your lifeline boy gregor is all that stands between you and being targeted your hope of heaven count vortala turned to cordelia lady vorkosigan wont you lend us your vote you seem to have come to know him very well tell him hes the man for the job when we came up here said cordelia slowly with this vague talk of a post i thought i might urge him to take it up he needs work hes made for it i confess i wasnt anticipating that offer she stared at the emperors embroidered bedspread caught by its intricate patterns and colors but ive always thoughttests are a gift and great tests are a great gift to fail the test is a misfortune but to refuse the test is to refuse the gift and something worse more irrevocable than misfortune do you understand what im saying no said vortala yes said vorkosigan ive always felt that theists were more ruthless than atheists said ezar vorbarra if you think its really wrong said cordelia to vorkosigan thats one thing maybe thats the test but if its only fear of failureyou have not the right to refuse the gift for that its an impossible job that happens sometimes he took her aside quietly to the tall windows cordeliayou have not the first conception of what kind of life it would be did you think our public men surrounded themselves with liveried retainers for decoration if they have a moments ease it is at the cost of twenty mens vigilance no separate peace permitted three generations of emperors have spent themselves trying to untangle the violence in our affairs and were still not come to the end of it i havent the hubris to think i can succeed where he failed his eyes flicked in the direction of the great bed cordelia shook her head failure doesnt frighten me as much as it used to but ill quote you a quote if you like exile for no other motive than ease would be the last defeat with no seed of future victory in it i thought the man who said that was on to something vorkosigan turned his head to some unfocused distance its not the desire for ease im talking about now its fear simple squalid terror he smiled ruefully at her you know i fancied myself quite a bravo once until i met you and rediscovered funk id forgotten what it was to have my heart in the future yeah me too i dont have to take it i can turn it down can you their eyes met its not the life you were anticipating when you left beta colony i didnt come for a me i came for you do you want it he laughed shakily god what a question its the chance of a lifetime yes i want it but its poison cordelia power is a bad drug look what it did to him he was sane too once and happy i think i could turn down almost any other offer without a blink vortala leaned on his stick ostentatiously and called across the room make up your mind aral my legs are beginning to ache but for your delicacyits a job any number of men i know would kill for and youre getting it offered free and clear only cordelia and the emperor knew why vorkosigan barked a short laugh at this he sighed gazed at his master and nodded well old man i thought you might find a way to rule from your grave yes i propose to haunt you continually a little silence fell while the emperor digested his victory youll need to start assembling your personal staff immediately im willing captain negri to my grandson and the princess for security but i thought perhaps you might like to have commander illyan for yourself yes i think he and i might deal very well together a pleasant thought seemed to strike a light in vorkosigans dark face and i know just the man for the job of personal secretary hell need a promotion for ita lieutenancy vortala will take care of it for you the emperor lay back wearily and cleared his throat of phlegm again lips leaden take care of it all i suppose youd better send that doctor back in he waved them out with a tired twitch of one hand vorkosigan and cordelia emerged from the imperial residence into the warm air of the late summer evening soft and grey with humidity from the nearby river they were trailed by their new bodyguards trim in the familiar black uniforms there had been a lengthy conference with vortala negri and illyan cordelias head swam with the number and detail of subjects covered vorkosigan shed noticed enviously seemed to have no trouble keeping up indeed hed set the pace his face seemed focused more electric than shed seen it since shed come to barrayar filled with an eager tension hes alive again she thought looking out not in forward not back like when i first met him im glad whatever the risks vorkosigan snapped his fingers and said tabs out loud cryptically first stop vorkosigan house they had driven past the counts official residence on their last trip to vorbarr sultana but this was the first time cordelia had been in it vorkosigan took the wide circular staircase two steps at a time to his own room it was a large chamber simply furnished overlooking the back garden it had the same feel as cordelias own room in her mothers apartment of frequent and prolonged disoccupation with archeological layers of past passions stuffed into drawers and closets not surprisingly there was evidence of interest in all kinds of strategy games and civil and military history more surprising was a portfolio of yellowing penandink drawings run across as he sorted through a drawer full of medals mementos and pure junk did you do these cordelia asked curiously theyre pretty good when i was a teenager he explained still sorting some later i gave it up in my twenties too busy his medal and campaign ribbon collection showed a peculiar history the early lesser ones were carefully arranged and displayed on velvetcovered cards with notes attached the later greater ones were piled haphazardly in a jar one which cordelia recognized as a high barrayaran award for valor was shoved loose in the back of the drawer its ribbon crumpled and tangled she sat on his bed and sorted through the portfolio they were mostly meticulous architectural studies but also a few figure studies and portraits done in a less certain style there were several of a striking young woman with short dark curls both clothed and nude and cordelia realized with a shock from the notes on them that she was looking at vorkosigans first wife she had seen no other pictures of her anywhere in his things there were also three studies of a laughing young man labeled ges that seemed hauntingly familiar she mentally added forty pounds and twenty years to him and the room seemed to tilt as she recognized admiral vorrutyer she closed the portfolio back up quietly vorkosigan finally found what he was looking for a couple of sets of old red lieutenants tabs good it was quicker than going by headquarters at the imperial military hospital they were stopped by a male nurse sir visiting hours are over sir did no one call from headquarters wheres that surgeon koudelkas surgeon the man who had worked on or over him with the hand tractor during cordelias first visit was routed out at last admiral vorkosigan sir no of course visiting hours dont apply to him thank you corpsman dismissed im not visiting this time doctor official business i mean to relieve you of your patient tonight if its physically possible koudelkas been reassigned reassigned he was to be discharged in a week reassigned to what hasnt anybody read my reports he can barely walk he wont need to his new assignment is all desk work i trust you have his hands working pretty well any medical work left to be done nothing important a few last tests i was just holding him to the end of the month so he would have completed his fourth year thought it would help his pension a bit such as it is vorkosigan sorted through the papers and disks and handed the pertinent ones to the doctor here cram this in your computer and get his release signed come on cordelia lets go surprise him he looked happier than he had all day they entered koudelkas room to find him still dressed for the day in black fatigues struggling with a therapeutic hand coordination exercise and cursing under his breath hello sir he greeted vorkosigan absently the trouble with this damn tinfoil nervous system is that you cant teach it anything practice only helps the organic parts i swear some days i could beat my head on the wall he gave up the exercise with a sigh dont do that youre going to need it in the days to come i suppose so it was never my best part though he stared abstracted and downcast at the board then remembered to be cheerful for his commander looking up he noticed the time what are you doing here at this hour sir business just what are your plans for the next few weeks ensign well theyre discharging me next week you know ill go home for a while then start looking for work i guess i dont know what land too bad said vorkosigan keeping his face straight i hate to make you alter your plans lieutenant koudelka but youve been reassigned and laid on his bedside tray in order like a fine hand of cards koudelkas newly cut orders his promotion and a pair of red collar tabs cordelia had never enjoyed koudelkas expressive face more it was a study in bewilderment and rising hope he picked up the orders carefully and read them through oh sir i know this isnt a joke but its got to be a mistake personal secretary to the regentelecti dont know anything about the work its an impossible job do you know thats almost exactly what the regentelect said about his job when he was first offered it said cordelia i guess youll both have to learn them together how did he come to pick me did you recommend me sir come to think of it he turned the orders over reading them through again who is the regent going to be anyway he raised his eyes to vorkosigan and made the connection at last my god he whispered he did not as cordelia thought he might grin and congratulate but instead looked quite serious itsa hell of a job sir but i think the governments finally done something right id be proud to serve you again thank you vorkosigan nodded in agreement and acceptance koudelka did grin when he picked up the promotion order thanks for this too sir dont thank me too soon i intend to sweat blood out of you in return koudelkas grin widened nothing new about that he fumbled clumsily with the collar tabs may i do that lieutenant asked cordelia he looked up defensively for my pleasure she added it would be an honor milady cordelia fastened them to his collar straightly with the greatest care and stepped back to admire her work congratulations lieutenant you can get shiny new ones tomorrow vorkosigan said but i thought these would do for tonight im springing you out of here now well put you up at the count my fathers residence tonight because work starts tomorrow at dawn koudelka fingered the red rectangles were they yours sir once i hope they dont bring you my luck which was always vile butwear them in good health koudelka gave him a nod and a smile he clearly found vorkosigans gesture profoundly meaningful exceeding his capacity for words but the two men understood each other perfectly well without them dont think i want new ones sir people would just think id been an ensign yesterday later lying warm in the darkness in vorkosigans room in the counts town house cordelia remembered a curiosity what did you say to the emperor about me he stirred beside her and pulled the sheet tenderly up over her bare shoulder tenting them together hm oh that he hesitated ezar had been questioning me about you in our argument about escobar implied that you had affected my nerve for the worse i didnt know then if id ever see you again he wanted to know what i saw in you i told him he paused again and then continued almost shyly that you poured out honor like a fountain all around you thats weird i dont feel full of honor or anything else except maybe confusion naturally not fountains keep nothing for themselves aftermaths the shattered ship hung in space a black bulk in the darkness it still turned imperceptibly slowly one edge eclipsed and swallowed the bright point of a star the lights of the salvage crew arced over the skeleton ants ripping up a dead moth ferrell thought scavengers he sighed dismay into his forward observation screen and pictured the ship as it had been scant weeks before the wreckage untwisted in his minda cruiser alive with patterns of gaudy lights that always made him think of a party seen across night waters responsive as a mirror to the mind under its pilots headset where man and machine penetrated the interface and became one swift gleaming functional no more he glanced to his right and cleared his throat selfconsciously well medtech he spoke to the woman who stood beside his station staring into the screen as silently and long as he had theres our starting point might as well go ahead and begin the pattern sweep now i suppose yes please do pilot officer she had a gravelly alto voice suitable for her age which ferrell judged to be about fortyfive the collection of thin silver fiveyear service chevrons on her left sleeve made an impressive glitter against the dark red uniform of the escobaran military medical service dark hair shot with grey cut short for ease of maintenance not style a matronly heaviness to her hips a veteran it appeared ferrells sleeve had yet to sprout even his firstyear stripe and his hips and the rest of his body still maintained an unfilled adolescent stringiness but she was only a tech he reminded himself not even a physician he was a fullfledged pilot officer his neurological implants and biofeedback training were all complete he was certified licensed and graduatedjust three frustrating days too late to participate in what was now being dubbed the day war although in fact it had only been days and part of an hour between the time the spearhead of the barrayaran invasion fleet penetrated escobaran local space and the time the last survivors fled the counterattack piling through the wormhole exit for home as though scuttling for a burrow do you wish to stand by he asked her she shook her head not yet this inner area has been pretty well worked over in the last three weeks i wouldnt expect to find anything on the first four turns although its good to be thorough ive a few things to arrange yet in my work area and then i think ill get a catnap my department has been awfully busy the last few months she added apologetically understaffed you know please call me if you do spot anything thoughi prefer to handle the tractor myself whenever possible fine by me he swung about in his chair to his comconsole what minimum mass do you want a bleep for about forty kilos say one kilo is the standard i prefer one kilo he stared are you joking joking she stared back then seemed to arrive at enlightenment oh i see you were thinking in terms of wholei can make positive identification with quite small pieces you see i wouldnt even mind picking up smaller bits than that but if you go much under a kilo you spend too much time on false alarms from micrometeors and other rubbish one kilo seems to be the best practical compromise bleh but he obediently set his probes for a mass of one kilo minimum and finished programming the search sweep she gave him a brief nod and withdrew from the closetsized navigation and control room the obsolete courier ship had been pulled from junkyard orbit and hastily overhauled with some notion first of converting it into a personnel carrier for middle brasstop brass in a hurry having a monopoly on the new shipsbut like ferrell himself it had graduated too late to participate so they both had been rerouted together he and his first command to the dull duties he privately thought on a par with sanitation engineering or worse he gazed one last moment at the relic of battle in the forward screen its structural girdering poking up like bones through sloughing skin and shook his head at the waste of it all then with a little sigh of pleasure he pulled his headset down into contact with the silvery circles on his temples and midforehead closed his eyes and slid into control of his own ship space seemed to spread itself all around him buoyant as a sea he was the ship he was a fish he was a merman unbreathing limitless and without pain he fired his engines as though flame leapt from his fingertips and began the slow rolling spiral of the search pattern medtech boni he keyed the intercom to her cabin i believe i have something for you here she rubbed sleep from her face framed in the intercom screen already what timeoh i must have been tireder than i realized ill be right up pilot officer ferrell stretched and began an automatic series of isometrics in his chair it had been a long and uneventful watch he would have been hungry but what he contemplated now through the viewscreens subdued his appetite boni appeared promptly and slid into the seat beside him oh quite right pilot officer she unshipped the controls to the exterior tractor beam and flexed her fingers before taking a delicate hold yeah there wasnt much doubt about that one he agreed leaning back and watching her work why so tender with the tractors he asked curiously noting the low power level she was using well theyre frozen right through you know she replied not taking her eyes from her readouts brittle if you play hotshot and bang them around they can shatter lets stop that nasty spin first she added half to herself a slow spin is all right seemly but that fast spinning you get sometimesit must be very unrestful for them dont you think his attention was pulled from the thing in the screen and he stared at her theyre dead lady she smiled slowly as the corpse bloated from decompression limbs twisted as though frozen in a strobeflash of convulsion was drawn gently toward the cargo bay well thats not their fault is itone of our fellows i see by the uniform bleh he repeated himself then gave vent to an embarrassed laugh you act like you enjoy it enjoy no but ive been in personnel retrieval and identification for nine years now i dont mind and of course vacuum work is always a little nicer than planetary work nicer with that godawful decompression yes but there are the temperature effects to consider no decomposition he took a breath and let it out carefully i see i guess you would getpretty hardened after a while is it true you guys call them corpsesicles some do she admitted i dont she maneuvered the twisted thing carefully through the cargo bay doors and keyed them shut temperature set for a slow thaw and hell be ready to handle in a few hours she murmured what do you call them he asked as she rose people she awarded his bewilderment a small smile like a salute and withdrew to the temporary mortuary set up next to the cargo bay on his next scheduled break he went down himself drawn by morbid curiosity he poked his nose around the doorframe she was seated at her desk the table in the center of the room was yet unoccupied uhhello she looked up with her quick smile hello pilot officer come on in uh thank you you know you dont really have to be so formal call me falco if you want he said entering certainly if you wish my first name is tersa oh yeah i have a cousin named tersa its a popular name there were always at least three in my classes at school she rose and checked a gauge by the door to the cargo bay he should be just about ready to take care of now pulled to shore so to speak ferrell sniffed and cleared his throat wondering whether to stay or excuse himself grotesque sort of fishing excuse myself i think she picked up the control lead to the float pallet and trailed it after her into the cargo bay there were some thumping noises and she returned the pallet drifting behind her the corpse was in the dark blue of a deck officer and covered thickly with frost which flaked and dripped upon the floor as the medtech slid it onto the examining table ferrell shivered with disgust definitely excuse myself but he lingered leaning against the doorframe at a safe distance she pulled an instrument trailing its lead to the computers from the crowded rack above the table it was the size of a pencil and emitted a thin blue beam of light when aligned with the corpses eyes retinal identification tersa explained she pulled down a padlike object similarly connected and pressed it to each of the monstrositys hands and fingerprints she went on i always do both and crossmatch the eyes can get awfully distorted errors in identification can be brutal for the families hm hm she checked her readout screen lieutenant marco deleo age twentynine well lieutenant she went on chattily lets see what i can do for you she applied an instrument to its joints which loosened them and began removing its clothes do you often talk tothem inquired ferrell unnerved always its a courtesy you see some of the things i have to do for them are rather undignified but they can still be done with courtesy ferrell shook his head i think its obscene myself obscene all this horsing around with dead bodies all the trouble and expense we go to collecting them i mean what do they care fifty or a hundred kilos of rotting meat itd be cleaner to leave them in space she shrugged unoffended undiverted from her task she folded the clothes and inventoried the pockets laying out their contents in a row i rather like going through the pockets she remarked it reminds me of when i was a little girl visiting in someone elses home when i went upstairs by myself to go to the bathroom or whatever it was always a kind of pleasure to peek into the other rooms and see what kind of things they had and how they kept them if they were very neat i was always very impressedive never been able to keep my own things neat if it was a mess i felt id found a secret kindred spirit a persons things can be a kind of exterior morphology of their mindlike a snails shell or something i like to imagine what land of person they were from whats in the pockets neat or messy very regulation or full of personal things take lieutenant deleo here he must have been very conscientious everything regulation except this little vid disc from home from his wife id imagine i think he must have been a very nice person to know she placed the collection of objects carefully into its labeled bag arent you going to listen to it asked ferrell oh no that would be prying he barked a laugh i fail to see the distinction ah she completed the medical examination readied the plastic body bag and began to wash the corpse when she worked her way down to the careful cleaning around the genital area necessary because of sphincter relaxation ferrell fled at last that woman is nuts he thought i wonder if its the cause of her choice of work or the effect it was another full day before they hooked their next fish ferrell had a dream during his sleep cycle about being on a deepsea boat and hauling up nets full of corpses to be dumped wet and shining as though with iridescent scales in a huge pile in the hold he awoke from it sweating but with very cold feet it was with profound relief that he returned to the pilots station and slid into the skin of his ship the ship was clean mechanical and pure immortal as a god one could forget one had ever owned a sphincter muscle odd trajectory he remarked as the medtech again took her place at the tractor controls yes oh i see hes a barrayaran hes a long way from home oh bleh throw him back oh no we have identification files for all their missing part of the peace settlement you know along with prisoner exchange considering what they did to our people as prisoners i dont think we owe them a thing she shrugged the barrayaran officer had been a tall broadshouldered man a commander by the rank on his collar tabs the medtech treated him with the same care she had expended on lieutenant deleo and more she went to considerable trouble to smooth and straighten him and massage the mottled face back into some semblance of manhood with her fingertips a process ferrell watched with a rising gorge i wish his lips wouldnt curl back quite so much she remarked while at this task gives him what i imagine to be an uncharacteristically snarly look i think he must have been rather handsome one of the objects in his pockets was a little locket it held a tiny glass bubble filled with a clear liquid the inside of its gold cover was densely engraved with the elaborate curlicues of the barrayaran alphabet what is it asked ferrell curiously she held it pensively to the light its a sort of charm or memento ive learned a lot about the barrayarans in the last three months turn ten of them upside down and youll find some kind of good luck charm or amulet or medallion or something in the pockets of nine of them the highranking officers are just as bad as the enlisted people silly superstition im not sure if its superstition or just custom we treated an injured prisoner oncehe claimed it was just custom people gave them to the soldiers as presents and that nobody really believes in them but when we took his away from him when we were undressing him for surgery he tried to fight us for it it took three of us to hold him down for the anesthetic i thought it a rather remarkable performance for a man whose legs had been blown away he wept of course he was in shock ferrell dangled the locket on the end of its short chain intrigued in spite of himself it hung with a companion piece a curl of hair embedded in a plastic pendant some sort of holy water is it he inquired almost its a very common design its called a mothers tears charm let me see if i can make out hes had it a while it seems from the inscriptioni think that says ensign and the dateit must have been given him on the occasion of his commission its not really his mothers tears is it oh yes thats whats supposed to make it work as a protection doesnt seem to be very effective no well no ferrell snorted ironically i hate those guysbut i do guess i feel sort of sorry for his mother boni retrieved the chain and its pendants holding the curl in plastic to the light and reading its inscription no not at all shes a fortunate woman how so this is her death lock she died three years ago by this is that supposed to be lucky too no not necessarily just a remembrance as far as i know kind of a nice one really the nastiest charm i ever ran across and the most unique was this little leather bag hung around a fellows neck it was filled with dirt and leaves and what i took at first to be some sort of little froglike animal skeleton about ten centimeters long but when i looked at it more closely it turned out to be the skeleton of a human fetus very strange i suppose it was some sort of black magic seemed an odd thing to find on an engineering officer doesnt seem to work for any of them does it she smiled wryly well if there are any that work i wouldnt see them would i she took the processing one step further by cleaning the barrayarans clothes and carefully redressing him before bagging him and returning him to the freeze the barrayarans are all so armymad she explained i always like to put them back in their uniforms they mean so much to them im sure theyre more comfortable with them on ferrell frowned uneasily i still think he ought to be dumped with the rest of the garbage not at all said the medtech think of all the work he represents on somebodys part nine months of pregnancy childbirth two years of diapering and thats just the beginning tens of thousands of meals thousands of bedtime stories years of school dozens of teachers and all that military training too a lot of people went into making him she smoothed a strand of the corpses hair into place that head held the universe once he had a good rank for his age she added rechecking her monitor thirtytwo commander aristede vorkalloner it has a kind of nice ethnic ring very barrayaranish that name vor too one of those warriorclass fellows homicidalclass loonies or worse ferrell said automatically but his vehemence had lost momentum somehow boni shrugged well hes joined the great democracy now and he had nice pockets three full days went by with no further alarms but a rare scattering of mechanical debris ferrell began to hope the barrayaran was the last pickup they would have to make they were nearing the end of their search pattern besides he thought resentfully this duty was sabotaging the efficiency of his sleep cycle but the medtech made a request if you dont mind falco she said id greatly appreciate it if we could run the pattern out just a few extra turns the original orders are based on this average estimated trajectory speed you see and if someone just happened to get a bit of extra kick when the ship split they could well be beyond it by now ferrell was less than thrilled but the prospect of an extra day of piloting had its attractions and he gave a grudging consent her reasoning proved itself before the day was half done they turned up another gruesome relic oh muttered ferrell when they got a close look it had been a female officer boni reeled her in with enormous tenderness he didnt really want to go watch this time but the medtech seemed to have come to expect him idont really want to look at a woman blown up he tried to excuse himself mm said tersa is it fair though to reject a person just because theyre dead you wouldnt have minded her body a bit when she was alive he laughed a little macabrely equal rights for the dead her smile twisted why not some of my best friends are corpses he snorted she grew more serious idsort of like the company on this one so he took up his usual station by the door the medtech laid out the thing that had been a woman upon her table undressed inventoried washed and straightened it when she finished she kissed the dead lips oh god cried ferrell shocked and nauseated you are crazy youre a damn damn necrophiliac a lesbian necrophiliac at that he turned to go is that what it looks like to you her voice was soft and still unoffended it stopped him and he looked over his shoulder she was looking at him as gently as if he had been one of her precious corpses what a strange world you must live in inside your head she opened a suitcase and shook out a dress fine underwear and a pair of white embroidered slippers a wedding dress ferrell realized this woman is a bona fide psychopath she dressed the corpse and arranged its soft dark hair with great delicacy before bagging it i believe i shall place her next to that nice tall barrayaran she said i think they would have liked each other very well if they could have met in another place and time

the suitcase and turned back with the float pallet daughter he asked it was all he could ask she pursed her lips and nodded itsa helluva coincidence no coincidence at all i asked for this sector oh he swallowed turned away turned back face flaming im sorry i said she smiled her slow sad smile never mind they found yet one more bit of mechanical debris so agreed to run another cycle of the search spiral to be sure that all possible trajectories had been outdistanced and yes they found another a nasty one spinning fiercely guts split open from some great blow and hanging out in a frozen cascade the acolyte of death did her dirty work without once so much as wrinkling her nose when it came to the washing the least technical of the tasks ferrell said suddenly may i help certainly said the medtech moving aside an honor is not diminished for being shared and so he did as shy as an apprentice saint washing his first leper dont be afraid she said the dead cannot hurt you they give you no pain except that of seeing your own death in their faces and one can face that i find yes he thought the good face pain but the greatthey embrace it
