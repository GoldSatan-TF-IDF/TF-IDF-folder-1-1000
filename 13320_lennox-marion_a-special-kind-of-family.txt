marion lennox a special kind of family dear reader a few months back i watched a romantic movie saw the heroine sink into the heros arms at the end and thought the script writers got it wrong sure the hero had great pecs sure he was rich and dropdead gorgeous but underneath the surface polish i had a bad feeling hed spend the rest of their marriage gazing fondly into the mirror at himself which got me thinkingwhat if the perfect man proposes everyone tells you youre the luckiest woman alive and yet you know deep in your heart that youre not thats how i came to write a special kind of family dominic spencer is totally committed to the community he cares for and the damaged kids he helps to heal he has no time in his life for erin and erin already has the perfect fianc√©the perfect life so i thought id throw them together and see what happens i thoroughly enjoy writing warm loving stories where my hero and heroine take part of their strength from the community around them in my favorite stories healing takes all forms and love reaches out and embraces in ways we cant begin to expect love conquers all i believe that absolutely and by the time you finish reading a special kind of family i hope youll be a little closer to believing it as well marion lennox to my number one marion my number one reader my number one mum love you for ever chapter one the doorbell rang at one in the morning dominic spencer doc to the locals swore and thumped his basin of dough into the trash the locals knew he couldnt go out tonight was a patient coming to him happy easter he thought and tried not to glower as he stomped through the hall to the front door it had better be serious it was the girl standing on his veranda was a bedraggled muddy mess age somewhere between twenty and thirty it was hard to be more precise she was five feet six or so slightly built and wearing jeans and a windcheater both coated with mud and with blood one leg of her jeans was ripped to the knee and there was blood on her bare shin what else she was wearing one filthy shoe but only one the other foot was partly covered by a sock but the sock had long abandoned the idea of being footwear her brownblack curls were drooping in sodden tendrils to her shoulders her eyes were huge scared a long scratch ran from her left eyebrow almost to her chin bleeding sluggishly she was carrying one of the ugliest dogs hed ever seen maybe an english bulldog fat to the point of grotesque it lay limply in her armsa dead weight oh thank god the girl managed before he had a chance to speak she shoved the dog forward lurching like she was drunk he grabbed the dog then watched in dismay as she sank onto the veranda put her head between her knees and held her head down with both hands triage he thought his arms full of dog woman first dog second get rid of the dog rain was blasting in from the east reaching almost to the door so he turned and laid the dog on the mat inside the hall the dog sagged like a rag doll but the girl was his priority whats wrong he caught her wrist her pulse was racing she was sweating and as he knelt beside her she started to retch hhelp me she stuttered and couldnt manage more a childs sand bucket was lying on the veranda he hauled it forward but she didnt need it this hadnt been the first time shed vomited tonight then now wasnt the time for questions he did a more careful visual examination as he waited for the nasty little interlude to be over she was kneeling which meant the damage to her leg must be superficial the scratch on her face wasnt deep either she was moving her arms freely there didnt seem to be any major injury maybe she was retching from exhaustion if hed had to carry that lump of a dog far he might be retching too this afternoon had been sultry before the change and the kids had set up their paddling pool by the sandpit a houseproud man might have tidied the place as soon as the colder weather hit but housework was well down dominics list of priorities so towels still lay on the veranda albeit damp ones as she ceased retching he used one to wipe the worst of the mud and blood from her face she submitted without reaction and he thought again this is exhaustion lets get you inside she looked up then as if seeing him for the first time wherewhere she was almost incoherent im the local doctor he said smiling at her in what he hoped was his best bedside manner i assume you know that from the sign on the front gate my names dominic spencer dom for short dominic she managed dom will do fine and your name erin carmody it wasnt a comprehensive patient history but itd do for now what hurts everything it was practically a wail and he relaxed a little in his experience patients who were deathly ill didnt wail anything specific nno what happened i crashed my car where the roads round here would be deserted at this time of night where had she walked from is anyone else hurt he asked and she managed to shake her head so theres no one else at the car nno i was by myself is the car obstructing the road do i need to call the police no okay lets get you out of the rain where i can take a look at you i shouldnt be here she managed its really late she stared blindly up at him and he thought he saw fear her eyes were wide and brown and shocked it was one in the morning maybe reassurance was the way to go take a look around he said gently motioning to the jumble behind himbuckets and spades nathans tricycle martins pogo stick the bundle of wet towels left from the days play im a dad as well as a doctor my kids are asleep upstairs youre safe here the dog even the dogs safe with me he said ruefully safe reliable dr spencer she even managed a smile at that dont say it like youd rather be a playboy she whispered leave my fantasies alone he growled and smiled back now erin dont get your knickers in a knot but im going to carry you indoors one two three go and before she could protest he swung her up into his arms she was older than twenty she was every bit a woman he thought as his arms held her close pushing thirty maybe now the worst of the mess was gone from her face he could see smile lines around her eyes or worry lines nope smile lines he thought she had clear brown eyes nicely spaced her mouth was generous and her nose was decidedly cute that was hardly patient appraisal he gave himself a swift mental swipe and carried her inside before she could find the strength to protest she did protest as he stepped over the dog in the hall the dog she managed put me down ill attend to your dog as soon as ive attended to you in fact he wouldnt be surprised if the dog was on the way out it hadnt moved an inch since hed set it down but that wasnt his concern right now erin had been retching he needed to check there wasnt a ruptured spleen or something equally appalling going on inside so he stepped over the limp dog with purpose and carried her into the living room hed been reading in here while he waited for his dough tonot rise the open fire was still sending out warmth making the place seem intimate and welcoming the settee was big and squishy built for comfort rather than style she protested again as he laid her on the mound of cushions i cant your wifeill stain your settee she whispered as he laid her down but her protest was weak she was almost past arguing i have kids he growled weve given up worrying about home beautiful years ago lets have a look at you there was a better light in the living room and he could see her more clearly lots of superficial injuries he thought taking in scratches and bruising there was blood but not so much in any one place that it merited concern can we take the worst of those clothes off he asked half expecting her to protest again but she simply looked at him for a long moment maybe assessing for herself the truth of his statement about reliability steadfastnessdad material rather than playboy stuff what she saw must have been okay she nodded mutely and submitted as he peeled off her windcheater and tugged her jeans away he wanted her dry her bra and panties were scant and lacytheyd dry quickly on her he thought and he guessed shed be much happier if he let them be he pulled a mohair throw from the back of the settee tucked it round her and felt her relax a little with the warmth he felt her pulse again and it was slowing growing stronger and steadier how far did you carry the dog he asked checking an arm gently watching her face for reaction no problems there her hands were scratched but there were no breaks he lifted the other arm before she found the strength to reply miles she said and she even managed to sound indignant this is the middle of nowhere what bombadeen he asked pseudo indignant to match bombadeens the cultural capital of the known world right she managed and tried for a smile then as he moved to check her legs she added my legs are fine do you think i could have carried him with a broken leg toes also fine but they werent he tugged the lone trainer off her right foot that was okay he gently peeled the remainder of the sock from her left foot less than okay gravel was deeply embedded the foot was bleeding rubbed raw not lifethreatening though move on for now tummy that does hurt she whispered finally acknowledging pain like ivejustbeenretching hurt but no i wasnt hit in the chest or abdomen id imagine my kidneys and spleen are in one piece and im breathing okay she had medical knowledge then he smiled but he didnt take her word for it he put his hands gently on her abdomen and felt still watching her face its true im fine she whispered in fact youve never looked better he agreed relaxing then triage kicked in again youve been in a car accident youre sure no one else was hurt theres only me and your caryoure sure its not blocking the road do i need to call the emergency services to clear it its way off the road she said suddenly bitter but even if it was would you need to clear it apart from the car that caused me to crashwhich didnt even stopive seen no other car for hours its a quiet little town in the middle of coastal bushlandand were on holiday he was still watching her face thinking the situation through what next in the warm room erins colour was starting to return her foot needed attention as did her mass of cuts and bruises but if shed carried the dog for miles she must really care about it maybe triage said he ought to check if youre okay for a minute ill see whats happening to your dog would you she closed her eyes i think hes dying he was moving when i picked him uphe sort of moanedbut he didnt struggle ill see what i can do dom said and put his hand on her cheek in a fleeting gesture of reassurance dont move he tucked the rug more tightly round her pulled a couple more logs onto the fire then left leaving the door wide so she could watch him her eyes followed him she must love the dog a lot to carry him with her foot like that he thought itd be good if he could do something but like shed said the dog looked close to death the creature hadnt moved dom flicked the hall light on so he could see him better and stooped over the limp form he wasnt dead yet neither was he unconscious the dogs eyes were huge he looked up at dominic and his expression was almost imploring if there was one thing dom was a sucker for it was a dog especially a dog in trouble and this one was really in trouble hey dominic said softly and put a finger gently behind the dogs soft ear he scratched gently hey its okay he liked this dog on sight it was mix of english bulldog and something he didnt know part bulldog part mutt dog ugly in every sense of the word he looked a bit like winston churchill missing the cigar but he didnt smile at the thought the situation was too serious tending an injured dog had problems not normally associated with people the main one being their propensity to bite this one looked beyond biting but dom sensed that even when he was well this dog would be docile his eyes followed him with absolute trust but hell he must be hurt why wasnt he moving a few months ago dom had attended a guy whod come off his bike onto gravel thats what this dog looked likehed been dragged along the road his coat was a mass of scratches some deep his mistress was in a much better state than he was what was so wrong that the dog couldnt move hed laid the dog on the doormat and the dog had slumped so his legs were facing the wall now dom carefully pulled the mat aroundwith dog attachedso he could get a clear view of the dogs joints a smashed leg would explain immobility but his legs were fine ornot here at last was information to enter in his patients history in doms expert medical opinion these were her legs whats your dogs name he called back into the sitting room you tell me and well both know the woman muttered and dominic thought he needed to give her something for pain but suddenly his attention switched back to the dog for as he watched a ripple ran across its limp body the muscle contraction was unmistakable from a little bit of information suddenly he had a lot of information too much this dog was not male and she was not fat she was heavily pregnant and by the look of her body she was in labour great dom thought fantastic half an hour ago hed been bored to snores now he had a wounded woman lying on his sittingroom settee and a pregnant bitch who was showing every sign of dying unless he could do something about it and the last vet had left bombadeen back in via the graveyard okay he needed a history he rose striding swiftly back into the sitting room i need to know he started but at the look on erins face he changed priorities again and headed for his surgery that foot would be excruciatingly painful his surgery was at the back of the house accessed through his study two minutes later he was back hauling his bag open retrieving what he needed sorry he said kneeling beside erin and lifting the rug back a little i shouldnt have let the dog distract me im giving you something for the pain are you allergic to anything no i no reaction to morphine no but then lets stop things hurting he said he should set up a mask but he was forming priorities as he went a mask meant hed need to stay with her while she slowly gained the level of pain relief she needed but he had a birth on his hands she had brought the dog after all i dont need morphine she muttered tell me its not hurting she hesitated then its hurting she conceded you came to the doctors i assume thats because you were looking for medical help your house is the first house out of bushland but when i saw your signi was looking for help with the dog im not a vet ill do my best for her but her her but well get you sorted first ill give you something to stop the vomiting as well he hesitated his eyebrows still raised waiting for her agreement she looked at the syringe then she winced again and nodded i suspect youve been brave enough for a lifetime tonight he said gently swabbing her thigh i need to go back to your dog but can you quickly tell me what happened im on my way to campbelltown she said closing her eyes as the needle went in then opening them again hey not bad that hardly hurt im a doctor he said and smiled its what i do so then she was still having trouble talking shock exhaustion and fear had taken quite a toll anyway id sort of deviated from the main campbelltown route ii needed thinking time so i didnt know the road and then there was a car in front of me an ancient car that trailed smoke it was weaving as if the driver was drunk it was just after dark the road was narrow near the cliffs beside the river and suddenly the rear door of the car opened and the dog was thrown out thrown they pushed him she said horror flooding into her voice as she recalled right into the path of my car i would have hit him but i swerved you went over the cliff she must have the road by the river left no room for error what do you think she said bitterly so my car was on its side right down the bottom of the cliff im lucky i didnt go into the river i lay in the car for a bit thinking someone would rescue meim sure the people in the car in front must have seen what happened but nothing so finally i kicked my way out of the passenger door which was suddenly my roof it was really dark my shoe came off and i couldnt find it i couldnt find my phone i climbed up the cliff but it took me ages and the dog was lying in the middle of the road just lying there so i sat there in the dark waiting to get my breath backwaiting for someone to come along and i thought the dog was dying but he didnt die so finally i picked him up and carried him here if you went over where i think you went overthats twomaybe three miles youve walked dominic said horrified it felt like ten she closed her eyes again and then she opened them again what nothing no actually not nothing im thinking you deserve a medal i cant believe he shook his head forcing himself to move on i need to go back to the dog the she dog she said cautiously elementary mistake i guess my examination skills leave a bit to be desired definitely medical he thought nurse but now was hardly the time to ask the she dog he agreed gravely and i think i know why shes not moving why shes in labour im guessing by the look of her that shes been in labour for a while i need to haul out my veterinary books and see what i can do well give your injection time to work and ill take a closer look at those scratches meanwhile do your best she said and managed a smile i didnt pick she was a she and i didnt pick she was in labour i deserve to be struck off but pleasehelp her i havent lugged her all this way to have her die chapter two she might well have the dog was still exactly as dom had left her he squatted beside her and winced she was an obvious stray she wore a frayed collar with no identification shed been dumped she looked emaciated and exhausted and ill almost to the point of death maybe it would be more humane to put her down he thought ruefully as the only person with any medical knowledge for fifty miles dom had been called on for veterinarian duty in the past he had something in his bag that would be fast and painless but but the dog was looking up at him hed never seen such pleading eyes he swallowed itd be sensible the dogs gaze wasnt leaving his face he watched as another contraction rippled through her body it was weaker than the last it was a wonder her contractions hadnt ceased altogether given what she was going through he did a fast basic examination there was no sign of a puppy coming how long had the contractions been happening erin had obviously not been in a state to notice but the fact that the second contraction was weaker than the first told its own story this was an abnormal labour in a dog near death he couldnt do a caesarean section hed learned a few basic vet skills but this was way beyond him he had no anaesthetist to help him even if could find out the dosage what sort of anaesthetic could he give a bitch so close to death erins heroics aside what was the sensible course of action she was a badly injured stray dog in obstructed labour he knew the logical thing to do but still her eyes pleaded okay softtouch doc dom he sighed and hit his phone fiona mclay was the nearest vet fifty miles away she was as soft a touch as he was like dom fiona was on call twentyfour hours a day seven days a week she was nearing seventy she was wonderful and when he was having a bad day he reminded himself that if fiona could do it so could he she answered on the first ring sorry to wake you fi he said but i have a problem can you give me some advice the morphine was starting to take effect finally the pain in her foot and in her shoulders was taking a back step she was warm gloriously safely warm dominic had loaded the fire the flames were leaping and the room was fabulously heated she was still a bit damp but it didnt matter she could go to sleep right now she should ring charles and her parents she thought drowsily theyd worry or not theyd just assume shed been caught up at work they certainly wouldnt be pacing theyd be furious with her anyway maybe theyd even expect her not to come id kill her out in the hall doms voice sounded startled up until now shed been concentrating on the pain but now erin lay back and let doms words sink in if youre surethen im guessing its been stuck for hours yeah youre right theres no choice no youre right there too shes not going to make it that far or that long shed be dead before you got here thanks for offering anyway fi youre a hero okay step by step yeah ive got the kit you made up for menot that i ever dreamed of using it talk me through it slowly ill write down dosages as we go silence followed she peered around the back of the settee and saw him taking notes finally the receiver was replaced she heard him moving away somewhere further down the hall the sound of running water in the bathroom then things being set up on the floorboards by the front door just out of sight i know girl he said so softly she had to strain to hear its not a great operating table but i dont want to move you more than i need to and ive set up the desk lamp so i can see this was killing her she wiggled her foot with care the worst of the throbbing had stopped that was because she wasnt standing on it she thought okay she wouldnt stand on it she wrapped the rug around her slid off the settee and wriggled on her backside over the floor her shoulders complained but what the heckwhat was morphine for shed put too much into saving this dog to stop now she reached the doorway and peered round dom was intent on the dog hed set up a high bendy light so he could see he was setting up a dripstand she paused taking in the whole scene her dog was lying in the hallway with the morphine aboard erin could focus on her surroundings now taking in the wide oldfashioned hall the high ceilings the massive architraves and she could also get a good look at this doctor dominic spencer he was youngish she thought midthirties his dark chocolatebrown hair was a bit too long a bit wavy with some of it flopping down over one eye not too farlike he was a week or so overdue for a haircut and a day or two late for a shave and a year or so overdue for an iron he looked rumpled she thought she was used to the men in her life beinggroomed this guy was wearing faded jeans ancient trainers and an old cotton shirt with rolledup sleeves and a frayed collar his top two buttons had disappeared long since he didnt look like a doctor she thought if the sign on the brass plate out the frontplus his actions since shed arriveddidnt bear out his introduction shed have guessed maybe he was the doctors artistbrother whod maybe cadged a bed over easter because he was living on the smell of an oily rag but in what he was doing this guy was proving every inch a doctor his lean face looked absolutely focused he lookedwonderful it must be the morphine talking she thought dazed she didnt respond to men like this of all the stupid hormonal reactions at least he hadnt noticed with the drip started dom had turned his attention to his equipment what are you doing she asked he glanced aroundone swift glance that said he was completely preoccupiedthen turned back to what he was doing if you move youll hurt yourself he said briefly go back to the settee im hurting because of this dog she said i think ill call her marilyn marilyn as in monroe cos shes gorgeous and misunderstood his mouth quirked into a trace of a smile a damned attractive smile her hormones said no she told her hormones marilyn it is then he agreed then his smile died but i need to tell you shes not likely to make it i cant believe i didnt pick up that she was in labour i thought she was just fat youre hurt yourself he turned back to her refocusing go back to the settee he said please this wont be pretty youre not putting her down not yet he motioned to the drip im getting some fluid on board shes still having weak contractions my guessand ive just spoken to the vet in the next town and she concursis that shes been in labour for some time we think shes got a pup stuck maybe thats why she was dumped maybe she got into trouble giving birth someone said theyd take her to the vetmaybe to keep kids happyand then they dumped her taking a pregnant bitch to the vet costs money his face tightened dumping her would be easier throwing her out where you said they didmy guess is they intended her to go in the river its only a guess but people can be cruel he spoke like he knew what he was talking about he spoke like a man with ghosts she registered it but only fleetingly her foot was hurting her hormones had taken a back seat to discomfort and she only had so much registering space possible so what are you doing trying to get the pup out a caesarean i cant shes so weak itd kill her even if i had the skillswhich i dont neither do i she said regretfully im an accident and emergency consultant youre a doctor he demanded clearly astounded i am she wriggled closer he was loading a syringe what is that lubricant he said and the surprise hed shown disappeared as he turned back to what he was doing he was carefully filling a syringe full of gel then he moved deliberately blocking her view youll kill the puppy she said appalled how could he manoeuvre lubricant into a blocked birth canal without the pup will be dead anyway he said flatly he was speaking almost to himself fionamy vet friendtells me if its been wedged for hours theres no chance its still alive she tells me i have a choice i put marilyn down now or i try and get the dead pup out of the birth canal so whatevers behind can come out of its own accord if it doesnt work then ill have to put her down but i intend to try so if you could shut up im shutting up she said and pushed herself forward a bit more but you have an assistant i may not be sterile but ill do whatever i can to help it was a nasty procedure with an initial nasty outcome dom inserted the lubricant with difficulty he injected oxytocin he used forceps with even more difficulty he fitted the forceps just as a contraction hit he tugged the thing shifted and suddenly it was there just as fiona had foreseen he glanced back at erin who was lying full length on the floor keeping a light touch on marilyns carotid artery feeling her pulse and stroking her ears one pup he told her softly dead amazingly marilyn struggled raising her head as if to see she moaned a low doggy moan that sounded almost like despair hush erin said softly fondling the big dogs ears as dom removed the dead puppy i know its your baby and im so sorry but you did the best you could relax girl well take care of it her bedside manner was great dom thought though it was slightly more personal than the approach hed learned in medical school she was lying nose to nose with her patient and you moaned erin whispered thats the first sound youve made since i found you that has to be good she glanced up at dom again whats happening id imagine this pup died in utero some time ago dom said grimly wrapping the tiny body in a towel and placing it gently to one side its not completely formed and its stiff thats why its blocked the birth passage if theyre all like that the oxytocins only so good at getting the contractions going again he muttered we need a bit of luck he stopped the pressure behind the dead pup must have been overwhelming the contraction marilyn was having now was almost nonexistent but it was enough a wobbly limp body was propelled outward in a rush dom caught it as it cameand the tiny bundle moved in his hand again marilyn tried to turn its okay girl erin whispered leave your babies to dr dom hes doing it all for you were both in his hands what was in doms hands was a live pup dom peeled membrane away from one tiny nose he held the tiny creature upside down and gave it a faint jiggle it gave a sound that could almost have beena bark dear god erin said and burst into tears you cry youre out of my theatre dr carmody dom said but he was grinning some surgical assistant you are he headed down the hall with the pup in his hands dont let her have another contraction till i come back he needed warm towels hell hed never anticipated a live birth luckily he had heated towel rails in the bathroom he grabbed the family towels wrapped the pup in one and tucked another two towels under his arm by the time he got back to the hall erin had his doctors bag tipped out on the floor dental floss she murmured in approval as she searched youre a man after my own heart what sort of doctor doesnt carry dental floss he grinned then laid the pup on a towel on the floor right near marilyns head do we need to clamp and tie the umbilical cord erin asked doubtfully youre asking me as a dog expert lets do it anyway then as another contraction rippled through he left the pup to erin and went back to delivery mode and two pups later it was over at least he guessed it was over there was no heartbeat that he could hear insidethere were no signs that there were any more to come the third live pup slid into the world and marilyns body seemed to sag in relief dont you dare die now erin said to her almost fiercely dr doms getting fluids into you hes doing everything he can you have three puppies totally dependent on you you cant die not completely dependent dom thought ruefully as he watched erin marilyn was lying back exhausted to the point of death but as erin presented each of her pups to her she nosed them with the beginning of maternal interest as erin set them at their mothers teats they knew what to do erin was doing everything she could to give these puppies a start in life and marilyn was trying herself the big dog was breathing deeply evenly as if she guessed that she had to concentrate on gathering her strength shes a dog in a million erin said fiercely echoing his thoughts how can they have just thrown her out it beggars belief dom said sadly but thats life we just pick up the pieces you sound like you do it all the time im a family doctor yeah family she gazed up at him seeming suddenly to realise that she was seminaked lying full length in the hall ofa family doctor a doctor with a family umhow come we havent woken your wife and kids maybe now wasnt the time to let her know exactly what his family consisted of dom thought he needed her settled tonight and if the thought of a wife and kids upstairs would do it then thats what shed get im a family doctor he repeated with tired humour in this family we learn to sleep with bombs going offor sometimes thats what it feels like i nap between explosions now he looked down at marilyn who was almost visibly relaxing her eyes were threequarters closed the puppies were a living breathing pile of life nuzzling her teats the fire in the living room was sending its warmth out here marilyn was safe and she was delivered you know what im going to leave her right here dom said ill put a heater out here to make it even warmer but she looks like shell sleep for hours and i dont want that iv line to move in the morning ill do something about cleaning up her side but it looks like superficial scratches fiona told me what antibiotic to give ill clean the mess up later he rose which means he looked down at erin who was smiling goofily at the pups you he said feet im not leaving them till morning im fine thats right he agreed youre nicely doped on morphine and you could walk another three miles or so or not dr carmody you know very well that your foot has to be attended to and it has to be attended to now there was nothing to say even if there was a decent rebuttal she was too tired and too drugged to think of one yes doctor she said meekly and held out her hands so he could help her to her feet he didnt youve walked far enough tonight he growled you need to come through to my surgery at the back of the house and before she could guess what he intendedor protesthe picked her up again and was carrying her through the house to his clinic beyond what followed was nasty dom gave her as much analgesic as he could but short of a general anaestheticand im not doing that on my ownhe couldnt stop all the pain there was gravel deeply embedded shed felt pain as shed walked but there hadnt been a choice shed just kept on walking any other night thered be traffic on that road he told her but its the thursday before easter the whole towns either left for holidays or hunkered down with visitors he was trying to distract her she lay back and tried really hard not to think about what he was doing he was making sure not one trace of gravel remained so why arent you either on holidays or hunkered down with visitors hey i am he said smiling suddenly she liked it a lot when he smiled she decided normally his face looked strained like life was hard but when he smiled the sun came out it made her feelsilly no she chided herself that was the morphine one mans smile shouldnt make her feel silly she was a very serious person or she would be if hed stop smiling one woman with a sore foot he was saying one dog and three puppies that makes visitors pity about the easter buns the easter buns they didnt rise he said sorrowfully im in all sorts of trouble but dont you worry about me you just think about your own worries crashed car injured foot bruises all over and a messedup holiday to boot you keep thinking about them and let me get on with my own troubles easter buns as flat as pancakes she chuckled the sound surprised them both he glanced up at her and grinned and then he went back to what he was doing ouch her smile faded she bit her lip then decided she needed to smile again suddenly it seemed really important to keep smiling its okay not to be a martyr he said gently swear if you want i dont swear she said with an attempt at dignity i chop things pardon i have an axe he said when life gets toughwhen things go wrong or when gloria fisher comes in with her somethingswrongwithmemiddle complaint for the fourth time in a week and she still refuses to stop wearing tootight corsetsi go outside and chop anything that comes to hand luckily theres lots of old tree stumps on this place i keep the family in firewood year round venting spleen thats the one he said cheerfully if you like ill let you borrow my axe only not tonight and then magically he set aside his instruments all done now theres nothing else youre not telling me about painwise ino you swear my shoulders ache from carrying marilyn i suspect ill ache for a bit but i was well strapped in when the car rolled i really will be okay so who do we phone to come and get you she blinked she hadnt thought that far ahead charles her parents charless parents of course she should ring them but it was what three in the morning and they were angry with her already family he asked and she nodded her parents were with charles and charless parents the whole domestic catastropheexcept the one element that was supposed to complete the whole the pig in the middle a small rebellious pig you know if you were heading to your parents for easter and dont want to wake themif youre sure they wont be worryingyoure welcome to sleep here he said gently watching her face i dont want to move your dog until morning anyway the settees as big as a bed and the fires comforting she thought of the alternative ringing charles waking charless parents and her parents scaring them with the news of another accident theyd send charles to fetch her hed be kind and supportive and not offer a word of reproach until she was over her shock andtaking marilyn aaagh dom must be reading her face he placed a last piece of dressing on her foot and touched her lightly on her ankle it was a feather touch of reassurance and why it had the capacity to make her feel reassured she had no idea but unaccountably it did hey no drama he said your settees practically made for you anyway but i do need a guarantee that no one will be looking for you notmy family theyll assume i stayed in melbourne until the morning they might even assume shed decided not to come at all she thought ruefully she darn near hadnt but if those yahoos saw me go over the cliff they may have reported it its unlikely or youd have been found before this ill ring the local police and tell them if anyone reports a crashed car i have the driver safe okay all sorted and now the driver needs to sleep and before she knew it once again she was in his arms was this how country doctors transported patients the thought made her feel silly again what he asked as he carried her through the silent house the man was percipient she thought shed allowed herself a tiny smile meant only for herself but hed picked up on it im just thinking most hospitals have trolleys yeah and hospital orderlies he said with wry humour and nurses and regulations about lifting and role demarcation but orderlies are in short supply around here so lie back pretend to be a really light suitcase and let me do my job the man was seriously efficient he set her in an armchair for a couple of minutes disappeared and came back with linen pillows and blankets she watched as he made up her bedfaster than shed thought possible the man had real domestic skills except in making easter buns umdoesnt your wife cook she asked but the idea didnt last she almost forgot the question before it was out of her mouth the heat of the fire the morphine and the events of the night were catching up with her her words were slurring he smiled back at her you want to concentrate on staying awake till your beds made she tried but as he lifted her over onto the fresh sheets as he drew the blankets over her she felt her lids drooping and no amount of effort could keep them from closing thank you she murmured it seemed enormously important to say it thank you for everything my pleasure he said in an odd thoughtful voice its all my pleasure dr carmody you go to sleep and dont worry about a thing he touched her face there it was againthisstrangeness it was a tiny gesture and why it should seem so personalso right there was no figuring it out she was too tired to try gnigh she whispered she slept he should start easter buns again it was not much after three in the morning after all yeah right sod the buns he crouched by marilyn for a bit watching her breathe in breathe out you keep on doing that he told her and she opened her big eyes she looked up at him and amazingly her tail moved just a fraction youre wonderful he told her just like your mistress her tail moved again hey thats enough effort he told her go to sleep he watched as she did just that she was a wreck he thought a disaster washed up on the jagged rocks of human cruelty like so many disasters he had two of them sleeping upstairs right now could he keep marilyn as well could he keep three pups not and keep working he thought bleakly but hey they all might find homes scrubbed and cared for marilyn might look quiteattractive umno this dog couldnt look attractive in a million years no matter what the care would erin take her but hed watched erins face as hed said she shouldnt move the dog tonight the inference being when she moved so would the dog hed seen dismay so its up to me again he told marilyn but then he gave himself a mental swipe to the side of the head hey thats me being despondent therell be all sorts of people just aching to give you a good home a nice brick bungalow with room to romp a couple of dogloving kids balls to chase a pile of dog food so high you cant see the top he glanced into the sitting room toward the sleeping erin was she the girl to provide it maybe not but then he thought still hopeful hed really liked what hed seen for now hed indulge his very own personal philosophy which was to worry about tomorrow tomorrow finding homes for puppies was for tomorrow flat easter buns were for tomorrow tonightor what was left of itwas for sleep and maybe for letting himself think just a little bit about what sort of woman carried an injured dog so far chapter three she woke and she was being watched she opened one eye looked sideways at the door and two small heads ducked for cover she closed her eyes and waited for a bit testing herself out she wiggled everything really cautiously various protests started up in response but compared to the pain of last night they were minor then she wiggled her left foot and thought no not minor she opened her eyes again once more two heads but this time they didnt withdraw one head was bright carrot red really curly the other was mousy brown dead straight five or six years old she guessed and then she thought they didnt look one bit like the man whod helped her last night hi she said and the redhead gave a nervous smile he was the oldest the younger one ducked back behind the door dom said were not to wake you redhead said dom hmm doms your dad sort of redhead said most unsatisfactorily hes in the kitchen making breakfast the buns didnt work this sounded like a tragedy of epic proportions but weve got puppies the other little boy said from the anonymity of behind the door only dom said were not allowed to wake them either well im awake erin said swinging her feet off the settee putting her right foot cautiously to the floor wondering if she dared do anything with her left foot did your dad tell you i hurt my feet last night he said you crashed your car off the cliff and you saved the dog by carrying her for miles and miles redhead was looking at her like he might look at superman it was nothing she said modestly and thenumif you guys got on either side of me i might be able to make it to the kitchen you want us to help redhead said i do they thought about it finally redhead nodded okay he said come on nathan we gotta help im martin he added im pleased to meet you martin she said and nathan can you help me hop nathans head appeared again sometimes i help my mum go to the bathroom he said sounding wise far beyond his years do you want us to help you to the bathroom he was a child in a million yes please she said gratefully and a minute later she had a small living crutch at each side she was on her way via the bathroom to meet the doctors family theyd be ready at lunchtime maybe what sort of father forgot to buy easter buns well okay he hadnt forgotten but he had forgotten to put in an order he hadnt reached the shops until three and theyd been sold out so hed thought no problem hed buy yeast and make em piece of cake not quite not even on this his second try and he ought to check on erin the door swung open erin and boys the kids were standing on either side of her acting as walking sticks shed arranged the cashmere throw like a sarong tucking it into itself so it hung from just above her breasts her curls were cascading in a tumbled mess around her shoulders she lookedfabulous he thought so suddenly that he felt a jab of what might even be described as heart pain or heart panic two deep breaths professional she was a patient nothing more hed been over the idea of heart pain a long time ago hey welcome to the world of up he said and managed a smile he hoped was detached and clinically appropriate i hope youre not weight bearing on that foot i have two great crutches she said and smiled one called nathan and one called martin great job boys he said and nodded and both little boys flushed with pleasure which gave him another jolt it was hard to get these kids to smile dammit why had he forgotten the buns are they ready yet martin asked almost as the thought entered his head easter buns are for this afternoon he said and he knew he sounded desperate you said we could have them for breakfast nathan said the kids at school say they eat buns on good friday morning ive been eating them all week erin chipped in and he cast her a look that he hoped put her right back in her place talk about helpfulnot dom says easter buns are for easter and not before martin told her like easter eggs he says if the bunny sees us eat an egg before sunday hell know he doesnt have to deliver eggs to our place so if he sees you eat a bun before this morning you wont get any erin ventured eyeing dom with caution your dads a stickler for rules then rules are good martin said though he sounded doubtful they are good erin agreed as long as there arent interruptions like dogs having puppies and ladies crashing their car to take a mans mind off his baking actually the buns flopped before dom started but erin shook her head one good deed deserves another she said smiling at him from the doorway with a smile that said she knew exactly how disconcerted he was youre starting another batch now i started an hour ago but the instructions say it takes five hours at least she said so your buns will have to be buns batch two pardon do you have selfraising flour umyes butter yes and dried fruit of course yes look you cant do very much at all she agreed cheerfully marilyn and her puppies are asleep theres no job for me there im just hanging around at a loose end in my very fetching sarong but my foot does hurt so what say you give me a chair and a bowl and all the ingredients i listedoh and milk i need milk and turn your oven to as hot as you can make it in twenty minutes i guarantee youll have hot cross buns for breakfast they did true to her word twenty minutes later they were wrapping themselves round absolutely delicious hot cross buns or to be more specific hot cross scones dom conceded as he lathered butter onto his third but who was nitpicking he surely wasnt neither were the boys as per erins instructions theyd helped rub butter into the flour and helped her cut scones from the dough theyd painted on glaze to make crosses using sugar and egg white theyd stood with their noses practically pressed against the glass oven door as the sconesbunsrose in truly spectacular fashion and now they were lining up for their third as well as was erin she was eating like she hadnt eaten for a week he thought back to the retching of the night before she was running on empty he should have given her something i wouldnt have been able to eat even if youd offered she said and his gaze jerked to meets hers how did you know i was going to say i could see it she said wiping a daub of melted butter from her chin you had that look my intern gets when he forgets to take some really minor part of a patient history like how many legs my patient has like i came on duty one morning a few weeks back she continued placidly reaching for another scone according to my interns notes a patient whod come in during the night was suffering from tingling in his legs that was all it said the nurses had set a cradle from his hips down so i couldnt see i chatted to the patient for a couple of minutes then asked if he could wriggle his toes and she had him fascinated and hed lost both legs in a motorbike accident twenty years ago she said glowering obviously remembering a very embarrassing moment hed come in because he was getting weird tingling in his stumps and a bit of leftsided numbness it transpired hed had too much to drink gone to sleep on a hard floor then woken and panicked i figured it out but not before the students who were following me on my rounds did the worlds biggest snigger so the look i had on my face just then yep it was like my intern looked when i came out of the ward and asked why a small matter like lack of legs wasnt in the patient notes last night all you did was not offer me a threecourse meal when i was still queasy so you can stop beating yourself up and pass me the jam yes maam he said faintly these are great sbuns they are arent they she said smugly i taught myself from the australian countrywomens association cookbook circa your mother didnt teach you no she said shortly and a shadow crossed her face umyour mother he started what about my mother will she have hot cross buns waiting for your arrival probably designer buns though she said shell have ordered them from the most exclusive and expensive baker in melbourne shell have unsalted butter imported from denmark if she wasnt staying at charless parents place shed be serving them on china that cost more than my weekly salary per piece but marjory will be making up for that marjory has exquisite porcelain all her own marjory charless mother she said and bit into her scone with a savagery that made him blink um dont ask she said i love them but they drive me nuts in a while ill phone and ask them to come and get me she looked down at her sarong and winced im not sure what theyll think of my fashion sense what do you think boys the little boys had been staring at her like she had two heads they were totally entranced its verynice martin tried my mum wore a blanket sometimes nathan offered your mum ive washed your clothes dom said thinking maybe now was a good time to deflect the conversation i put them in the washer last nighttheyre in the drier now id expect youll have decent clothes in about half an hour i think i ripped them you may have he agreed did you have any more in the car of course i let the police know about the crash last night if the local cop doesnt arrive with your gear well go and get it did you really crash your car martin asked i did then seeing the boys desire for gory detail she relented marilyn the dog was in the middle of the road i swerved to avoid hitting her my car went off the road and rolled all the way down to the river rolled nathan breathed rolled she agreed over and over it was lucky i was wearing a seat belt or id have been squashed you must have been scared martin said i was she nodded looking satisfactorily ghoulish i could have been deader than a duck her dark eyes twinkled if it was a dead duck that is but martin wasnt to be deflected he was off in his own horror story you might have rolled into the river and drowned he said and frowned i think my dad drowned my aunty said he drowned himself in booze im so sorry erin said focusing directly on the little boy before her her playacting disappeared her expression was suddenly adult to adult and dom thought this woman is skilled empathic kind her whole body language said she cared i cant even remember him martin said i can remember mum but shes gone too does that make you really sad erin asked cautious no cos doms looking after me martin said cheering up and tansy but tansys not here but youre here and now marilyn is too the dogs here only till this lady goes home dom said warningly and erin thought no dom said she looked startled what its two who can play at facereading he retorted im sorry you crashed your car im also very sorry for marilyn but i cant keep her you cant she paused no iof course you cant im looking after two boys and the medical needs of this entire community he said normally i have a housekeeper no wife she said before she could stop herself no wife he agreed and smiled at her evident confusion im sorry last night you assumed there was and because you were scared it seemed more sensible to let you believe it we normally have a livein housekeepertansy shes great isnt she boys but her sister had a baby last week so tansys flown to queensland to help out which means when i get an urgent callout the boys have to come with me i can hardly take marilyn and the pups as well i can only take on so much of course you can she said hurriedly iill think of something of course you will he said and had to bite back the urge to say stay here of course we can keep your dog we can keep you too if you want which was ridiculous there was no earthly reason why he should look at this woman and feel his heart hammer in his chest she was a patient whod come to him for help she didnt belong here his body was telling him she did his body had better go take a hike maybe he had more of his mother in him than he thought his mother had believed in love at first sight and shed messed with both of their lives because of it her romantic ideals had turned into loser after loser she saw life through rosecoloured glasses and her dreams turned to nightmares every time i have work to do he said abruptly i wont interfere i know you wont he said and added silently as he left for his ears only because i wont let you shed upset him hed walked out of the room like he couldnt leave fast enough like she was contagious ridiculous she must be mistaken she ate another scone and had a second cup of coffee and talked to the boys the tumbledrier whirred to a halt in the next room and dom appeared again with an armful of clean dry clothes do you want to phone your family he asked brusque and businesslike you lost your cellphone didnt you you can use my land line she glanced at her watch nine if she was driving from melbourne this morning shed hardly arrive before eleven they wouldnt be worrying she could have a couple more hours of what sitting in this mans kitchen eating more hot cross scones while he stayed out of her way stupid she was avoiding the inevitable she had to go and marilyn if she was careful she could get her onto the back seat of charless or her fathers car she decided sure they shouldnt disrupt her but it was a whole lot better than putting her down which was the alternative you could ring the local animal shelter dom said watching her face and seeing her indecision they might be able to do something on the first day of a fourday holiday an injured stray with hoursold puppies she shook her head ill think of something she rose to her feet feeling shaky feeling unaccountably desolate ill fetch some crutches from the surgery thank you we can be your crutches martin said stoically but he was looking doubtful are you taking the puppies away theyre erins puppies dom said does she want them martin looked at erin with eyes that said hed been lied to in the past his clear green eyes were challenging of course i want them erin said forcing brightness and then she glanced out into the hall and saw the heap of doggie contentment by the door of course i want them she reiterated sounding more sure of herself its just a matter of convincing my family her family en masseincluding charless parentswere appalled erin tried to downplay the accidenta skid on a wet road to avoid a dogbut for her extended family even a minor incident had the power to dredge up fearsome memories it took a while to assure her mother she wasnt hurt honest it had been a minor accident and no she didnt need their help she only needed someone to fetch her her mother put charles on so charles hadnt told them what had happened between them or maybe he had but hed explained she was being silly hormonal hed said the last time shed seen him which had made her want to hit him by the time she spoke to charles she was emotionally wrung out she didnt have energy left to explain she still had marilyn ill be there as soon as i can charles said and she knew shed shaken him as well she knew hed come fast she didnt want charles she wanted her dad to come but of course they acted as a team they all cared for her they cared for her so well she feltstifled the doorbell pealed while she was getting dressed and her feeling of oppression deepened but then she thought surely charles couldnt be here already maybe it was another patient maybe it was another need for dom to face this easter if he was called outmaybe she could stay with the boys for a while she thought as a thankyou gesture charles wouldnt mind waiting he could have one of her hot cross scones she hauled her windcheater over her head and opened the livingroom door with caution dom was at the front door facing a stranger the man in the doorway was long lanky and unkempt he was maybe six feet four or so he had limp dirty hair that hung in dreadlocks to his shoulders he was wearing tattered clothes and frayed sandals and in his hands he was holding the biggest easter egg erin had ever seen as big as two footballs the thing was wider than he was im here to see nathan the man snapped and then started coughing dom took the egg and waited until the coughing ceased nathan he called down the passage marilyn was right behind him in the hall between erin and the front door between dom and erin as he glanced backward past the dog doms eyes met erins he gave her a blank starethe sort of look doctors gave each other in the emergency department to say caution act with care nathan came running out of the kitchen he saw who was at the front doorand stopped heres your dad dom said gently erin noticed i think hes brought you a present i can tell my kid that myself the man said aggressively would you like to come in dom asked he gestured to marilyn sorry about the mess our dog gave birth to puppies last night in just the wrong place our dog okay maybe anything else would be too hard to explain erin conceded for now marilyn was communal property im not coming in the man growled this place gives me the creeps its a safe house dad nathan said in a small voice no one hits you here there was moments deathly silence the man seemed to freeze no one hits you anywhere the man said finally in a voice that said he didnt believe it himself no one responded hows the methadone programme going dom asked and the mans anger returned bloody stuff doesnt work you know that so youre using again yeah but i want the kid you know the courts said you need to be clear for three months before theyll consider it methadone and testingyou know the drill weve been through it over and over people are trying to help you fdogooders its all we can do michael dom said wearily would you like some breakfast nah i just want to give the kid the egg he held it toward nathan not moving an inch inside the house come on nathe he said in a wheedling voice i bought it good and proper with me pension money its pretty big nathan said but he didnt look pleased in fact he looked close to tears so come and get it michael said nathan edged forward along the hallway inching his way past marilyn but it wasnt the dog he was scared of erin thought when he reached michael his face was bleached white doms hand came down to rest on his shoulder hey its good that your dads brought you an egg he said yyeah nathan took a deep breath as if searching for courage he reached out and the egg was shoved into his arms there michael said satisfied you cant say i dont have contact with him can you he demanded of dom belligerently of course i cant dom said but if you want custody you need to get serious about the methadone programme yeah yeah after easter when i get me life in order a bit but me and a mate are going surfing he glanced out to the street where an ancient purple kombi van was clearly waiting for him id love to take you nathe yes nathan said but his hand crept into doms and held it the man noticed his face darkened with anger why you little nathans had flu dom said quickly as the mans hand raised hes had almost a week off school it was enough to deflect michael his hand paused my kids been sick why didnt you tell me i left a message at your boarding house i havent been there for weeks out on the street whoever was driving the van was clearly getting impatient there was a long loud blast of the horn i hope the surfs great dom said neutrally and michael cast him an uncertain lookdeciding erin thought whether to stoke his anger or not and finally blessedly deciding not yeah it will be he said at last i gotta go but nathe remember i gave you the egg i do what i can love ya mate and he wheeled away and half ran back to the van leaving nathan clutching dominics hand this was none of her business she should go back into her sitting cum bedroom but she was too interested to retreat dom and nathan stayed with their backs to her watching the van disappear nathan didnt release dominics hand when finally the sound of the van retreated to silence he glanced up at dom and his small face was a mess of tears the easter bunny wont come now yeah he will dom said placid in the face of the little boys distress you know the rules if the easter bunny sees you eating an egg before sunday he knows he doesnt need to deliver eggs but lots of people give eggs before sunday three of my patients left me eggs and theyre sitting on my desk right now i just have to be very good and not eat them so i cant eat dads egg not until sunday not if you want the bunny to come dom said with all the gravity in the world he was great erin thought he wasgorgeous umwhat where had that come from gorgeous hardly appropriate or actually incredibly appropriate the mans kindness made her blink back tears sexy came in all forms sexy came in the guise of a guy holding a little boy by the hand and discussing the easter bunny with the same gravity he might accord world peace i guess nathan was saying still doubtful its true all you need do is put it with the others that well eat after easter okay nathan said his face finally clearing as he decided to believe then he added im glad hes gone will he come back soon i dont know nathe dom admitted and the little boys face clouded he might he whispered but then the clouds disappeared again but he said he was going surfing for easter and thats days and days he wont come back till after the easter bunnys been ill tell martin and he handed his egg to dom edged past the bundle of canine contentment on the floor and scooted off to find hisbrother she didnt think so a few assumptions were being stood on their heads this morning dom was standing in the hallway holding the egg it really was ridiculously large marilyn snoozed at his feet with her three puppies erin could hear nathan talking to martin back in the kitchen how many responsibilities did this man have the boys are yourfosterkids she ventured and he nodded he was watching her an expression on his face like he couldnt figure her out what she said he shook his head as if clearing fog nothing he said umyeah theyre my fosterkids but you dont have a wife you dont need a wife to foster kids i thought if i wanted to adopt a cute baby with no strings attached then yeah id need to be married id need references practically from the pope himself but i take kids when theres a problema reason they need closer supervision than even fosterparents can give if im willing to take a kid like martin whose mothers disappeared but who might surface at any minute in any state or nathan whose dad iswell like you saw him then theres not so much competition that youd notice references from the pope might be waived but youre a doctor part time she ventured in this town full time and part time as well then as her confusion became obvious he added its manageable i have a great housekeeper and the boys come with me a lot they come here traumatised caught up in their own dysfunctional worlds with me they see lots of other worlds many of them just as dysfunctional but i give them a solid base i give them rules and i give them a hug when they need one he broke off as the doorbell pealed again nathans head emerged from the kitchen looking fearful its okay nathe he said hop it ill deal with it nathan disappeared dom tugged the door wide it was charles six feet two blond and tanned wearing cream chinos a quality linen shirt with top buttons casually unfastened and soft leather boat shoes he really was absurdly handsome erin thought behind him in the driveway was his porsche sleek and handsome as he was charles was a general physician whose patients numbered some of the wealthiest people in melbourne he knew what he wanted in life did charles and he didnt like hiccups what was happening now was clearly a hiccup and it was the second hiccup in a week the first had been on tuesday when shed knocked back his very reasonable request to marry him erin he looked straight past dominic seeing only her his glance took her in from her bare toes to her hair still tangled and wet from the shower my god you said you werent hurt the crutches i cut my foot she said and managed a smile lots of little scratches theyll heal fast and i already look a lot better than i did last night charles this is dr dominic spencer he came to my rescue im very grateful charles said and gripped doms hand in what erin knew would be an exceedingly manly handshake not that there was any need if shed just phoned he was grateful as if he owned her what more did she have to say to cut herself loose i told you she explained when he turned on his reproachful look on her i lost my cellphone and by the time i got here it was three in the morning i didnt want to worry mum and dad theyre worried now charles said reproving crashing the carfor a dog honestly erin you know not to swerve for animals you know better than most what tragedy crashes can cause but i wont say anything if youre ready well leave well take a look at your car on the way see what we can salvage and ring the insurance people before we do anything that cars practically new i dont want it looted i dont want it looted the proprietary thing was automatic she should never have let it get this far she thought bleakly but it had happened so gradually she hadnt noticed according to charles her parents had always assumed theyd marry his parents had always assumed theyd marry so had charles it was only when hed suggested they break the news to the parents this easter and maybe take a family excursion to buy the ring that shed realised how far those assumptions had gone was marriage supposed to be like this an assumption that itd be good for all concerned so on tuesday shed tried to explain it but hed simply smiled at her like an avuncular big brother its only nerves its okay come home at easter and well discuss it she so nearly hadnt come but her parents were already staying with charless parents theyd been planning this easter for months theyd all be so upset charles was smiling at her waiting for an answer ready to start his very reasonable discussion again dom was watching from the sidelines itll hardly be looted where it is erin managed andumcharles theres also the problem of marilyn marilyn themy dog she gestured to marilyn on the floor behind her she was the one on the road last night im keeping her charles glanced at the dog and then glanced again in horror marilyn was rousing her intravenous line had provided her with fluids antibiotics and pain relief her puppies had drunk their fill and were now sleeping with a weary heave she stumbled to her feet dom had left a water bowl by her side she inspected it with caution looked up at the three humans watching her and then lowered her head to drink erin found she was grinning she glanced at dom and he was grinning too ill take the iv line out dom said sounding exceedingly satisfied shell want to go outside what charles said in a voice that said he didnt believe what he was seeing is that its the dog i was telling you about erin explained patiently she had puppies last night and im keeping her she repeated im keeping them all ignoring them dom dropped to his knees while marilyn drank he slipped the iv line out putting pressure on the entry point for a moment with a wad of clean tissues he tugged from his pocket what sort of a man carried an excess supply of tissues erin wondered a guy who was used to lifes messes a really sexy doctor who was used to lifes messes thats great dom said cheerfully as marilyn kept on drinking im thinking shell settle wherever you take her she was great this morning while i cleaned her sideshes a lovely placid pooch youll have to give the rest of the antibiotic orally but she should be fine youll have to give charles repeated faintly and stared at erin in horror youre kidding im not kidding erin said solidly i cant leave her here why not dom has enough on his plate he has kids kids like dogs charles said flatly i cant believe this you crashed the car for this hey dom said mind the insults you need to be wary of new mothers very hormonal he was still grinning laughing atcharles at her situation erin turned a shoulder to tell him what she thought of thatand tried to concentrate on charles i have to take her not to my parents you cant charles said bluntly mumd have kittens thatd add to the menagerie dom said still grinning your mother would have forty fits as well charles added and i cant imagine how peppy would react whos peppy dom asked interested great aunt peppy peppys my mothers poodle erin snapped she could do without the levity your parents and charless parents live together were having a family easter erin said trying not to soundstrained knowing she hadnt pulled it off our parents are old friends charless parents asked us all for easter thats great dom said and suddenly the laughter was gone his tone had turned implacable thats six adults to look after one dog and three pups two dogs if you count peppy behind him his phone started ringing can you excuse me i need to answer this then he glanced at marilyn who was lookingmeaningfullyat the door could you guys take marilyn out to the garden now shes off her iv line im thinking she might need a walk he carried his phone into the kitchen and closed the door walk right not so much a walk as a stagger erin thought for both of them she ignored charles for the momentshe was taking marilyn and there was nothing she could do to help him come to terms with the inevitable doms wellingtons were at the doorused she guessed for carting wood in the rain or something equally bucolic and messy this was where she was now she thought ruefully country and messy she hauled on the boots over her dressings and thenas charles still didnt moveshe limped to the stairs marilyn followed they struggled but both of them made it down the couple of shallow steps and onto the grass marilyn sniffed the grass in appreciation cast erin a look of what seemed to be gratitude and did what was expected last night in the dark and confusion and fear erin had thought the dog was fat now she saw the tooprominent ribs the sunken face the legs that trembled but the terror of the night was over marilyn turned her big ugly face up to the morning sun as if soaking in its warmth erin gazed down and felt her heart wobble last night it had seemed as if the world was endingfor her as well as for marilyn last night as the car had rolled for a long terrifying moment shed thought she might die marilyn had been close to death this morning the sun was glinting on the sea on both of their faces on their lives and here they were ready to start again for this dog life was about to change it must no matter what even if her own life changed in the process for that was how she felt right now it was as if shed never felt the sun on her face before like shed woken from a dream and found a new reality maybe she was being dumb fanciful but she looked down at marilyn and her resolution was absolute knocking charless proposal back was only the start of it hey she said softly and squatted on her heels in the soft grass it hurt a bit but her foot was nothing compared with what marilyn had been through youre a dog in a million shes not charles said from the veranda hed made no move to help he seemed toostunned erin get serious if this guy you mean dominic if this guy cant take her he cant hes the only doctor for the town and hes a single dad then she has to be put down charles went on inexorably you know that shes a stray no one wants her do you mind she put her hands over marilyns ears do you know what shes been through someone threw her out of their car all the more reason to do whats sensible he said and then softened his tone sweetheart i know youve had a rotten shock if this guy cant take the dog im not your sweetheart and i cant take the dog dominic was abruptly with them again pushing the screen door wide with a bang and striding down the steps with speed sorry but i need to go ive called a neighbour to come over and care for the boys but i cant wait ive had a calla kid with nut allergy jamies gone into anaphylactic shock theyre driving him to meet me can you stay with the boys until dulcie gets here he was heading for the garage at a run great to meet you both see you again some time anaphylactic shock erins mind switched into medical mode just like that if a childs reaction was severe this was what she did without making a conscious decision she found herself running not noticing her feet reaching doms car almost as he did im going too she yelled over her shoulder to charles can you look after marilyn and the two kids inside she slid into the passenger seat dom paused hand on the ignition what the hell you might need help go charles hes a doctor too he understands emergencies im an accident and emergency specialist i can help go dominic move chapter four he had help he shouldnt have let her come she was hurt herself he glanced across at her but she stared straight ahead her face determined like she thought he was going to stop the car and kick her out he didnt have time to argue but even if he wanted to she was another doctor last night hed had insight into this womans medical skills maybe it could make the difference in whether jamie sutherland lived or died okay he wasnt about to argue he had his phone in the car cradle now he phoned the ambulance in campbelltown requesting help then he concentrated on driving concentrated on what lay ahead tell me what were facing erin said into the silence he was speeding as fast as he dared without putting themselves in danger but his foot on the accelerator must tell its own story she knew this was life or death jamies eight years old hes had a couple of near misses last time it was from a friends mum making peanutbutter sandwiches not washing the knife and then making him a ham sandwich he nearly died this time hes eaten half a muesli bar his cousin told him it didnt have nuts in its chock full of em his parents have what they need they have adrenaline antihistamine and an action plan theyve done everything they can but they phoned from the car and i could hear him choking you wasted time ringing the neighbour i dont have a choice he said grimly martin and nathan arent safe on their own i would have it was quicker to phone dulcie rather than hope youd do it she fell silent but he could sense what she was thinking i dont know you he said at last i couldnt trust that of course you couldnt she shook her head as if convincing herself obviously trying to see the whole picture butif martin and nathan need such close supervisionif youre the only doctor for milesis it fair that you take on their care of course its not she blinked sorry but but nothing of course its not fair he repeated savagely they need a fulltime carer but theyve both come from such appalling backgrounds that no fosterfamily will take them you get nathan you get michael in your life as well and hes dangerous martins mother is just plain weird she only loves martin when hes sick so she tries to make him sick its munchausens by proxy syndrome he gets sick or is hurt she gets sympathy and attention martins starting to believe the way to affection is selfharm dreadful stuff so these kids stay with me or they go into juvenile detention because theres nowhere else secure enough for them to go youd take on these people if i have to to protect my kids thats crazy yeah he said and he thought shes right its crazy why the hell did he do it hes crazy she thought nuts dom was focused again on his driving on the road ahead on getting to where they had to be without killing them both shed never met such singleminded purpose he washe was umno back in your box she told herself feeling weirdly off key shed been off key all week she hadnt realised how close charles was to proposingshe hadnt figured how much their parents were depending on it these last few days had been shock enough without falling forfalling for whoa no i must have hit my head last night she thought everything before now seemed out of focus unimportant what was important was dom she could help him will you quit it with the staring he said and she caught herself sorry i was thinking thinking what what should she be thinking work of what lay before them of course how equipped are you i can do surgery in the middle of the road if i need to and i might just need to he said grimly we nearly lost him last time then he visibly braced himself and she could see he was slipping into a mode where he could work shed seen surgeons do this before a dicey operation push away the negatives go in full of confidence even if their hearts should be in their boots but hey its daylight so i dont need lights i have the gear i need and another doctor with meeven if her footwear does leave a bit to be desired who needs theatres and theatre staff then as if on cue another car came into view it had to be the people they were meeting erin thought the car came over the hump of the hill at such high speed the rear appeared airborne dom pulled off the road fast well off the sutherlands car was beside them in seconds brakes screeching a cloud of black smoke and burnt rubber left in its wake as it skidded dangerously onto the verge dom was out of his car and pulling open the back door of their car almost before it stopped erin followed and saw their patient on the back seat cradled in his mothers arms lay a child limp and bluedesperately ill erin only caught a fleeting glimpseenough to make her catch her breath in dismaybefore dom was blocking her view she wasnt here to look she was here to work dom had his medical case on the back seat of his car she hauled it out laid it on the grass and tugged it open searching for what she needed seconds later dom was laying the little boy down beside her his hand was on jamies neck trying to find a pulse yes he said so there was hope if there was still a pulsea little air must have been getting through until now but no longer the childs face was swollen his mouth was open as if hed been gasping for breath even without putting her fingers in his mouthas dom was doing nowshe could see his tongue was so swollen his airway must be blocked his chest didnt move trache she said into the stillness and dom nodded a tracheotomy was the only way theyd save him now scalpel and trache tube he snapped that was what she was here for she had what he needed out of the case ready before he finished the words and was tugging a swab package open with her teeth dom felt the little boys throat slowing a little acting with care the need was urgent but not urgent enough to risk cutting in the wrong place erins fingers held the swab waiting for dom to lift his hand behind her jamies mother started sobbing his dad had sunk to his knees on the verge and was pleading simply over and over please please please how many tracheotomies had dom performed shed done thembut then dom only had her word that she was who she said she was this was no time to verify her credentials if dom had looked unsure shed offer but doms bearing was of grim intent a man who knew what had to be done and wasnt about to hesitateor offer the procedure to someone he didnt knowwhen hesitancy could mean jamies life so she swabbed she set her hands on the sides of jamies head making sure he kept motionless and dom didnt falter he made a small neat slit in the central neck down to the trachea into the trachea he pressed the tube inand the thing was done but this was no guarantee of life jamies body was shutting down it had been two minutes maybe three since theyd arrived and she hadnt seen any sign of breathing hed ceased struggling dom leaned over and blew gently into the airway again and then magically jamies chest heaved all on its own air sucked into the tube without doms help sucked involuntarily by lungs that knew what they needed again and then the little boys eyes fluttered wide he stared up at dom in confusion and the start of panic dom tightened his hold so the airway couldnt shift out of position hey jamie he said firmly surely its okay mate you ate something with peanuts in it and your throats swollen weve popped in a tube to help you breathe its important to keep still until we get the swelling down this was one smart little boy and brave he stared up at dom and erin saw recognition she saw the moment when he decided to trust he breathed on all by himself his chest rose and fell rose and fell hed live she felt tears well behind her eyes unprofessional maybe she didnt care heres your mum and dad dom said keeping his voice calm and prosaic still holding jamie tight he raised his voice a notch talking to the woman behind him casey jamies breathing again your crying is scaring him rob can you tell your son hes going to be fine it was a command no matter how softly spoken and jamies bravery must be inherited jamies parents were themselves again in moments casey brushed tears fiercely away from her face she knelt beside jamie and took his hand no cuddling yet dom said but he was smiling lets keep jamie nice and still until his breathings settled you injected the adrenaline pen at home okay great i know it didnt work as well as we hoped but it gave us time erin can you prepare a syringe with light sedation are you a nurse casey asked her her eyes not leaving her sons face this is dr carmody dom said answering for her shes not like the doctors youve met before eh wellingtons must be the latest fashion for lady doctors do you reckon theyll take over from white coats theyre about as sexy dont you think it was light banter erin thought dom was talking them all down from horror herself included she was used to emergencies emergencies were what she did for a living but even in her city emergency department a case such as this where a child had come so close to death would shake her to the core she still needed to be professional she did not need to cry she never cried at work why the sudden urge now emotions hormones her world was shifting stupid fanciful undeniable jamie breathed on while erin administered light sedation she did it without conferring but dom watched her watched the dose she felt on trial a new kid in school desperate to please the big guy or not it was a fanciful way of thinking she was here to help not to think about what dom was thinking about her or to cry stupid stupid stupid and then at last the ambulance arrived two skilled paramedics took over they knew dom well she could see they respected him as well they might she thought jamie would need to spend the night in hospital until the swelling subsided theres no hospital here dom told her regretful we have a small one but with only one doctor we had to close it theres a paediatrician in campbelltown jamie will be in good hands they loaded jamie into the ambulance his mother went with him his dad followed behind driving the family car dom and erin were left alone standing on the verge of a country road with the debris of an emergency around them she still wanted to cry lets get you home dom said gently and she made a lastditch attempt to get herself together and found suddenly there was a wad of tissues in her hand im nnot ccrying she stammered i never cry i can see that he said and he wasnt smiling its just you had a really big night last night he paused thank you he said softly thankme you know we only had seconds the seconds you gave me here may well have made the difference thank you for being here its my pleasure erin said and subsided under her tissues trying not to wail its all my pleasure charles was waiting they didnt have to go into the house to find him he was out on the road standing beside his porsche looking angry uhoh erin said you want a medical defence dom pulled up behind the porsche he climbed out of the car before erin could do the same we saved a life he said before charles could speak erin was great but charless expression didnt relax given time to think to assess the crisis for what it was hed have offered to help himself but being left behind to play nursery maid would have made himwell like he was now did dulcie come dom asked yes he said shortly shes in the house with the boys thank you for helping out dom said and held out his hand it wasnt taken charles stared down at it like he didnt know what dom was offering i had to go charles erin said then thought damn that had sounded like pleading and why should she plead of course you did charles said obviously making an effort to sound pleasant so do we grab your things from the house get rid of that footwear and well leave with marilyn charless attempt at a smile faded you cant take the dog to my mothers house we wont stay on ill ask my parents to take us home you think your parents would let you keep the dog im not a kid hey why dont i go inside and make sure the kids are okay dom interjected looking mildly interested and nothing elseand erin fought off a need to grab his arm and say stay she didnt she was a big kid she almost felt grown up youre okay dom asked and that tiny gesture of caring suddenly had her feeling tears welling up again what was wrong with her she was turning into a wuss she sniffed loudly im fine she managed and he cast her a doubtful look and then nodded and headed for the house but when he reached the veranda he turned back i can find someone to drive you back to melbourne if you want he called erin didnt answer she couldnt trust herself to speak but melbourne sounded good marilyn aside she didnt want to go placidly with charles she didnt want her parentsand charless parentslooking reproachfully at her making her feel sorry for charles making her feel sorry for them shed had over twenty years of sorry surely that was enough sorry was doing her head in i mean it dom said and went inside and closed the door erin closed her eyes actuallythe way dom was making her feel was doing her head in erin what the hells going on charles said youre behaving like a child im not dont tell me no dont tell me she snapped enough im sorry youve all got the wrong idea youre my friend charles but youre not my lover and while i love my parentsand i love your parentsand i even love you in a way but not in the way you figure i shouldi need to get on with my life my life he was staring at her like shed suddenly turned green and sprouted horns she must have been really wimpy up until now she thought why had it taken so long to stand on her own two feet its this guy isnt it he demanded this is crazy its not dom i only met him last night and what im saying to you now has been coming for a while maybe its about twenty years overdue she took a deep breath okay thank you for coming to get me but im not coming with you i need to figure myself out first ill ring mum tonight meanwhile tell them im fine but i was put up last night by a doctor whos the sole medical professional for fifty miles id like to repay him by helping out with his kids and with his practice over easter if he doesnt want that then ill go back to melbourne with him he said him like he was referring to some sort of pond scum hedominicoffered to find someone to drive me to melbourne he didnt offer to drive me himself theres nothing between us charles how can there be she took a deep breath but despite thatdoms been wonderful hes aareally wonderful doctor i need to make the offer if he wants me im staying on when she came back inside dom was sitting in the kitchen munching on another of erins scones the kids were waving goodbye to dulcie from the back veranda dom glanced out the window and charless porsche was disappearing down the road what the hell hes gone without you he said warily you said there was someone who could drive me to melbourne she hesitated that is if you dont want me to stay hed been about to take a bite of his scone he didnt umif i dont want you to stay i sort of thought i might be useful she said sounding uncertain seeing tansys away if there are more emergencies if you want me to is this because of the dog she tilted her chin at that a gesture he was starting to recognise i have friends in melbourne whod take her in for a few days at least until im sorted but im offering to stay here for easter only if you can use me though i wont stay unless i can be useful she wanted to stay for easter the thought took his breath away there were all sorts of reactions dom ought to be feeling he ought to be furious shed landed not only her dog but also herself in his care he ought to be wary charless body language had been unmistakeably possesive there was no way he wanted to be landed in a domestic dispute and this had the makings of a doozy he ought to be cautious aboutwell about the way she was looking right now she was a qualified doctora colleaguebut she looked a waif and then he thought no she was wearing torn jeans and a stained windcheater shed ditched his boots by the door and was wearing a pair of his toobig socks what she looked was really extraordinarily beautiful but there was no room in his life for what he was thinking right now except he was thinking it what warmblooded male could help but think it so you wont kick me out she asked and her eyes warmed just a little as if she guessed his thought how could she you cook a mean hot cross scone he said cautious i can do all sorts of neat tricks she said mind im a bit restricted she sat down and held up a socked foot i think my dressings coming off ill redress it do you need a painkiller yes she said promptly painkiller first then dressing youre telling me how to practise medicine im bossy she retorted recovering spirit you need to learn that about me i plan to run a very efficient emergency department run i accepted the top job last week she tried not to sound cockyand failed he had to smile where melbourne east emergency how old are you he demanded astonished and it was her turn to grin how rude next youll be asking about my love life im assuming your love life is currently driving off in a huff and a porsche how insightful driving off into the sunset she sighed dont worry about it im sure ill make a great spinster id planned to keep cats but nowmaybe its bulldogs youre serious serious your boyfriends angry he is so not my boyfriend she said and glowered he sort of assumed he washe assumed all sorts of thingsand when i realised she shrugged sorry this is not your problem so he wasnt sure where this was going your plan is to help you she said if you admit you need help which seeing youre male might be difficult but if you try hard im thinking you might come round she smiled her smile was extraordinary this womans life whichever way he looked at it was in turmoil in the last twelve hours shed almost died shed been thrown into someone elses easter shed gained a dog and she seemed to have lost a perfectly good boyfriend and yet she could still smile he was feelingstunned he thought he was feeling like the wisest course was to get her out of here fast you have a house in melbourne i have a hospital apartment on the fourth floor so that means i guess i have to find another place to live youre swapping charles for marilyn hey im not living with charles she said im not even sleeping with him hes just assumed all sorts of things i wasnt assuming you know i suspect my lifes been leading up to this moment for years ive spent my life pleasing my parents pleasing my family pleasing charles then this week two shocks a proposal of marriage a neardeath car crash its enough to give any girl an epiphany an epiphany he said faintly yep umyou know that painkiller your foot really does hurt my foot really does hurt excellent when in doubt revert to priorities triage sore foot okay painkillers he said rising you want me to carry you to the surgery nope she said no more of that thank you very much if im to be stuck here for easter i intend to be independent fine he said and had to suppress a jab of disappointment lifting erin last night had beenan epiphany it wasnt anything of the sort he told himself it was simply because he was a male and she was a female and hed been alone too damned long of course his body would react likelike it really wanted to get to know erin better no she said and he blinked pardon um she blushed suddenly and he stared down at her fascinated no what he repeated and she blushed some more i didnti mean i was probably mistaken in what you were thinking but if im not she said fighting for recovery and becoming suddenly astringent if im not then definitely no lets get back to basics do you want me did he want her yes and yes and yes and enough of that too she said astringently you know very well what i meant do you want me as kid sitter dog minder and medical associate over easter yes he said and he wasnt saying a word more this woman saw too much then painkillers followed by lunch she said and then the boys and i might like to try making another batch of hot cross buns this time with yeast while you go and do your doctoring wherever you do your doctoring ive told the locals i cant come out at easter then do your doctoring in your surgery she told him or paperwork or something the boys and i will be in the kitchen youre free to do as you like and if i want to be in the kitchen thats your choice she said suddenly prim but im offering you freedom to get your work done its my thanks for having me and marilyn to stay if you want to throw a gift horse in the mouth i believe thats look sorry you dont throw gift horses he said and suddenly she was pink again he liked it he decided he really really liked it whatever she said sounding suddenly breathless same difference all im saying dr spencer is that youre free to do what you want treat me as your cook and child companion for easter and get on with your life yes maam he managed and put a hand down to help her up she stared at it appearing to consider then she slowly shook her head nope she said while were on platitudesi dont intend to jump out of any frying pan into the fire martin and nathan were back at the door looking hopeful boys can you help me up she turned her gaze away from his she waited until the little boys gave her a hand apiece and she let them haul her to her feet while dom looked on feelingjealous ridiculous but jealous all the same chapter five ever since tansy had told him she needed to take this time off dom had been dreading easter normally the boys would be at school and thered be other kids mothers he could call on to help but easternearly everyone was away or busy he had dulcie next door but dulcie had her brother and sisterinlaw visiting she could come in for a real emergency but otherwise he was on his own not only was he alone but the boys were bored their school friends were away he didnt have time to spend with them and these kids were high maintenance but then came erin after he redressed her foot she settled into the kitchen she downloaded hot cross bun recipes from the internet discussed their merits with the boys tried to figure why his might have failedconsensus was hed warmed the dough in a toohot ovenand then decreed she and the boys would try a recipe apiece luckily tansy kept the pantry well stockedwhen she saw it her face lit up ingredients yay so they made three versions of bun all of which worked they decidedto martins delightthat martins was best erins was second and nathans thirdbut they all ran rings round doms no question he agreed not even bothering to be offended he and the boys were filled to the rim with bun they squeezed a little soup in for dinner they checked and rechecked marilyn the boys chattered to erin like an old friend she had them entranced and he didnt blame them he was close to entranced himself he should go out to erins wrecked car and fetch her belongings hed found her a toothbrush and combas an emergency fostercarer he always had necessities on handbut she needed more a change of clothes would be good but the house was full of the smell of cooking and the sound of laughter and it seemed suchwell such a home that he wanted to stay it was an illusion he thought but he may as well enjoy it while it lasted the boys seemed mesmerised as well when it was finally time for bed they left erin with reluctance but they knew shed still be there tomorrow tomorrow was looking great it was so different from what hed expected hed seen six patients during the course of the daynone needing him to go out but each needing his full attention erin had turned the day around she was fantastic he thought returning to the kitchen after tucking the boys in a laughing cheerful sprite he swung open the kitchen door and she looked so sad he stopped in his tracks whats wrong he demanded involuntarily and she caught herself and dredged up a smile nothing sorry just thinking this is my thinking face it looks like your endoftheworld face thats a bit dramatic okay he conceded maybe its a justlostyourfianc√© face hes not my fianc√© she snapped he never was he just assumed he was he never told me though ive had boyfriends hes had girlfriends but of course hes always been around and when i was offered this new job he decided i was getting too career oriented it was time i knew where i stood hows that for romantic not very he said cautiously too right not very is it dumb to want violins nightingales fireworks exploding isnt that whats supposed to happen i guess you mean it hasnt happened for you either i think its you tell me it only exists in the pages of a romance novel i swear ill break down and sob she said darkly i know this true love things out there somewhere what about all those heroines out there dying of broken hearts or fading away of consumption is that what you want to do he smiled at her mournful expression if you do then maybe you need to cut down your intake of easter buns and now you mock my romantic heart it took only that she was smiling now butbehind the smilethered been real sadness when hed walked into the room hed seen it he didnt need to get emotionally involved this womans life was not his business he did not need to enquire any further erin must be tired he should tuck her into bed no whoops dangerous he should order her to bed but his gut feeling was telling him the minute she was alone that face would return so despite misgivings he stayed erin was sitting by the stove resting her feet on a footstool he moved to stand beside her back to the fire a position he loved he couldnt think of a thing to say she wasbeautiful unaccountably stupidly he wanted to touch her he wanted to run his fingers through her curls tilt her face to his kiss away her sadness inappropriate inappropriate inappropriate he needed to get this on some sort of doctorpatient level he decided after all thats what she was shed come to his house looking for medical help and hed provided it so to kiss her now no your family and charless family areclose he ventured at last do you mind just enquiring there seems to be lots of undercurrents im not getting im sniffing dysfunction dysfunctional families are my specialty you want tea sure she said and watched him as he heated the teapot havent you heard of teabags they dont work as well he said for dysfunction my familys not dysfunctional you know im a parttime dad he said these kids are on loan while their families sort themselves out but i still manage to get pretty close if one of them sent word that hed crashed his car i might be tempted to find out for myself what was going on it seems to me that your parents depended on charles to report in as far as i know they havent even phoned im almost thirty so when do you stop caring they do care right there was a long pause he measured in scoops of tea with care she eyed the pot with caution they do she repeated at last they care very much it seems theyre delighted im marrying charles i thought you werent im not but according to charles they think i am dom yes are you a complete paragon what do you mean charles is verycontrolled she said hed say drinking tea is really sensible right now you dont want tea i ought to want tea its very sensible of you to suggest tea but youd rather whisky she said promptly failing that a glass of red but thenyou probably disapprove work of the devil he said and loved the look on her face sorry she said meekly of course but if you could make do with some really excellent cognac her face changed again she was totally transparent he tried not to laugh butshe was making him laugh inside it was an extraordinary sensation you have cognac she demanded for medicinal purposes only three times a day before meals or three glasses before bedtime whichever suits the patient yes please she breathed this patient needs medicine now so they drank cognac they also talked shop medicine was the easiest safest thing to talk about theyd been to the same medical school four years apart how come hed never noticed her mind his head had been so far into books back then that he might not have noticed she was ambitious shed been one of the youngest graduates ever and shed gone into emergency medicine i love it she said pure adrenaline but you dont get to know your patients no no emotional stuff that way you dont like emotional stuff ive had enough emotion to last me a lifetime you want to explain he asked and she shook her head and stared into the depths of her cognac she fell silent he didnt mind he even liked it she was a restful woman warm and funny but there were depths he could only guess at shed used the comb hed found her to good purpose her hair was lovely tumbling around her shoulders in soft curls more and more he wanted to reach out and touchreach out and kiss no no and no and no i lost my brother and sister she said bluntly and her bald statement shook him out of his not so appropriate thoughts how they were killed when i was four he had the impression she was trying to figure things out and he could listen or not sarah was seven and connor was nine charless father was driving charles was in the front seat charles was nine as wellhe and connor were friends a truck ran a red light sarah and connor were in the back seat and were killed instantly im so sorry he said not knowing what else to say i was too little to figure it out she said i just remember people crying crying for years really and then every family function since charles and his parents have been there ouch a psychologist could have a field day with this one so tonighttheyll all be distressed she whispered theyll be sitting round not knowing what to think but while you were putting the kids to bed i tried to ring and mum was so upset she wouldnt talk to me now charles will be explaining ive had a shock and ill come to my senseshell see to it and my parents will listen to him theyll leave me alone to figure things out on about easter sunday charles will appear again and be reasonable and have a very sensible plan as to what to do with marilyn what to do with me her voice wobbled he didnt get into this sort of emotion butas if it had a life of its own his hand moved to rest gently on her hair she put her hand up and covered his it was okay he could do this it feltright she needed this he knew it what he didnt understand so much was why he felt as if he needed it too the urge for moreto take her in his arms to kiss her was still there but it was supplanted comfort was okay more than okay actually the warmth in this tangible link was so strong it left him feeling that something was being forged that was really important something he wasnt sure existed dom she said at last softly mmm she pulled her hand away and maybe it was his imagination but he was sure there was reluctance she had to move on they both did i reckon marilyn and her pups would be more comfortable in here by the stove she whispered then she tried again and she had her voice back it made him wonder if the contact theyd had was disturbing her shed needed to get back to sensible practical if we popped them in the corner theyd be out of the way they cant stay in the hall all easter you want to cart them in i guess so she sat by the stove and superintended while he made up a dogbed gently he lifted each tiny pup across to the new bed letting marilyn see exactly what he was doing as the last puppy was taken away from her marilyn heaved a doleful sigh hauled herself to her feet and lumbered across to her new bed this felt okay too dom thought he was surrounded by domesticity and for once it didnt scare him he ought to go to bed hed been up since dawn and there was no guarantee he wouldnt be disturbed again during the night but he didnt want to leave the kitchen he didnt want to leave erin so tell me about you she murmured and he thought no he should go not a lot to tell yeah there is you finished med school four years before i did were your parents proud ruby stood in the front row at my graduation and cried like her heart was breaking ruby my fostermother so your real mum and dad disappeared years ago he said i havent heard from my mother since i was eight my birth father was arrested for armed robbery six years ago i read about it in the papers but i only knew him by name which explains why you take in fosterkids maybe it does he said repressively did you always want to be a doctor yeah why he shrugged and then he thought why the hell not tell it like it is we moved towns a lot when i was a kid he said my mother wasnot exactly stable he shrugged she believed in love at first sightwhich meant we followed loser after loser finally there was a night he hesitated then decided there were still places he didnt want to go anyway it was what the cops call a domestic the police came there were neighbours shouting lots of stuff going on and in the middle of it all the doctor arrived a nice greyhaired old man who surveyed the mess then came straight for me i remember i was hiding under some hydrangeas in the corner of the garden it was like he knew i had to be there he came under the bushes he told me id had enough that hed take care of my mum from now on and then he put me in his car and took me to ruby i should have been taken in by child welfare i should have been formally assessed instead half an hour later i was by rubys firestove drinking mugs of hot chocolate while ruby and the doctor talked about what colour socks hed like her to knit him and who was going to win the football that week he sounds wonderful erin said in a voice that was suddenly none too steady they both were he said doc roberts and ruby extraordinary people i cant touch them for kindness but i can take in the odd waif as payback how long have you taken in waifs since i found tansy he said i was looking for a country practice i wanted one where there was less work than there is here but i came to the interview before i realised how remote it was tansy was on the panel that interviewed me i mentioned i wanted space in my life to foster kids and i wanted a big house about two minutes later i had this place and a livein housekeeper so shes bossy shes great he hesitated feelingexposed really exposed but what about you he demanded and his voice came out rougher than hed intended why did you decide to be a doctor i dont think i ever had a choice two parents one kid where there should have been three actually four parents she said for charless parents might as well have been my own it was always assumed wed do great things charless parents knew he was going to be a doctorthough maybe thats unfair charles certainly wanted to be one i got carried along for the ride but you like it i love it she said and the dispirited tone gave way to sudden enthusiasm i never thought i would but i do mind theyre all desperately unhappy that ive chosen to work in emergency medicine rather than one of the status specialties they think its an aberration some day soon ill settle to something more worthwhile an aberration he said and turned and looked at marilyn you and your dog aberrations both what a thing to say suddenly she smiled and damn there was that feeling in the depths of his gut again it was the loveliest smile she was the loveliest woman but she was tired the smile faltered almost as it appeared she yawnedand marilyn yawned in sympathy he smiled at the pair of them bed he said marilyns in hers ill carry you to yours no need i can manage she grabbed the crutches hed found for her and struggled to her feet no she said as he made a move to help her thank you dominic she said gently youve been great he didnt feel great it nearly killed him to stay still and watch as she struggled out of the room but somehow he did goodnight he said softly and she turned and smiled goodnight dom she whispered and thank you she was gone the kitchen felt bleak for her going which was nonsense he made a desultory effort to clear dishes he moved marilyns water bowl so she could reach it and then as she stirred he thought okay maybe it was time so he picked her up and carried her outside she was moving herself now but it filled a need to carry someone erin for preference but marilyn was all that was on offer so he stood in the cool night air and waited until marilyn completed her toileting it was restful out under the stars he should feel peaceful hell he didnt erin was settling into bed right through that window erin marilyn was sniffing the grass licking up the dew raising her head and smelling new smells she looked battered and exhausted yet profoundly grateful for this momentfor the ability to smell the night air before going back to her pups lifes okay he said gently and from the veranda came a response it looks okay from this angle too he turned and erin was watching him from under the porch lights she was lovely mindblowingly lovely you need to be in bed he said and felt dumb so do you so whats stopping us he lifted marilyn again and carried her up the steps the big dog looked up at him with an expression of something akin to devotion hey dont look at me like that he told her doc carmody heres the one who saved you and you saved us both erin smiled at him and there it was again gut lurch enough with the dog time for a little exercise rehabilitation the door was open he set marilyn down she waggled her butt and staggered toward the door erin made a sharp move to clear a path but then it was her turn to stagger she wobbled dangerously on her crutches and dom made a dive he caught her shoulders her crutches clattered to the floorand he was left holding her its either one or tother of us she said sounding suddenly breathless me and marilyn your walking wounded or not walking you want me to carry you to bed i dont think thats a good idea why not i suspect you know why not she said with a hint of asperity youre too near youre too male and you dont have a wife upstairs as chaperone pity about that im sure you miss her madly she said but she didnt pull away i dont need anyone where had that come from the situation had been light suddenly it was intensely personal im sure you dont she said softly whereas ii need all sorts of people soso when does tansy come back her daughter had her baby last weekend maybe a couple of weeks i cant stay for a couple of weeks of course you cant i should have gone with charles you decided not to i did i wanted to help you she sighed fat lot of help i am you did help you are helping his hands stayed on her shoulders shed have to pull away if she wanted him to move and she wasnt pulling she might even be leaning in he tugged her in a little bit further nice dom im sorry i offloaded onto you she said softly against his chest it wasnt fair youve done so much for me and here i am keeping you from bed asking for sympathy when youve got so much else on i dont have enough what sympathy im not sure he said looking down at her in the moonlight i suspect sympathy is the least of it me too she said unexpectedlysuddenly tentative theres not a lot of sympathy happening from where im standing i knew i had to apologise now i have soso maybe we could move on a thought was occurring an excellent thought maybe shared maybe crazy maybe not regardless this was a thought worth airing so if i were to kiss you and amazingly she smiled and nodded a decisive little nod almost businesslike itd probably do us both the world of good like a tonic a tonic he was losing the thread something castor oilish something to give us both a decent purge reassure us were okay youre asking me to kiss you or book you in for a colonoscopy take your pick ive imposed on your hospitality its up to you to name the price she grinned and raised her face she jutted her chin in what he suspected was a gesture of defiance to whom to charles to her whole history if its not too much trouble its definitely not too much trouble he said faintlyand then stopped speaking he had better things to do chapter six it didnt quite work he wasnt holding her tight enough she slipped a little as their lips met his mouth brushed hers too briefly and the kiss landed off centre she pulled back just a little whoops whoops it wasnt just his kiss that was off centre im sorry she said then eyed him sideways im sorry im strung up tight as a stradivarius string stradivarius violin you dont play no thank god for that you dont like violins when other people play theyre fine but my parents dream of me playing when my music talent is more suitable fori dont knowbongo drums funny interesting excellent dinnerparty conversation except they werent at a dinner party they were right here right now she might seem sure of herself this woman but talking violins when there was kissing to be donethat was nerves are we getting distracted im a bit nervous she conceded kissings much easier than playing a violin he assured her and before she could think of anything else to say any other way to distract himhe tugged her tighter he centred her so this time he couldnt missand he kissed her again better didnt even begin to describe it better better and better you didnt get to be thirtyfive without learning how to kiss even though serious relationships werent on his agenda hed had some very satisfactory frivolous onesbut nothing had prepared him for this not for the way she made him feel it was like hed been zapped by an electric charge if he could see himself in a mirror maybe his hair would be standing on end he thought with the tiny amount of head room he had available for analysis which wasnt much and what was available was getting less by the second hed expected a kiss but this was akiss from the moment his mouth met hers nothing was as it had been nothing was as it should be what was that word discombobulated hed never used it he needed it now for his thoughts were whirling jumbled out of kilter his senses were centred solely on the fire inside the fire this woman was creating his brain felt shortcircuited circuits zapped and overlaid by sensations hed never felt before this was a need he didnt know he had she was melting into him and he was on fire she was surrendering herself to him and it was the most exquisite giftthe most lifeaffirming generosity her beauty stunned him his hands caressed the small of her back and he thought hed never known a woman as beautiful her breasts were melting against his chest and it was as if she was merging into him two bodies becoming one fused by fire her surrender was total as his hands moved to her hips and tugged her closer he felt her rise to meet him standing on tiptoe so her thighs were against his he was responding with a fire he hadnt known he possessed she was the loveliest thing the most beautiful woman and amazingly she was opening herself to him wanting him with a desperation that belied description but desperation the word clanged into his head unwanted uncalled for but suddenly there loud and clear he had an armful of the most desirable woman in the world but suddenly the instinctive knowledge of her despair was overwhelming once thought it couldnt be unthought she was letting herself sink into him to prove something to herself that had nothing to do with him how he knew it he couldnt say but all of a sudden it was fact and the effect turned fire to ice how the hell he managed to stop to pull away he never knew but somehow he did he put her far enough so that he could look down into her eyes and see if the word hed thought had any reality it did she was gazing up at him her eyes softly luminous trying to smile but there was confusion behind her smile her lip looked bruised he thought had he kissed her so hard she put her hands up to his head to tug him down to her again but the sight of those bruised lipsof the confusion behind her smilehad him shaking his head no nno his pause had shaken her he saw her bewilderment increase and it was almost his undoing she was here for the taking she was a grown woman a colleague who was surely old enough to know her own mind but still that word desperation erin why are you doing this what id take you to my bed in a heartbeat he said softly into her hair wanting desperately to increase the hold but i know youre in trouble and im not sure youre kissing me for the right reasons it was like tossing cold water over her she pulled back a little she gazed up at him for a long bewildered moment and then slowly she tugged away he released her with all the regret in the world i dont know what you mean she managed but he could see that she did youre injured he said softly youve come here as my patient no you came here last night because there was a sign on my front gate that said doctor didnt you of course i did she managed but that doesnt mean i think it does mean youre hurt you came here for treatment and for refuge for me to take advantage youre not taking advantage dom you make me feel yeah well you make me feel too he said ruefully i do nothing but feel when i hold you when i kiss you but youre an emotional mess i am not it was said with such indignation that he almost laughed okay youre not so blame it on me i dont want to feel like you make me feel its not that im not flattered flattered she said astounded what man wouldnt be flattered so youre taking what just happened asa compliment she gazed at him incredulously youre not gay i suppose no so my pride has to take it on the chin its got nothing to do with pride oh yes it does she said bitterly here i was practically launching myself into your arms i believe i did some of thelaunching well bully for you she sighed a great gusty sigh that stunned him she was like a chameleon changing skins with mood okay maybe it was a bad move she closed her eyes moved on so lets forget it ever happened shall we youll still let me stay for easter of course i will thank heaven for that my noble host just when i want a hot one im sorry she managed a smile at that and now the man apologiseswhere were you when i was planning my life no she said and put her hands up as if to ward him off dont answer you were adopting kids being noble doing all sorts of stuff i can scarcely dream of you rescued marilyn he reminded her that has to count as noble so i did but it doesnt put me in your league nope youre a wonderful man dr spencer and i admire you immensely as one doctor to another and youre right we need to keep this professional soas patient to her treating doctoror even as colleague to colleaguei need to go to bed goodnight and without another word she turned and limped inside down the hallway to her makeshift bedroom leaving dom staring through the screen door after her feeling like there was no way in the wide world he could forget the events of this night feeling like his world had changed for ever how was a girl supposed to sleep after that she couldnt she lay and stared at the ceiling and thought of all the reasons why she should ring her parents and ask them to come and fetch her they would they were upset with her now but they knew their duty theyd be appalled by marilyn but if she insisted theyd take her theyd drive her back to their own home on the outskirts of melbourne theyd be dreadfully upset at having their easter plans spoiled but maybe their easter plans had been spoiled anyway maybe charles had already hinted that easter was to be the time of the big announcement and here she was falling in love with another man falling in love that was dumb crazy dom had pulled away because hed sensed shed felt desperate and maybe he was right desperation confusion call it what you would confusion thats what it was because shed never before felt like she felt when dom smiled at her when hed kissed her it was like her world had blown apart it had scared her terrified her shed felt like she was teetering on the edge of a cliff and about to fall into what she didnt know dom didnt wantpermanence hed said that loud and clear neither should she shed met the guy for the first time less than twentyfour hours ago it was way way too soon when then when was the first proper time that she could open her eyes and say shed fallen head over heels in love with dominic how was a man expected to go calmly to sleep dom lay in his toobig bed and thought maybe he ought to trade it for a single hell he had no use for a double much less the kingsized opulence he lay in now hed bought it thinking of ruby how early mornings had been a contest to see who could dive into rubys lovely squishy bed first but hed never got it right he might do his damnedest as a fosterdad but ruby had something special erin had something special she was as confused as he was his family had been nonexistent a scattering of dysfunctional people vaguely connected by blood but nothing else erins extended family sounded much scarier he thought of the battered little boys in his care and he thought of erin being raised with the ghosts of siblings he wasnt sure which was worse what would be worse though he told himself would be complicating his life by hitting on her when he had no intentionno capacityto take it further why not a spot of seduction maybe even progressing to thinking about love love for some reason that was what he was thinkinghe whod never had such a thought before but he was thinking it of loving erin was he nuts what would he end up with a woman torn by guilt raised to be duty bound to two sets of parents and a man who regarded her as rightfully his did charles want her as much as he did it was a dumb question the whole situation was impossible hed made a vow a long time ago when hed been used as a bitter connection a rope in domestic tugs of war where neither his mother nor his string of stepdads had worried that he might snap domestic harmony was for othershe wasnt even going to try hed had the odd relationshipwho hadnt until now hed never wanted to push it an inch further than a casual affair so why was erin different because she was damaged he told himself fiercely he saw in her the same need he saw in his boys maybe even in himself but need was no basis for a relationship she was here as his guest using him for refuge therefore he had to apply the same rules he applied to his boys all care but no ties so when they left there was no heartbreak on either side and as for the love wordwhen hed known her for such a short timethat was being no better than his mother love at first sight was a crazy ideal leading to heartbreak all round right he had that clear maybe tomorrow he could drive her to her parents place himself or not probably not shed offered to help he needed help there was a very sensible reason for him to accept her offer it was sensible for her to stay yeah right she slept badly dozing and waking dozing and waking once she heard dom pad downstairs and let marilyn out into the garden he was a very nice man she told herself dreamily in her halfsleep she listened to him leading marilyn back to her pups then speak softly she couldnt hear but she was willing to bet there wasnt any mention of dog pounds if she was seriously interested dom with his needy kidsmarilyn and her needy pups dom she was seriously interested dumb or not maybe i need to go to the antarctic for a year she muttered i can hone my skills with frostbite and hypothermia and everyone can need me solely because i wield a great roll of sticky plaster buthow could she go the antarctic when there was the faintest possibility of a repeat of that kiss dumb or not she was staying right where she was for as long as dom let her easter saturday dom was coolly pleasant at breakfast if he could be coolly pleasant she could too she decided he didnt say anything about leaving and if he didnt neither would she even though hed told the locals he wasnt doing calls he was still the only doctor in the district patients arrived with the minor trauma of a country community the phone never stopped she ended up fielding callsand enjoying it youve had a sore knee for months dr spencer will be happy to see you but not until tuesday hes busy right now actually the doctor was examining puppies when that call came doms vetfriend fiona had found an excuse to drive over and check for herself that her instructions had been carried out dom and the elderly vet were checking each individual pup erin had been the one closest to the phone and dom seemed okayeven gratefulthat she answer it she glanced through to the kitchen as she replaced the receiver dom looked a querydoctor examining patients while stretched out on the kitchen floor in front of woodstove he smiled at her her heart did a silly backward somersaultand she was suddenly even more determined to stay any more determined theyd soon have to prise her out of here with a chisel she thought superglue had nothing on how she was starting to feel after fiona left at doms suggestion they took a family drive no make that a communal drive she corrected herself this was not a familymum and dad in the front and kids in the back regardless they headed out to her crashed car yesterday her feet had been too sore she had been too shocked and marilyn had needed supervision but she really wanted her clothes in the daylight the crash scene looked appalling shed been dead lucky she and the boys watched as dom climbed down the river bank and retrieved her overnight bag from the trunkand her cellphone and her shoe a good scrub and itll be good as new he said handing over a bloodstained mudsoaked trainer yum she said taking the shoe gingerly he grinned again and there it was slam backward somersaultwith pike this time they returned to the house dom saw a couple more patients she tried not to think about that grin she answered the phone and she baked there was something really therapeutic about baking on a firestove she couldnt figure what it was but her foot felt better every minute she spent there the little boys loved it too she was getting comfort as well as giving it she thought watching them wrap themselves round meatloaf and apple pie for lunch dom asked for a second helping of pie he smiled againand wham this had to stop it was making her dizzy she was out of her depth diving too hard too fast and not knowing where she was going she met doms gaze and his smile faded hes just as confused as i am she realised and the idea wasunsettling dom was clearly unsettled he took himself back to his surgery to catch up on paperwork he had too much work to do far too much for one doctor an idea was seeding in the back of her brain she refused to give it countenance it was too soon way too soon concentrate on the kids she told herself concentrate on anything but the way doms smile made her feel and this tiny germ of an idearidiculous martin was quiet passive they played scrabble and did a jigsaw puzzle and martin grew quieter nathan helped her cook corn fritters for dinner but martin watched silent then they settled down with books in front of the livingroom fire finally dom joined them he had a couple of kids books to read out loud nathan enjoyed them but martin was getting quieter she was flicking through a magazinethis months family doctor riveting stuff she could sort of read while she sort of watched martin looked strained why she watched dom who was clearly worrying about him at eight he lifted martin from where hed been drooping by the fire he took nathans hand and bade her goodnight youre coming back down she asked startled and he shook his head i have a lot of medical journals to catch up on so catch up on them here its distracting here he said gently i cant afford to be distracted ouch but weve really appreciated your help today dom said still in that gentle reasonable voice that made her want to hit him havent we boys yes nathan said definite but martin burrowed his face into doms shoulder and didnt say anything erin cooks great meals doesnt she dom said pressuring martin to respond there was a faint sniff miserable shes like my mum oh heck whatever was going on in this little boys background one thing stood out he missed his mother with all his heart those four words had been a cry like from a little boy lost i know you do dom said softly and he looked at erin over martins head and gave his own head an imperceptible shake meaning theres nothing she could do to help there wasnt she watched them go upstairs and she ached she wanted to help so much it hurt shed been here for a day what right did she have to mess with these peoples lives what right did she have to ache to be a part of theirs she remade her settee she went out and said goodnight to marilyn she climbed into bed and tried to sleep it was too early there was too much in her head like how to get close to this little family like who was tansywhere did she fit like how much dom needed her like how one guy could cope with such a medical practice and still have time for these kids over and over the image of dom played in her headthe sight of him comforting martin the memory of him smiling at her that morning when hed been examining the puppies the way he was justdom she sat up and read about six of the kids books trying to get herself tired she lay down again and watched the flames dom dom dom dom she was going nuts she put her head under her pillow and groaned finally she slept but when she slept she dreamed of dom she woke up to fire chapter seven maybe the fireplace was smoking it was her first thought but it was fleeting the fire in the hearth was almost deada soft glow of coals and nothing more but the smell of smoke had intruded on her halfsleep and marilyn was barking she stumbled out of bed worried and the fire alarm started as she reached the door she flung open the door into the hall the faint smell of smoke became a thick wall of fog and the scream of the smoke alarm became almost deafening from the kitchen marilyn let out a yowl of distress but the smoke wasnt coming from the kitchen either it was billowing down from the top of the stairs the security lights on the stairs and in the entrance were showing a faint sheen of smoke around her feet but at head height the smoke was already so thick she could scarcely see dom she screamedentirely without need when the fire alarm was doing her screaming for her she hit the stairs two at a time forgetting about her injured feet forgetting everything except that dom and the boys were somewhere in the midst of the source of the fire dom the cry was from one of the kids a terrified scream high and filled with horror she was at the landing now her hand on the balustrade feeling her way rather than seeing and then the smoke swirled back and dom was there an armload of child was thrust at her nathan she clung and steadied and dom was already invisible ring emergency services he snapped from the gloom get nathan outside and the dog i need to find martin he was gone she staggered down the stairs again carrying nathan he had his arms round her neck holding on as if his life depended on it sobbing with fear as she hit the flat surface of hall she staggered a little with the weight of him and he clung tighter still she groped for the phoneshe had a clear idea where it was now which was just as well as the smoke was so thick shed never have found it by sight fire she snapped into the phone without waiting to hear the operator ask leading questions she gave ten seconds of curt directions repeat it she ordered with the same efficiency she used with interns when she had to make sure they understood in an emergency marilyn was whining agitated in the kitchen erin shoved open the door the dog pushed her nose against her leg and then headed back to her pups we need to get us safe she said to nathan trying to figure what to do next somewhere upstairs were dom and martin but by the way nathan was clinging and sobbing she knew he wouldnt let her go ill take you onto the veranda no nathan whimpered but there was no time for sympathy she should take nathan outside leave him then go to help dom but she knew hed come back in after her and marilyn was clearly a dog in panic okay she had to let dom take care of martin as best he could until she had nathan safe the only way to get nathan safe was to anchor him anchor him to marilyn anchor marilyn with the puppies she bent over the pups setting nathan firmly on the floor beside her nathan hold my shirt and dont let go she snapped before he could clutch her round the neck again dont move away from me im picking up the puppies she tugged marilyn away from the pups and before marilyn could react she gathered pupsbed includedagainst her she now had an armload of blanket and pups a little boy clutching her shirt and marilyn making a herculean effort to jump up and get to her babies and there was smoke she was struggling to breathe without gagging she wanted to hold her shirt over her mouth but she had no hands left lets go she muttered and headed out the door in seconds she was out on the front veranda with nathan towed behind her and marilyn leaping anxiously about her feet the relief to find herself outside was almost overwhelming she kept going over the grass well away from the front door near the gate she allowed herself to pause dom dom dom she found herself saying swinging round to face the house and hoping against hope he was following the lights in the upstairs windows flickered and went out the power was gone at least she couldnt see flames there was an almost full moon in a cloudless sky and the house was a great unlit shape no flames you need to stay here she told nathan and he whimpered and clung but she put him away from her mustering strength before she started to speak if she sounded scared there was no use expecting courage from him she laid the puppies on the ground by the gate marilyn whined her distress and started doing a maternal tongue count i have to help dom bring martin out she said to nathan keeping her voice flat inflexionless like this was a completely normal scenario but marilyn has to stay here can you put your hand in her collar and not let her move until i get back she tucked his hand under the dogs frayed collar promise you wont let her go she might still think theres a puppy inside and run in after me its too smoky inside to be safe youll come back of course ill come back she gave him a swift hard hug with dom and martin but youre in charge of marilyn and puppies can i trust you yyes youre great nathe she said erin mmm will you save the easter eggs too the smoke had increased so much it was terrifying it was a thick flat wall oozing out the door stinking gritfilled and dreadful she got three feet inside the front door and backed out shed make it maybe ten feet without a plan if that plan right like wait until the fire brigade arrive and men in uniform take over not an option she leant on the wall of the front veranda and took three four lungfuls of cleanish air and then decided what were lungs if not to be used dom she screamed at the top of her voice dom nothing hed hardly be able to scream back if he was in the pall of smoke inside so think layout of house she hadnt been upstairs apart from that one brief foray to get nathan she was going to have to feel her way she hauled back and checked the upstairs windows again no orange glow lots of smoke she could contend with that the downstairs bathroom was right next to the front door head there first and wet towels no wool would be better back into the sitting room blankets she was back beside her makeshift bed almost before she thought it grabbing blankets feeling her way back out into the bathroom tossing the blankets into the shower turning on the tap then getting herself back outside for another couple of lungfuls of air while the blankets soaked stay nathan she breathed but there was no time to check he was following directions she was inside again hauling sodden blankets out from the shower draping them over her head then groping her way along the hall toward the stairs underneath the dripping blankets she could at least breathe and she managed to call dom dominic erin the call ending on a choked cough had her feeling her way up the stairs again clinging to the balustrade blind under her canopy of wet wool dom he was on the top step crouching as she was she almost fell as her feet came into contact with his solid presence a hand came out and caught her ankle she was crouched low but now she sank even further her hands seeking contact her hands met his fingers clasping momentarily in the gloom registered the wetness great forethought dr carmody he managed the words coming out as a hoarse choking gasp i have two she tugged one of the sodden blankets from her shoulders he grabbed it hauled it over himself i cant find him he breathed theres only tansys room left stay here im coming dont be stupid but stay here unless it gets so bad you cant breathe at all i might need help carrying he didnt waste further breath he was gone leaving her to wait and wait maybe it was only seconds but it was the longest wait of her life crouched at the head of the stairs not knowing the layout of the house knowing if she moved dom might well end up hunting for her hearing the first crackle of flames terror and then dom was there magically hauling her wet blanket up pushing a limp body into her arms martin ii cant dom stuttered i needa minute go get him out he was out from under her blanket leaving martin behind and she heard him beside her choking lungs desperate for air hed come from the seat of the fire she thought if she was struggling to breathe the fact that dom had managed to haul the child to her was nothing short of miraculous they couldnt relax yet martin was limply unconscious she hauled him close under her blanket smoke was pouring through go dom muttered you follow she gasped and as he didnt move she struck out with her foot kicking so hard she heard him gasp in pain you follow or im not moving dont you dare give in move she could do no more she was sliding down the stairs clasping martin to her bumping on her backside afraid to stand not knowing what was in front or what was behind not knowing if dom was able to follow but knowing only she had to get outside before she lost consciousness how many stairs she sagged and something hit her in the small of the back dom was behind her i can take him now he muttered im okay pigs might fly she managed and focused on the next step the knowledge that dom was right behind her was enough to get her down the last three stairs into the hall she fell sideways on the last stair rolled tugging martin with her and kept going hauling him out through the front door and onto the veranda she couldnt stop she couldnt wait for dom even here it wasnt safe the smoke was billowing outward a tunnel of acrid poison she was blind still unable to remove her blanket she shoved herself sideways away from the door tugging the dead weight of the child along with her one last tug and she was over the side of the veranda dropping the eighteen inches or so into the flower bed below out of the path of the smoke out into clean clean air martin fell with her still ominously limp oh martin she was sobbing with fear and desperation she tugged him free of the bushes so she could assess clearly what was happening she searched for a pulse it was there and suddenly it wasnt one part of her was blinded by panic horror struck terrified for dom as well as for martin the rest of her was moving into medical mode checking airway shifting the little boy into a position where she could work youre going to live she muttered fiercely dom didnt save you for nothing she pinched his nose put her mouth over his and breathed until his chest rose one breath fifteen pumps on his chest hard fierce determined breathe damn you breathe but she didnt have the strength to say it she bent again and breathed hard filling those small lungs then shifted to thump again ill do it and miraculously dom was there edging her aside so he could work on martins chest ill do cpr he croaked you keep breathing it was like a gift from heaven dom was safe dom was with her one life safe one to go please they had much more chance of succeeding with two of them shed have more clear air in her lungs than dom did she acknowledged although surely she must be stronger than he was right now how could he have the strength to perform cpr if youre not risking cracking ribs youre not thumping hard enough it had been one of her first lectures but dom was thumping hard enough strongly and steadily as if he had all the energy he needed and then some breathe thump thump thump there was a desperate whimper from behind her nathan it was too dark too smoky to see but she could hear his terror nathe she managed between breaths can you look down the road to see if the fire brigade is coming then stay with marilyn to stop her getting frightened were okay there was a grunt of approval from dom but there was room for nothing else breathe thump thump thump breathe thump thump how was he doing it the man had almost died himself for him to give martin to her at the head of the stairsshe had no doubt hed been feeling close to the edge himself people did extraordinary things under pressure stories came back to hermothers lifting cars off their children running when running was otherwise impossible life or deaththe threat gave superhuman abilities the need to perform a miraclethat was what they needed a miracle she breathed again cupping the little boys chin tilting it pushing the breath down hoping hoping and thena tiny gasp a jerk a cough his eyes fluttered open martin dom said in a voice she didnt recognise dom the little boy faltered and then he was thickly splendidly ill and suddenly it was over the threat was past there was nothing more for her to do dom was supporting his fosterson tugging him in against him cradling him so he couldnt choke soothing holding holding nathe she called into the dark and nathan came flying back to her hey she said and tugged the little boy into her own arms these two are going to be okay weve rescued each other and then she hugged him so hard she thought she might break one of his ribs and dom was reaching out to touch her she hauled herself closer tugging nathan close with her and they sat in a huddle of mess and soot and smoke and she thought shed never felt happier and when marilyn appeared through the mists of smoke signifying her presence by a slurp to the face she grabbed her too and the dog was enveloped in their sandwich squeeze as well hey dom managed in a voice that was full of smoke and fear and the remnants of toxins were all okay thanks to our wonderful erin thanks to all of us she replied kissing nathans hair what she really felt like doing right now was kissing dom but it was hardly appropriate so she just sat within the circle of eight arms and marilyns tongue and felt fabulous and then the sirens started in the distance and the cavalry was here chapter eight first came a fire engine screaming though the dark screeching to a halt at the front gate sending floodlights over the scene and disgorging maybe fifteen men and women all in various states of undress they were donning uniforms as they climbed from the vehicle erin saw from the safety of her underveranda sanctuary theyd be local volunteers roused out of their beds expecting anything were over here she tried to call but her voice wasnt working properly and then she saw them heading toward the gate and marilyns puppies were right in the way go stop them dom said and she cast him a look of desperation because that was how she felt desperate her voice didnt work she wasnt sure her legs would work the boys are safe here with me dom said save the puppies how did he know where the puppies were but then she looked out through the smoky haze and marilyn was making a beeline for the gate and she thought it wouldnt take much of doms intelligence to figure out thats where the puppies were go he said and he reached out and touched her face in a fleeting gesture that could mean anything at all but it meant everything it gave her the strength to pull herself up and stagger across the garden after marilyn watch your feet she managed to scream and the front firefighter stopped dead long enough for her to reach the puppies and gather them up again into her arms poor marilyn this was not an ideal maternity hospital she thought grimly but at least they were alive and help was at hand the lead firefighter was in front of her his hands on her shoulders his face grim and his voice sharply authoritative is anyone inside were all out she managed she tried to turn and he relaxed his grasp but only a little and indeed if hed released her completely she might have toppled over theyre by the veranda doc and the two boys in the garden by the steps the fires upstairs put her behind the truck the guy growled to someone behind him and she was placed firmly into the hold of someone else someone propelling her out of the way i need to go back to dom well bring dom to you the man said and in minutes they did she was sitting where shed been led on the far side of the fire truck feeling reaction set in feeling sick holding an armload of puppies and with marilyn draped over her legs dom was carrying martin and a firefighter was carrying nathan martin was fully conscious now his eyes were huge full of fear only nathan was no longer fearful with terror past this was a small boys dream firefighters and engines and fire for martin it looked to be the stuff of nightmares weve rung an ambulance the firefighter told dom but dom shook his head and lowered himself to sit beside erin still holding martin hard against him we wont need an ambulance he said firm and sure martins okay now he passed out through smoke inhalation but hes looking good if you can grab my emergency bag from the back of my car ill give him some oxygen you know im a doctor graham i can take care of him but erin paused martin had come close to dying from smoke inhalation if shed had him in her emergency department shed be wanting oxygen xrays intensive care type observation for the night dom would know the score as well as she did hed know there was a possibility theyd cracked ribs why and then she looked at martin who was shivering against dom deathly pale terrified dom was weighing relative risks she realised keep him here and run the risk of complicationsor send him to hospital and maybe cause even more trauma if his mother had been harming him to draw attention to herselfthis child must have had enough of hospitals for life okay shed go with dom on this one how much oxygen do you have here she asked and he flashed her a look that said he knew what she was thinking but he knew what he was doing enough to send the local football team scuba diving for a week or so she refused to smile she needed to focus can you do a chest xray here yes okay then she conceded i concur the tension in doms face eased a little great above them the firefighter was frowning if youre sure im sure dom said just go save my house im a doctor too erin told him ill take care of them the man cast her a look that said frankly he didnt believe her maybe she wouldnt either she thought drily she was wearing pink pyjamassilk she was covered in soot and she was wrapped in a huge grey army blanket doctor sure it really is okay dom said erin helped me with jamie sutherland yesterday youve probably heard shes more than competent amazingly i seem to have a colleague well about bloody time the man said and gave erin a grin welcome to bombadeen doc you sure are welcome he gave her a salute part gentle mockery but there was thanks and admiration in there as welland disappeared back to the action another firefighter brought doms equipment and they were left alone which wasweird sitting in a huddle on the far side of the biggest of the fire engines it was as if they were in a cocoon of isolation cut off from the drama being played out on the other side of the truck men were shouting orders were being thrown flashlights were augmenting the floodlightsit seemed the press had arrived there was organised chaos as the firefighters went about their business floodlights were playing over the house but here they were in shadow they were in a tight huddle dom had martin hugged tight against him erin had checked martins lungs shed put on an oxygen mask on him but martin was recovering by the minute thank god dom was sitting with his back against the trucks rear tyre and involuntarily erin shifted closerclose enough so she could feel the comfort of his big body against hers she was holding nathan but the feel of one little boy wasnt enough contact she needed as much reassurance as she could get she needed to feel that she wasnt alone that the terror of the fire was over marilyn was settling down amidst her puppies nuzzling each doing her eternal check and the dogs rump was firmly settled against her leg marilyn too it seemed needed comfort hey more blankets someone called from the shadows and produced a pile of thick wool to spread over all of them dry soft wool lovely amazingly nathan was back to being himself he wriggled out of their grasp and ventured to the end of the fire truck taking a blanket with him erin watched his small face transform from fear and shock to wonder firefighters hoses pumps water he was a small boy again and this was an adventure not for her yet not for martin and not for dom she sniffed feeling a bit desperate and doms arm came round her shoulders its okay he said softly were safe thanks to you i didnt you know smoke makes you want to be sick dom said thoughtfully his hand putting pressure on her shoulders in a silent warning that he was no longer talking to herthat he had a plan its horrid being sick is horrid being burned is horrid she sensed rather than saw martin tense in doms arms nathan was out of earshot but there was no way martin was ready to call this an adventure im guessing you made a little fire martin dom said softly and in the eerie deflected light from the floodlights she saw the little boys eyes flare i didnt i think you did dom said and amazingly his tone was conversational matteroffact in the blanket box in tansys room it was only a little fire martin whispered i thought it would hurt me just a little bit but then i got scared and hid in the cupboard and that was really really sensible dom said still matteroffactly because who wants to be hurt if youd hurt yourself you would have had to go to hospital and nathan and i would miss you youd come and sit by me youd give me stuff we give you more stuff when youre here he said lots more stuff hospitals lonely my mum was in hospital there were depths here she hadnt dreamed of erin found she was forgetting to breathe oh martin oh dom im thinking erin reminded you of your mum dom said softly your mums very sick thats bad but whats worse is that sometimes she made you sick or hurt too so she could go to hospital with you that was part of her sickness but now you live with people who arent sick people who try really hard to stay well because its more fun do you like living with us yes then almost defiantly yes and i dont like being sick i didnt want to be burned i was scared no one wants to be sick if youre sick you cant run swim jump on your pogo stick make the best easter buns in the world from now on you have to stay well so you can do all those things dom was stroking martins hair softly softly his hands were stained black his face was grimed hed come close to death himself but it seemed now that he had all the time in the world this man was the gentlest man shed ever met erin thought shed thought shed met the most caring of doctors she was wrong dom went all through the house to find you martin erin whispered guessing thered been healing tonight but instinctively guessing there was roomeven a needfor lightness now for both dom and for martin dom wore a big wet blanket and he crawled through the house looking for you he looked like a big wet bear and erin looked like a littler bear dom said seeing where she was going and going with her she crawled too mummy and daddy bear looking for baby bear in the cupboard and suddenly amazingly martin managed a smile a bit watery a bit pale but a smile for all that im not a baby bear im not fuzzy enough dom chuckled it was an amazing sound erin blinked and suddenly her eyes widened and she looked at himshe really looked at himand the thought came to her with such blinding clarity it almost hurt this guys awesome and i could really really love this guy and stupid or not i think i already do dom was hugging martin and smiling but suddenly his gaze shifted and he was looking at her their gazes locked and she knew she ought to look away but she didnt big gentle kind clever he was so damned sexy that if the kids werent here she could have had him on the spot it must be the shock she thought stunned to be thinking of jumping him right here right nowit was totally inappropriate but oh if she could he was looking a question she tried to pull herself togetherand failed ii she couldnt think of what to say next are you okay no she managed im a bit shocked im a bit full of smoke ifif you dont mind i need to go see if the house is still standing itmaybe its important were all fine dom said he couldnt move he had his arms full of martin but erin was so choked up the need to leave was imperative she went to rise but doms hand came out and gripped her wrist holding her down you really are okay he demanded sounding worried i really am okay she managed im just a bita bitwell were fine but if you dont mind i left my shoes in the house and i need to see if the firemen have saved them your shoes dom said blankly and my easter egg nathan said from behind them and my pogo stick martin whispered of course erin said see i need to save shoes and egg and pogo stick but i need to go dom she said more urgently this time but then as his hold on her wrist tightened she couldnt help herself she turned to face him head on his face was right there his eyes were on a level with hers his mouth yeah okay his mouth inappropriate inappropriate inappropriate what the hell he was tugging her closer she let herself be tugged and kissed what had she expected a feather kiss a kiss of reassurance friendship it stood not a snowballs chance in a bushfire of being anything so tame his kisshis demanding holdhis touchwere an affirmation of the blast of emotion that had just hit her his kiss washers thats what it felt like here was an unlocked link an open part of her that had been left free waiting for the right connection it was a connection of heat of want of need of everything shed been waiting for all her life here it was in this one kiss in this one man everything faded everything to an observer maybe the kiss was light she couldnt melt against himmartin was already there she was somehow kissing himbeing kissedover the top of martins head but doms kiss was as demanding as hers taking comfort taking heat taking whatever she had to give dom her hero her man in the last couple of days her world had been blasted apart or maybe her world had been blasted apart twenty or more years ago with the death of her brother and sister and maybe it had taken until now to come out from under the rubble since her siblings deaths shed been drifting trying to make sense of everything but nothing quite had shed been trying to make herself three people but she couldnt be what she was supposed to be her tumble down the cliff had shown her just how stupid that ambition was shed nearly died and now again tonightthis was the only life she had this was her life hers and now it felt like she was giving that life awaybut gaining so much in return dom a life for a life it felt right it felt wonderful and it felt like the other half of her whole had slipped magically into place the kiss extended far past the point where a casual kiss would have stopped for she couldnt break the link dom was leaning against the fire truck his arms full of martin his legs draped with dog but he was kissing her just as much as she was kissing him their mouths were fused in a searing blast of heat that left the rest of her weak and useless every fibre of her being was focused on that kiss somewhere behind them a window broke the smash of broken glass hauled them out of their thrall if it hadnt maybe theyd still be kissing for both of them this night had meant terror and in this kiss both of them had found release but it was more than that as erin pulled back she knew it was far far more than that but dom was looking confused and the boys were looking at her in confusion as well kiss us too nathan whispered and she gave a shaky laugh and did just that of course cos were great she kissed nathan on the tip of his nose she kissed the subdued martin on the top of his head and then for good measure she kissed marilyns weird squashed nose as well were all fantastic now if you dont mind i really need to go find a pogo stick and some eggs chapter nine amazingly the fire had been contained to one room its all smoke the firefighters told her the seat of the fire is a store chest the fire took hold in a pile of acrylic fleece blankets its spread from there but the beds iron the rugs wool the bed had woollen blankets on and its mostly the fumes from acrylic weve been dealing with then theres no harm there nearly was a hell of a lot of harm the chief said the fire went up the curtains into the ceiling and theres insulation there thats melted the house is choked with poisonous fumes ive sent my men to clear the seat of the fire but theyre all using breathing gear thank god for smoke alarms and for dom erin thought stunned how the hell did it start he asked do you know there was no point in lying no one was going to charge a sixyearold with criminal damage she still had one of the firefighters blanket draped around her but she was shivering the last thing she wanted to do was stand and answer questions but if this man didnt get the information he wanted from her hed have to ask dom and all doms attention was needed now hell those kids the firefighter said when shed told him theyll be the death of him youve met them a couple of their predecessors the man said grimly doc takes on the kids no one else will touch he and tansy he paused thats right shes away at her sisters shell have docs guts for garters when she comes back a right little mother she makes she and doc are a great pair that didnt sound good umwhat was she thinking fire lifethreatening peril and here she was wondering about the unknown tansy around them the firefighters were moving in what seemed organised chaos there were firefighters everywhere a team was concentrating on the bedroom on the upper left of the house but others were uncoiling what looked like a vast vacuum hose whats that a suction tube the man told her well get the burned stuff out of the house well check the roof put any last embers out then start sucking out smoke tonight straight away the smoke causes the most damage and if i know doc hell want to stay here he always does he hates farming his kids out you mean this has happened before one of his kids stabbed him once the man said watching the vacuum hose disappear inside the front door doc needed fifteen stitches but he wouldnt go to hospital nor would he let the cops take the kid away the lad was only eight the cops called us cos hed locked himself in his room and was threatening to set the place on fire but by the time we got here doc had talked him out and was hugging him blood and all can you believe that the kids been reunited with his mother now and last i heard was doing okay he and his mum still visit lots of docs kids still do how many erin said faintly god knows the man said all i know is that he and tansy are heroes i wish to hell we could get another doctor for the town so he had more time to spare now if youll excuse me miss i need to suck smoke i wish to hell we could get another doctor for the town so he had more time to spare this was not the time to be thinking career moves but the tiny idea had seeded itself already the firefighters words made it grow her shoes were fine as was nathans egg and martins pogo stick two hours later the house still stank of smoke but it was deemed no longer dangerous the bedroom where martin had lit the firetansys roomwould need major work but with its door not only closed but sealed so no smell could escape the house started seeming like home again dom had fielded twenty offers of accommodation that shed heard but shed given up counting hed knocked them all back once the smoke is clear well get back inside he explained itll be better for the kids not to move dom must be feeling weak at the knees himself erin thought as she watched him deflect offers but he wasnt putting martin down the little boy was slumped on his shoulder erin wasnt sure whether he was asleep or not but every time the voices round them rose she saw doms arm round him tighten with his other hand he held nathan he didnt let them go once were home here he said over and over trying to make his voice normal the smoke makes everything seem worse than it is but were fine and gradually the chaos became order the onlookers melted into the night two of the fire engines left one would stay i know you wish us to the devil the firechief told dom as they carried the kids back into the almostnormal living room but the fire spread to part of the ceiling and theres no guarantee we havent miss spots therell be two men staying upstairs all night and therell be more outside yes you can stay in the house but youll do so with our presence like it or leave it dom could see the sense he smiled rueful fine by me graham well sleep round you he looked across at erin how about you can i accept any of these offers of help on your behalf the locals were leaving but he only had to call one back say do you mind looking after erin and shed be away no she said fiercely involuntarily no she coloured iif its okay with you i might be able to helpwith marilyn thats right we still have marilyn he said and he smiled and she was reminded of that chuckle all over again shes having the worlds worst birth experience in dog history she said and tried to make her voice not wobble ill settle her back by the fire if the very word doesnt make us all blench fires are good she said stoutly aware that martins eyes had widened in alarm fires are lovely this was an aberration whats an aberration nathan said he sounded exhausted it was time he was tucked up into bed wherever they could find a bed but erin knew that farming the kids out to strange beds tonight would be asking for trouble dom knew it and she knew it an aberrations a mistake she said meeting doms gaze full on this was a little smoky fire lit by mistake that made us all feel a bit sick but theres a lovely fire in the kitchen stove and another in the living room thats what we all want now a lovely warm fire so i can get my cold toes warm it was the right thing to say they were wearing their nightwear plus blankets even though erin had shoved on doms wellingtons over the dressings on her foot her toes were freezing so it seemed were everyone elses brilliant dom said and his eyes were giving her a message that said her approach had been right on all sorts of levels its what we all want an ordinary fire to warm our toes lets get ourselves organised it would take days before the stink cleared from the upstairs rooms but downstairs the smoke had been sucked out before it had permeated enough to cause any damage the windows were open fresh air had blown through and it felt almost normal so were all sleeping downstairs dom decided and before they knew it burly firefighters had hefted mattresses and bedding downstairs and set up a row of beds in front of the sittingroom fire what had seemed a big room when erin had had it to herself was now cramped three mattresses erins divan marilyns mat for shes not going to be the only one in the kitchen erin decreed one in all in fine by me dom said the fire was still a pile of glowing embers in the grate dom added wood building it up so it crackled and flared fires great he said as martin looked at it nervously this is what fires meant to do martin ive been thinking youve had a terrible experienceit should be useful for something tomorrow ill teach you how to set and light a fire properly whatever martin had been expecting it wasnt this he even managed a sleepy smile dom had set the beds so his was the closest to the fire martins was next then nathans and finally erins settee so they were in a protective sandwich two little boys with an adult on either side and marilyn at their feet the kids were asleep in seconds erin knew she should sleep toobut she could see dom in the firelight he was propped up on one elbow looking over his charges by the firelight she saw raw emotion playing on his face i dont regret that kiss she said suddenly into the dark and she saw him stiffen why arent you asleep im watching you dont someone has to look out for you she said gently you watch out for the whole world and no one watches out for you well thats about to change i dont regret that kiss one bit it was a truly fabulous kiss a kiss to dream about you go to sleep now dominic spencer and know that tonight youre off duty responsibilitys mine right believe it she whispered youre shaking he said into the dark im not i can hear it in your voice well maybe she was somehow the events of the night had caught up with her im okay you need a hug i might she said cautiously why didnt you say so he said and suddenly he was upright stepping carefully across the sleeping boys stooping to touch her face and then because there was no room to kneel by her bed in the crowded roomthat surely must be the reasonhe tugged back her blankets and slipped in beside her his arms came round her and held if shed not been shaking before she was now or maybemaybe not it was a different sort of shaking i needed to hold you he said ii know i kinda need to be held she admitted i know that too you were brilliant tonight you were too she relaxed against him or sort of relaxed her back was curved into his chest he was wearing pyjama bottoms but no top she could feel his body through her silk pyjamas it certainly took a girls mind off fire im not seducing you he said apropos of nothing in particular no her voice wasnt working properly it sort ofsqueaked no he said and she could feel his smile rats she whispered he chuckledand held her closer hey if i could i would but how mom and pop brady ever managed procreation with that lot i cant remember any combined bradys she said cautiously savouring the warmth of him against her loving the warmth of him against her there was a his bunch and her bunch and then no more kids he said darkly theyre a contraceptive device second only to a brick wall right or not right she wasnt sure the feeling of his body against her was doing all sorts of strange things wonderful things youyou want to tell me why youre in my bed then to stop you shivering i think ive stopped shivering ill be the judge of that besides i need to thank you you saved our lives tonight you saved yourselves i never would have got martin downstairs without your help his voice was still hoarse from smoke inhalation he sounded serious suddenly and husky and so damned sexy he was making her toes curl i couldnt say it in front of the boys but i know how close we came to losing him he whispered into her ear thank you hey any time she whisperedand then she thought dom must have been even more terrified than shed been just because he was a man did that make him less needful of comfort instinctively she twisted to face him and her arms came round to hold him tight its okay dom she said tryingnot altogether successfullyto focus on him as a person and not as the body he came with were all okay and im sure martin wont do such a thing again he might then youll be there to help him she said stoutly and then because it was what was in her heart she said what she most wanted to say dom i want to help you you already did no long term she swallowed i could help here if you let me you mean medically of course the medical bit was only part of it she thought but instinct told her to start with the medical offer and move on i could take so much off your shoulders here in this community theres so much work here are you nuts they were lying entwined like longterm lovers it felt right though she thought it felt entirely wonderfully natural youve just got a new job he said a new job she forced herself to focus thats right she had too head of emergency medicine in another world but shed shifted worlds this was her world now and there was no going back ive just had another epiphany she retorted in fact ive had a week of epiphanies the work youre doing herei cant imagine how you cope i cant imagine any greater honour than being permitted to help you tansy helps me it was like a slap she closed her eyes she felt ill she was still holding him she didnt know how to stop holding him erin he shifted away from her and she felt like weeping okay she was being overemotional here but it had been some night and he was making her feel erin she opened her eyes again cautiously hed pushed himself up on his elbows and was gazing down at her in the firelight rueful im sorry he said i didnt mean to sound so blunt tansy does help with the boys medically thoughyes i am stretched but you and ino no no because she put her hands up to touch his face this was the most important moment in her life she knew it did he know it too because of this he said and he kissed her it was a different kiss this time their last kiss had been born of fear and exhaustion and relief but those emotions had passed the warmth of the room the knowledge of two little boys sleeping safe and warm beside them the peace of the drama pastand the warmth and comfort they were taking from each othercombined into one lovely whole suddenly it seemed so right so inevitable sotrue dom was kissing her and the pain his words had caused was gone she was singing inside her dom they were safe and warm and at peace and she was in the arms of the man she loved she was floating dreamlike responding to his kiss with every fibre of her being dom she whispered in her heart dom what the hell was he doing he was kissing a woman as hed never kissed one before he was needing a woman she was luscious under his hands soft yielding but wanton wanton the word played in the back of his brain in the tiny section that was free to think anything at all for now wasnt about thinking it was about feeling touching tasting all five senses awake alive tuned to this woman as hed never been tuned to a woman before wanton that was the way she was with him he knewin that part of his brain he hadnt seemed to possess until hed met herthat wanton wasnt an adjective hed ever hear applied to erin she was the good child the compliant clever daughter the dutiful and faithful friend shed done all she was supposed to in lifebut right now she was pleasing herself she wanted him as desperately as he wanted her every part of her was yielding her body was crushed against his her breasts moulding deliciously against his chest her mouth closed on his her tongueher tongue she tasted of salt and heat and want she tasted of everything hed ever dreamed of his kiss deepened and she matched him demanding as much as she gave willing him to want more his hands tugged her hard against him his fingers cupping her butt in her silken pyjamas so she was pulled right against him she was doing her own tugging he could do with her what he willed and he knew that shed come shed follow where he led or shed lead herself if he willed he should stop he had to stop but he could no sooner tear himself away from her than he could fly he felt as if a part of him that had been torn away at birth had miraculously come home erin her hair smelled of smoke erin the fire crackled in the grate a small hissing explosion it caught him pulled him up no hell what was he doing he was hers whatever hed ask of her in this moment shed give she could love him no more in the future than she did now he was her man she was his woman and shed come home dom this was a long lingering kiss deep and sweet and right she clung to him and he held her close savouring the kiss as she savoured it deepening it as she deepened it tugging her closer closer loving her as she loved him butmaybe not no for the fire had spat and hissed and hed pulled away as she could never have pulled away now he was holding her at arms length gazing at her as one might gaze at a precious unattainable thing something so far out of his reach it was a dream what is it she whispered oh dom i justmeant to tell youmeant to show you why your offer is impossible his voice was shaken desperate its the most generous offer ive ever heardto give up your city practice and come here but theres this between ustheres this i never meant it to go so far so i dont want it it seems to me she whispered fingers of ice suddenly whispering their way round her heart that you do want it as much as i do no why not youve been here for less than two days this makes no sense it makes all the sense in the world no he said more strongly now youre sweet and smart and beautiful and im not about to take advantage hey isnt that ever so slightly patronising whatever but its true he kissed her again then but lightly this time holding himself rigidly under control the drama of the night had unveiled his need but he had himself back together he slipped from under her blankets and rose and she could have wept i want to help she said and if she sounded needy she couldnt help it i cant accept you might have to accept she whispered this community is too big for one doctor youre doing what you have to maybe i am too he shook his head neither of us is making sense he said softly and he stooped and touched her lightly on the lips it was a feather touch it was like a touch of farewell enough this is crazy its dreams talking not reality goodnight erin he whispered go to sleep in the morning well be sane again but i wont be sane tomorrow she muttered rebelliously under her breath as he returned to his makeshift bed im sane now im feeling like ive been insane all my life and ive just woken up im feeling like its time to come home she didnt say it out loud but she meant it somehow she just had to convince dom that love worked she had to convince dom that what she felt was for ever she hardly slept when the phone went at six it didnt get the chance to ring a second time before erin was out in the hall to answer it there were still firemen in the house one of the menthe firechief grahamhad started down the stairs to answer it he stopped when he saw her she smiled waved the receiver at him and pulled the sittingroom door closed so as not to wake dom and the boys doc on the end of the line a mans voice sounded frantic the terror of last night kicked in again just because last nights terror was gone it didnt mean the world was a safe place for everyone im a doctor she said smoothly professional how can i help but the doc we had a house fire last night she said trying to sound like it was no drama dr doms taken up with his kids im the doctor on call will you allow me to help you instead there was a pause then a shattering sob ive just woken up he managed i think my wifes dead it took all of two seconds to decide someone needed to go and that someone should be her this was doms patient in theory she should wake him but she glanced back into the living room and all three boys were sleeping like the dead martin had snuggled next to dom during the night dom had his arm across the little boys shoulders the sight made her suddenly blink away tears she was almostjealous it was dumb but there it was these guys were a family and she wanted to be a part of it at least she could give them this time which meant this was her call quietly she asked the questions she needed to know the lady had been suffering from advanced metastatic cancer dom had been looking after her at home yes dom had said she might die but surely not so soon she covered the receiver and talked to graham whod been watching with concern from the landing is there someone who can take me to hughie mathesons house sure thing is enid dead then we thought it might be soon so the town was expecting this death more and more she knew this was something she could deal with yes itd be better for hughie if dom was able to come but right now triage said those little boys needed him more shed stowed her clothes in the downstairs bathroom so she could have privacy when she dressed that meant she didnt need to go back into the living room two minutes later she was dressed in jeans and a thick sweaterand doms boots againand graham was ushering her out of the house thank god youre here he said stowing doms medical bag into the back of his truck docs driving himself into the ground you dont want to move here permanently do you i might she said and he came close to tripping over his feet as he climbed into the truck youre kidding maybe im not she said cautiously but the idea was taking solid form dom had said flatly it was impossible okay living in the same house was impossibleshe conceded that but what he was doing with the kids was so worthwhile if she could share his medical load everyone says you need two doctors we need half a dozen graham told her weve been advertising for ever so if i were to stay youd never move in with him graham breathed ino dom had said they couldnt work together because of this thing between them but maybe they could if they stayed apart apart for as long as he wanted i reckon our tansyd have something to say about that graham said grinning but that means youd be needing somewhere to live what about old docs place whoa things were suddenly moving really fast even for her newly formed resolutions the dawn light was just starting to edge over the horizon their truck was headed out of town on a bumpy road around them were open paddocks full of sleepy sheep how could she move here but graham wasnt treating the suggestion as silly wheresold docs place she ventured how about i take you there after we finish at hughies graham said warming to his theme its a bachelor pada tiny house attached to the building that used to be the hospital the government closed the hospital when old doc died this doc says he cant open it againhe cant have inpatients without backup but old docs place is owned by the town and its for medical staff thatd mean you hell with two doctors we might be able to open the hospital again what dyer reckon i reckon i need to think about it she said cautiously i need to talk to dom whats this got to do with dom graham said easily chuckling in my other life i run the local hotel im head of the chamber of commerce plus im shire president if theres the possibility of an extra doctor for this place im not letting you go consider yourself hired enid matheson was indeed dead peacefully in her own bed dying in her sleep with her husband beside her theres not a lot of women lucky enough to have this as their farewell erin said gently as she checked all vital signs then just as gently she touched the ladys face in the gesture of farewell she always used working in emergency in a big city hospital meant most of her farewells didnt seem as right as this one enid had been in her eighties there were photographs all over the houseenid and hughie with kids dogs grandkids ribbons for prize bulls certificates for prize fruit cakesthe house was a cosy wellloved testament to a woman who had known how to make a home erin thought fleetingly back to her parents home to the superclean granite and stucco architectural statement her parents worked so hard overand she was aware of a stab of envy then she thought of the bikes and pogo stick and general chaos in doms yard and felt a stab of something else the same but different but now wasnt about her she thought as she finished her examination hughie was sitting at the kitchen table his head in his hands silently weeping she put on the kettle and found two mugs outside graham would be waiting but hed said youre not to worrytheres others taking care of things back at doms place and i have all the time in the world hughiell need you ill wait for as long as you need so she took him at his word in a while shed do the official stufffill in the death certificate organise an undertaker ask hughie who she should call but if hed desperately wanted his family to be with him hed have called them by now it seemed he wanted a little time first before the business of dealing with death began thanks to graham she could give it to him tell me about enid she said softly as she put a mug of hot sweet tea in front of him this house is lovely im guessing shes been a wonderful woman she is the old farmer said brokenly and looked through into the bedroom she was he shook his head youyou really want to hear about her it was a plea pure and simple yes i do erin said strongly and surprised herself by the truth of what shed said this was a facet of medicine shed never thought about trained and working in city hospitals shed never been in the position where where patients could be friends she thought suddenly with a flash of insight this easter was really changing her perspective up until now shed thought that dom was a selfsacrificing hero now as she sat in front of the ancient kitchen stove and shared a second and then a third cup of tea and heard about enid from the time she and hughie had first met she thought no it worked both ways she could do this whats more she wanted to do this docs been great hughie said and she had to haul herself out of her own thoughts and back to him hes looked after enid well when we knew the cancer had spread our kids said we should put her in a hospice but doc said if she wanted to stay home then stay home she would and hes moved heaven and earth to keep her here hes been here nearly every day he brings those kids with himi take em for a ride on the tractor while he looks after enid you know shes hardly had pain at all the minute theres pain you ring me he says and we dowe didand hed be here hes one in a million but he works too hard i know that she said im thinking of helping him the old farmers gaze lifted from the dregs of his tea his eyes were redrimmed from weeping but he looked at her nowhe really looked thatd be great he said simply youre such a one as he is i can see it sticking out a country mile and now he took a deep breath and now its time to call the kids he said its time to call the church and the funeral chaps thank you for giving me this time miss ive appreciated it more than you can say you want me to make the calls for you if you would he said with dignity ill sit with enid until they come afterwards graham drove her home past the old doctors house and the building that had once been bombadeens hospital weirdly it still looked neat and freshly painteda long low building of rendered brick surrounded by welltended gardens and ancient eucalypts it looks like it closed yesterday erin said confused the locals hated it when it closed graham told her a few of the oldies have taken it on as their retirement project if we can ever attract another doctor to the place we can get it open again in a trice id imagine thered be heaps of bureaucracy im really good at bureaucracy graham was casting her thoughtful sideways glances dom probably likes being the only doctor are you kidding if i moved here you really are interested he frowned missdocif you dont mind me saying im hearing youve only been here for two days its your car thats at the bottom of the boulder creek road maybe you hit your head on the way down i dont think you should make your mind up quite yet thats generous of you it is isnt it he said cheerfully and drew the truck into the hospital yard okay ive given you my obligatory warning now lets introduce you to your new home that dog of yours is going to love this yard right he pulled to a halt she thought he was about to get out but instead he hesitated again you know i shouldnt say this but i have daughters of my own you and dom what about me and dom hes a really attractive man miss he said cautiously my daughters tell me hes what they call a hunk youre not imagining yourself in love with him after two days no yes thats alright then he said glad to have that cleared up my daughters say theres tansy and only tansy the local lasses have thrown everything they can at him but no one succeeds and now you he shook his head okay im talking out of turn i know it ive said my piece and now ill shut up now lets go show you your new home they were at the kitchen table eating cornflakes when she got back and easter eggs happy easter dom said the easter bunnys been they all had an egg in front of them or half an egg thered obviously been considerable egg consumption in her absence but at the end of the table was an empty place neatly set in the middle of the placemat was a shiny pinkfoiled egg a tiny white flag was stuck in the top erin it said erin it was her egg weirdly it made tears prick at the back of her eyes in all this chaos dom had still found time to play easter bunny and hed remembered her this very girly pink egg must have been deliberately organised for her the easter bunnys more reliable than the chap who cooks the easter buns he said and smiled at her with that dropdead smile that had her heart doing back flips you bought me an egg dammit her bottom lip was quivering the bunny brought you the egg nathan corrected her they were on the table when we woke up this morning the bunnys good she managed how do you think he knew you were here nathan asked magic she said and sat down because she needed to they were gorgeousthe three of them her boys now that was a dumb possessive thing to think these guys had nothing to do with her though dom might end up being her partner her medical associate nothing more she had to get her bottom lip under control where have you been dom asked passing the cornflakes the fire guys said you had a call can i eat my egg before i tell you if you must of course i must she said and unwrapped her eggquite a big egg actually she bit a very satisfactory hole in the pointy end munched for a bit then placed her egg holeside down in front of her cereal bowl then she poured her cornflakes that looks like a ritual dom said she nodded ive done it every easter sunday for as long as i can remember one year the easter bunny brought me a chocolate rabbit instead of an egg it messed with my psyche all year i imagine it did dom said faintly so where have you been out to the mathesons he was half way through handing her the milk jug his hand froze in midair what a lovely peaceful ending she said and smiled across the table at him thanks to you well done dr spencer hughie rang at six graham drove me out there you should have woken me there was no mistaking the angera flash of fury right she said you copped more smoke than me last night i decided this morning that youre my patient and it was me making the decisions you had no right i know she said softly and indeed if there was anything you could have done i would have woken you but there was nothing can we talk about it later he said tightly she thought uhoh shed acted unprofessionally shed stepped in and acted in his stead without a byyourleave of course we can but then she looked at the little boys oscillating between egg and cornflakes and she knew shed done the right thing theyd woken to find dom beside them they needed him today dom had made the decision to be a fosterparent he had to accept the consequences what she was thinking must have been obvious the tight lines of anger changed to something elseconfusion what not prepared to take an official reprimand he asked but his heart didnt sound like it was in it not for enid she said and tilted her chin or for anything else i may have done this morning his voice grew apprehensive what the hell else have you done this morning she peeped a smile at him it was easter sunday after all a good day a day for celebration dom looked grim and tired and he was getting help whether he needed it or not ive found a home for marilyn she told him but discussions for after breakfast if youll excuse me i have an easter egg to concentrate on he needed to get his head in order the drama of the night was still close to overwhelming hed nearly lost martin hed taken his mind off the game he thought grimly these boys needed so much attention he couldnt afford to be distracted and erin was definitelydistracting she was lovely and that kiss last night hed gone to sleep with that kiss lingering in his senses he felt it still shed kissed him as if shed meant it as if she wanted to be a part of him well that was a crazy thought or maybe not so crazy he had a great home a great job and he hadyeah okay he had enough going in the testosterone stakes to make him interesting ruby had told him that over and over youll make some lucky girl a lovely husband just because your parents were a disaster it doesnt mean the rest of the worlds damaged relationships do work open yourself up and some nice girl will slip right in while he wasnt looking thats what this felt likeas if erin had slipped in while his back had been turned and now she was in and he couldnt take his mind off her if she hadnt been here maybe hed have sensed that martin had been troubled last night he couldnt stay this preoccupied he had to get her out of here hed promised she could stay over easter you neednt worry im organising myself alternative accommodation she said and smiled sweetly he blinked were his thoughts so obvious where ill tell you after breakfast she repeated now if you dont mind i havent eaten enough egg chapter ten only of course after breakfast things got busy really busy for a start there was the little matter of a fire having almost destroyed a bedroom and part of the ceiling it seemed easter sunday was no reason why the fire department couldnt come out in force the morning ended up as an endless parade of men in hard hats traipsing up and down the stairs climbing ladders knocking holes in roofing tiles and clambering about the ceiling its still structurally sound graham somewhat grudgingly admitted at lunchtime but youve got your work cut out getting tansys room ready for her to come home i need to contact her and find out what she wants done with her damaged possessions dom said well keep as much as possible intact until she comes back when will she be back in a couple of weeks dom said as erin listened from behind the unknown tansy she shouldnt mind erin thought why did the idea of tansy have the power to unsettle her she knew exactly why but she was trying hard not to admit it luckily she had a distraction a couple of church ladies arrived and offered to take the boys on an easteregg hunt even though the thought of the hunt was enticing the boys were clingy and martin still needed observation an xray had shown a rib had a hairline crack though it didnt seem to be bothering him but the boys wanted to go dom was needed at the house so erin offered to go with them the hunt was in a patch of bushland behind the church erin limped about on the sidelines as the boys hunted wishing dom could be there trying not to think that hed seemed relieved when shed suggested taking the boysand thus herselfaway she watched and while she did so she took stock of this community wondering whether she could do what graham had proposed that morning but from everyone she told she was a doctor she got the same response you wouldnt like to practise here would you were desperate for another doctor and itd be wonderful to get the hospital up and running again she could do good here she could be needed she could be close to dom no no and no the decision had to be made on its own merits dom had tansy tansy gave him all the help at home he needed he didnt want or need anyone elsepersonally this had to be a professional proposition only so she needed to talk to dom about it last night hed rejected it out of hand for dumb reasons though she thought they were illogical reasons he had to see sense it was a gorgeous day the kids were whooping through the patch of bushland reserve where the church ladies had hidden eggs the terrors of the night forgotten they came tearing back every now and then to show her their finds and she found herself absurdly touched erin erin weve found nine ten eleven something about last night had bonded them to her they trusted her what dom was doing with these kids was great fantastic he had to let her help he missed her she and the kids were gone for three hours it gave him a chance to get some order into the house a group of church ladies had taken themselves off egghunt duties and arrived with mops and brooms they went through the house like a dose of salts and by the time theyd finished the place was cleaner than it had been before the fire all the time they worked they chattered and asked questions about erin she seems lovely he was told as the ladies worked we gather she was lovely this morning hughies daughter said she sat with him for over an hour she made him cups of tea and listened for as long as he wanted to talk she didnt rush him at all and thats after shed crashed her car and hurt her foot and all you should have told us doc well organise the men to pull the car up from the river doesnt matter that its easter what sort of doctor is she she doesnt want a job does she ooh i wonder what tansy will think of her they were about to find out at four oclock four cars pulled up outside the house almost simultaneously dom was in his surgery dusting through a pile of patient notes the women had cleaned in here but patient confidentiality demanded he do this himself the sound of the kids voices made him look out the window erin and the kids were being dropped off by a lady he recognised as marg lalor head of the church choir that was surprising on its own marg was a nervy driver and she didnt like having passengers she also didnt like boys for her to offer to drive erin and the kids home was astonishing pulling up behind them was a porsche charles great then there was a taxi followed by a small red car he thought he recognised ruby butruby was in dolphin beach his elderly fostermother had intended to celebrate easter with his fosterbrother pierce and pierces new wife shanni nope ruby was definitely here tugging her battered overnight bag out of her car beaming at the kids martin nathan i hear you and your dad have been having some excitement and tansy for it was tansy looking hot and bothered edging out of the taxi dropping her purse swearing dropping her shawl finally sitting down on the kerb opening her purse and emptying its contents onto the grass i swear ive got a fiftydollar note maybe i can do it in coins can you wait for a bit and in the middle of it allerin looking confused uhoh he grabbed his wallet and went to confront hisfamily tansy there was no mistaking the joy in the little boys voices the woman sitting on the kerb counting coins looked likewell maybe like a tansy ought to look erin thought she was tall and buxom shed made an attempt to subdue her copperred hair into a knot but there was no way hair like that could be subdued half her hair was in the knot the rest was a mass of frizzy curls she was wearing a raggededged purple skirt that reached her bright red boots her lacy blouse was cut low a mass of bright red beads wound round her neck anduntil shed dropped it in the dustshed also been wearing a shawl daffodil yellow she looked maybe midthirties she was gorgeous why erins heart should sink at the sight of herwell why shouldnt it she was so far gone she no longer had the strength to lie to herself tansy was beautiful she minded the boys launched themselves at tansy from a distance and coins went everywhere she abandoned the money she hugged the boys as if they belonged to her im so pleased to see you guys she said mrs neale rang me at sparrows fat rooster crow this morning and said you were in trouble its taken me three flights and all day to get here erin had just alighted from the car margthe lady from the churchwas talking to her she wasnt listening she was watching tansys flaming red curls bent over two small heads and she was aware of such a jab of jealousy it was like a physical pain tansy was back now things would be fine dom could go back to work there was no need for her to stay oi the call came from a dumpy little woman dressed in twinset pearls and neat sensible skirt and shoes she was standing in the road beside a big canvas holdall she was watching tansy and the kids with approval dont i get a hello ruby the kids yelled and abandoned tansy and careered round the far side of the taxi to reach her can i get paid the taxi driver saidplaintivelyand erin was suddenly aware of charles approaching from behind he had his wallet out was counting notes waving away changethat was such a charles thing to doand was moving to help tansy to her feet hi tansy said who are you charles he said easily smiling down at her and you im tansy charles did have a nice smile erin thought as she watched them he hardly used it on her any more he was too busy improving heror disapproving of her but when he smiled he was smiling at tansy now and tansy was smiling at him charles seemeddumbstruck find any eggs she turned and dom was behind her he was watching the charlestansy tableau but his hand came down on her shoulder and rested just briefly as if he knew there was a certain amount of emotion here she didnt know what to do with seventeen she said absently weve eaten six well done you it seems we have the cavalry she said cautiously we do indeed he didnt shift his hand and she was irrationally grateful tansy and charlesand ruby my fostermother i might have known shed be here why there was a fire last night he said sounding half fond half exasperated ruby and tansy have the same finetuned antennae its a wonder the firefighters beat them here and charleswhy do you think hes here ive come to take you home charles said dragging his eyes from tansy with what looked like difficulty we heard the doctors house burned down last night it was on the local news erin you need to be sensible i dont erin muttered but maybe she did you dont have anywhere to stay but it isnt burned down tansy said turning to survey the house i was expecting much worse but hey is that my bedroom window boarded up your bedrooms burned dom said i lit the fire martin said in a scared little voice and any doubt erin had that tansy was a very nice person dissipated just like that tansy hauled the little boy into her arms gave him a hug that looked as if it could have cracked more ribs and kissed the top of his head i imagine it must have been a mistake she said has dom talked to you about it yyes then theres nothing more to be said so you dont need me ruby too was staring at the house like it had betrayed her i thought you might like me to take the boys back to dolphin bay the boys are fine dom said socan i still stay the night she asked i cant turn round and drive all the way back can we all sleep here ummaybe not dom said the boys bedroom is okay and mine is too but tansys isnt and erins using the sitting room ive come to take erin home charles said but he was sounding less sure of himself now he was still watching tansy mesmerised maybe we can even take the dog he added like it was a rehearsed speech in view of the fire my mother says its the only christian thing to do tansy snorted why hadnt she snorted erin thought and jealousy returned in force the snort threw charles off balance he really was a good person erin thought again hed been put under as much pressure by their combined parents as she had do the right thing by erin he was a good person but she didnt want to marry him especially not now not when shed figured what she could feel doms hand was still on her shoulder it felt weird it feltright for she needed determination and if doms hand on her shoulder gave her that determination well and good okay deep breath and jump you dont need to take me home she said to charles and to all of them she took a deep breath and managed a smile and of course ruby can stay i have alternative accommodation ive figured it out im taking a new direction and i may as well tell you all im taking a job as a local doctor charles my home is here if shed detonated a bomb she could hardly have had less of an impact they stood stunned all of them staring at her like shed grown two heads she couldnt see dom he was behind her she was aware that his hand had stiffened on her shoulder she should have told him first of course she should but she already knew his misgivings and shed decided to ignore them maybe those misgivings were valid and maybe they werent she could always leave but dammit she was going to try surprise is the essence of attack she thought she needed to breach defences she knew instinctively were all around the man standing behind her maybe that was a dumb thing to think when tansy was here maybe tansy had already breached his defences but dom still had his hand on her shoulder if he and tansy were an item surely hed have let her go by now he and tansymaybe not please not she needed a smile she neededsomething she looked round and found ruby had the required smile it was a smile of questions but it was a smile nonetheless youre moving in with my son doms your son my fosterson ruby said extricating herself from kids and moving forward she gripped erins hands kissed her warmly on the cheek then set her aside and hugged dom as if he were the same age as martin and nathan she reached about as high as his chest youve found a woman she said sounding delighted no dom said adamantly and erin thought maybe it behoved her to clear a few things up im not moving in with dom youre not ruby said sounding disappointed im moving into the old doctors house by the hospital youre kidding dom saidfaintly but thats wonderful said the church lady in all the excitement she had been forgotten im so glad ill get graham to get the contracts drawn up straight away and seeing youre tight for accommodation here ill organise to set the old doctors house up so you can sleep there tonight well even supply dog food she beamed nothing like striking while the irons hot dont you think huh said charles and he said it for all of them huh was right bye the church lady said and climbed back into her car and drove off one down erin thought dazed many more to go she needed to get dom alone like that was going to happen it happened ill drive you there now dom said sounding suddenly grim she thought huh again even if she didnt say it you cant she said everyones here which is why i need to be somewhere else charles can you help tansy and ruby inside with their things you girls can have the two usable upstairs bedrooms the boys and i will keep sleeping in the sitting room erin ill take you and marilyn she said and marilyn he agreed sounding goaded erin charles said they want to be alone tansy said unexpectedly and tucked her arm confidingly in his i can sense these things youre good ruby said warmly a woman after my own heart charles can you take this holdall erin charles tell our parents i love them erin said but she had to speak fast for dom had her hand and was leading her forcibly back to the house ill ring them tonight and thank you for coming to rescue me but i think i might have rescued myself dom where are we going to fetch your dog of course dom said and your toothbrush and then to get rid of at least one woman from my life chapter eleven they hardly spoke until she was in the front seat of doms car and they were heading across town erins belongings had been hastily stuffed into her overnight bag marilyn was on the back seat looking as confused as a bulldog could look no woman in a maternity suite had ever been shuffled between so many beds but as long as her head count of pups was correct she seemed resigned erin didnt feel resigned she felt breathless and a little afraid dom looked downright furious they reached the centre of town drove past the fire station and a couple of volunteers were still there they got cheery waves erin waved back dom didnt wave are you going to tell me what youre playing at he said at last tightly and she stared at the road in front of her and thought of what she needed to say i guessthis was a spurofthemoment decision to work here youre not serious i think i am you want what a nice idyllic home in the country thats not what im looking for she said evenly i needto be needed i dont want to be needed to play violin like my brother and sister i dont want to marry charles to make our parents happy i want to do something for me and bombadeens supposed to provide it i think it can she said evenly i dont know of course ill have to wait and see so youll walk away from your job leave your employer in the lurch thats not fair im about to start a new job heading our emergency department i won the job by a whisker over two other doctors who are still available im on two weeks leave before starting that means theres heaps of time for another applicant to be delighted that i can no longer take up the appointment you have all the answers you mean you dont want me the question was tossed into the air like a hand grenade they drove in stillness waiting for it to explode it didnt but neither did it disappear so what are you proposing he asked at last sounding strained that i live in the old doctors house and practise medicine i can at least give it a few weeks trial every single person i talked to today told me how overworked you are they say nonurgent stuff has to go to campbelltown because you cant handle it is that right yes but so i wouldnt be setting up in opposition to you id be sticking up a sign saying im here for doc doms leftovers my leftovers ill even do insurance medicals she promised grandly a greater offer she couldnt make insurance medicals were renowned for being the bane of a doctors life in the midst of a busy day they took an hour of crossing ts and dotting is how could he help but be impressed and he was youre kidding he murmured and thenamazinglyhe smiled great thats what shed been aiming for it was starting to seem like a reasonable career ambitionto make dom smile she smiled back and the tension lessened a little youre a top doctor he said cautiously as if he was thinking it through youd never have got to head the emergency medicine team if you werent good i do a nifty line in sticky plasters she said and looked hopeful and the rest he said his smile died he was serious again but the tension was gone youll have skills i cant guess at but why for this decision to come out of nowhere see thats where youre wrong she said and suddenly she knew she only had to tell the truth sure there was her very definite attraction to this man but the moment shed thought of taking on this job things had settled that had been jumbled for a very long time i loved this morning she told him she clasped her hands together on her knees and hoped he got it he got it spending time with hughie it felt right she said working in a city emergency department ive lost count of the times ive had to face death but this morninginstead of leaving hughie with a social worker i made a cup of tea and sat down and talked it feltright its why im here he said simply ive never want to be anything but a family doctor my family might see it as failure she told him but its not i saw it clearly this morning and then i thought if i have to move apartments anywayi cant have marilyn in my hospital flat and theres no way im giving her upwhy not move here i know you have misgivings about us but i thinki hopewe can work it out i want to give it a try youre serious i am it seemed he couldnt think of anything else to say two minutes later they reached the house two women were carrying in armloads of bedding an elderly man in overalls was carrying ina dog kennel my god dom said this is serious i knew margs organising skills were good but this i dont think marilyns ready for a kennel erin said looking dubious i sort of see her at the end of my bed thisthis is happening very fast it surely is he said drily youll wake up tomorrow and thisll seem like some crazy aberration maybe but she didnt think so she climbed from the car and went to retrieve her dog but dom was before her ill carry marilyn you bring the puppies this is your last move marilyn she told the dog and marilyn looked up at her with a mournful expression that said she didnt believe it for a minute erin followed dom into the house inside a mini working bee had begun they were greeted with goodhearted cheer and the guy with the dog kennel took one look at marilyn and swore sheesh doc theres no way that butt will go through this opening he was talking to her erin realised shed just becomedoc she smiled but absently she walked through the little house carrying puppies while dom and marilyn followed behind the house looked like it had been built back in the s heavy oak wainscotting diamondpatterned windows with thick irregular glass heavy furniture well used lots of leather worn carpets a fireplace in the front room already set for lighting the afternoon sun was glinting through the panes of glass throwing diamonds all across the room she pushed open the door into the kitchen an ancient cooker took up half the far wall the same diamondpatterned windows were on either side of the cooker this room though faced east and through the windowsthe sea its fabulous she breathed shed seen it briefly that morning but now the sun was out it was amazing we put locums up here dom said when we can get them it only has one bedroom marilyn and i only need one bedroom everyone was looking at hermen and women whod moved heaven and earth in record time to get this place looking inviting she realised there was a basket of bread fresh made and smelling wonderful on the kitchen bench there was a box of groceries on the table a big bunch of crimson poppies was scattered in a blue striped jug on the dresser home she breathed its blackmail dom muttered how do you think they got me here the same route the job was advertised i came here for an interview and met tansy she was on the hospital board she showed me this house i said i fostered kids and needed room for kids and a housekeeper tansy took me on a tour of the town stopped to give me a coffee at the local caf√© and before id finished my coffee the locals had my house set up i was taken to the house im in now same deal even the same bread he grinned at a whitehaired old gentleman out in the passage pete makes the best bread in the district and tansy was part of the package tansy you take a job here you get to eat this bread you get to live in this house and heres your housekeeper i was told with their marketing strategies i couldnt believe the town had been without a doctor for ten years but have they worked it was graham standing at the back of the pack of onlookers do we have another doctor i think so erin whispered though she already knew the answer go away the lot of you dom said shaking his head in exasperation the ladys crashed her car and is stuck im not taking advantage of her youre more of a gentleman than i am then pete said and cackled we need to talk medicine dom retorted enough of the salesmanship youve made your point leave the lady to me as long as you keep her pete retorted and looked erin up and down in absolute approval cos the rest of us can see shes a keeper graham lets go chop a muttsized butthole out of this kennel they were left alone standing in the perfect little kitchen looking at each other dom was still holding marilyn erin was still holding pups first things first dom set marilyn down disappeared into the bedroom and came back with a pile of blankets theyre old he told erin we set the bed up with duvets for the locum theres more than enough to spare for marilyn so they set up a bed for marilyn beside the stove in a corner of the kitchen where shed be out of the way the morning sun would stream in on her the back door was at hand if you stay i could chop a dog flap in the door dom said sounding reluctant im staying you dont know that yet i do know it she was arranging the pups on the blanket showing each of them to marilyn in turn there you go sweetheart all your babies are present and correct this is your permanent home ill paint a sign on the wall if you likemarilyn sleeps here ill show you our hospital if you really mean it i mean it youre not doing it because he hesitated and then suddenly he swore i should never have kissed you maybe i should never have kissed you wrong her heart said but she had some pride anyone i work withit has to be purely professional she put her hands on her hips so why wouldnt it be professional i have no idea he said sounding goaded or maybe i do so everyone says youre desperate for a partner do you like being the only doctor for miles no then its just this attraction thing which is nonsense he snapped okay so we get over it he turned away abruptly heading out into the hall and then through a door to the side the door led to a hospital in miniature there was an office and four small wards each with two beds the beds werent made up but the walls were painted in cheerful pastels the green linoleum gleamed with polish dom led the way to a room at the rear and erin found herself in a miniature theatre it was big enough to perform notsominor surgery the lights overhead were new and modern the trolley under the lights looked ready to receive a patient right now the old doc used to operate by himself dom said during the war he was the only doctor for a hundred miles hed take out an appendix all on his own and do a crossword on the side i expect erin said ruefully boy do those old guys make us look pussycats what do you use it for now minor stuffand i mean minor stuff certainly not an appendix my surgery back home is too small so im back and forth here at need will i get in the way she asked if im in the background helping look erin what she hitched herself up onto the examination couch and met his gaze straight on look what you cant really be serious of course im serious this place is fantastic graham tells me this place is desperate for a doctor hes shire president and hes offered me a contract it seems just what im looking for except the current incumbentwhich would be youlooks like he has a mouthful of sour grapes i do not you certainly do she said if youre worrying about my qualifications theyre excellent and graham says the districts so desperate if i was threequarters dead and threequarters drunk theyd still be interested you know im not looking for a relationship he said flatly and she almost fell off the couch excuseexcuse me she tried to saybut it turned into a choking cough he was watching her from the far side of the room like she was a ticking bomb it took her a couple of minutes to recover he didnt move some doctors she said at last when she could finally talk would have fetched their patients a glass of water when that happened especially after last night i might have impaired lung capacity from smoke inhalation if thats a possibility youd better go home with charles why do you want to get rid of me i told you im not in the market for a relationship i heard you im here as a doctor not a mistress you kissed me so i did you big oaf she snapped and you kissed me back last night was truly horrible and we were both terrified and were all alive and i was so thankful that i would have kissed marilyn in fact i seem to remember that i did kiss marilyn not like you kissed me not being marilyn youd know how she snarled and he blinked um look lets get this on a professional basis and keep it there she snapped ive been asked to work here as a doctor i believe theres room for both of us in this town is there not i havent advertised for help you didnt ask i ought to have asked so you concede that at least of course but im desperate i need a home for marilyn shes not even your dog she is she said and swung off the examination couch and stood tall look ive jolted you out of your comfort zone you havent but ive been jolted further she snapped again it was me who crashed into a river who almost killed myself who saved marilyn who helped save martin who spent all last night trying to figure how i could get my life back and suddenly realising i dont want it back youre doing good in this town dominic spencer and i want to share it how selfish is it of you not to let me selfish yes selfish this is a fantastic setup youre telling me i cant stay youll be gone in a week i believe the contract graham is drawing up is for six months am i so appalling no but but what she demanded exasperated whats the worst that can happen graham tells me you have an outreach patient population of over eight thousand surely you can spare the odd patient or two and if youre worried i might hit on you surely youre old enough to fend me off in fact consider me fended i dont know whether i can work with you he said goaded cant you understand that the way i feelhow can i risk it i need to stay as i am my works important to me my kids are important to me you mess with my head and you mess with mine so maybe we need to sort it tell me youre not the least bit interested in me or youre in love with tansy or you swore celibacy until armageddon just say it and then forget it and i will too end of story professional colleagues and nothing more he stared at her seemingly baffled she gazed calmly back the phone rang he didnt want her she watched him speak into the phone as she saw his body tense and stay rigidly turned away from her ive lost she thought bleakly where do i go from here wheres the crash despite her confusion despite feeling humiliated to her socks she picked up on what he was saying how many hell okay im on my way stay calm mate youre the first on scene and you have to cope make sure everyones breathingconcentrate on getting muck away from their mouths and noses and make sure no ones slumped so theyre restricting their air flow ill be with you in minutes go his phone was back in his pocket and he hauled the door open she knew what shed heard a car crash multiple casualties do you need help she demanded no he snapped he strode two steps out the door and then stopped took a grip saw sense yes he said without looking back theres been a headon collision two miles on the other side of town just past my place that was a local farmer four injuries and from the sound of it theyre bad the ambulance is fifty miles away yes i might need help id appreciate it if you came chapter twelve he shouldnt focus on anything but the task ahead but after a fast call to the police and to the ambulance service with two miles between them and the crash site there was room for more erin was staring straight ahead hed hurt her he thought hed watched as her features had flattened from eager laughing even maybe seductive to humiliation and anger her impulse to stay here made in hours was nuts she was just like his mother the thought slammed home and it hurt he only vaguely remembered his mother but what he remembered was flatness and apathy except for the times shed arrived home in love oh dom this is wonderful this is different this will totally transform our lives and it always did the fragile security they achieved in between his mothers romantic attachmentsa place to call home school routine belongingswas cast to the wind as they followed one loser after another even at seven hed remembered saying desperately to his mother how can you be in love after only one night how can you decide to move without even thinking about it he glanced across at erin and saw that was exactly where she was she was all for throwing the old life away and starting the new just because it was exciting different and wonderful it wasnt wonderful he told himself grimly shed wake up and realise what was importantcharles her parents her career and hed be responsible you always mess things up for me hell where had that come from his mothers voice sobbing from the past hed want me if i didnt have you dont whine dominic well find somewhere else to live and next time be smarter just stay in the background i dont knowdisappear he had hed ended up in fostercarethank god with rubyand his mother had never come back for him impulsive decisions were for fools relationships sucked love at first sight was for idiots he glanced across at erin and he felt his gut clench he had no intention of making her miserable but the way he felt about her he might even imagine himself in love with her but if he didif he stayed round her for much longeritd just make everything worse the accident was about half a mile past doms home they passed his house going at speed erin glanced fleetingly at the driveway and charless car was still parked in front call him dom said before she could say anything frank said we have multiple casualties if charles is another doctor and hes prepared to help you must really be desperate erin muttered but she used her cellphone and waited for charles to answer charless phone rang through to the message bank odd and what was he doing still there it couldnt matter dom had rounded the last bend and the crash was in view it looked shocking horrific a purple kombi van was on the wrong side of the road it looked as if it had hit a sedan then spun so the sedan had smashed full on into the kombis side the sedan was a crumpled mess the trunk had torn open baggage had been thrown out onto the road a childs doll was lying on the verge looking like a small dreadful corpse a guy in khaki overalls and boots bigger than erins was holding a little girl in his arms the child was sobbing uncontrollably screaming for her mother thats frank the farmer who called us dom said hell well need some local help as well ring graham he hit the brakes and was out of the car clicking onto a number and tossing her his phone before erin could respond okay first things first follow orders but there was no way she was calmly sitting in the car making phone calls she was out of the car as well running toward the wreck as dom hauled gear out of the trunk car smash two miles out of town past doms place she snapped as graham answered dom and i are here weve called the ambulance but we need more help ill have the boys there in minutes graham said and erin thought fleetingly the mans been up all night and here he was helping out again local communities at their best but then she stopped thinking she was at the wreck now and what she saw it was a family sedan the van was higher than the sedan and the front of the sedan was wedged right under the vans chassis dom was already working they only had access on the left side the door of the car had been hauled open dom was half in working on whoever was closest i got the little girl out cos she was screaming frank called hopelessly from behind them i dont know what just take care of her dom called its okay well deal with this it wasnt okay the woman closest to them was in her thirties or early forties she was staring straight ahead whimpering in shock and fear sharon hey its okay lets get you out dom said and she turned her face a little ddom so dom knew them that made itworse a vicious gash ran down the side of sharons head from just above her ear she had the look of someone just returning from unconsciousness erin thought dom was mopping blood from around her mouth erin reached through from the front and took her wrist her pulse was thready and her complexion was sickly blue does it hurt to breathe dom asked nno they had to get her out to reach her partner there was another child in the back seat so much blood far too much blood erin wriggled in underneath dom and slid her hands across the seat feeling for any obstructions my hands are under her knees erin said curtly seat belt undone yes on count of three lift they lifted blessedly she came free they worked as if theyd been trained together dom must have done the same emergency training shed done erin thought appreciatively they had sharon away from the wreck in seconds carrying her over to the verge to where frank still stood helplessly holding the child they laid her on the grass erin had been doing a lightning assessment as theyd moved her the moment they had her down dom was moving back to the wreck erin gave sharon a moment more checking vital signs her airway was clear the gash on her head was bleeding but not gushing they had her on her side so the blood was no longer running down her face there were fractures she thought glancing at the womans leg but she was breathing steadily and was conscious there was no time to check for more stay with her she said to frank sit down beside her with the little girl she took sharons hand sharon dom and i need to get everyone else out of the car frank will look after you and your daughter it was all she had time for she was away back to dom dom had the little boy out of the car before she reached him one look at him and she knew there was urgent need but dom was tugging the little boy past her see to his dad he snapped to her i have max his dads name is ivan and hes in trouble so was the little boy the childs face was a mass of blood but doms command had been urgent and unequivocal ivan the boys father was crumpled against the far side of the car the steeringwheel was crushed against his chest even from here she could see the effort it was for him to breathe his breathing came as short sharp gasps his hand was on his chest and he looked frantic triage no she said pulling back in fast decision ivan had to be pulled from the car before she could help him and it couldnt be a lift because of the urgency it would have to be a messy pull and she couldnt do it she lifted max from doms arms without waiting for him to respond ivan cant breathe and he needs your strength get him out of there ill take over with max breathing tubes in the case thank god for that the little boys breath was bubbling as if he was breathing underwater something had smashed into his face with the amount of blood in his mouth and nose he was likely to drown moving fast she laid him on the verge close to his mother his nose was broken there were smashed teeththe little boy would need reconstructive surgery but that was for the future for now all she could do was clear his mouth and throat set him on his side fit an oral airway and administer oxygen thank god for doms equipment thank god for dom the little boy had gone past terror he hadnt enough strength left to fight her he simply submitted youll be safe max she told him you can breathe now and im giving you something to stop it hurting im popping a mask over your face to make it easier to breathe she manoeuvred him so he was lying propped against his mother frank was still holding the little girl looking more and more terrified by the minute where on earth was help can you set the little girl down on the grass she said to frank and then to sharon can you please hold your daughters hand i need frank to hold maxs mask in place then as no one moved she lifted the little girl bodily from franks grasp and set her down by her mother then she grabbed franks big weatherbeaten hands tugged him down so he was forced to crouch and forcibly put his hand over maxs mask hold that she ordered dont any of you move frank if that mask movesif max looks like hes not getting enough air if theres anything that scares you then you yell loud enough to wake the dead and ill be back but dom needs me dom did need her he had ivan out of the car but ivans breathing was so shallow it was barely there erin took a moment to watch as dom worked ivans chest was hardly movingone side seemed totally still doms fingers were on his throat and he sent her a silent message with his eyes she knew what it had to be hed have felt ivans trachea and found it pushed to one side this had to be a tension pneumothorax the symptoms fitted hed have broken ribs and a puncture to his lung so air was escaping from his lung into his chest every time he breathed the air couldnt be exhaled the pressure would be enough to collapse both lungs dominic had obviously already made the diagnosis he was grabbing what he needed from his bag he had a cannula between his teeth still in its protective sterile casing holding it while he ripped the side of ivans shirt from neck to waist she grabbed a sterile swab from the bag dom looked like hed been going in withoutthere was no time for niceties here when the only imperative was to save the mans life but she moved like lightning hauling the swab open swabbing ivans chest noting the enlarged veins in his neck how the left side of his chest wasnt responding even when he managed to take a breath air would be being sucked out into the chest wall building building so the lungs could no longer expand so no more air could get in he was hardly breathing at all just sharp tiny gasps that did nothing to alleviate the blue of his lips and the terror in his eyes they had to get the pressure off she pulled her hand away leaving the path clear for dombut suddenly the cannula was in her hand youre the emergency specialist dom snapped you go in she didnt argue at one level she appreciated doms hardheadedness that morning hed objected when shed taken over his patientand so he should but now he was deferring to her specialist training ego aside he was already moving on fitting an oxygen mask leaving her to what she had to do she positioned the needle with care but with speed then pushed in with force deep within the chest over the top of the sixth rib in line with the axilla into the thoracic cavity the air hissed out like a burst of steam under pressure shed done this once before and then it had been too late please it wasnt too late now ivans next breaths miraculously were slower and his chest rose and fell rose and fell theyd done it dom had fitted an oxygen mask over ivans face the mans colour was improving already blessed be doms medical kit erin thought again thankfully he had four oxygen cylinders four youll have to restock oxygen before your football team goes diving again she whispered allowing herself a tiny release from tension as ivan took another breath that actually worked letting air into his chest and making his chest wall rise and fall almost normally they needed to get him to hospital fast he needed a chest tube and an underwater seal fitted until his lung had a chance to heal but with the pressure off the other lung could work and he should survive and they were no longer alone there were suddenly vehicles everywhere the cavalry had arrivedin force hey dom said in a voice that was suddenly a bit unsteady his hand was on ivans shoulder his words might be for him but he was looking at erin weve done it well done ivan youre going to be okay mate weve sucked a ruddy great air pocket out of your chest or rather doc erin has were bloody lucky to have her and then as erins eyes filled unaccountably with tears he went on to answer the unspoken questions in ivans eyes sharon and the kids are going to be okay youre going to be okay erin left him to it she stumbledher legs unaccountably werent working properlyover to the verge to do the same thing for sharon your husband and your kids will live it could have been so much worse wheres the driver of the kombi someone demanded it was grahamof course he was wearingof all thingsa kilt later shed discover that the local highland band had been practicing everyone round them was wearing kilts her sense of unreality deepened a nightmare with kilts i couldnt find him frank said the farmer was still seated on the verge one arm full of the little girl the other holding the little boys mask in place erin put a hand on the little girls neck and felt her pulse it was strong and steady i reckon shes gone to sleep doc frank said and erin smiledher first real smile for the evening she left the little girl and turned her attention to sharons leg this would heal she thought but dom wasnt relaxing he was staring around focusing on grahams question the kombi driverwhere the hell he wasnt here when i got here doc frank said swear to god i heard the smash from the dairy i was only a couple of minutes away but he was gone the cab of the kombi was almost intact empty had he been thrown or i need to go dom said urgently as the scream of an approaching ambulance cut the night erin can you take over here theyll all have to be taken to campbelltown or air ambulanced to melbourne ill leave that call to you but everyones stablised whats wrong he closed his eyes briefly she reached instinctively for his hand and he held it hard only for a fraction of a second though as if needing strength before moving on i think this is nathans dads van he told her i have to go there were two ambulances the paramedics were competent officers accustomed to dealing with emergencies a long way from the city dom and erin had done the hard stuff they moved in setting up drips stemming bleeding moving parents and children into the two vehicles making sure they were stabilised erin helped transfer them but they didnt need her to go with them she watched them leave feeling ill shattered at how fast an evening drive could come so close to tragedy butwhere was dom is there any sign the driver of the kombi was hurt she asked and graham shook his head we dont think so the cabs intact and theres no blood nor is there any sign hes been thrown clear it doesnt tell you for sure he wasnt hurt but he shrugged no matter the police will find him her concern grew she had time now to stop and think through doms reaction when hed realised who the driver of the kombi was shed been caught up focusing on sharons leg when dom had told her now she replayed his wordsand remembered fear why the man was a drug addict unpredictable unstable nathan was afraid of him unbidden doms words came back to her i take kids where theres a problema reason they need closer supervision than fosterparents can give problems like martins mother intent on harm nathans father arriving on friday looking ready to do violence back here today why she stood and surveyed the whole crash scene in its entirety what do you reckon happened she asked graham who looked like he was doing the same thing the cops have been looking at the tyre marks graham said it looks like the kombi driver was on the wrong side of the road the cops are saying he didnt even swerve ivan did all the work trying to avoid him then the driver of the kombi her breath caught in fear graham can we leave others to finish here i need to go back to doms she outlined her fears to graham on the short drive hoping she sounded worried for no reason but grahams face confirmed what she was thinking he and tansy take on the kids no one else will have he said grimly kids whod otherwise go into juvenile detention just to get the protection they need but dom can talk down the worst of them ive seen him with a hopheaded father out of his brain with drugs and dom just talked and talked getting more and more boring till the guys eyes glazed over and the threat was past tansy too tansys boring shes a ballbreaker graham said and grinned id like to see any hophead get past our tansy it made her feel betterbut not much can we hurry were already there graham said she was no longer listening the moment the car stopped she was out running toward the house stumbling slightly in her stupid boots but still running hed been there the front door was open there was a hole smashed in the panelling splintered timber there were voices coming from the kitchen dom charles she bucketed through tansy was sitting in front of the fire there was blood spattered down the front of her gorgeous shawl charles was bathing her forehead an expression on his face shed never seen before ruby was sitting on the opposite side of the fire she had martin on her knees rocking him like a baby its okay she was crooning hes gone you saw the police take him away well find nathan dom was standing with his back to the door barking orders into his phone as erin entered he wheeled to face her erin he said blankly and then as he saw graham behind her he said graham thank god ive been trying to reach you i dropped the phone on the road back at the crash graham said briskly smashed whats up i need help he stared blankly at both of them and she couldnt help it erin crossed the few steps separating them she put her hands in his and held her dom he was she thought this mans trouble was her trouble whether he willed it or not whats happened he came here he said nathans dad off his head with drugs hed heard about the firehell theres been no news over easter so the local radio station played it as a major event he must have crashed but he still came he said his son wasnt safe and he was taking him away when nathan said he didnt want to go he hit him tansy intervened and got hit herself oh tansy but charles helped tansy whispered nathan broke free he headed across the road into bushland charles managed to stop michael going after him a couple of cops on the way to the accident stopped and lent a hand theyve arrested michael and taken him away but nathans disappeared he just ran straight into the bush ive been into the bush as far as i dare dom said grimly ive yelled my lungs out he turned to graham his face set and hard i need you mate he told him i need everyone i want him found chapter thirteen this town was amazing these people were amazing the more erin saw of them the more she wanted to be a part of this community last night half the town had been up to a fire now they were turning out to search for one little boy she wasnt allowed to help your feetyou shouldnt be walking on them at all much less traipsing round the countryside looking for nathan dom growled search parties seemed to be organising themselves men and women dividing the district into grids acting methodically and fast dom was desperate to be gone as wellhe organised himself to lead the first search party but graham wanted him close he had to physically hold him back while he made him see sense so we find him graham told him or we think we know where he is the kids terrified you need to be on call to go wherever we need to stop him running i can do that tansy ventured you cant it was charles and once again erin had that flash of something she hadnt seen from charles charles had known tansy for what four hours was there something in the water he knocked you out charles was saying youre not doing anything until we get that head xrayed i can do the calling ruby said diffidently but dom shook his head grim but accepting no grahams right dom said and sos charles ill stay tansy needs an xrayif theres a fracture and we miss it id never forgive myself and i want it done by someone more capable of reading results than me cracked ribs are one thingneurologys another can you take her to campbelltown charles sure and martin and i will keep the home fires burning ruby said it was a platitude said so serenely that it sounded right and erin saw in that moment why dom was so grateful for rubys care that hed taken on fostering himself she saw dom nod and knew that somehow hed been unaccountably comforted by this elderly little woman with her prosaic attitude to life strangely inexplicably it hurt she wanted to do the comforting if hed only let her butcan you get one of the guys to drop erin at her place dom asked graham no she said startled yes he said and suddenly doms voice was steely youre injured and i will not drag you into our lives even further i dont think she needs to be dragged ruby said placidly no matter dom said still harsh he met her gaze full on erin i cant afford to be distracted it causesits causedno just go please it was hard to get her voice to work they were all looking at her she knew her distress was showing but she didnt care doms expression was implacable he really didnt want her youllyoull let me know when you find him she whispered of course we will ruby said warmly but dom had already turned away to talk to graham so she went home one of the searchers drove herthey were starting their search in the town and working their way back through the bush she was dropped off at her new home it was growing dark and cold or maybe that was just her she let herself into the house and marilyn greeted her with joy she knelt she hugged her dogand she burst into tears what will i do marilyn she sobbed i love him to distraction i love them all to distraction in response the dog gave her a huge dogkiss from chin to nose erin hiccuped on a sob it turned into a sort of laugh and she tried to haul herself together well be okay she whispered you and me well be fine oh but nathanand dom dom would be going out of his mind pacing waiting for news she ought to be there he wouldnt let her how he expects me to calmly go to bed she said savagely to marilyn i cant okay my feet hurt but theyre getting better socks and trainers would support them so they dont hurt i could search but you dont know the area she admitted to herself she didnt feel like she had any common sense left but what there was surfaced for a moment you dont know where to look your feet are sore and youd hold searchers back or youd get yourself lost lost the word itself was frightening the area around the town was thick bushland if nathan was hiding it was wild i wouldnt go into the bush if i was nathan she told marilyn and marilyn wagged her butt in agreement neither would you erin said hugging her tight for she had to hug someone where would i go if i was nathan that was easy id go find dom me and nathan both she said to marilyn giving her a shamefaced grin i have it bad so if nathan was looking for dom hed go out to the car crash she decided really this was quite a sensible conversation erin v erin no he wouldnt she said hed think dom was here she was thinking it through and relaying her thoughts to marilyn this afternoon dom left home to bring me here as far as nathan knows dom is still here i bet he knows where this place is and its she paused lightbulb moment its about three miles from doms place just around the headland she breathed nathan thinks his father is looking for him would he go by road i wouldnt she told marilyn answering herself id go by the beach i couldnt get lost that way id get out of sight of the house and then id sneak back over to the beach i could hide under the cliffs and id think no one would look for me there so ring dom and tell him she lifted her phone from her pocket and paused theyd already have thought of it she decided and the way dom had looked at herlike shed distracted him and this was the result he didnt need any more distraction and she didnt actually know his phone number but but you reckon the puppies can do without you for a few minutes she asked marilyn i know this is a big ask but its dark on the beach and i wouldnt mind company dom was going nuts pacing in the darkness waiting for news more than anything else he wanted to join the searchers to yell his lungs out as half the town was doing but graham was right he had to be accessible if nathan needed to be coaxed out of hiding the country west of the road was wild and mountainous a little boy would lose himself quickly and stay lost the thought didnt bear thinking but it was with him and it wouldnt go nathan had been gone for two hours terrified he could have travelled fast ill be crossed off the list of fosterparents after this he thought grimly even if nathan was found hed had to do a hard sell to be allowed to take these two boys both it had been argued would be safer in a secure facility and suddenly he thought i wouldnt mind keeping them the thought was like a sunbeam piercing through thick cloud to keep these boysto give emotional commitment long term hed been walking back and forth along the headland behind the house watching the moonlit beach desperate to see a small figure struggling home but the tide was almost full nathan would have to be off the beach there was nowhere to hide there the thought wasnt fading he wouldnt mind keeping them martin and nathan hed had martin for six months now and nathan for only a little less it was the longest hed ever had kids they were great little boys brimful of potential scarred by life they were starting to emerge from that scarring and become great every other child hed cared for hed said goodbye to with a sense of relief his planwhat he did for all of themwas to care for them while there was a threat then pass them on tansy did the warm and fuzzy stuff shed divorced early from a bad marriage she loved the kids he provided the house the security she did the rest but now he wanted more and he wanted erin after two days stupid only maybe it wasnt stupid what if such a thing really existed his mother had believed in it with her whole heart love at first sight what if erin wasit she was messing with his head erin nathan erin martin marilyn erin hisfamily okay so shed just walk slowly along the beach carefully so her feet didnt hurt she wasnt holding anyone up and she couldnt get lost she was her own personal little search party marilyn strolled a couple of hundred yards with her then looked apologetically up at her i have my pups her look said but id rather be doing what youre doing she turned and headed sedately back along the beach so it was dark and she was alone with just a torch for company she couldnt go much further anyway half a mile from her house the headland became rocky and hard to negotiate shed found the torch in the kitchen cupboard but she didnt know how long the battery would last the last thing she wanted was to become another person on the lost list okay she conceded finally dom was right her feet hurt and shed run out of beach the cliffs loomed dark and dangerous there was no way nathan could get round here at high tide but a little voice was still whispering if hed tried and the tide had come in she should go home but first crazy or not she picked her way over the rocks as far as she could before it got downright dangerous then she stared out into the night waiting for there to be a pause in the crash of the surf waiting then nathan she yelled it with all the power she could muster she ached to hear she wanted to hear so much that when she did she thought she was imagining it but no it was a childs thin voice high and terrified help me dammit hed ring her hed rung every set of searchers hed paced so long he was practically paced out he was going crazy nathan nathan and along with it like an echo erin erin erin couldnt help but he could justphone he had her number to let her know when nathan was found it wasnt a real weakness it wasnt like he was admitting he needed her he was just giving her an update four rings five it switched to the message bank the phone would be inside and shed be outside pacing he knew it as surely as he knew himself he knew her and hed hurt her shed offered to be with him and hed knocked her backbut it was more than offering to be with him that was why hed sent her away they both knew what was happening between them hell his head was doing him in he wanted nathan to be found so he could concentrate on something else like erin she seems lovely it was ruby coming up behind him he groaned nathanll be safe ruby said with quiet confidence you kids used to run away all the time the townspeople wont give up till they find him she tucked her arm into his you have a whole community of caring not bad for a loner im not a loner she put her wrinkled hand into his and held hard i know as i said she seems lovely ruby its way too soon ive known her for less than three days its never too soon she said serenely youve been waiting all your life for this dont be ridiculous shes not answering her phone she picked her way gingerly over the rocky outcrop the cliff face was sheer but part of the cliff had caved in years before to form a sort of path between cliff and sea she climbed maybe two hundred yards her torch playing out ahead trying to see where the cry had come from once she slipped she fell only a couple of feet but it scared her she clambered back vaguely aware her phone was ringing nathan was screaming again and she forgot about her phone for now it wasnt a comeandgetme scream it was a scream of sheer terror from the sea she steadied and shone her torch across the waves he was maybe twenty feet from the base of the cliff forty or fifty yards from her on what was a tiny rocky island he must have been trying to reach the ledge where she was when the tide had beaten him the tide was still rising while she watched another wave smashed over his tiny island he was down on all fours screaming and clinging erin sucked in her breath in horror she had to wait for the wave to recede to see if he was still there he wasbut only just once more wave would push him in some things were just plain dumb like jumping into the sea in the dark as the wind was rising but the wave was receding giving her a moments calm it was all the time she hadand she was all nathan had she slid from her ledge and struck out for nathan so why isnt she answering the phone i dont know dear ruby said maybe she isnt carrying it some people have been known to live to a ripe old age without ever owning a cellphone he smiled but his smile was perfunctory the first time i rang it rang out now it says the phones turned off or out of range theres no way shell have turned it off shes as worried as i am yet you sent her home okay im a fool but now its probably out of battery ruby said wisely you young ones spend your lives looking for phone chargers or getting cross cos your batterys flat we recharged her battery last night maybe it got soot in it she regarded him sideways you know what youre going to have to find out i cant leave here you heard graham i heard graham tell us you need to be available if any of the search parties need you i suspect erins made up her own search party i suspect she needs you you think hey dont ask me ruby said wryly im just an old lady who doesnt own a cellphone but im here and i can talk nathan out of a hideyhole at a hundred paces if need be martins asleep i can go to nathan if they need me so you go look for nathan yourself look for erin too she smiled and reached up to kiss him on the cheek and while youre about it what about searching for your family at the same time nathans island was eight feet wide at its widest in the centre was a jagged knob thats why he hadnt been swept offhed been able to cling to it erin swam the few yards to the rock in record time she hauled herself up onto the ledge then grabbed nathan and the rocky knob as another breaker crashed over them it took all her strength to hold on when the wave receded nathan was stuck to her like a limpet holding on with hands and feet and she was clutching the knob beyond him with the incoming tide this was only going to get worse it was a miracle nathan had held on this long can you swim nno then youll have to float she said spitting water and let me hold you but nathan if you try and hold me well both drown im scared me too so much for reassurance but it seemed to work nathan seemed to steady the bravery of himall of five years old and he was a hero a smaller wave washed over them they didnt go under this time but another wave was bearing down after this next one erin said urgently well roll back into the water and let the wave push us toward the cliff as soon as the waves past you lie on your back and ill tow you if another wave comes youre not to panicjust hold your nose and wait till it passes ill hold you around your shoulders youre not to try and grab me cos i have to use all my energy to swim do you think you can do that is dom coming nathan quavered of course he is erin said heres the wave nathe ready set go she wasnt at the house but marilyn was in the kitchen pacing back and forth to the back door so wheres your mistress dom said crouching down and fondling her ears what have you done with her as if in answer marilyn crossed to the open back door and stared anxiously into the night toward the beach i told her not to search dom said so savagely that marilyn looked up at him in surprise he relented and crouched down to give her another pat i spose you think thats dumb telling erin to keep out of my life marilyn groaned in agreementor maybe because she really liked what dom was doing behind her ears but doggy massage wasnt on the agenda okay he said and straightened lets assume shes gone along the beach im guessing shes heading toward my place he should wait for help for backup but everyones looking for nathan he told marilyn i dont want them to stop just because one dumb female doctor who you happen to love where had that come from no matterit just hadand once thought couldnt be retracted okay who i just happen to love he said resigned regardless shes risking her neck and her feet walking along the beach at high tide in the dark but who am i to query her motives okay marilyn while we wait for the rest of the world to find nathan i need to find erin she had nathan safe for now she was shoving him out of the water onto the rock ledge shed set off from but even as she did so she saw their escape route had been cut off part of the ledge shed clambered over was now awash at least the rocks they were on now were dry she hauled herself up after nathan she hugged him tight and she tried to assess whether they could clamber back to the beach between waves the answer was no the sea was building the strengthening wind whipping up waves already swelling with the tide it had been risky enough trying to get nathan here she darent move any further at least the rock they were on wasnt slippery maybe it was higher than the highwater mark please will dom come and find us nathan asked in a tiny voice and she hugged him close and thought he was such a brave little kid brave beyond his years to be allocated a father like michael it wasnt fair she wantedshe wanted she knew what she wanted dom only took kids in peril when the peril was pastif she could manoeuvre her way round the challenge of nathans appalling fatherif dom didnt want nathanif dom didnt want her i seem to be adding to my family she told nathan hugging him close me and marilyn and three puppies and now you if i can find a way to wiggle you into my life if we can figure what to do with your dad they say the heart expands to fit all comers i wonder how my mum and dad feel about becoming grandparents erin dom was shouting into the rising wind starting to worry in earnest as he saw the sea building storms could arrive without warning and this had all the signs of being a beauty dear god nathan was out in it and erin what the hell was she playing at erin cooee he stopped dead erin cooee it was the australian bush call echoing over the waves where there was no way she could have got further than the ledge hed reached where cooee she must have reached further before the tide came in dammit was she trying to kill herself didnt she know cooee alright im coming he said grimly hold on their ledge was precarious it might be safe for a little longer but the waves were already reaching just beneath the rock they were on swimming out to nathan the sea had at least been clear here though the partial cliff collapse meant the sea was churning round jagged rocks on her own she might have clambered back knowing shed probably be able to haul herself out if she was washed in with nathan thoughnot hed been extraordinarily brave hed lain limply in her grasp as shed towed him here and for a fiveyearold to do that she was so proud of him she could cry but she couldnt take him further neither could she leave him to get help her phone was deadsalt water wasnt great for reception all they could do was wait and hope hell come wont he nathan asked again through chattering teeth of course he will erin said but it sounded hollow even to her stay or go damned if she did damned if she didnt stay there was no choice she held onto nathan she hugged him and she prayed dom dom dom erin when had her name ever sounded as good cooee shed expected him to go for help shed never thought hed clamber round the rocks he was ten yards away before she saw him in the moonlight hed been washed from a rock and had a handhold again hauling himself out of the sea and up to safety she didnt move nathan was hugged hard against her and it was nathan who was directing traffic were up here dom look out theres another wave duck hurry were here hed reach them she thought mistily her kelpie i am a man upon the land i am a kelpie upon the sea she sang it with joy in her heart nathan stared at her like shed lost her mind and dom hauled himself up the last rock and heard what she was singing he stared at her as if he couldnt believe his eyesand then he burst out laughing he gathered the pair of them into his arms and then he kissed her chapter fourteen first things first or rather second because the kiss came first but that didnt count as it was imperative erin tugged herself from doms hold and smiled mistily at her love i knew youd come marilyn told me you were here good old marilyn she said happily i rescued her and shes rescued me right back but dom mmm he held her tight with nathan squeezed somewhere in between i dare say you didnt think about it on your very noble climb around here but we cant climb back and my phone got wet the tides still coming in these waves are getting higher and if im not mistaken your phone just got wet too yeah but i phoned before i climbed he said lovingly and she blinked you phoned triage he said what they taught us in medical school think about dangerie personal safety first youre wonderful she said happily there was no earthly reason to be happy she was soaked she was battered she wasnt in the least bit safeyetand here she was grinning like a fool just because this man had put himself in the same deadly peril she was in i love you he said and she stopped grinning ppardon i think you heard dom said he hauled nathan onto his knee dom was sitting on the end of their ledge his feet hanging over the side so his already soaking feet got even wetter it didnt look like he cared though do you think she heard nathe you said you loved her nathan said why good question dom said umdom yes my love he said so lovingly she thought shed drowned and gone to heaven but this wouldnt do she told herself severely trying to focus on something other than what hed just said there was a certain amount of triage she needed to do herself if this wasnt to be the shortest engagement in the history of the world umyou said you rang before you came i did he saidmodestly i told graham i thought you were stuck on a cliff at moonlight bluffthats where were sitting by the way i said if he didnt hear back within ten minutes could he contact the authorities and get a helicopter you didnt she breathed i knowmr wonderful he said modestly and she choked umhow do we know the helicopters free to come save us she asked she shouldnt ask nathan had relaxed slumping against dom feeling safe and loved andhome like she wanted to be and she could be she thought dazed she just had to get these niggling worries sorted first like whether or not they were going to drown we dont dom said so ive organised one of the fishermen to bring his boat round from the harbour and play floodlights on the cliff he peered out into the darkness he ought to be here any minute if the helicopter doesnt arrive grahams organising guys to abseil from the cliff top and haul us up he winced as a wave splashed to his thighs i hope they hurry you guys have got the best spot im getting cold you didnt order a heater and hot soup while you were at it i suppose she said waspishly and he grinned didnt think of it he admitted nowwhere were we oh yes i love you seriously seriously he said and suddenly his tone was serious i know love at first sight is impossible at least thats what i thought i cant believe its taken me three days to admit im wrong but i felt it the moment i saw you i wanted you then i thought its crazy all the time you were helping me even offering to work here i was thinking this was nuts i must be nuts what do they say marry in haste repent at leisure thats what i believed and thenthe car crash another wave hit his legs wow this waters cold dont you dare stop she said i dont care how cold the water is this is a story i need to hear right through to the end okay his voice gentled and his hand gripped hers okay i stood at the car crash and i saw how close that little family had come to being wiped out and you know what i thought i thought at least theyd had each other they were with each other and i thought even if i died right nowwhich mind you if this water gets any colder is on the cards shut up and talk she said lovingly yeah well he said and sighed okay if we died right now which isnt going to happen by the way nathan because my plan is brilliant then i wouldnt have spent a single night with the woman i love with who nathan asked teeth chattering confused but still trying to keep up with erin but you did spent a night with her he objected concentrating fiercely last night we all slept together after the fire so we did he agreed id forgotten that okay then but im thinking i want more than that i want lots of nights and then when i saw those footprints leading to the rocks and i thought i might have lost youboth his voice cracked and it was all erin could do to stay sitting stillwhich was sensibleand not launch herself into his armswhich wasnt so im admitting it he said im in love love at first sight its crazy i dont believe it for a minute but it seems to have happened nathan tell erin im a very sensible person tell her i never take risks so climbing round here rather than wait for the helicopter except when theyre absolutely necessary for survival of the people i love you know my love that my mother fell in love at first sight over and over again it made me think it could never be true but when i saw your footprints disappearing onto rock i figured she had it right all along her choices were lousy but the concept still holds ive fallen in love with you ill do anything it takes to keep you with me for ever and im saying it here and nowyoure necessary for my survival you dontyou cant know what youre talking about i dont he said and smiled again that heartstopping smile she loved so much she could see it clear as day in the moonlight or maybe she could feel it but she knew it was directed straight at her crooked and teasing and just a little bit wicked teach me he said teach me about loving wow they could have fun she thought suddenly a little bit breathlessly she and this man they could have a family or maybe they already had a family they could have a bigger family i love you too she said so fast her tongue tripped over itself she grinned back at him a great dopy grin a little bit misty boy do my parents have some readjusting to do i cant wait to meet them a wave bigger than the rest smashed into their rock their hold on each other tightened whatever happened they were in this together out to sea a fishing boat had rounded the headland its floodlights were playing over the cliffs the light hit what the fishermen were looking forand steadied a man a woman and a child the child somehow squashed between the adults the man kissing the woman as if hed never let go a man a woman and a childa family the helicopter arrived fifteen minutes after the floodlight hit them the waves were starting to constitute a serious threat but rescue was on time skilled search and rescue personnel were lowered with harnesses lifting first nathan then erin and finally dom graham had what seemed to be the entire community on top of the cliff waiting for them every searcher in the district must have got the news and hotfooted it to the scene to be in on this happy ending dom saw them all as he was lowered into their midst did these people ever sleep ruby was there too holding a sleepy martin reaching to hug him with martin squished in the middle ugh martin said youre wet and cold said a paramedic he recognised coming toward him with a thermal blanket im fine dom said waving away help he was searching the crowd for who he needed to find erin and nathan were warming them inside the ambulance the paramedic told him nathans bordering on hypothermia were guessing though that you wont want us to take him to hospital whats the use of having two doctors if we cant take care of our own but dom was pretty cold himself and the paramedic was focusing on him as a patient nownot as a doctor yeah well well strip you off and get you warm or were going nowhere the guy told him and ruby was concurring you do as we say or ill take you to campbelltown hospital myself she said you and whose army any cheek and ill box your ears she said and he thought she just might umyoure not supposed to be here dom said trying to get his head round what was happening i knew youd be rescued and martin and i wanted to see ruby told him and we both want to see you with erin you want to see our happy ending she said serenely go on then theres blankets and warmth and no wind in the ambulance oh and did i mention erins in there she grinned at the paramedics take him away boys but leave the doors open he had no choice he was propelled into the back of the ambulance erin was sitting on one of the stretchers she was draped in thick warm blankets nathan was snuggled close by her side kiss the girl doc someone called from the back of the crowd right dom said drily and tried to close the doors but the paramedic was holding the doors firmly open i reckon you have to give the people their moneys worth he said chuckling the guys on the boat said you were kissing when they found you the news has gone round the town and back again most of these people have been trekking through bushland to find the kiddie they want a happy ending like you kissing the girl someone called out like in all the best movies kiss the new doc someone else called hell he didnt do emotionuntil tonight he didnt do connectionuntil tonight and he surely hadnt ever done public displays of the same dominic spencer was a man who walked alone right when erin was huddled under her blanket looking out at him smiling and smiling when nathan was waving to martin when ruby was looking on with her get on with it boy expression and when this whole amazing community was watching waiting for him to kiss their new doc what was the use of arguing and why would he want to walking alone was for idiots he decided right there right then he tossed it aside along with any last reservations about love at first sight so taking that all into account there didnt appear to be a choice he couldnt stand up in the ambulance anyway so he knelt on one knee erin carmody will you take my hand in marriage he asked and there was a collective gasp from the assembled crowd erins eyes were dancing you idiot is that any way to greet a proposal i dont know this is only my second i need a few more to practise with you cant have any more i love you she smiled mistily down at him i love your kids she ventured he met her and raised i love your dog and i love your town oh and rubys fabulous erin he said deciding it was time to get things back on track mmm ive asked you to marry me you dont believe in love at first sight ive known you for three days thats the longest courtship ill tolerate so he was starting to sound exasperated will you marry me only if youll share share what your kids your house your patients her laughter faded your dreams your fears yourself you i will he said and there was that something in his voice that told the crowd of onlookers that this was a vow he meant for life erins misty smile grew even more misty her heart was singing a silly joyous song a great wonderful chorus a song of love will you he said and then there was nothing for a girl to do her crazy wonderful doctor her saviour her love he was waiting for an answer she glanced out at their entranced onlookers you realise theres no way youll get out of this one why would i want to why indeed she whispered she slid down onto the cramped floor of the van so she was kneeling right in front of him she took his hands in hers and she held as shed hold for life i do she whispered and then louder so the audience up the back could hear i do she repeated and she would have said it for a third time but she was caught up and kissed so thoroughly that her third response was lost to everyone but themselves i do and she did it involved almost militarylike manoeuvres but they honeymooned alone ruby took martin and nathan to dolphin bay promising them a month of beach and sun and fun theyll have a ball dom told his brideand he sounded almost wistful you dont want to go too hed smiled and shaken his head not this time dolphin bays the best place in the world if youre a kid in trouble but i have a better place to take my wife and he was free to take her for amazingly charles had offered to take care of the medical needs of bombadeen while tansy dogsat bombadeen had been seeing a lot of charles lately tansy had even caught her bouquet there were developments with the kids too applications had been made to make dom and erin into martin and nathans longterm fosterparents nathans dad was in gaol and likely to remain there martins mother had been sighted in nepal and no other parent was in the picture so it was settled when their honeymoon was over dom and erin could return to bombadeen gather their family and move forward for both erin and dom it felt like life had started the moment erin had walked into his house hed opened the door and shed walked into his heart into the heart of his kids into the heart of his community sentimental maybe it was the wedding had been fantastic theyd done the full bridal bit erin had let her somewhat bewildered mother indulge every last fantasy on her wedding dress and thered never been such a magnificent frock she had been all lace and flounces and swirling skirts it had been crazy shed loved it and so had dom dom had looked pretty damned handsome too a tuxedo no less the sight of them together had made her mother cry but the tears had been tears of joy her parents loved dominic after the first shockwell why wouldnt they what else tansy was taking two of marilyns pups one for her and one for charles erin was giving the third to her parents to keep peppy company the thought made her chuckleas so many things made her chuckle these days and nowthis was the first night of their honeymoon they were about as far from bombadeen as it was possible to be for im not sharing my honeymoon with anyone dom growled and erin agreed entirely hed found a wonderful tropical hideawaya room built on stilts over a lagoon so beautiful she hardly believed it was real theyd flown here in normal travelling clothes but dom had insisted they bring their wedding finery tonight just for themselves they dressed again for now is the time for us dom decreed and it was so as the sun set over the water they dressed in full bridal wear erin needed help with the finishing touches dom helped her fasten the garland of tiny pink ribbon roses into her hair then kissed the nape of her neck so gently she sighed with pure erotic pleasure there it was done once again they were bride and groom a discreet waiter brought them dinner and icecold champagne they dined out on their tiny balcony overlooking the lagoon the waiter disappeared there was nothing but the water lapping gently underneath them fireflies flitting over the water moonlight and starlight reflected on the sea and nothing else except each other we fell in love at first sight dom said softly raising his champagne flute in her honour we have all our lives to get to know each other i believe i know you already erin said softly i knew you the moment i saw you my heart knew you thats corny he said and smiled so it is true though he pushed back his chair would you like to dance my love i believe i would she whispered and they did a long slow waltz with no music but the music that was inside them he held her close against his heart so wheres the man who walks alone now she teased holding him against her savouring the feel of his body holding her close her dress was swishing around them in delicious folds of silk and lace she was a white cloud on a starlit night there was nothing and no one but man and wife in love maybe i never was alone he whispered into her hair maybe from the time ruby took me in from the time her care made me want to take in kids from the time you walked into my life from the time i decided to be a dog breederwhere does love start where does it end it never ends he whispered swinging her round and round and round and you know the lovely thing about family what we can use em he said in quiet satisfaction we may have kids and dogs but we also have your parents and ruby and tansy and charles thats five great kid sitters so whenever i want my wife entirely to myself why would you want that he chuckled why indeed let me show you he lifted her high into his arms and held her against his heart they gazed together out over the starlit water and then firmly dom turned his back on the loveliness of the night he carried his wife into their luxurious room where a great wide bed was waiting there were crisp white sheets mounds of downstuffed pillows and soft soft duvets what more could two lovers want only each other he lowered her onto the sheets and started unfastening the tiny buttons at her breast one by one such a waste she teased softly to take it all off again and again and again he whispered slipping the dress from her shoulders and sinking to lie beside her for ill love you again and again for as long as we both shall live that sounds just fine to me she whispered she wound her arms around his neck and tugged him forward so she could kiss him deeply properly wonderfully as a woman should as a wife should that sounds fabulous she whispered as long as i can love you right back marion lennox
