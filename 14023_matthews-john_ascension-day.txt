john matthews ascension day october libreville louisiana at first larry wasnt sure why the sound had awoken him hed become familiar with all the usual nighttime sounds the clunk of the cell doors and the rattle of keys whenever anyone had to be let in or out unexpectedly after last shutdown the steady ominous clump of boots along the steel walkways with the regular cell patrols every hour punctuated by the impromptu sliding back of two or three inspection hatches along the line the mumble of the guards at the end and the occasional peal of laughter the jibes and taunts of new prisoners or regulars whod suddenly fallen from grace the gentle sobbing of some of those same new inmates that might take up to a week to finally abate and the klaxon blare of the amtrak from baton rouge to jackson seven miles away across the bayou plain a siren call to the prisoners from the world outside elusive freedom only one of eight attempted breakouts over the past thirty years had got even that far and theyd all been rounded up within the week between new orleans and baton rouge over the past eleven long years these sounds had been lawrence tyler durrants nightly companions but this sound was different he could recognize the voices of two of the guards but they were fighting not to be heard little more than muted whispers along with the soft sliding back of the bolts on a cell door normally their bootsteps would be heavy and purposeful celldoor bolts would be slammed back like gunshots whatever the time of night and the prisoners name shouted out as if by some miracle the clamour of the guards approach might not have awoken him along with everyone else on the cellblock row this time they didnt want anyone to hear them larry kept his breathing low and shallow trying to pick out more but suddenly his heart was drumming fast and strong threatening to drown everything out and when he finally tuned in beyond his own heartbeat everything was still and silent as if they somehow knew he was listening in then a sudden flurry of shuffling footsteps from five or six cells along what what the ffffmmm even from that muffled exclamation before a hand was clamped across to completely strangle it larry clearly recognized the clipped latino intonation rodriguez roddy whod managed to make him smile and laugh on even the darkest of days a rare spark of light and life in this pit of gloom hed called home for over a decade and one of the closest friends hed ever had inside or out he couldnt just close his mind and shut his eyes as he had to so much over the years maybe he could have turned away if he thought they were just going to give roddy a beating but hed seen that look fired across the canteen earlier by tally shavell it was only a fleeting stare but in libreville that was often all you got as warning the last two on the end of that same look from tally had both been killed one with a shiv through the neck in the showers the other garrotted with a guitar string there was no reason to believe that with roddy it would be any different especially after the beating tally had given him five months back tally didnt issue second warnings larry looked towards his cells makeshift altar with its array of photos for inspiration his mother whod died after a stroke on year five of his sentence ten months after his appeal failed his father whod died when he was only fourteen mercifully before hed started to slip into bad ways his wife francine who hadnt visited him for the first five years and after that only infrequently depending on her currentpartnersituation though they still hadnt divorced yet his son joshua now twelve who except for some recent email contact hed seen at most halfadozen times over the years occasional birthdays and at christmastime the only one not represented from his family was his elder sister whod disowned him the day of his incarceration told his mother as if she didnt already have enough heartbreak that day that as far as she was concerned he no longer exists but swamping his family photos were religious prints dalis christ on the cross michelangelos creation of adam da vincis last supper caravaggios st francis raphaels madonna and child when word had first got around that larry had found religion one of the other inmates sal peretti had his aunt who still lived in her native umbria send a collection of prints and cards eleven in all from the gift shop at perugia cathedral to complete the array on his makeshift altar upon sight of the finished display given a misty eerie glow from fifteen interspersed candles roddy had commented simply christ exactly larry smiled back drolly now larry wasnt looking just at the altar for inspiration but beyond his eyes boring through to the hole theyd dug in the wall behind along the ventilation shaft then the twists and doglegs through three hundred yards of ducting barely enough to squeeze through and two more walls before arriving at the vents by the boiler room then the final sixtyfoot wastepipe slide to the achalaya river the passage that the five of them himself roddy bc sal peretti and theo mellor knew every inch of had consumed every spare minute they could steal away over the past ten months thats where theyd be taking roddy for sure the boiler room deep in the prisons bowels where the clank and hiss of the boilers and pipes and twofoot thick walls would prevent even the loudest screams reaching the cells above larry also knew that if he used their escape passage to get to the boiler room it would be uncovered their last hope gone and four of them condemned to die those were the odds at libreville twenty per cent reprieved pardoned or commuted to life imprisonment eighty per cent executed that was the choice right there roddys life saved for four others lost including his own and with two or three of them now with roddy what chance did he have in any case of being able to save him another muted mumble from roddy fading quickly with the rapid shuffle of footsteps along the outside walkway gave him a sharp prompt he had to decide quickly but larry durrant stayed staring at his makeshift altar frozen with indecision just when he needed guidance the most there was nothing thats the original trial preparation file thats the trial transcript and notes appeal preparation and appeal transcript and notes john langfranc piled each file on the desk before him some of them four inches thick with an appropriate pause finally any case notes since the last file was thinnest of all though to be honest not much has happened over the last seven years lawrence durrant has been all but forgotten until now now that theyre about to kill him jac said though his disdain could equally have been aimed at the mountain of paperwork hed have to plough through over the coming days langfranc raised an eyebrow and smiled smugly first thing to get clear jac is that the state of louisiana never kills anyone they execute process fulfil sentencing lethally inject expedite and terminate but they never kill if youre going to use a word like kill youll have to get used to putting legally in front presumably that one word differentiates the states actions from those of the people theyre killing sorry processing why me jac asked fair question thought langfranc he shrugged time for you to prove yourself i guess no point in embellishing beyond that trying to kid jac that this might be a landmark glory case they knew each other too well for that now and with jac only passing his criminal law bar exams ten months ago hed be aware that he was a long way from being handed the firms prize cases you and i both know that if there was a good angle left in all of this langfranc waved one hand across the files beaton would have taken it himself clive beaton senior criminal trial lawyer at payne beaton and sawyer new orleans second largest law firm at which langfranc was a junior partner strange title junior for someone fiftytwo years old jac had always thought in a way it further underlined langfrancs frustration that he should have been made a senior partner earlier perhaps one reason why the two of them had bonded so well the feeling that the firms main headpats and accolades had gone to others often less deserving though in jacs case that was mainly because hed spent his first years wallowing in corporate and tax law before hed turned to criminal law the easy route after his initial years of practice in france commercial law in louisiana followed the french napoleonic code criminal law didnt langfranc looked up as the clatter from the general office drifted in ive rescheduled donneley for threefifteen penny vance his pa who jac also shared as a secretary said through the halfopen door that will give you a clear hour at liberty street oh and jem payne has called for an update briefing on borkowski before you head out this afternoon so you might have to cut lunch short to make the time the information brought a faint slouch an extra ruffle to langfrancs appearance he always wore the best versace or missoni suits with slipon italian loafers to match but with his wild wavy greying hair to jac he still looked somehow unkempt as if thered been a strong breeze on his way into work then the rush of the day simply kept him that way thanks langfranc sighed as the door closed only ten minutes into the day and already everything was at full tilt he brought his attention back to jac and durrants files its a nogoer from the outset full confession every possible angle exhausted at the appeal no new evidence since your only hope is to try and get our good or bad lawrence durrant pardoned throw all on the mercy of our good or bad governor the illustrious piers candaret and to a lesser extent the board of pardons jacs eyes narrowed candaret holds the whip hand without a doubt he nominates the board to begin with and while theyre meant to sift through and review everything on his behalf when it comes to big cases he likes to have a handson first looksee and while hes also meant to accept their recommendations in many cases hes gone his own way so youll file simultaneously with both of them but the buck stops with candaret and thats all theres left to do prepare a simple plea letter well theres a tad more to it than that youre going to have to plough through most of this to get the tone right for the letter hit the right notes durrants apparently very religious candaret is too or at least he pushes christian and family values at every photo opportunity and by all claims durrant has been a model prisoner kept his nose clean so those are probably good start points were talking about quite a long considered clemency plea six or seven pages maybe more plus any relevant file attachments it might only take a day to prepare the letter but you could spend a good week in preparation as langfranc fought to boost the cases merits jacs quizzical eyebrow merely arched higher for gods sake jac this is a big case for louisiana murder cases they dont come bigger so dont make light of it and whatever might or might not be involved also dont lose sight of whats at stake here good or bad or rotten to hells core a mans life i know i know jac held up one hand in submission and bowed his head slightly when langfranc had first told him hed be getting the case he was excited murder of the wife of adelay roche one of louisianas wealthiest industrialists the case had occupied more newspaper column inches than any other louisiana case since the garrisonjfk investigation hed immediately dived into the library on st charles street to leaf through clippings but most of the attention had been at the time of the trial and the appeal for the past seven years the newspapers and the world outside had forgotten about lawrence tyler durrant though now no doubt thered be a renewed flurry of media activity i suppose im just disappointed to know that all the main angles have gone all avenues for appeal already exhausted all im left with is sweeping up the dust of the case the only shot at appeal was centred around durrants accident and his resultant memory lapses at the time and all hopes on that front died seven years ago langfranc shrugged and as i said if there were any angles left beaton would have taken the case himself but its still a big case jac the biggest life or death for larry durrant and every local tv network and newspaper and some beyond covering which way its going to swing you might not be beatons golden boy but the fact that hes even given you a high profile case like this even if all thats left is a clemency plea means that hes noticed you you exist therefore i am langfranc smiled back thinly jac mcelroy had set his cap on criminal law with a determination that probably was largely lost on old man beaton at thirtyone with six years practice under his belt he could have just kept coasting along with corporate law raking in the big bucks taken the easy route but no hed wanted to do criminal law so that meant going back to square one and taking a fresh set of bar exams alongside a bunch of freshfaced graduates while still juggling the remainder of his corporate caseload so that meant he was either crazy or it was a real vocation from jacs first ten months of criminal casehandling langfranc hadnt yet made his mind up which jac was thoughtful for a second whats candarets track record on pardons and reprieves pardons are rare and will no doubt now be doubly difficult since the last but one guy pardoned aaron harvey also africanamerican as it happens killed again just six months back with commuted to life theres far more chance i think running somewhere between one in five or six but that could be one of the first things to check along with case histories get a feel for what might hit the right note with candaret so slim chances but not impossible langfranc held one palm out better than that buffoon in texas like his predecessor he sends everyone for the chop no exceptions thinks thats what the public wants might make him potential white house material and floridas not much better at least with candaret theres some chance jac studied the files a second longer then laid one hand firmly on top of them exhaling wearily dont worry slim hopes or not ill give it my best shot i wont let larry durrant down but belying the brooding look that jac gave the files langfranc caught a fleeting gleam in his eyes challenge defiance that sounded a faint alarm bell in jac mcelroys first year with the firm langfranc had often found him sullen and contemplative which as theyd got to know each other hed learnt was due to the recent death of jacs father a scotsman who twentyodd years ago had taken his family to france to pursue his dream of running an artists retreat but langfranc had also discovered that nothing lifted jac out of that slump like a good challenge of only eleven criminal cases that jac had so far handled solo the most serious a grandtheft auto and representing a colourful local forger morvaun jaspar hed turned four of them into major productions and no grandstanding and glorysearching on this one no screaming the clients innocence against impossible odds thats not what beaton wants nor what the case calls for rest easy ill be a good boy jac stood up and hoisted the files under one arm firing langfranc a strained smile as he took on the extra weight ill do what im told and just sweep up the dust just a look thered been a few derisory looks from tally to roddy during the first couple of years but nothing too intense or worrying just a sly conciliatory smile and shrug funny guy as the other inmates guffawed and bellylaughed at roddys latest quip none of the comments were aimed at tally and on occasion when the target was someone he didnt like hed join in laughing with everyone else but gradually resentment grew in tally at roddys constant flow of jokes and jibes as if as roddys popularity grew as a result tally felt that his power base was being threatened or simply because humour undermined the mood of menace and fear which helped tally operate more effectively but that was exactly why everyone loved roddy a rare bright light in the stifling gloom he lifted everyones spirits made them forget even if for only part of the day where they were for larry in particular roddy had been a godsend a lifeline arriving at libreville only five months after larrys mother died and his spirits were at their lowest just a look the first came when roddy compared the grunts snorts and hisses coming from the men in the muscleyard to the pigs at feeding time in librevilles farm compound tally overheard and took it as an insult of the muscleyard men in general and of him as their leader in particular he warned roddy that if he was loose with his mouth again hed be taught a lesson the second came when peretti complained that his library duties werent giving him enough time either for farm duty or general exercise he was finding it hard to keep in shape don worry roddy assured you got the best end of the deal some of those guys on farm duty are worked till they drop and as for the yard guys they might be developin their pecs and abs but not much up here roddy tapped his forehead the only time they use a fuckin tome is as a doorstop or to rest barbells either side o their head roddy had made sure this time that tally was out of earshot but one of the other yardmen overheard and duly reported tally beat roddy to within an inch of his life using two of his favourite books murder machine and hollywood hulk hogan so we never read tomes huh he taunted misquoting selected lines from the books with each blow i don min killing people i just don like takin em to pieces but right there thats my damn place and nobody can fuck wit me the irony lost on tally that if not his choice of reading then certainly his quotes simply supported the claims of illiteracy the books were heavier in weight than content or merit cracking two of roddys ribs bruising his shoulders and chest to the point of bleeding in three places and breaking his nose and two finger joints where hed put one arm up to protect himself tally warned that if it happened again hed be taken out that final look just two days ago had come when arneck bc peretti and roddy had been discussing what had originally landed tally in libreville some scam involving computer clocks adjusting for yk by all accounts arneck offered during the overnight downtime to make the switch the interest on a score of bank and insurance accounts was routed to an outside account not exactly what youd expect from tally peretti said white collar crime like that bc huffed cept thats not what landed him here sfor cutting his partners throat when he tried to stiff tally outta part o the fuckin take so more like red collar crime roddy quipped everyone laughed except peretti who was still slightly lost in thought and managed only a meek smile peretti shook his head still not the sort of crime youd expect tally to get tied up with in the first place yk scam like that roddy nodded smiling drolly yeah daresay the closest hes ever come to that is askin laylo whether he wants some ky too the laughs were louder this time and peretti joined in as well laylo was the name given to maurice lavine a soft doeeyed creole africanmexican dragreview dancer who when made up and wearing the right wig could give jlo a run for her money laylo had earned a life sentence for poisoning a rival dancer whod started to steal the limelight and tally quickly corralled him as his exclusive love interest but it was a touchy subject for tally never openly admitted and for all of their liaisons tally had laylo dress up in full regalia jlo halle berry beyonce a different fantasy every time so that tally could hide away from the fact that he was having a gay relationship not good for his tough guy image and so tally also liked to kid himself that it was a closelyguarded secret even though most of the prison knew yet never dared openly talk about it because of the nature of the conversation theyd made sure that tally or any of his goons werent around but then tally walked into the canteen just as roddy delivered his killer punchline the guffaws and bellylaughs died as quickly as theyd started under tallys stony stare just a look but in that moment everyone present knew that roddys days more than anyone else on librevilles death row were numbered larry regretted the decision as soon as he was a few yards into the ventilation shaft it was pitch black peretti always came armed with the penlight for their digging sessions from his shared library duty with larry with his poor eyesight he used it for highlighting fine text or picking out titles in the darker corners of the library but even if larry had the penlight now he wasnt sure he would use it they never dug at night and the faint light might be picked out shining through where there were corridor grills though the main reason they never dug at night even if they could dummy up their beds and sidestep lockup was due to the noise the hectic hubbub and clatter of daytime prison activity drowned out their digging and scratching now it was deathly silent and larry was aware that his slightest movements seemed to bounce and echo along the steel shaft and sail free into the prison he closed his eyes and swallowed hard as he crawled forward another couple of feet anyone close to the shaft could surely hear him theyd done this journey so many times now that he could picture practically every inch of the prison below him as he went for another five or six yards the shaft ran along the back of the cells in his row then it crossed a corridor ran along its side for another eight yards and doglogged to run along the back of the cells in jblock careful eeeassy does it he told himself as he crawled the first stretch at the back of the cells though maybe if one of the other inmates did hear him staring wideeyed at the ceiling and unable to sleep as hed done for much of his first year they wouldnt give him away go on man make it make it to freedom show some hope for all of us he was doubly careful crossing the stretch running by the corridor edging forward a few inches at a time the slightest sound reaching the guards on duty the alarm would be raised in a heartbeat heartbeat pounding rapidly deafeningly so that he could hardly tell if his movement was making any noise or not unconsciously hed been holding his breath and as he came to the final yard of the corridor stretch he started to ease it loose then suddenly sucked it sharply back up again and froze footsteps boots on steel shuffling to a stop almost directly beneath him larry wondered if theyd heard him were at that moment looking up appraising trying to pinpoint exactly where theyd heard sounds coming from his chest ached with the effort of keeping his breath held his heartbeat rapid as if it wanted to burst through so loud that surely that alone could be heard by the guard below larry stayed deathly still another set of footsteps the muffled sound of voices oh jesus all he needed they could be there half the night talking about the latest saints game and sorting out the world tally wouldnt waste time roddys throat would be slit within the first minutes of reaching the boiler room the seconds dragged in time with the heavy pounding of his heart indecision now freezing his mind along with his body afraid to move breath held for what seemed a lifetime though was probably no more than ninety seconds before the footsteps finally started moving away the voices receding larry scrambled hurriedly on letting out his breath in a burst as soon as he was a couple of yards into the turn behind the cells and felt he was out of earshot of the guards just what was awaiting him in the boiler room dawned on him tally wouldnt do something like this without backup never did two men maybe three then the couple of guards whod helped get roddy out of his cell larry had been good in his day one of the best but even then taking out four or five at once would have been a tall order and unlike tally and his crew he didnt spend every day in the muscle yard training up the hopelessness of what he was attempting weighed heavy on him telling in the ache in his limbs as he dragged himself through the narrow shaft as he came to the junction with the main shaft rising up from the boiler room the warm air wafting through intensified he scrambled forward faster more desperately not sure whether it was to get away from the intense heat or to ensure that he got to roddy in time hed given up caring whether he was making a noise or not the thud of his elbows and knees against steel a repetitive penetrating echo he stopped abruptly as he came to the grill by the upper part of the boiler room hurriedly unscrewed its bolts and yanked it aside still on his hands and knees he kept still his breathing shallow taking stock no sounds or voices that he could pick out though something else reached him in that moment that made him have doubts again the soft lap and sway of the achalaya river echoing up through the waste pipe a yard to his side beckoning taunting elusive freedom yet suddenly so tangible real that he felt he could reach out and touch it probably his last and only chance hed long ago decided that he couldnt face another day inside so a commute to life imprisonment held nothing for him and his chances of a complete reprieve were practically nil so his only real hope of freedom lay in what he could hear now with the gentle lapping of the achalaya river make the break and find out what was happening with joshua hold him in your arms again stay back and save roddy make the break or head back to his cell and they all make the break together in three weeks when the tide would be right as theyd all originally planned he wasnt going to be able to save roddy in any case one against four or five he didnt stand a chance maybe he should his thoughts were broken he could hear voices from the far end of the boiler room lawrence tyler durrant born may th in knoxville tennessee the second child theres an elder sister of nathan joseph and myriejane durrant the family moved to new orleans when durrant was eleven first arrested th august six months after the offence made a full confession on his second interview held without bail in oakdale detention centre until trial which ran through april and may sentenced to death by lethal injection by judge thomas s colby on may th and bought to libreville prison jac lifted his head from the files and took a quick sip of coffee grimacing as it trickled down it was already cold hed been reading longer than he had realized most of the information was in a fivepage summary provided at the time of durrants appeal but jac found himself leafing back through the files each time he hit a key point parents siblings wife and young child past criminal form to find out more no history of criminality in the family nathan joseph had been a postal sorting worker for most of his life then later managed a small chain of grocery stores while myriejane worked in a local ninth ward cafe once the kids had grown up the only other family member with any runins with the law though once removed was lawrences first cousin simon juvenile shoplifting and one count of assault when he was nineteen lawrence was a different matter after five years of trying to make his name as a lightheavyweight boxer interspersed with casual jobs he became a serial house thief though out of four previous arrests new orleans pd had only managed to make one conviction stick while his falling from grace as a boxer could have been viewed as the start of his criminality his police file noted that there was suspicion of other robberies both before his boxing career and while he was still amateur albeit that no arrests were made during these periods and little pattern of violence connected with the robberies except on one occasion when he was disturbed and knocked a man unconscious with a couple of pistolwhip blows from behind but the nopd argued that durrant had simply been lucky enough not to have been seen on any of the past robberies and on this occasion jessica roche had seen him and he was desperately afraid of going down for a second time hed had a taste of prison a threeyear stretch in oakdale and didnt want to return second offence hed have got a minimum of five years jac rubbed the bridge of his nose with durrants later selfeducating and finding religion in prison his life was certainly one of contrasts boxer thief scholar preacher few of them sitting that comfortably together jac went back to the beginning of the segment on durrants family second marriage to francine gleason durrants first at the age of nineteen ended in divorce after only fifteen months just three years before the roche breakin no record of other robberies in that period or at least none that the nopd had him down as a specific suspect for and a baby son joshua only three months old at the time not the best timing to reoffend but then that had been part of the motive the prosecution had argued the financial pressures of the new family and durrant losing his job as an assistant in a sportinggoods store only six weeks previously then his return to heavy drinking and his car accident four months after the murder while out on one of his binges larry durrants life was a wreck of mishaps and falling from graces doing the right thing at the right time was far from his strongest suit then the therapy sessions following the accident to treat his resultant partial amnesia or selective amnesia as the prosecution later termed it to blank out the darkness of his actions that night with jessica roche and his confession coming out when jac jumped at a sudden bang from next door sounding like a pistolshot before he realized it was a door slamming a mans voice shouting came straight after i told you i dont like you working there any more and how am i meant to take care of molly and pay for my courses the womans voice higherpitched shriller defensive im workin again now i could take care of you and you got that other money yeah gerry and you know what that other money was for you know and how come youre still splashing it around come on babe gimme some credit i told you what mine was for too but this time im like an assistant barmanager rather than just a barman and the tips are big muted mumbling and rustling as if he was in close trying to hug and sweettalk her then after a moment rising from the mumbling give it up babe give it up the words punctuated by what sounded like gentle kisses for me is that too much to no no sharper louder annoyance at his intimacy to try and sway her its not even open for what what are you doing youre hurting me i just dont like other guys lookin at you like that it drives me well crazy thinking about it yeah yeah crazys about right now let me go brusquer rustling as she wrenched free and then the slamming of another door but his voice followed her and the argument continued in more muted indistinct tones behind the closed door jac had heard quite a few arguments coming from next door over the past couple of months he could hear them clearly when they were in the lounge or kitchen directly adjacent the bedrooms less so and the bathroom at the far end not at all he listened out for a moment more but all that reached him was the low drone of traffic like a muffled swarm of bees passing on highway a few blocks away these were the main disadvantages of his apartment block at the lowcost end of housing in the warehouse district the minimal partition walls meant that you could hear your neighbours when their voices raised as well as the traffic on the nearby main arteries heading out of the city jac brought his attention back to the files opening the police report with due veneration and turning over the photos that earlier hed flipped firmly facedown he hadnt wanted to look at them initially in case they influenced his judgement of larry durrant before he started he wanted to get a feel for the man first then the crime get the sequence right one gunshot to the stomach from eight to ten feet according to ballistics then the final shot to the head from close range only a few inches the photos of jessica roches splayed body were painfully raw and would have had a strong impact on even the most hardened juror one of her legs was crooked behind her at an impossible angle her blood on the blackandwhites merging with where shed soiled her dress and one side of her face collapsed where her skull had shattered stark horror in contrast to the beauty of her unblemished side jac rubbed his forehead and reached for his coffee cup before realizing that it was already empty he could imagine the first shot being fired by somebody already on edge suddenly disturbed but that final shot seemed out of character for someone whod never killed before and that thought preyed on jacs mind as he went through the rest of the police report he tried to piece together the sequence of events in his mind from durrants confession and the evidence presented at trial but still something didnt quite fit and the same sequence kept replaying in his thoughts long after hed given up trying to make conscious sense of it along with the rest of the police report and had gone to bed in the final reruns jac was playing the role of durrant standing over jessica roches sprawled body with the stillsmoking gun begging for clues as to why hed killed her please tell me if you know any small sign anything but then suddenly the body beneath him became the girl from next door her long auburn hair cascading either side of her naked body and she was reaching up for him make love to me fuck me jac could feel the heat and sweat of her skin her hazel eyes piercing straight through him before slowly closing in abandon oh lover fuck me fuck me and her gasps of pleasure seemed so real jac so wrapped up in it that he didnt hear durrants footsteps from behind the shot slamming into the body beneath him changing it abruptly back to jessica roche her blood sticky against his skin replacing the sweat and passion and jac struggled to get away from her clutch as the headshot came jac awoke with a jolt suddenly realizing that it was his neighbours door slamming again raised voices following straight after like a tidal wave no no please gerry please i ask you one small favour just one but with you no no movement no negotiation please gerry im begging you dont be like this thats your problem you never listen to me most other people i tell em once thats it but you no gerry please im begging you if im bruised i wont be able to work for a few days maybe thats what i want in fact that would probably suit me just fine no gerry no desperate now almost a scream youll wake molly snorting derision you make me sick you use that girl like a shield and your beauty and your precious fucking work and your college course and all i feel like doin is putting a fist right through it smashing it all no gerry no jac heard a thud together with a shriek from her and was convinced shed been hit he was now bolt upright in bed his breathing rapid and fractured with the drama unfolding next door wondering whether he should go and help her the sharp pistolshot came a second later and with the long silence following jac remained uncertain his pulse galloping almost in time with his breathing whether this time it had been a gunshot but after a moment he was relieved to hear from next door the sound of her gently weeping this was the heart of libreville heart of darkness its six oil boilers pumped and spewed hot vented air to the cells corridors and general open areas and hot water to the showers kitchens and laundry area which was adjacent some airconditioning units had been linked up to the venting eight years ago but they were insufficient to cool the vast prison and the temperature rarely dropped more than degrees below the outside temperature which hovered in the s for much of the summer the heat and stench of the prison rose insufferably during those months but in the boiler room and laundry it was insufferable at all times of year a permanent hell it was meant to be lit twentyfour hours by rows of emergency lights but over half of them were out either blown naturally and not yet replaced or broken by inmates whod wanted to make sure that a particular section remained dark so as to mask one activity or another a sexual liaison a drugs handover a beating a murder despite the heat larry felt a cool tingle run down his spine he couldnt see anybody at first only hear muffled voices and make out some indistinct jostling shadows from the far corner a couple of the shadows became heavier longer as they fell under the starker light from one of the emergency lights still in place there the shadows his end hopefully were equally as heavy but he had to ease himself down cautiously from the ventilation shaft ledge to the floor the slightest sound and the mumbling voices would suddenly halt and someone would break free from the shadows to head his way as his feet touched the ground the voices were slightly louder he was able to risk a few brisk steps to behind the nearest pillar then froze again swallowing back against his rapid heartbeat so that he could listen was roddys voice there or was he already too late always such a wise mouth huh always the clown dyer think this is a funny place then barrel o laughs a day tallys voice rising from the earlier muted tones gave the answer not particularly but i reckon why not try an brighten the days some i mean if i can the rest from roddy was lost as one of the boilers fired up someone had turned on a hot tap or a thermostat had dropped somewhere in librevilles labyrinths whatever had been said tally didnt appear to like it the sudden burst of air from roddy as he was hit in the stomach almost mirrored the hurrrumph from the boiler bfore i slit your throat im gonna beat you like yneverknown before tally timed his blows to emphasise his last few words and larry used the soundcover to shuffle quickly forward to the next pillar i wantya tfeel this first each blow like the rotten fuckin jokes yer told day in day out the sound of the blows landing accompanying roddys guttural groans was sickening and his coughing and retching straight after sounded as if it already carried blood larry clenched his jaw as he risked a glimpse past the pillar there were three of them with tally dennis marmont one of the guards in headguard glenn batesons pocket he should have guessed bateson wouldnt risk being present personally and jayt and silass two of tallys main muscle men jayt worried larry the most the only true brother of the group tally was a creoleafrican mix at sixfive a full four inches over larry he was surprisingly fast for his size and had good technique for someone whod never been formally trained whats that i thought i saw something larry ducked quickly back into the shadows behind the pillar as marmonts torch flicked on and shone his way a frozen few seconds with only the sound of the groups suppressed breathing before tally said only a rat or maybe you jus seein things among the shadows fucking big rat when i can see its shadow halfway up a pillar marmont retorted and larry heard his footsteps start towards him but after a moment the steps became uncertain then stopped completely you check it out larry saw the beam of the torch swing back and then towards him again im only meant tbe here as a witness to ensure fair play faint chuckle from marmont but along with his faltering step it betrayed his nervousness another set of footsteps started forward larry stayed deathly still struggling to make out whose they were beyond his pounding heart he looked at the advancing shadow in marmonts torchlight beam but exaggerated and elongated it told him little marmont also started moving forward again no doubt feeling braver now that someone else was a few steps ahead of him larry held his breath his whole body rigid as the footsteps approached hed have to make his first punch count and jump marmont almost in one otherwise marmont would have a clear shot with his nightstick or gun and it would all be over but if it was jayt or tally hed be hard pushed to do much with just one punch his breath fell fast and shallow his flank pressed firm against the pillar shielding him as the footsteps moved closer and as the torchbeam came to within a few feet bathing the area just to his side in light suddenly he was a freshfaced twentytwo year old contender again facing his first big fight in atlantas omni arena the clapping and stomping of the crowd almost in time with his thudding heartbeat his mouth was dry his skin bathed in sweat as it had been then as the adrenalin rush fired up every nerveend and muscle but as the approaching footsteps and the torchbeams angle passed the point of no return and larry lunged fully into its light with his first punch he wasnt sure if it was the roar of approval of his first fights or the groans and shouts of derision of his last when only four years later he lay on the canvass for the last time glory or demise like so much else in his life the line between them had been slight almost impossible to discern jac was running late he was fifteen minutes later than planned getting into the office because hed dozed off again for a while after his alarm sounded hed slept fitfully after being awoken in the middle of the night by the slamming doors and voices from next door which in turn meant that he didnt have time to get penny vance to type up langfrancs dictation notes on libreville hed simply grabbed a handheld cassette before rushing out again and planned to listen to it on the journey he caught his train connection with only a minute to spare and it left on time but then it was held up for twentyfive minutes while the santa fe railroad shunted a neverending stream of freight trucks past them on a dualtrack junction so now jac found himself rushing to make up time pushing his rented ford taurus for the most part past sixty on the country roads that made up the last fortyfive miles between baton rouge and libreville jac anxiously checked his watch as the flatlands and swamps of the mississippi delta flashed by haveling runs a tight ship at libreville everything by the book and strict routine and god help anyone who upsets that routine faint chuckle from langfranc on tape so while you and timekeeping might often not be the best of buddies try and be on time for all your meetings with him and durrant get everything off on the right foot jac edged his foot down if he pushed it he might be no more than five minutes late hed started playing langfrancs dictatape on the train until a man across the aisle started paying him and the tape too much attention hed saved the rest for the car journey but the upside of that is that haveling will deliver everything you need reports and recommendations on durrant strictly on time no delays or hassle and talking of god warden havelings even more devout than our dear governor candaret stories abound of him taking a bible with him into the execution chamber and if the condemned is stuck for an apt last passage to be read by the prison pastor haveling will recommend a few he even offers to hold the condemneds hand in the final moments if they should so require langfranc paused markedly which i suppose raises more awkward questions about havelings character and state of mind than it should but at least it supports that pushing durrants religious bent as hard as you can is without doubt the main ticket and in havelings defence hes a lot better than his predecessors claims of turning a blind eye to or even supporting institutionalized violence hung over most of them havelings immediate predecessor was as straight as they come but lacked the backbone to push through what he wanted high levels of violence still continued a year ago there was a new orleans magazine piece on haveling picturing him with a bible in one hand and nightstick in the other which just about summed him up iron fist with he believes gods backing and approval there are still incidents of violence but probably no more than most maximumsecurity penitentiaries certainly things now are a far cry from the dark days of the seventies and eighties when there were regular pitched battles with cleaverstyle radicals and assorted psychos going at each other with machetes sneaked in from the fields inmates then regularly slept with steel breastplates to protect them from getting hacked to death in the night libreville was in fact originally a slave plantation dating back to the s and its name came from the west african port where most of the slaves were shipped from with the change from plantation to penitentiary coming in the early s when jacs cellphone rang he looked at the display his mother or younger sister he stopped the tape and answered his mother catherine quickly launched into a subject shed broached at the weekend past when hed visited have you given it much thought yet she pressed a bit he lied even without the durrant case he wouldnt have given it much consideration arranged date he thought that sort of thing had died out a century ago but i havent decided yet well let me know when you have she came by the other day with her father to aunt camilles place and she seems a very nice girl and attractive too jac sighed come on mum this is more about pleasing camille than you or more importantly me one more step in her socialclimbing ladder thats true shes from a very good family and no doubt thats what camille saw first but now having met the girl it would be easy for you to forget that this is all about camille you could get on very well catherine sighed and it has been a while now since madeleine madeleine madeleine thirtyseven months to be precise just before theyd left france perhaps his mum was right if she was nice and they got on what harm could it do but most of all he could hear the uncertainty almost desperation in his mothers voice the need to do this to please camille and that part of him made him want to rebel say no his mother and sister stayed in one of camilles houses in hammond at only half rent and camille also paid half of jeanmaries college fees he paid the other half his was the only family workvisa so far granted and it was all he could afford while doing criminal law bar exams meanwhile his mum and sister lived partly in his aunts pocket part of the legacy left by his fathers early death and disastrous state of affairs at the time which his aunt took every opportunity to remind them of what a mess adam left all of his wild dreaming so lucky i was there to help all of you jacs aunt was the exact opposite of his father maybe thats why he rebelled and railed so against any of her suggestions in part it kept alive his fathers spirit okay ill think seriously about it but if i agree to it im doing it for you or because i feel its right not for camille thats very noble but you need to please yourself first and second on this jac not anybody else i know with a promise that hed let her know that weekend when he came over he rang off after the argument through the wall the night before the only girl hed given any thought to had been his next door neighbour starting to wonder what she might look like hed purposely listened out for her movements as he got ready that morning she was still moving around inside when he left but if he timed it right one morning hopefully hed get to see her on the corridor he shook his head smiling obsessing over a girl just from a few soundbites through a wall his mother was right he had been too long without a date jac switched on langfrancs tape again and as he approached libreville the details started to mirror what he saw through his car window spread over acres in total with the closest towns libreville four miles away which sprung up shortly after the plantation was founded and st tereseville seventeen miles away the term plantation hung on until the midsixties when it was dropped because it smacked too much of the early slave days and was replaced with ranch possibly due to its sheer size the fact that they rear their own cattle as well as farm and have an annual rodeo the term could easily evoke a laidback high chaparralstyle atmosphere but dont be fooled this is hardgraft rockbreaking coolhand luke territory all the way jac approached the main gate of libreville fourteen foot high matching the perimeter fence with another threefoot of rolled razor wire on top after announcing his meeting with chief warden haveling and handing over his card jac checked his watch while the guard phoned through for confirmation four minutes late not too bad but from the sprawl of the place it looked like it was going to take him another four or five to actually get to havelings office the guard returned handed him back his card and pointed along the shale road ahead ignore the first three buildings two one side one the other all single storey and after a lil more than a mile youll see the main building cant miss it rises up four floors out o nowhere visitors parking on the right thanks three thousand eighthundred inmates forty per cent increase since the late fifties which led to three new blocks being built in the grounds all high risk or death row prisoners are held in the main block with time allowed out of holding cells for them just two hours a day unless they have allocated duties or privileges though that never includes field work their work assignments are again all within the main block which is like a fortress of the halfdozen or so workers that jac passed that troubled to look his way at best they were sullenly curious at worst surly and menacing no smiles it was difficult for jac to believe that these were the best of the bunch sixtyone per cent africanamerican inmates sixteen per cent mixed race and twentythree per cent white and with the guards that ratio is reversed only nineteen per cent are black or mixed race though a marked improvement on twenty or thirty years ago take the clock back to the early sixties and there wasnt a single black guard but as jac entered deeper into the bowels of librevilles main block he began to appreciate the difference here at best the stares were surly at worst taunting and disturbingly intense and there were a few smiles though invariably leering and slanted as if fuelled by madness or challenging as if viewing him as prey jac felt that the stifling oppression and heat of the block unless he was imagining it seemed to be getting more intense as he progressed pressing heavier on him with each guard checkpoint and heavy steel gate opened and bolted shut behind him and as a few sexual taunts were thrown at him as he passed the cells like the way you walk pretty boy sweet ass i could fuck you right through that armani he felt his face tingle and burn he was probably still flushed agitated his shirt sticking to his skin as he was ushered into the contrasting coolness of warden havelings woodpanelled office but he knew immediately unless haveling had taken to appearing as surly as his prisoners or was far more upset by his tardiness than hed envisaged that something serious was wrong it was that time of day leonard truelle nursed the two fingers of jim beam between his hands with due reverence as if warming his hands through the glass then with a faint gleam of expectation in his eyes brought it to his lips and felt its warmth and aroma trickle slowly down he closed his eyes in appreciation pure nectar with a part sigh part murmur as he felt its afterburn he set the glass slowly down the hand clamping over his came an inch before the tumbler touched the table and he flicked his eyes open again startled what the oh oh its you now thats no way to greet a longlost friend you startled me thats all probably because it has been so long nelson malley nelm or just plain nel almost five years now but it wasnt a face he was ever likely to forget there was a tinge of grey now in malleys tightknit curls and it looked as if his mahogany skin tone was becoming greyer each time as if someone had thrown potash in his face which hadnt completely washed off anyway nice to see you again nelm gave truelles hand a couple more squeezes though to truelle they felt threatening rather than reassuring and as nelm felt the trembling there he smiled is that because of me im touched or because you havent kicked this stuff yet nelm flicked his hand towards the whisky tumbler as he lifted it away truelle didnt want to let nelm inside his head show weakness either way expecting sharon stone any minute and you know first dates always nervous truelle forced a weak smile i might need some dutch courage to actually get to fuck her nelm smiled back but his charcoal eyes fixed steadily on truelle showed no hint of warmth as always icy and bottomless as if they were independent monitors searching for weak points to signal what his next move should be they cut truelle to the core ran a shiver up his spine this drink now was part of a ritual every tuesday and friday night when he left work one glass of jim beam slowly and reverently sipped then home before when hed been on the wagon hed always felt in danger that if he had just one drink he wouldnt be able to stop and on a couple of occasions that was exactly how hed started again this was his way of proving that he was in control could stop at just one drink but he was damned if he was going to share his innermost secrets with nelson malley he could feel nelms eyes still on him as he looked down thoughtfully at his glass and shrugged to ease his discomfort look if you wanted something why didnt you come by my office like most normal people normal people nelm raised one eyebrow and smiled slyly bit of a contradiction in terms in your line of work isnt it i wouldnt want to rob any of your patients of their precious fifty minutes or god forbid get seen walking in and confused with all those crazies i got a reputation to uphold the smile broadened then died just as quickly but youve probably guessed the reason im here now no doubt youve seen or read the news durrants execution has been set only fortyseven days left now and counting yeah i know ive read it truelle kept his eyes on his tumbler didnt want to risk what malley might see in them and well we just wanted to make sure that you were still cool about everything no last minute stabs of conscience truelle smiled drolly we as in you and addy roche as in yeah im cool truelle nodded still staring at his glass resigned to or numbed by would probably have been more accurate expressions hed shed so many tears of conscience over durrant that now there was nothing left i got rid of all my demons years ago though looking at the tumbler now he could almost still picture it being refilled time and time again until hed stagger from the bar in a daze if hed had a problem before durrant the aftermath was without doubt the main event hed drunk half the state dry before resorting to more aa meetings and colleagues couches than he dared remember but the problem was that he could never tell them what lay at the root of what was troubling him never youre sure now that youre cool about it nelm pressed laying his hand back on truelles no recriminations truelle shook his head and looked back at nelm im sure no recriminations not any more but nelm kept his hand there squeezing bit by bit harder as he stared into truelles eyes searching for doubt he stopped short of a complete crush and although he couldnt discern anything from truelles eyes too lifeless dulled by the years of drink he could feel the telltale trembling back in his hand though nice to know you still have feelings for me nelm said giving the hand one last pat before he lifted his away and in the same motion before truelle could object waved towards the barman and another of the same for my friend here nelm slapped some money on the counter and slapped truelle on the shoulder remember stay cool then with one last taunting smile he headed out truelle hardly acknowledged him his eyes fixed on the second drink as if it was poison he could feel the trembling in his hands reverberating now through his entire body of all the times he could do with a second drink it was now but he was damned if he was going to fall off of the wagon just for nelm and the fact that nelm had bought the drink made it all the worse it would be like supping with the devil he knocked back the last of his first drink closing his eyes again as he felt it trickle down in control still in control then bringing the tumbler down with a firm slam on the bar counter he walked out days later so how was our good friend truelle not bad not bad nelm said after he got over the shock of seeing me so no signs of him falling apart none that i could see beyond the normal pmt postmalley tension nelm chuckled briefly he claims that he exorcised the demons over durrant years ago and apparently hes also kicked the demon drink truelle was reluctant to tell me himself but i checked back with the barman after he left it appears he goes in there only twice a week and has just a single jim beam each time and he left the extra drink i bought him impressive and the gambling unless hes using a bookie or is into some private games we just dont know about looks like hes clean there too sound almost too good to be true two vices overcome the voice at the other end was punctuated by laboured breathing from years of emphysema and as a chortle was attempted it lapsed into a small coughing fit adelay roche louisianas second richest man twentyninth nationally hed earned his main money in petrochemicals and refining and his detractors claimed that his emphysema was gods punishment for poisoning the lungs of millions of others whereas his supporters said that it was brought on by the death of his beautiful young wife twelve years ago as many years ago now as the agegap between them vr vaderraider he was unaffectionately nicknamed homage to his breathing problems and his fierce reputation for corporate raiding on occasion hed ask people what the vr stood for and not wishing to upset him theyd either claim that they didnt know or with a tight smile perhaps very rich roche would nod knowingly thats nice hed long ago heard what the initials stood for but couldnt resist watching them shuffle awkwardly around the issue and what about raoul ferrer roche enquired i havent caught up with him yet i thought i should speak to you again first yeah i know he could be more of a worry two money demands now no knowing when we might get another true nelm didnt say any more just let the steady cadence of roches breathing get there on its own if thats going to be an ongoing situation then we might have to nip it in the bud let me know how you read it once youve met with him will do as much of a green light as he was going to get from roche he might have to nudge that situation along himself oh and theres a new lawyer been handed durrants final plea at payne beaton amp sawyer name of jac mcelroy doesnt have too much experience from what i hear so looks like endoftheline throwinginthetowel time otherwise theyd have given it to someone with a bit more weight but warrants watching all the same a small shudder would run through jacs body at times a small electrical surge buzzing through him for no reason often in the dead of night and just when he was on the verge of sleep snapping him back awake again the same chilling shudder that had run through him when his mothers voice had lifted from her weary trembling body into the silent expectant rooms of the sprawling rochefort farmhouse theyd called home for the past nineteen years to tell him that his father was dead that had been daytime hot and sunny though the large house had never felt colder when that news even though halfexpected dreaded for so long finally came from the hospital and hed felt that same shudder even more in the following months at his fathers funeral when the bank foreclosed and the bailiffs came with his mothers muffled sobbing through walls or halfclosed doors or after his father had appeared in a dream smiling warmly telling him everything was okay lived before i died or sometimes for no reason that he could fathom as if telling him there was something he might have missed stay awake for another hour staring at the ceiling and you might just work out what it was some magical way of getting your family out of this mess after all youre the man of the house now the rochefort artists retreat had been his fathers dream for many a year long before he finally summoned up the courage to pack in his job at a small design and print company and transplant his family from a cold grey glasgow to the sundappled vineyards and wheatfields of the saintonge and now the dream had died along with his father as his father in his fading years knew all too well it would many saying the money problems had in fact caused his illness income dwindling financial problems mounting and banks pressing in pace with the cancer eating him away a race as to which would hit the tape first but it was difficult for jac to get angry with his father for the financial fallout after his death because as his fathers good friend archie teale had said unlike most people hed actually lived his dream and jacs abiding memory of that period was of an almost idyllic childhood looking over his fathers shoulder as hed bring to life with his paintbrush a patchwork quilt of vines lavender and sunflower fields spread before them jac sitting on the hillside by the lshaped farmhouse the sun hot on his back his father in the courtyard below sweeping one arm towards the same patchwork landscape as he instructed a group of eight by their easels his father living his dream and the rest of the family happily riding along in the wake of that glow powderwhite sand slipping eggtimer slow through jacs fingers on an isle de rey beach or chasing small fishes through its shallows his father telling him if he ran fast enough and scooped down quick enough with his cupped hands he might finally catch one but of course he was never able to those had been the overriding images in jacs mind from those years rather than remembering his father tired and wasting away his mother weeping and the courts gavel and bailiffs knocks that had marked their final days in france jac saw his father as some fallenthroughnofaultofhisown hero rather than the failure that others particularly his aunt had labelled him and so as the months passed the brief shudders in the dead of night became less frequent then finally one day stopped and jac was able to sleep easy so when that brief shudder hit jac again snapping him awake in the dead of night after hed visited larry durrant for the first time it caught him unawares he stared up at the ceiling long and hard wondering what it could be that one vital detail or clue hed missed reading durrants trial files a hint at how to handle this fresh problem with the attempted breakout and the injured guards but all that lifted from the muted streetlight orangegreys on his ceiling was the last image to hit him before hed awoken durrant in his cell lonely and afraid sweat beads massed on his forehead with the crippling fear that he was about to die the antithesis of the cool and distant guarded front hed shown to jac reaching out to say something but the words never forming in his mouth but with the email that was waiting on jacs computer when he switched it on early the next morning jac wondered if it was some kind of strange premonition only two lines his blood ran cold as he read it a nervous tingle running down his spine looked like he might have a breakthrough with durrant before hed hardly started whadya call that fuckhead i could cue a better shot with my dick i didnt see you do so well with that last yellow thats cause there were two other fuckin balls in the way stevie wonder this one you had a clear shot nelm had arranged to meet raoul ferrer in a bar in algiers ten years ago it was a nogo area day or night but now with a string of new bars and restaurants nestling in the shadows of the dockside warehouses according to local city guides it was now inadvisable to walk around only aftermidnight theyd been perched up at the bar only a few minutes when the argument erupted at the pool table a couple of yards to their side as the insults picked up steam and the two opponents moved closer one of them raising his cue stick threateningly nelm shifted from his bar stool lets get outta here no no wait a minute raoul said this is just gettin interesting one thing nelm hadnt considered looking at the warped leer on raouls face the excitement of the fight look i havent come here to watch a bunch of goons fight we got business to discuss nelm turned and took a pace away raoul got up and lightly tugged at his arm come on man wont take a minute to kickoff by the looks of it nelm noticed the man with the raised cue stick a biker with wild red hair flinch and fleetingly gaze their way he hoped raoul hadnt read anything into it you wanna watch that wise mouth redhair waved the cue stick more threateningly at his opponent otherwise one day someone will bust it wide open yeah yeah his opponent stepped forward taunting challenging will probably be the best fuckin shot youve had all night too they were running out of script one more minute and raoul would guess that something was wrong that it was all staged im outta here nelm said you want to waste time watching these assholes then do it on your own time not mine he paced purposefully away and by the time his hand reached for the door raoul had shuffled up quickly behind him the sort of business we need to talk about cant be done here okay man okay i understand business business nelm waited until they were a good dozen paces from the bar before he spoke again he took a deep breath of the warm night air and slowly let it out you probably guessed why the meeting at this particular time larry durrants coming up for his big day and roche wants to know if there might be any more surprises waiting in the wings you know as in another big payoff no man no of course not that was a oneoff deal never to be repeated except that there were two payoffs raoul shrugged awkwardly the second was only teng just a topup on the main deal and only ya know raoul grimaced cause i was in such a jam at the time im okay now doin fine no troubles no problems i got a good deal runnin now with carmen ya know yeah i know carmen malastra louisianas leading racketeer but at raouls pecking level in malastras empire one call from roche would easily smooth over any move they had to make against raoul although that might all change once raoul was a made man but what we wanna make sure is if thats always going to be the case i mean what happens if you hit hard times later fall out with carmen or business goes bad or he changes your deal or territory so youre just not pulling in the same nelm shrugged you know it happens it happens all the time no no it won happen dont worry but there was a heavy pause before raoul answered that told nelm that raoul was far from sure maybe not now this year or next but who knows what can happen in five or ten years nelm shrugged again and if that was going to be the case or even if there was a slim possibility that it might be the case then roche would prefer to make that payment now rather than later nelm shuffled to a stop and fixed raoul with a stony gaze because once durrants gone for the chop roche doesnt want to hear mention of his name again or anyone or anything to do with durrant once the chapter closes in fortyfive days time it closes for good understand so if there was ever again to be money involved as elvis once said its now or never nelm watched raoul look thoughtfully agitatedly at his shoes for a second snakeskin with a maroon leather band pursing his lips as he mulled it over it looked like he was going to need a bit more push roche has even thought of a figure for you forty grand no arguments no questions but also no comebacks or demands later its a oneshot deal raoul looked up and blew a soft whistle into the night air same as the first time huh yeah same as nelm held raouls gaze for an instant snakeeyes snakeshoes he could tell that raoul was close teetering on the edge behind them a ships horn sounded as it approached algiers point raoul looked over his shoulder as a sudden babble of voices burst from a bar eighty yards up the road they were away from the main bar and restaurant area but obviously still not far enough thought nelm and there was still a thread of uncertainty holding raoul back ive got the money right over there in my car should you decide to take it nelm started pacing towards his car without looking back for raouls reaction after five yards they came alongside a large warehouse and as they turned the corner to follow the flank of the building the atmosphere changed completely it was darker the streetlighting sparser the bars and restaurants a hundred yards away hidden from view by the twostorey corrugated warehouse walls at the end of the warehouse and before the next was a small patch of wasteground used as a makeshift carpark for twenty or so cars at this time of night only three cars were there one of which was nelms nelm knew that if hed arranged to meet raoul here initially raoul would have balked or at least would have been suspicious and wary thats why hed decided on the bar and the staged fight and you got the money right here in your car yep nelm could tell from the edge in raouls voice that hed taken the bait the smell and immediacy of the money was just too tempting no point in delaying one quick call to roche for a final nod and the moneys yours done deal so what do you think one final appraisal of his shoes lips pursing before raoul looked up again okay okay the words rode a hushed exhalation as if he was accepting the money reluctantly equally nelm kept his voice low as he took out his cellphone and started speaking to roche holding one hand up towards raoul as he took a couple of steps away so you were right roche said on the back of a tired sigh he did want an extra payment yeah yeah looks like it another forty grand you say yeah and do you think hell come back for more again later yeah looks like it at least thats how i read it another tired sigh i suppose were going to have to take the option you suggested against my better judgement less possible problems later except that is for how were going to square things with malastra that too will be better dealt with now rather than later you mean once he becomes made yeah okay roche exhaled as the silence lengthened i understand you cant say too much your end one final weary sigh just take care of it the best way you see fit will do nelm beamed widely as he looked back at raoul great hes given the okay raoul mirrored nelms smile but then it quickly faltered sinking as in the same motion of nelm putting away his cellphone he saw him slide a gun out a mm with silencer already attached raoul held one hand up defensively his eyes darting in panic roche said for you to gimme the money nelm cocked an eyebrow now let me think when he said to let you have it could i have got the wrong meaning nelm had wanted to kill raoul from the outset he might as well squeeze every bit of juice from it maybe my poor grasp of english letting me down again you know us poor southern boys they didnt let us near any books until much later in life you you cant do this raouls eyes continued darting for possible options hoping that someone from the nearby bars might suddenly come around the corner a verbal gem to stop nelm in his tracks empty prayers on his breath falling into the night air you wouldnt dare touch me carmen would tear your fuckin heart out youre just small potatoes in carmens empire and roche could buy and sell carmen ten times over so in the scheme of things youre really small nelm raised his gun and aimed and about to disappear completely raoul moved his hand higher in response and nelms bullet took off raouls index fingertip before slamming into his left cheekbone leaving a gaping hole as it deflected and exited just below his temple the impact threw raoul ferrer back a full yard and left him partly on one side his body twitching as blood pumped up through the hole in his cheek just in case it was raouls nervous system and brain still intact rather than death throes nelm put the silencer barrel by raouls left eye and squeezed off a second shot it certainly wasnt to put raoul out of pain quickly dougy sawyer had decided to stop by their table on his way out i i was wondering if youve had a chance to speak to mike coultaine yet it was sawyer whod recommended to langfranc that whoever took on the durrant case should speak to coultaine no not yet jac said theres been some initial jac thought he should find his feet first langfranc cut in the last thing jac needed was news of problems with durrant getting back to beaton get through his initial interviews with durrant before seeing coultaine well you want to speak to coultaine soon as you can sawyer said except that now the hurricane seasons winding down hes probably out on his boat flyfishing every day harder to get hold of than when he was with the firm sawyer smiled meekly but there was a faint gleam in his eye as if he too might like to escape and flyfish the rest of his days away or because he considered it pure folly reserved only for the mad or brave like mike coultaine i know that he was upset at losing the appeal i think durrant touched him deeper than any of us appreciated along with a few other cases probably the reason that mike retired so early still sawyer halfturned distracted as a noisy group took up seats a couple of tables away yes yes it is jac exhaled heavily haveling phoned me this morning to tell me that marmonts condition had worsened the hospital give him less than twenty per cent chance of pulling through haveling said that the next fortyeight hours would be the most telling but that obviously if marmont died all bets were off jac found himself on edge over the following days fearful each time the phone rang that it would be haveling calling to say that marmont had died late afternoon with the help of the companys it man hed discovered more about the email signed up and sent from an internet cafe cybersurf on prytania street and an anonymous untraceable email address durransave hotmailcom he phoned cybersurf it had been paid cash and they didnt recall whod been on that computer then just as the last people were leaving the office penny vance calling out have a nice weekend jac finally sent the reply hed been turning over in his mind the past twentyfour hours equally brief but hopefully it might draw them out and give him what he needed if anything came back his phone started ringing only minutes after he got back to his apartment his hand hovering a second before he picked up haveling but it was jeff coombs his squash and tennis partner and one of the few friends hed made in his three years in new orleans he begged off a squash game jeff was trying to organize for early saturday evening heading out to hammond for the weekend to see mum and sis i understand duty calls maybe well get in a game in the week wednesday or thursday night ill phone you then part of that duty now included pressure to get him married off he tried to relax in the shower breathing long and slow with his eyes closed as he let the water run over his body as if at the same time it was washing away the pressures of the week and some of the sticky heat and grime still there from libreville traffic was slow heading out of the city probably because the weekend weather promised to be fine and everyone had the same thing in mind escape to the beaches or bayous his phone rang again halfway along the lake pontchartrain causeway his mother no doubt wondering where he was he was twenty minutes later in leaving than hed said and the traffic had held him up still further he let it go into message service the reason for the call he was confronted with as soon as he arrived aunt camille has arranged dinner for us all and you know how fastidious she is his mother looked anxiously at her watch already it looks like were going to be ten minutes late shell give us hell a twentyminute run to the far side of amite they decided to all go in his car if youd called and told me id have made sure to be on time jac said as he made the turn back onto the highway she didnt tell me until very late but as he glanced across his mother looked slightly away either she had been told late probably because his aunts last dinner invite hed begged off with an excuse or his mother had decided to delay telling him for much the same reason either way his lack of enthusiasm for his aunts company was now out in the open official aunt camilles house was a sprawling southern mansion complete with doric columns on its front facade straight out of gone with the wind a servant with white tails and gloves greeted them and served them dinner perpetuation of the plantationera image except that he was white hired from an atlantabased agency that specialised in english servants because shed heard that they were the best that must have caused her weeks of mental anguish thought jac choosing between what was considered traditionally correct and what was best to her friends and those wishing to be kind to her camille was a colourful eccentric a character to nearly everyone else including jac she was an impossible snob and social aspirant camille waited until the second course before broaching the subject everything with a purpose but also very much in order arranged liaisons with the blanquette de veau i suppose catherine has talked to you about jennifer the bromwells daughter yes yes he caught his mothers eye fleetingly before slightly flushed she brought her concentration back to her plate she mentioned that she was very nice yes nice camille aired the word as if it had scant relevance in her world she also happens to be the daughter of one of the richest men in the state tobias bromwell and i have to tell you he was more than a little intrigued when i shared with him the noble line running through our family ooooh right as jac let out the words with a tired exhalation his eyes drifted to the coat of arms on the far wall soon after arriving in america camille had traced her family history back she claimed all the way to louis xv in fact it had only been a distant cousin of louis xv a grand duke with an estate in bourges but shed used that relentlessly as her ticket to every society gathering she could as well as to attract her husband one of louisianas leading property realtors dead these past eight years when shed previously pressed home the importance of their royal lineage theyd argued jac pointing out that the relevance of royalty to most french people including himself had probably been best demonstrated by what they did to marie antoinette camille though was hopelessly blinkered and having gone that route herself she no doubt saw it as the way forward for everyone else the use of their royal lineage however tenuous to snag a wealthy partner money meets respectability but as he went to answer he caught his mother looking across anxiously hoping that he wouldnt make a scene yes i can see how that might intrigue him the sarcasm was lost on camille her knife and fork hovered only a second above her plate before she continued of course jac this isnt france you know where theres fallen royalty in practically every other hamlet here in america such things are a rarity youve got to make best use of it where you can yes i appreciate that better now again it went at a mile above aunt camilles head or didnt penetrate her rhino skin but as jac pushed a tight smile he caught his mother suppressing a smirk at the corner of her mouth hed handled it the best way so good camille placed her cutlery in line on her plate as she finished i can take it then that youre keen to see jennifer for a date well i dont know i he was about to comment that he didnt want to rush into it but caught again his mothers anxious look you know opportunities like this with girls like jennifer dont come along every day camille said and if we snub her or dally around the door will probably be closed straight in our faces never to open again jac felt the pressure like a tight coil at the back of his neck his aunt pushing persuading controlling like she did with so much in her life almost second nature now and his mother subservient living in her shadow afraid to go against her the way theyd lived practically since his fathers death over three years now but at times it felt like a lifetime probably because so much had changed their life now held no resemblance to their life before sunglowed days at their rochefort farmhouse or isle de rey beaches his parents both carefree relaxed his mother smiling and laughing at his fathers comments and quips not a care in the world and his mother now her eyes dull and haunted shoulders slumped as if holding the weight of the world chewing at her bottom lip as she panicked over what he might say next i know i i jac felt terribly torn his mother urging him to acquiesce anything for an easy life his father telling him to fight back dont stand for it anymore break the cycle now or you might never be able to perhaps his aunt had been right on one front even if her comment had been intended as just another snipe surely you cant be serious doing criminal instead of corporate law corporate is where the money is and youve already got your feet under the table you dont want to end up a pipedreamer like your father i mean look where that got him at least with the money from corporate law hed have been able to free his mother and sister from camilles clutch and now like his father his life was becoming a series of diminishing options i i think i should a tingle ran up jacs spine the vital element hed missed earlier with durrant suddenly hit him he delved into his pocket for his cellphone holding one hand up in apology as he dialled one minute sorry someone i remembered i have to call as it rang aunt camille contemplated him with rueful impatience as if convinced the call was just a ruse a diversionary tactic his mother looked away awkwardly her face flushed on the third ring it went to an answerphone youre through to the office of thomas j haveling chief warden of libreville prison im either away from my office right now or unavailable so please jac was about to ring off and try his assistant pete folley but then had second thoughts he didnt know how far batesons grapevine of influence went whether folley could be trusted any passing of information between them and the game would be up he left a message asking haveling to call him back urgently so what do you want me to tell jennifer bromwell camille pressed sorry just one more minute haveling might not pick up the message for hours or perhaps not until the next morning jac couldnt risk the wait he needed to put something in motion immediately every second could be vital he dialled out to john langfranc who thankfully was there and answered quickly jac explained the problem looking away from his aunt as she held one hand out in exasperation and lifted her eyes heavenward the best guy i know for that sort of thing is a private eye and writserver called bob stratton in morgan city langfranc commented it could take him a couple of hours to get out to libreville and from the sound of it you dont want to lose even that time worth a try though in case youre stuck or he knows someone closer halfway through jac scribbling a contact number on the back of a business card from his wallet camille silently mouthed well she whisked the air with her raised hand as she added voice what do i tell her thanks john jac sighed as he rang off okay okay tell her were on for a date but not this coming week too much to sort out next weekend what would it harm one date thought jac how bad could it be at least the pressure was off for all concerned his mother risked a faint smile relieved that battle was done but as he saw his aunts fuller more satisfied smile basking in the glory of yet another triumph once again he heard his fathers voice telling him that he should have put up more of a stand shouldnt have given in so quickly perhaps in one way his aunt camille was right like his father he was a dreamer any chances of saving lawrence durrants life were fast ebbing away before hed even started jac dialled bob strattons number but with each extra ring with no answer jac felt any remaining hope slipping further away larry durrant could feel his mothers eyes on his right shoulder all but burning a hole right through it shed always been there in the same position in the courtroom through those days of the trial give or take a few seats either way and francine too had sat in a similar place but theyd hardly ever been together at the same time because of them alternating on taking care of joshua except for the few times frannys mother had helped out frannys stare had been different shifting uncomfortable not meeting his gaze directly for too long when on occasion hed turned around as if uncertain whether he was guilty or not but his mothers stare had been direct unflinching either she believed in him no matter what or was trying to see through to his very soul to understand what might have possessed this being that shed brought into the world to kill that poor woman hed had the first dream then a shadowy figure holding the gun on jessica roche firing just as he was screaming out for him not to unsure if it was someone else or he was merely looking at himself that shaky unstable side of himself that he had little control over and might have actually done it the evidence said hed done it his memory such as it was said that hed done it and then hed said it himself in his confession but suddenly that shadowy figure was there to say maybe just maybe when hed first had the dream shaking his head from fitful sleep as he sat by a bailiff ready for the next days court battle his first thought was that it was a protective device for his psyche creating another character whod actually fired the gun because part of his mind couldnt accept that hed done something so horrific but as the court case continued with his mothers eyes each day boring into his shoulder he wondered if it was also partly for that that if the shadowy figure in his dreams looked his way and he was able to see its face hed have been able to turn and call out to his mother that hed seen who it was and it wasnt him i didnt do it yet the figure in his dreams never did turn his way and so he was never able to rid himself of that penetrating stare and all the guilt recrimination anguish and lost hope that went with it and years later when he was still having the same dream by then often mixed up with his mother staring at his back on those courtroom days he was still never able to see its face he was never able to phone his mother before she died five years after the trial as hed hoped and prayed hed be able to and say ma i dont think i did it bob stratton was in his local bar watching his favourite football team the new orleans saints play the arizona cardinals when his cellphone rang hed switched it off at the beginning of the game but when the saints were trailing by the first quarter his enthusiasm began to wane and remembering the call hed been waiting for hadnt come through yet he switched it back on jim is that you he shouted above the noise of the television no as i said its jac mcelroy jac repeated a shade louder john langfranc gave me your number oh right and what can i do for you sir stratton nodded at intervals and watched hambrick of the cardinals rip though the saints defence with another run as jac explained what he wanted the problem is im tied up with something right now stratton said can it wait until tomorrow no thats just the problem jac told stratton why there was such dire urgency if this guard comes around before we have someone present to take his account it could be too late stratton looked at his watch then at the game on the tv it didnt look like the saints were going to pull this around so maybe he should save himself the pain he could listen to it on the radio on his way out there and at least vent his frustration in private by banging the steering wheel when need be the couple of times hed slapped the bar counter and shouted abuse at the tv a few heads had turned his way itll take me at least two hours to get out there any use to you yes absolutely jac filled in the rest of the details thanks youre a lifesaver aunt camille was looking keenly at jac as he hung up having watched him pace like a caged lion at the close of dinner as he tried to get hold of stratton her interest had been piqued important by the looks of it yes yes its a murder case jac couldnt resist it in their last heated debate about his move to criminal law shed commented disdainfully starting from rung one like this itll be years before they hand you any worthwhile heavyweight cases camille arched one eyebrow murder you say any case we might know jac eased back eleven years on durrant was still a landmark case and in the run up to his execution was again grabbing major headlines camille would be bound to voice strong comment and in responding hed risk breaching client confidentiality no no nothing important just an alsoran oh i see camille nodded and smiled tightly an alsoran case back to where she expected his legal career to be going nowhere fast the guards regular card game took place in the watchroom an hour after shutdown every lock and bolt had been secured monitors checked and residual hubbub and chatter from the inmates had by then faded out all that lay ahead was a long quiet night so out came the cards glenn bateson presided but not everyone was invited to join in bateson ran a strict game minimum stake of a hand poker or thirteencard canaster and one of those who looked on with curiosity as voices and blood pressure rose with the heat of the game but had never been invited to join in was miles elden or scope as he was nicknamed because he was always scoping around head turning and craning to every corner of the prison hardly ever stopped moving scope was a regular visitor to the prison chapel so bateson always thought his religious principles would keep him away from the game but now he was keen to have him join in when he saw scope pass the open door to the watch room and glance over bateson beckoned him over enthusiastically hey why dont you join us bateson beamed his widest smile i dont knowi scope hovered uncertainly by the door come on its not really gambling with thirteencard canaster more of a mind and skillgame than chance well show you how to play and give you a few trial hands with no stakes then go in at just a hand if and when you feel confident scope put up a bit more resistance but it was clear that bateson wasnt about to take no for an answer and with a final welcoming smile and nod of encouragement he had a spare seat swiftly pulled up on the first night scope won on the second and bateson waited until the third night to put in the sting scope dropped on two almost unbeatable hands dont worry hands like that youre bound to make it back the next night bateson assured scope didnt he dropped another the following night scope looked panicstricken as he took bateson to one side at the end of the game thats a big chunk of my months salary there i was hoping you might cut me a bit of slack and let me pay say over the next few months bateson sucked in his breath if it was just up to me sure id wait but some of the other guys here they got heavy commitments and maybe other dues from games they gotta settle so it aint so easy bateson paused heavily enjoying letting scope stew for a moment more before becoming pensive but maybe theres something else you could help me out with that could settle this you didnt have to agree to the date if you didnt want to you know jeanmarie said certainly not just because of me and mum i think i did and you know it camille would have just kept on pushing and you and mum would have got the worst of it thankfully i only have to see her when i choose theyd left camilles an hour ago and jacs sister jeanmarie had grabbed his ear as soon as their mother had gone to the kitchen to make coffee before he left jeanmarie looked down thoughtfully for a second seventeen going on twentysomething the past six years with their fathers business collapse the cancer which finally led to his death then the upheaval and move to america to live partly in the shadow of their aunts charity and favour had made her worldweary beyond her years petite quiet and studious the extra age though didnt show in her body or face only in the sullen intensity in her eyes now and then the same gaze she levelled now at jac as she looked back up i suppose youre right shes a determined old dog even if often she aims to be wellmeaning jac smiled i think you give her too much credit i think she enjoys turning the screws and watching people squirm you should have just ended on old dog just about hits the right note jeanmarie chuckled anyway talking of old dogs you certainly could do a lot worse than a date with jennifer bromwell shes quite cute in fact in a britney spears sort of way hot i think is the american term for it or is it cool i forget now jac fired a doubtful grimace his sister no doubt knew the right term long ago but he rode along with the tease spoilt though i suppose no didnt seem it ive only met her a couple of times when she came over to camilles with her father but she seemed quite normal and approachable she spoke to me and mum for a bit and she was very friendly thats probably just because she thinks were royalty jac couldnt resist teasing back no i dont think so i got the impression that for her that was all just a theirgeneration thing camilles and her dads royalty and money i dont think she gives a damn about either came across as a bit of a hippy in that respect or maybe just a silly idealist this time when jeanmarie forced a smile jac couldnt tell whether she was teasing or not the lessons for them with money had come harder than most jac feigned a crestfallen look oh thats a shame i was hoping that with my royalty connections i might get lucky if thats the american term jeanmarie leant forward and lightly punched him on the arm few of their teasing jousts did she ever win but the contests were becoming tighter as she got older with the jolt jac instinctively stole another glance at his watch the umpteenth time hed done so since leaving aunt camilles why hadnt stratton called yet hed expected his call to say hed arrived at the hospital over an hour ago now is it the same thing you were worried about earlier jeanmarie asked you know the murder case you called about when we were at camilles yeah the same and is it just an alsoran case like you said jeanmarie knew him better than most and from her tone he could tell that shed read the earlier lie no point in continuing it no its quite a big case but its only a clemency plea and looks bound to fail thats why the senior partners have given it to me so that when it goes down in flames their reputations are well clear of any heat and as aunt camille asked is it a case that anyone might know yes its the lawrence durrant case jac said the words flatly plainly belying the gravity and intent they deserved perhaps because by now hed become used to repeating them or due to the pervasive feeling that had swept over him as the evening progressed a sense of guilt clinking glasses and chatting aimlessly while durrant lay in his cell at libreville the clock fast ticking against him was that what it was going to be like for the fortyfour days guilt at every moment that breathed freedom and life or was it just the sense of time being wasted that jarred oh i see equally flatly plainly even within her own little world of studies computer games pop posters starting to look at boys differently and coping with the transition from french to american culture the increasing media barrage of the durrant case had managed to penetrate but for gods sake dont tell anyone not even mum if shes pushed by camille shell find it hard to keep it under wraps jeanmarie hastily shook her head dont worry i wont say anything i promise ill she quickly sidetracked as she saw their mother walking back in with the coffee i was just saying to jac that he shouldnt worry about the date with jennifer she seems very nice yes she does as i already told jac catherine set the coffee tray down no need to worry at all but from his mothers forced smile jac could tell that the thought of her son having to go on an arranged date because of the situation they were in was troubling her more than any of them bob strattons journey out to st tereseville was marked by stages in the saintscardinals game on his car radio as he started on the lake pontchartrain causeway theyd managed to claw back three points with a fieldgoal but only four miles in as the first swirls of mist started to hit his windscreen they fell back eight points from a touchdown that was converted and as the mist became heavier as if mirroring the cloud of doom fast descending over his team they fell back another three points stratton switched off when the next touchdown against came it was becoming too painful and no way were they going to be able to play their way out of this particular hole immediately the radio commentary died he heard the sirens from behind and saw brake lights through the mist ahead he tapped his brakes and followed behind a slow crawling tailback for three minutes before it ground to a complete halt more sirens two police cars and an ambulance twenty seconds behind screamed past him obviously a collision ahead stratton looked at his watch could be a long one he toyed with the idea of tuning back into the game but the combination of the saints doomed performance and the traffic jam would probably be too much for his blood pressure he tuned into an easylistening station kmez and started humming along to glen campbells witchita lineman jac had heard the boyfriends voice next door only two nights after the big argument but for the last three nights she seemed to have been alone or at least he hadnt been able to discern any other voices from next door after the night of the argument i just dont like other guys looking at you like that jac had become curious to see her and hed started working on a plan she probably headed for the stairs at the other end of the apartment complex he never recalled hearing her pass his door after leaving if it was at night shed put on the timed hallway lights and if he left instantly and rushed towards the lbend where the corridor turned towards the far stairway he might catch a glimpse of her before she headed down the corridor was carpeted but if he kept his shoes off as an extra precaution hopefully she wouldnt hear him approaching having devised a plan jac found himself listening out more acutely for movement and voices from next door trying to gauge when she would be leaving so that he could accurately time his own exit the first occasion by the time hed heard her door shut it was practically too late for him to bother running out the second the only other opportunity so far by the time hed reached the corner of the l shed already started down the stairs the far side she didnt glance round in that fleeting second before disappearing from view and he was no nearer knowing what she looked like when hed first returned from his mothers he hadnt heard any noises from next door just after midnight she was either still out or already in bed but having still not heard from stratton jac wasnt ready for bed yet and sitting there with the tv on low and not really paying attention to bloombergs financial forecasts and next days weather suddenly he heard movement from next door sounded like the bedroom cupboard doors and drawers being opened and closed thered been the sound of another door opening and closing just before but it hadnt been the front door so probably shed been in the bathroom furthest away from him sounds from there barely reached him he moved closer to the wall ear nestled against it and strained for the minutest sound from next door a familiar position for many of the past few nights now and for a moment a picture of her fresh from the bath or shower hair still wet hit him but still he had no face to match to that misty image he stayed there listening longer than he realized his legs starting to have a few cramp twinges and for a while the sounds became more muted and indiscernible probably she was getting ready for bed and so when he heard more strident opening and closing of cupboard doors and then suddenly the front door slamming he was caught by surprise shoes off and thrown brusquely aside he managed to reach his own front door in just two strides out and running breathless he tried as best he could to suppress it so that she didnt hear him approaching like some rampant buffalo soft and swift strides too stockingfeet on carpet he could hear the steady pad of her footsteps fifteen yards the other side of the corner and prayed that it masked his own rapid stride and this time he did reach the corner before she headed down the stairs just as his cellphone rang she wheeled around and he ducked back round the corner equally as sharply and hit the button to put the call into message service he could hear that she wasnt moving was still rooted to the same spot and could almost feel her eyes boring through the bit of corner wall shielding him he kept perfectly still struggling to swallow back the weight of his breathing from his brief madcap run he feared for a moment that she was going to head back towards him he looked at the number calling bob stratton he was desperate to get to it before stratton rang off but couldnt risk moving or making any sound she stayed in the same position a moment longer undecided though to jac it felt like a lifetime with his back pressed hard against the wall breath held staring helplessly at strattons number on his cellphone as the vital seconds ticked by finally she turned and headed down the stairs he waited for her to get a few paces down before he raced back to his own apartment and as soon as the door was shut he pressed to take the call hello hello bob are you still there yes i i was just leaving a message i didnt think you were answering i was tied up for a moment sorry jac fought to regain his breath but im here now so tell me how did it go i was held up on the causeway due to an accident thats why i havent been able to call till now i was late getting there but no worries marmont is still spark out strattons tone dropped the only thing was that one of marmonts prison guard buddies was already there when i arrived some guy called miles elden oh jac felt a twinge of concern elden the name didnt strike a chord he had no idea if he was part of batesons clique or not could be just innocent it was okay i flashed my badge and said no visitors unless first cleared with your office or if anyone had a problem with that the da he didnt look about to argue with the bluff said he was simply looking in cause he was marmonts best friend and he left him a book to read for when he wakes up stephen kings pet sematary stratton chuckled probably takes a while for books to reach the comatose reading lists at least we know one thing about this elden hes an optimist but elden wasnt the only one praying that marmont wouldnt die jac reminded himself jac spent a moment confirming with stratton how they were going to keep up the vigil on marmonts bedside before ringing off then once again he was with his back against the wall eyes closed trying to wind down from the evening only a glimpse but she was gorgeous a coffeecream mixture of african and caucasian with a hint of something else from the faint slant at the corner of her eyes malaysian philippino he let his breathing fall steadily as he tried to bring her clearly into focus again in his mind but the rush to see her and almost getting caught like some pathetic voyeur only served to remind him of the sorry state of his love life how lonely and desperate hed become it was probably best that he was going on an arranged date he could hardly be trusted anymore to arrange anything for himself why do you want to die why is it you dont want me to try and save you jac went straight in with the key question no point in beating around the bush he might have got over most of the first hurdle with the attempted prison break if marmont survived but unless he tackled this they were all wasting their time he could prepare the most marvellous clemency plea for the governors office but durrant had to agree to its contents and sign the plea petition durrant shuffled uncomfortably shrugged he looked like hed have preferred some delay as if a question of such purport deserved reasonable preamble he looked almost offended to be hit with it straightaway i dont know tired first and foremost tired of the appeals and empty promises tired of waiting tired of false hope tired of life durrant looked up with a steady gaze as he hit the last words as if hed only at that moment finally discovered what most of all he was tired of youre tired and so you want out is that about it jac said it offhandly disdainfully and durrants stare became icy jac fully expected some confrontation if he was to stand a chance of shifting durrants stance it wasnt going to be easy yeah thats about it equally offhandly disdainfully jac stood up and took a couple of paces away from the interview table before turning to look back again that may be okay for you but have you given a thought to those youre leaving behind your wife your son how old is he now jac remembered the age from durrants file but he wanted durrant to say it be reminded twelve had his first birthday just a month before christmas while i was held for trial jac considered durrant dolefully for a second maybe your wife will come to terms with you dying has had a fair time to prepare herself but do you really think your son will at that age and as he saw durrant flinch and look away he knew hed struck a chord the first chink in durrants armour builtup hard these past eleven years durrant knew he was being worked but it was difficult to get angry this new lawyer was young still wet behind the ears was probably not yet seasoned and worldweary enough to know that he was a hopeless case but in a way that was also strangely gratifying most other lawyers wouldnt have bothered to put in the time at this stage would already have been signalling the guards to be let out okay so you want to die ill file accordingly no clemency petition to be made it was gratifying to know that someone still cared durrant snorted derisively you just dont understand the first five years i was here my wife and son didnt come to see me once too annoyed too angry with what id done she explained when she finally even took the time to send me a letter then when the visits did finally start they were just token looksees at most once or twice a year my birthday and sometimes just before christmas as well never christmas itself durrant snorted again she was always too busy with her other life and family outside her family and relations jac pressed to clarify because i didnt notice anything on the file about a divorce youre still married yeah if you could call it that francine met someone new eighteen months after i was inside and they started a relationship planned to marry too if hed been able to get his divorce papers through cleanly and on time from his ex but by the time they looked ready to come through three years later their relationship was already cooling off when they finally split was the first time francine started visiting me here with josh then just over two years ago she meets a new guy and after ten months with him once again the visits stop and again theres wedding plans next june if i remember right six months after ive gone suitable mourning and breathing space just wouldnt be right to mess up such plans with complications like say me stayin alive this time the derisive smile became quickly lopsided and that cool stare was back again so you see mr mcelroy my family deserted me long before i ever thought of deserting them jac took a long breath it was going to be harder than he had realized the only way he was going to prise durrant from his deathwish was with a crowbar so you feel sorry for yourself because you think your family has deserted you so now its payback time deserting them in the most dramatic way possible no way theyre ever going to forget that action especially young joshua durrant tensed as if he was about to get to his feet but then his shoulders relaxed again deserted except that is for the regular emails of the past year though now it had been almost two months since the last one had francine found out and stopped josh or maybe frank her new partner had put his spoke in durrants wry lopsided smile resurfaced you dont get it do you this isnt about them its about me oh sure they deserted me but then that was no less than i deserved and francine shes a good woman still attractive too she deserves a good and full life out there durrant shrugged who am i to deny that especially after all i put her through so it all comes back down to what i want and expect me durrant tapped his chest and as i said mr mcelroy im tired tired of the appeals and promises tired of the false hope because lets face it youre not going to be able to get governor candaret to set me free with a full pardon that just aint going to happen the best that you can hope for is a commute to life imprisonment another twelve to fifteen years in here maybe more and so that makes my mind turn to what else im tired of tired of the heat and sweat of this hellhole tired of the guards clanking keys and stomping their boots along the walkways in the dead of night just to ensure we never get a full nights sleep tired of the weeping of prisoners when they first come in or sometimes much later when they finally break and cant stand it anymore tired of the brutality of the guards and prisoners mental and physical constantly watching out for a shiv aimed for mine or roddys back tired of the corruption and drugs and stench of it all and i dont just mean the stench of nearon four thousand caged and sweaty men or the smell of their urine or the smell of bleach that never quite manages to smother the sweat and urine im talking about a stench of loneliness fear and sheer hopelessness that dont just hit your nose and synapses it reaches right down to grip your heart and soul like an icy claw leaves you completely empty and hardly a day has passed over the past long years that i havent prayed for a light to shine through the gloom and shift that emptiness but the light that finally reached me kept me going wasnt for hope in this lifetime mr mcelroy durrant fixed jac with a steady gaze again but this time the iciness had gone his eyes little more than hollow orbs weary and pitiful you see when they finally execute me theyre not really killing me because i died the day i came in here when they finally do that deed theyll be releasing me ill finally be going where ive wanted to be now for a long long time thatll be my freedom my ascension day it all went well cleanly thats good to hear no possible comeback just like the others thats good to hear too roche said except for the one that didnt go so cleanly started all this we should never forget that as if roche was ever likely to allow him to nelm thought but said nothing if hed responded to every one of roches jibes and putdowns over the years his way of compensating for the fact that he was only fivetwo podgy balding lizardeyed and had emphysema being the second richest man in the state wasnt enough theyd have spent all their time arguing but he was sure roche kept him around not only for safeties sake his darkest secrets held close under his wing but so that he could keep reminding him of the main shadow that had hung over them the past long years meter out punishment like a slowdrip torture a jibe or snide remark every three months at most six months without one if he was lucky got a bit more background too on that lawyer you mentioned nelm deftly shifted the subject jacques mcelroy lives in an apartment in the warehouse district mom lives out in hammond with his younger sister all of them fresh over from france just three years ago shortly after his fathers death though theyre originally from scotland and you were right about him being a greenhorn although hes thirtytwo hes been doing criminal law less than a year his bag before that was corporate law and french corporate law at that beaton couldnt have passed it lower down the rungs if hed tried which i think is an indication of what little weight the firms attaching to this they dont think hes got a chance of convincing candaret to commute pretty much what i heard initially but its good to get the detail and the confirmation but thats not the best part nelm continued apparently this mcelroys striking out before hes even started it seems that durrant and some buddies were trying for a prison break which is gonna make any possible clemency from candaret highly unlikely roche eased a muted chuckle always did have the knack of doing the wrong thing at the wrong time our mr durrant he took a laboured fresh breath who was this from my prison contact bateson but with the mention of bateson nelm thought hed better give roche the full story unlikely that it would develop into anything but if it did roche would question why he wasnt told earlier the only small fly in the ointment is that this mcelroy isnt accepting the prison break account for what it is hes making out that durrant was in fact trying to save the neck of a friend under attack do you think hell get anywhere with that no dont think so guards word against the prisoners looks like a nonstarter but you never know no you dont roche agreed his breathing suddenly heavier more troubled but one thing we do know is that this young lawyer despite his inexperience doesnt look like hes going to be the type to simply roll over and die at the first obstacle and thats just what we dont need some young turk eager to make a name for himself nelm left an appropriate pause what do you want me to do with him roches breathing was now rattling heavily at the other end and nelm wasnt sure if he was mulling over the situation or having trouble catching his breath to form the words after a second nelm prompted i mean do you just want me to warn him off at this stage or as you say if hes so eager to make a name for himself perhaps a few column inches arranged alongside raoul ferrer roches breathing continued to rise and fall heavily for moment like a tide over rough shale before he finally spoke again ascension day so durrants cell altar hadnt just been an escaperoute cover his religious conviction was real that might at least appease haveling that his trust hadnt been totally abused but then given havelings firebrand religious bent that might actually work against getting his support if durrant truly believes that thats his calling to be with god then who are we to stand in his way but it was one hell of a speech from durrant one that jac couldnt immediately fathom out a way of countering jac was suddenly more conscious of the oneway mirrored screen the guard the other side probably wondering what durrant had said at such length that made his lawyer look so perplexed and lost for words the sound link wouldnt be on client confidentiality jac had been scrambling from day one with durrant the attempted escape marmont in hospital durrants apparent deathwish and appeasing haveling but now it was crunch time it all ended here and now if he didnt think of something quickly no point though in mentioning that mystery email at least not until he knew more some anonymous crazy who thought he might be innocent at best it would cruelly build up durrants hopes at worst hed simply sneer at jac all the more would underline just how desperately jac was clutching at any last straw and he obviously wasnt going to get far simply trying to cajole and bully durrant push him in a corner eleven long years in libreville had toughened his hide too much for that and hed used much of that time to educate himself he was no longer the same man depicted in his initial arrest and trial folders he was mentally tougher and far more astute maybe that was the key or at least a useful conversational sideturn to diffuse things well one compensation i suppose not all your time in heres been wasted jac commented in what way durrant eyed him warily the studying and literary degree you gained quite an achievement couldnt have been easy no answer from durrant simply a wry smile of acknowledgement as if he could see already where jac was heading and wasnt about to be drawn in then helping run the prison library couldnt have been easy either and quite a challenge to organize jac continued must have kept you busy still no answer from durrant only a gentle nod of the head and an impatient weary gaze as if to say tell me when you get to something important wont you the other inmates are going to miss you still that impatient steady gaze so jac clarified you know your organizational abilities in the library how youve arranged everything now no guarantee that whoever takes over from you will keep it the same and by the way do you know who that will be roddy durrant said flatly disinterestedly or maybe theyll stretch perettis duties oh roddy was durrants closest friend in libreville and although jac didnt know peretti obviously he handled the other twohour shift of the four the library was open each day barring sundays durrant would probably have already talked to one or both of them about the continued smooth running of the library after hed gone another deadend by the way how did you get the nickname thes jac asked eager to keep the conversation rolling short for thesaurus oh right because of your literary expertise no from crosswords durrant had retreated into a pattern of answers between nil and three words seemed determined not to make things easy on jac he was going to have to work for it from crosswords yeah cause if you think about it apart from a few cryptics most crosswords are built around alternative word choices another word for dumb stupid another word for faltering floundering like in a thesaurus some more words at least but they were delivered with a tired laboured tone as if durrant was enlightening an irksome mentally challenged child jac couldnt help wondering whether stupid and floundering mirrored how durrant felt about his lawyer at that moment jac introduced a brisker tone so did the reading and interest in literature come later or about the same time as the crosswords mostly later jac stayed silent held a steady gaze on durrant that made it clear he expected more he was determined not to be taken for a fool and probably the best way was to work durrant equally as hard as the silence became uncomfortable and the muted clatter and murmur of the prison beyond reached them durrant looked at his shoes briefly before looking back up oh sure early on i was reading some light stuff now and then grisham patterson elmore leonard but then as i got deep into the crosswords and progressed from doing the local advocate and usa today to the washington post and new york times cryptics sometimes as many as three or four a day my reading also became deeper and more involved steinbeck melville dostoyevsky the bible full circle back to durrants religion and although he was finally starting to open up more it was delivered begrudgingly as if durrant resented having to explain or saw little purpose to it after all he was going to die soon but for the first time jac felt more in control of the situation felt hed pieced together enough to be able to fight back he shook his head you know youre a real conundrum mr durrant conundrum as in puzzle enigma durrant interjected jac continued unabated youve spent much of your time in here making your life more worthwhile reading organizing the library getting a degree in literature helping with the prison magazine but then in the same breath you tell me that everything here all around you is dire worthless so dire and worthless that you cant wait to die and so keen on dying are you so disinterested in continued life that you and your prison pals have spent the last year planning to escape jac leant forward over the interview table youre well read mr durrant so youll probably know your plato that a man is judged by his actions not his words and while you might tell me that you want to die and have thrown at me all sorts of reasoning to support that your actions tell me otherwise they tell me correction shout that you want to live durrants sly smile had started rising again perceived challenge this time rather than annoyance but halfway through it died with a flinch that brought something harder to his eyes thats because you dont fully pay attention mr mcelroy what me and my buddies were aiming for was freedom not a continued clinging to what passes for life in this rathole but fullblown freedom and if youre offering me that then id gladly grasp it with both hands and say thankyou but youre not and we both know damn well that that isnt even likely to happen the best that youre offering is another ten to fifteen in here and that being the case id rather say thank you but no thank you ill pass durrant leant forward to emphasize his point that being okay with you no thats not okay with me jac fired back durrants face was only eighteen inches away his heavyhooded eyes drilling home his message and he recoiled back slightly in surprise im not offering an absolute by pleading to candaret freedom or even continued wellbeing in here for you im even far from convinced that candaret is going to offer anything but what i am offering is hope hope that he might commute and that in a few years you might be eligible for release or that meanwhile something else might come out of the hat as close as jac dared get to hinting at the email and for that alone its worth a try because even if you werent well read mr durrant youd remember from your bible alone that when all the evils of the world were let loose from pandoras box all that was left was hope greek mythology again as it happens hesiods theogony if i remember right the point im trying to make jac rolled on impatiently is that you claim youve seen all manner of dark things in here over the years all manner of evil so maybe that hope at the end of the tunnel is somehow fitting and thats what im offering thats all im offering jac held out one hand in a helpless gesture but fine if you can look me straight in the eye and tell me theres nothing in life you want to hang on for no possible hope around the corner in a few months or years then ill walk out of here now and not look back durrants eyes had flickered uncertainly towards the end as if jac had hit a raw nerve but it was only for a couple of seconds as if what was troubling durrant was too elusive pushed quickly away sorry to disappoint you mr mcelroy durrant said at length shaking his head but theres nothing im hanging on for and certainly not hope ive been thinking things through for some while now probably too long then that makes you a somewhat unique human being larry durrant unlike the rest of us because youll also know from your reading that one of the most basic human desires is the need to know what happens next jac kept his gaze steadily on durrant and do you mean to tell me that theres not a single thing left you want to live for or are curious about knowing what happens next this time durrant was quick to hide the flinch by looking down at the table or maybe it was the intensity of jacs gaze possibly seeing things which durrant was keen to shield the private demons of eleven years in libreville unique human being been called a few things in my time but thats a new one durrant smiled crookedly but kept his eyes averted until he hit his last words but the trouble with that theory mr mcelroy is that what happens next in here becomes somewhat predictable jac absorbed what he saw in durrants eyes for a moment before conceding that there was probably nowhere left for him to go whatever was niggling at durrant in the background in the end eleven years in libreville had won out made him not wish to endure it a day longer well did my best jac said shuffling his papers back together from the table but one thing i dont think youve thought about fully is roddy seems to me that if you hadnt reached him when you did in the boiler room the other day tally would have had his way with him and hed now be in a body bag how long do you think hes going to last with you no longer there to watch his back three months six for the first time durrant reluctantly granted a more open smile ive got to admit youre good what you mean is im not the hopeless weakassed rookie lawyer you thought i was when i first walked in here i wouldnt go that far more importantly does that mean i might have finally convinced you to pitch for some hope with our dear governor candaret i wouldnt go that far either it might just mean that youre too young and foolish to know when to quit i think youve given me a pretty good object lesson on that score mr durrant jac said putting the last of his papers in his case and snapping it shut yeah im sorry if i went a bit hard on you durrant grimaced because i know youve gone to some trouble on this even sent a detective out to st tereseville general in case bateson and his cronies got to marmont before he woke up and a supposed friend of marmonts elden was already out there though thankfully marmont was still out even left him a book to read for when he woke up stephen kings pet sematary if you will durrant smiled elden is okay not particularly one of batesons tight circle but i appreciate it if not directly for me then for how roddy will be dealt with after im gone thats okay jac proffered his hand and durrant took it into a shake i just wish youd change your mind because i think roddys going to miss you even if he does manage to survive in here with you gone and your son twelve vulnerable age that uncertain flinch again which if hed been able to read he might have been able to prise durrant open more and convince him but durrant just nodded dolefully as jac handed over his card call me please if you do have a change of heart that look of uncertainty that deep down there was something that durrant wanted to live for was the only hope jac clung to as he paced back through the prison will call wont call will call wont call but with each echoing step and gate clanked shut behind him through the cavernous extremities of libreville that hope began to fade if nothing else dr leonard truelle was a creature of habit he read the daily newspapers every morning in his favourite cafe on iberville street over coffee and croissants except when he had outside assessments or clinical notes to review for patients that day in which case hed use his morning coffee break for that and delay catching up on the troubles of the world outside until he left work but on some occasions like tonight those assessment reviews also coincided with his tuesday and friday single drink rituals so hed then spread out with his papers at a corner table rather than sit up at the bar but the order of reading day or night was always the same first the majors the nyt washington post and chicago tribune twelve to fifteen minutes on each then finally the timespicayune which held his attention for no more than six or eight minutes truelle always felt more connected to the country at large than locally possibly through having graduated from cornell and spent his first eight years of practice in new york hed only gone to new orleans when his mother became ill shed long since died but through circumstance the drink and a mess of other problems hed never managed to grasp a time when he was organized or brave enough to return he still felt twenty years on from his last days of practice in the big apple that he was in new orleans through duty rather than choice the only things he found solace in were the warmer climes and the seafood the rest of it the petty wrangling and corruption of city officials the environmentalists fighting a losing battle against the oil refineries along the coast constantly grated and so he always gave the picayune short shrift as he flicked through he was flicking through so rapidly skimming halfblindly that he could have easily missed the entry tucked in the bottom lefthand corner of page fifteen raoul ferrer financier and businessman was found dead in an algiers car lot in the early hours of friday morning early police reports cite the cause as two gunshot wounds from a mm calibre weapon to the head on occasion linked to the malastra organization ferrer the noise and activity of the bar around him suddenly became more distant muted he wasnt sure if the barman benny had heard him above the drone from the sudden bloodrush to his head as he called out for another drink but benny was certainly looking his way having paused midwipe of the bar counter as he saw truelle suddenly transfixed by the paper as if hed seen a ghost one hand gripping tight to the page as he read and reread the other reaching absently to knock back in one the bourbon that hed usually nurse for another half hour are you sure benny asked eyeing him with concern four months into the ritual benny felt that enough rapport existed between them for him to breach barmans protocol and ask why always only the one drink from that point on benny had become a silent conspirator in keeping him clean yeah benny never been surer bring it on he beckoned elaborately but was careful not to meet bennys eye shield the demons then as he watched benny pouring in fact bring over the whole bottle this time he looked even further aslant somewhere between new york and new orleans to avoid bens withering gaze only looking up with a tight smile as benny came over and set the glass and bottle down your funeral benny said resignedly the tired tone of a barman whod seen more than he dared count finally slip off the wagon truelle knocked the drink down in two slugs as soon as benny turned away poured drank poured drank poured drank but it did little to quell his panic or give him any clarity of thought his head was still buzzing and his hands still shaking he pushed the bottle abruptly away suddenly picturing the months ahead of trying to push away more and more bottles but never quite succeeding the lost hours and days and mental lapses the patients neglected the sickness and depression friends patting his shoulder concernedly are you okay len the steady downward spiral that he knew so well truelles eyes darted around the table there was even a small article on durrant on page nine of the nyt obviously the first to hit the national press anti capital punishment campaigners both local and from outofstate are planning a vigil in front of librevilles prison gates in the runup to the execution maybe that was it truelle thought surrounded by too many demons the bottle durrant raoul ferrer the bar where nelm had paid him a visit just a week ago he had to get out he pushed the table back its legs grating roughly and turning a few heads from the bar he felt himself sway uncertainly as he took the first few steps he had been off the wagon a long while in the good old days hed have put away a few stiff ones like that without hardly blinking he waved briefly towards benny as he passed again careful not to meet his eye or for that matter those at the bar who were now watching his exit with curious smiles tabit benny ill catch you next time it was worse outside a confusion of traffic noise horns beeping people rushing by and calling out the height of the rush hour and happy hour on chartres street all of it seemed amplified in his head along with the buzzing and he felt himself swaying more or was it the street and all the people around tilting he bumped into a woman with her shopping bags and reached out to steady himself on the man just behind who pushed the arm brusquely away with a sneer another horn blaring sharper more immediate the sudden flare of headlamps making him realize hed staggered into the road he jumped back and took a deep breath trying to steady himself and his nerves maybe he was panicking for nothing in ferrers line of work it was only a matter of time before he was found in an empty car lot or ditch but it was the timing in the runup to durrants execution that made it ominous nelm pays himself a visit to make sure that everything is cool then next on the list is raoul ferrer this time though nelm had obviously decided that everything wasnt so cool the only way he could know for sure was by calling nelm nelm probably wouldnt admit it outright but hed glean enough from the cadence and inflection of what was said the trained psychiatrists ear but the call in itself might be the one thing to alert nelm that things might not be so cool with himself either would make him next on the list cool it was a warm and sultry night but truelle felt icecold his whole body starting to tremble and shiver rooted to the spot amongst the milling throng his stance underlined how isolated he felt at that moment with nobody he felt he could turn to advising thousands through the years but who had ever been there for him when he most needed it and his burden had been far far beyond that of any of those hed had to sit patiently listening to through the years perhaps it was time to tell nelm and adelay roche about his insurance policies no point in them finding out after the event that killing him was the one thing that would throw everything into the open jac was waiting in the anteroom to the payne beaton and sawyer boardroom along with seventeen other lawyers and paralegals for the companys regular wednesday morning progress meeting when the call came through on his cellphone the ritual meetings were presided over by either jeremiah payne or clive beaton dougy sawyer would take the role of company secretary saying little but making furious notes throughout and order of importance in the company was all but determined by time of arrival junior lawyers and paralegals were expected at am sharp senior lawyers at and finally the presiding partners at the message was patently clear when the company gods arrived woe betide any laggers that might hold up proceedings even for a second the tenminute wait for the juniors though was often insufferable it was intended to give them more time to prepare their notes or get comments clearer in their minds but more often than not it just gave them more time to dwell and become increasingly anxious jac was no exception particularly this morning hed been turning over and over in his mind just how much to show and tell about durrant if he told about the attempted prison break beaton might well axe the case but then if haveling decided finally to go with the guards account of events the whole thing would come out later how was he going to cover for that and he certainly couldnt reveal that durrant wanted to die didnt want a plea made on his behalf for sure beaton would axe the whole case instantly his cellphone ringing broke his train of thought he looked at the number same area code as libreville prison but it wasnt havelings direct number durrant jac quickly answered perhaps durrant had had a change of heart and he wouldnt have to go through any subterfuge now at beatons meeting mr mcelroy its about something you said the other day yes jac felt his hopes rise about the book that elden left at the hospital for marmont pet sematary jac subdued his voice to a mumble he could feel a few eyes on him particularly kyle everett no calls during the meeting obviously but even those prior to it were frowned upon might disturb the thoughts and notemaking of others yeah well thing is marmont has already read that book several times in fact its his favourite book and hell readily quote from it to anyone whos got the time and inclination to listen particularly the scene where the dogs brought back to life apparently marmont lost a muchloved pet dog years back a golden retriever and hes read and reread that passage as if wishing the same might happen with his own dog durrant sniggered lightly of course on the way completely missing kings underlying message with what eventually happens with the dog i see jac saw quickly where durrant was heading you mean thered be absolutely no point in giving that book to marmont unless of course there was an ulterior motive such as say getting some sort of message to him got it in one counselor like i said the other day youre brighter than i thought youre so kind but you know when i first took the call i was hoping it might have been about in his side vision jac could now see clive beaton and the other partners approaching the anteroom he broke off from saying more after a second durrant prompted about what mr mcelroy you know about after a peremptory survey of the room beatons eagle eye settled on him jac nodded and held one hand up to indicate hed be finished post haste about what we were discussing the other day about me wanting to die mr mcelroy is that what you mean yes thats right about that i thought you might have had a change of heart after a quick aside to a colleague beatons eyes were back on him keenly jac felt himself flush and a tingle rise at the back of his neck if he was feeling uncomfortable after just a quick glance how on earth was he going to carry off the subterfuge through the entire meeting afraid of saying it are we mr mcelroy durrants voice was jocular taunting dont want to face it so maybe if you dont even say it you can push the spectre further away like it was a dirty word no its not that its durrant rolled straight over him well ive done nothing but face death these past years mr mcelroy had precious little else worth thinking about so it dont hold any fears for me any more so thats why im not afraid to say it use the word i understand all jac could think of was getting off the line half the assembled group had already filed through to the boardroom and beatons stare towards him was now penetrating bordering on hostile yeah you understand durrant mocked so youll understand too that having thought about it for that long it aint exactly the sort of thing im going to change my mind about overnight no really i do understand and ill get somebody onto that book thing with marmont straightaway but if youll excuse me now ive got to go im already late for a meeting jac rang off and followed beaton and the last few into the boardroom probably sounded more flippant than hed intended ive got a meeting to attend so if you want to die you just go right ahead but maybe it wasnt such a bad thing to mislead durrant that he didnt care that much after all if as a result durrant dropped his defences he might see a clearer way through jac checked his emails as soon as he got out of the meeting still no reply as yet he checked first thing every morning and kept half an eye on it through each day but now four days had passed with nothing it was starting to look more and more like a prank or hoax or a friend or relative of durrants that couldnt reveal themselves if it was real then why not say who they were or somehow back up their claim in the end jac hadnt said anything about the dramas with durrant in the meeting hopefully thered be some clearer resolve on both fronts over the coming days and then he could say something jac didnt want to call stratton from inside the office so told penny vance that he was going to grab a coffee he hit the buttons of his cellphone as his feet hit the pavement outside thered been a heavy storm overnight and with the sun burning off the last of the cloud and haze humidity was high early november but it was still in the seventies jac could feel his shirt sticking to his back after only a few paces bob stratton answered quickly but there was a confusion of noise in the background from a busy shopping mall or store and jac had to raise his voice above the passing traffic as he explained about marmont and pet sematary so if you think it might be some sort of message did durrant give any hint as to what form it might take stratton pressed do we know what we might be looking for no thats it all we know is that marmont has these favourite scenes in the book due to his own dog dying years back and that its odd he should be given a book hes already read several times especially when hes still in a coma that aside jac joined stratton briefly in a muted chuckle were assuming that if he doesnt wake up whatever problem exists goes with him its only if and when he does come to so perhaps theres a note with the book or maybe something inside the book itself outside of that were fishing and you want yours truly the fisherman to head out there and start reading stephen king yeah jac stopped by the deli window held back from going inside he didnt want to add to the noise coming from strattons end as soon as the only problem is im not due out there until nine this evening and ive got one of those days ahead of me the earliest i could rearrange things to get out there is late afternoon four or five okay jac recalled that stratton had an arrangement running with a couple of shift nurses to block any visitors and phone him the minute there were signs of marmont awakening but could you meanwhile phone your friendly nurses and ask them to remove any cards and packages from marmonts room for you to inspect when you arrive hes not under any circumstances to see them will do and ill phone as soon as i have news jac stepped inside the deli as he wished stratton luck and rang off with a busy midmorning crowd and the steam from the espresso machine it seemed even hotter than outside shirt sticking to his back the last time he recalled that was when hed first walked through libreville prison not just from nerves but as the heat stench and oppression the staleness of thousands of caged hopes and emotions sank through his skin he felt as if he was still sticky and unclean hours later even after showering as soon as he got home that was how he felt after only minutes inside libreville durrant had been there eleven years latte and a danish mr jac yeah joe thanks his usual daily takeout for the first time jac began to question his own motives probably durrant had every right to want to die he himself might well feel the same after all those years inside somewhere like libreville was he hoping to save durrants life for durrants benefit or merely for his own reputation to stop his first significant case collapsing at the first hurdle bob stratton found the note straightaway but it was brief told him nothing thought you might like to read again your favourite scene remember how the locks and light switches were tagged for your shift seek and ye shall find the only useful thing was that the note had been slotted as a bookmark in marmonts favourite scene the dog coming back to life stratton didnt need to hunt through to find it but there was nothing else on the pages no underlining circling or cryptic notes stratton flicked through the rest of the book and tipped it upside down in case there were other notes inside but there was nothing he decided to grab a quick coffee from the canteen to clear his throat and his thoughts and while sipping he studied the note again hoping that something more might leap out at him the favourite scene was mentioned so that was no secret or perhaps they wanted in particular to bring marmonts attention to it but why mention tagging the locks and light switches why was that so important seek and ye shall find stratton scanned and rescanned the note in between sips find what what on earth was there to find in just a threeline note and why say your shift surely there were only two shifts day and stratton sat up with a jolt almost spilling his coffee nightshift if theyd put it like that it might have given too strong a clue to an inquisitive thirdparty stratton darted down the corridor and found one of his friendly nurses josie is there a cupboard or storeroom that can be grabbed for a moment somewhere where its dark josie raised an eyebrow and smiled slyly well you sure know how to sweettalk a girl stratton returned the smile but a flush rose quickly from his collar no its not that i just need to be alone with this for a moment stratton pointed to the book in his hand from the way josies eyebrow stayed arched quizzically as she led him along the corridor hed made the request seem no less odd stratton found the first word on the second page of marmonts favourite scene highlighted silvergrey in the darkness then two more on the next page one on the next two pages with nothing then another word stratton flicked through almost thirty pages before the highlighted words petered out he then went back to the beginning to put it all together making notes on a pad as he went when hed finished he flicked on the storeroom light and read what hed written dont say anything about the fight until youve had a chance to speak to us its important we get our stories straight stratton punched the air got em you look pleased with yourself josie commented as he exited i didnt know stephen king had that type of scene in his books only a weak halfsmile this time from stratton he was too busy concentrating on tapping out jac mcelroys number on his cellphone jac took the call as he was walking along camp street only a block away from his apartment hed got used to walking back and forth to work just over a mile it was better than braving rushhour traffic and paying allday carpark charges on st charles street only the firms senior partners had reserved places in the back parking lot jac beamed widely as stratton told him the news from st tereseville general to those passing they probably thought hed just arranged a hot date that was tomorrow night and wouldnt raise much of a smile thats great jac said looks like weve got the guards account roped and tied even if marmont does wake up then realizing that probably sounded flippant though obviously it would be better if he did not least for marmont himself in their brief association hed enjoyed strattons offbeat patter hopefully stratton appreciated it being bounced back if nothing else so that he can read pet sematary for the hundredth time might send him back into a coma again strattons chuckle faded as they came onto the mechanics of just where and when hed be able to get a written report to jac im hoping to head back out to libreville again this weekend jac said theres one final person i want to see who was involved in this and combined with your report that should nail things once and for all with haveling as jac swung open the door to his apartment block the hall light was already on so he didnt bother to push the timed switch stratton said that hed type up his report either when he got back that night or first thing in the morning itll be sitting here for you to pick up anytime after eleven tomorrow or if youre not going to libreville until sunday ive got time to messenger it over to you ive got a couple of calls to make first jac had heard that rodriguez was finally in a fit state to be interviewed but aside from him verifying durrants account of the guards assault there was another vital reason to see him ill phone you back as soon as i know when im heading out there jac had just reached the top of the entrance stairs as he signed off and was slightly breathless not just from walking and talking at the same time but from the adrenalin rush of strattons news only a second later the hallway light clicked off plunging him into darkness jac reached out and made contact with the wall to one side feeling his way along three more paces to the corner of the corridor then five or six feet the other side was the light switch surely he knew the positioning so offbyheart now that he could locate it even in the pitch dark the fall of his own breathing seemed somehow heavier in the darkness though suddenly he became aware of some other sound beyond it he froze and held his breath listening intently above his own rapid heartbeat someone else was there only a few paces away moving stealthily towards him in the darkness carmen malastra was a don from the old school moustache petes don corleones and dinosaurs were amongst the many disparaging terms for them malastra was keenly aware that in order to survive he should keep abreast of the times with at least one foot in the modern age brutally wiping out anyone who got within a sniff of threatening his power base might not on its own be enough for years hed resisted anything to do with modern electronics and computers that was for his kids correct that grandkids and whenever it played a part in his many business enterprises well that was what he employed geeks and nerds for besides at his age now the wrong side of sixty it wasnt seemly gentlemanly to be seen playing around on a computer next to some kid with a nose ring and half his hair dyed flameorange he was of a different era an age where suaveness and style still had meaning but as soon as that thought hit him he realized hed found the key to keeping one foot in the modern age he took three twomonth night courses without saying a word to anyone his capos and staff thought that he must have a private lady friend very private and when hed finished the courses he could talk java hotmetal firewalls and macromedia with the best of them his liverspotted hands flying across the keyboard but the rest of him still remained very much old school formal evening suits for dinners and functions black in winter white in summer often with a cummerbund aqua di selva doused liberally on his neck and mixed with olive oil to coat his sweptback grey hair the scent of pine and olive trees it reminded him of playing in the woodlands and farmfields of his native calabria when he was a little boy the first thing hed done with his new computer knowledge was go through his accounts see if he could siphon even more cash out of reach of the irs that was when he discovered that some siphoning was already taking place but heading the other way from his bay tree casino nelm phoned in the middle of this dilemma claiming the hit on ferrer and apologizing for same he was trying to stiff my mr roche outta some funds under normal circumstances wed of course have come to you first let you deal with it your own way but i got into an unfortunate argument with ferrer he went for his piece and i was left with little choice i see was unfortunate malastras attention was still mostly on his computer screen trying to pick apart just how the scam had taken place and who was responsible but as a mark of respect we felt we should make a contribution the same amount that ferrer was demanding forty thousand seemed right that got malastras attention thats quite a sum ferrer was after yeah it was silence nelm obviously wasnt going to offer to explain and malastra wasnt going to be clumsy enough to ask thank you kindly for the offer and i accept itll help fill the hole in what ferrer was pulling in in reality thered be no hole ferrer had been replaced within two days and malastra was glad of the call it got rid of the nagging worry that it might have been a rival and a turf war was looming give my regards to your fine mr roche two more days on and off at the computer and malastra had put all the pieces together originally set up to skim money away from the irs involving exchanging cash for dummy receipts between the bar and chipcashing booth it looked like the bay trees manager george jouliern had been taking some off the top for himself malastra picked up the phone and summoned one of his capos tommy byebye angellini byebye eased his large frame into the proffered chair and waited patiently as malastra went through his final deliberations on the computer pushing fifty byebyes hair was dyed jet black partly to hide the grey but mostly in homage to his two idols elvis and johnny cash with his bulk he looked more like elvis in his final hamburger days malastra looked up finally from his computer screen george jouliern and soon that was all that was said between the two men byebye nodded and left im sorry if i startled you no thats okay jac said the girl from next door he felt his face still flushed from the adrenalin rush or maybe it was her proximity viewed from a corridors length away she was a beauty but up close she took his breath away her brown eyes seemed to sparkle and tease at the same time and her body heat and perfume wrapped around him like a soft velvet shroud his mouth was suddenly dry i i was just reaching for the light switch on the way to my apartment jac pointed towards his door oh right you live there were neighbours and didnt even know it she smiled broadly and reached out a delicate hand alaysha reyner pleased to meet you jac took the proffered hand and shook it lightly jac mcelroy jack with no k pleased to meet you too they stood silently awkwardly for a second not sure who might speak next if there was anything else to say then she reached down to the bag shed left on the floor as shed pushed the light switch but as she straightened she looked at jac again as if as an afterthought by the way was that you i saw coming along the corridor the other day she asked then suddenly disappeared from view yes i jac was distracted as a door opened on the other side of the corridor and alaysha turned too mrs orwin pushing eighty and halftoothless who made it her business to check any noise close by her door and strike up a conversation with the passerby if she saw fit appraised them briefly forced a closedmouth grimace so that she didnt frighten them too much then as quickly closed the door back the few inches shed opened it the flushing in jacs face had subsided slightly with the pause i i got a call on my cellphone and had to head back to the apartment oh okay alaysha appraised him with a wry smile and here was me thinking that you were hiding from me as if jac said hoping that despite his obvious embarrassment she might take it as a compliment she studied him a second longer as if unsure how to read his reaction well must go now again nice to meet you yes you too then as with a smile she turned away jac panicked that this might be the last time hed see her for a while he might not get this opportunity again i was wondering if you might like to go but as she looked back he felt himself melt again along with any resolve and thought better of it no its okay i it doesnt matter alaysha studied him more intently this time her eyes scanning from his shoes then back up to his face quite tall lightbrown hair fairly handsome though not prettyboy so but he had the most incredible bluegrey eyes which somehow seemed sad lost she couldnt work out why she found them so appealing and his accent a faint hint of french along with something else a coy smile tilted one side of her mouth were you just about to ask me out on a date no ii but under the intensity of her gaze her coy smile becoming questioning challenging the pretence felt foolish well yes but i realize it could be awkward for you you probably still have a boyfriend her mouth curled into a grimace as if shed encountered a bad taste i havent as it turns out hes history even though very recent history her face quickly brightened again as she gave him another onceover with her eyes so if youre asking the answer is yes thats great jac mellowed his rapidly rising smile so that he didnt come across as overeager maybe we could go to arnauds or begues she seemed to only half take in the possible venues but not tomorrow night im working and the same too most fridays and saturdays sundays or mondays are the best oh except this sunday im due to go to my moms jac didnt want to leave it until the following weekend this coming monday then what say eight oclock give me time to get all the way over to your place okay youve got a date she smiled and nodded putting one hand lightly on his shoulder in acknowledgement shaking hands suddenly seemed too formal now that they were going on a date then her expression became slightly quizzical as what hed said earlier suddenly dawned on her you said still have a boyfriend have you maybe seen me coming in with gerry sometime before then again with the steadiness of her gaze any pretence felt out of place jac swallowed no its not that i heard him shouting at you a few nights back and there was some banging and thudding that worried me im sorry jac wasnt sure whether he was apologizing for her having a boyfriend that shouted at her or for listening in thats why i tried to see you on the corridor the other day to see whether he might have hurt you her eyes flickered as she took in what he said rolling through varying emotions pain of the memory embarrassment that anyone had heard but as her face softened and her eyes became slightly moist it was clear the emotion that had finally won through she brought one hand up and lightly touched one of jacs cheeks with the back of her fingertips youre a sweet guy thanks its nice to know that you took the trouble to care she could have added it was nice to know that anyone still cared but there was no point in burdening this jac mcelroy with the darker shades of her life frightening him off before theyd even started to get to know each other jacs step was light as they said their goodbyes until monday night and he walked into his apartment no lovelife to speak of since madeleine and suddenly he had two dates in as many days it looked like being a pivotal weekend for his career too if he got nothing worthwhile from rodriguez hed have little choice but to walk away from the durrant case so they took you down to the boiler room jac confirmed did you make any noise that might alert anyone did anyone else see you on the way down i made some noise at first when i realized what was goin down but one of em got a hand quickly over my mouth and wit the route they took cutting down past the restrooms and laundry and only passin a handful of cells with open fronts im not sure just who mighta heard or saw me rodriguez looked down thoughtfully for a second though of course with who showed up later obviously one person did hear me the tension mounted steadily in the small interview room as rodriguez described the events on the night he was taken from his cell haveling his assistant pete folley and a guard were ensconced behind the oneway glass screen the red light on the base of the table microphone indicating that sound was going through to them when rodriguez had entered the interview room jac saw that he carried three books the catcher in the rye steinbecks the grapes of wrath and dostoyevskis crime and punishment and beneath them a handwritten letter and two editions of librevilles quarterly magazine librevoice i brought these rodriguez offered cause you said on the phone that you wanted support for why larry thes should continue living thats true i did jac nodded towards the microphone the redlight wasnt on at that stage haveling and folley were just getting settled behind the screen but thats going to be for the second part of the interview this first part which will be monitored and recorded is to establish what happened on the night of october twentyfourth the night you received your injuries the last thing jac wanted to do was go into detail about durrants deathwish with haveling listening in rodriguez wasnt tall no more than fivefive and was slightly built jac could see that he might have problems in libreville without someone like durrant to watch his back and the evidence of that was strongly etched on his face with the welts and bruises still there one of them a golfballsized lump that half closed one eye the sight of rodriguez injuries werent helped by the freckles across his nose and cheeks some of them so large they looked almost like blotches as if his latino blood had had problems dispersing evenly through his skin but his liveliness of spirit was evident in his eyes coalblack constantly darting assessing sparkling with verve and cloaked humour or if you caught him on a bad day malice his only warningoff device jac leant closer to the mike and when they grabbed you in your cell did you recognize them not at first it was too dark but as they took me out into the corridor i gotta better look rodriguez glanced towards the mirroredglass screen as if appreciating that the information would have most impact to those behind it the guard was dennis marmont and the other two were inmates silass and jayt i see and was there another guard with them at any time a certain glenn bateson no no there wasnt he only appeared at the last minute with nother two guards to break everything up in fact only one other person was present tally shavell he was already waitin for me down in the boiler room king shit rodriguez shook his head sorry thats our other nickname for him before the meeting jac had spent twenty minutes in the annexe to havelings office going through rodriguez file in libreville for murdering a rival pimp for the heavy beating of one of his stable of girls rodriguez had taken a basic paralegal course which had led to him being one of two inmates entrusted to help run the prisons communication and advice centre since a significant part of that would entail contact between inmates and their legal representatives jac could see rodriguez formal legalese phrasing take over as he explained events but his more familiar prison jibetalk wasnt far beneath the surface once you were down in the boiler room what happened then jac wanted more detail on the assault not only for the impact of what theyd done to rodriguez to sink home with haveling but because it was something difficult to lie about in minute graphic detail as rodriguez related the events jac could practically see him wince with the memory of each blow landing the shadows in his eyes mirroring his fear in those desperate moments and if lawrence durrant hadnt arrived when he did what do you believe would have happened to you jac asked i believe theyda killed me in fact im sure that was their aim all along jac purposely left silence as breathing space to rodriguez closing comment then leant closer to the microphone thank you mr rodriguez that concludes this part of the interview he fired a tight grimace towards the glass screen as he flicked off the red light hopefully it was enough to convince haveling especially with the coded note intended for marmont that jac had shown him the atmosphere in the interview room immediately eased with the red light off both of them knowing that they were no longer being monitored and as jacs eyes fell again to the books rodriguez was there before him explaining if you look at the letter at the front written by larry eight years ago at the time of his appeal then at the margin notes made in the books youll see what im gettin at jac scanned the letter then started flicking through the first pages of the catcher in the rye it took a moment for jac to realize what the notes were before confirming with rodriguez these are larry durrants notes in the margin jac rapidly flicked through the rest of the book some pages had no margin notes at all some only one or two small entries but in almost half the book the notes were extensive often almost filling the available margin space all of these suggested changes and corrections yeah thats right hes been editin catcher in the rye for christs sake a fuckin merican classic rodriguez picked up the other two books and quickly fanned their pages towards jac and the same with steinbeck and dostoyevski and going from that rodriguez tapped the letter then pointed back to the books to that youll get some handle on just how much larry durrant has progressed while hes been in here and on top we got all his good work an contributions with the prison magazine rodriguez pulled out one of the magazines and held it up thats why hes worthwhile fightin for why hes now a worthwhile citizen that shouldnt be allowed to die rodriguez shook his head he just aint the same larry durrant he was when he first came in here jac looked again at the letter even though it was fairly basic and simple with two or three spelling errors it didnt smack of total illiteracy although jac took rodriguez point there was a grand canyon gap between the letter and durrants editing notes and articles a remarkable journey that could hopefully impress the state governor as to durrants worthiness if they got that far thanks for this and believe me ill put it all to good use to try and tip governor candarets hand but right now thats not the problem jac grimaced tightly the immediate hurdle is not whether we can convince the state not to execute durrant but whether or not he wants to live because he tells me flat out that he doesnt want to hes tired had enough and doesnt even want me to put in a clemency plea on his behalf he wants to die his ascension day he calls it oh that from rodriguez tone it wasnt clear whether that referred to durrants admission of wanting to die or his religion hes shared this with you before his wanting to die yeah a couple of times rodriguez shrugged but yer know we all go through that in here from time to time so down and weary of it all that we just want out and if we cant actually get out then that becomes the alternative rodriguez shook his head but when it came t the crunch possible clemency on one hand and execution the other i didnt think hed actually go trough with it thats sad to know sad and bad rodriguez looked down morosely for a second all the verve suddenly gone from his eyes you tried pushin him didnt just take it firstoff thats what he wanted yes tried everything even that he needed to hang around to watch your back that you wouldnt last long in here without him nice to know that tactic was so effective rodriguez smiled briefly you know on occasion when he got down and brought this subject up bout wantin to die id josh him how could he and miss out on all my good jokes over the next ten years even jus making fun of tally shavell and takin him down a notch or two was surely worth the ticket price of those extra years and after that sly laugh of his hed pat me on the shoulder and say that id already brightened his days nough for a hundred years hed never forget me rodriguez shook his head never forget me i should have caught on then that he was more serious bout it than i thought jac realized then that the association between them at least from rodriguez to durrant had been mostly jocular and bantering with rodriguez constantly trying to lift durrants mood whenever he was gloomy or down it might have felt out of place for rodriguez to suddenly step out of that mould and get serious start probing durrant whether he really wanted to die or what had made him feel that way perhaps rodriguez too to keep his own psyche upbeat wouldnt have wanted to hear the answers thats the main reason im here now mr rodriguez apart from hearing your account of what happened that night in the boiler room with shavell to find out if theres anything you can think of that might convince larry durrant to want to continue living anything rodriguez looked uncomfortable i dont know dealin out his innermost thoughts and secrets where he might not want it thats not what me and him are all bout hes a very private guy and i mean if hes already made his mind up maybe we should respect that rodriguez met jacs eyes steadily for a second before casting them to one side some darker shadows settling into them larry was in here five years fore i even got here you know and if things aint bad nough here now libreville was a much more brutal unforgivin place then the highest inmate murder rate of any prison nationwide god knows what those years might have done to him in here man yer know rodriguez tapped his chest with his fist then pointed to the books forcing a smile also it aint as if hes the easiest guy to sway now hes got to the point of thinkin he knows better than salinger and steinbeck what the hell difference do you think you or i are gonna make jac looked down conceding the point hed found much the same with durrant defiant and immovable in their last meeting hed seen only one small chink of possible weakness durrants son joshua jac asked what can you tell me about their association when i mentioned the boy it seemed to be the only thing to create some doubt in durrants mind if only for a moment rodriguez looked even more uneasy he raised a sharp eyebrow larrys family oooooh no definite nogo area larry guards them more jealously than any other secrets he might hold i wouldn dream of look mr rodriguez jac cut in impatiently looking at his watch hed done nothing but bash his head against a brick wall so far with durrant he was damned if he was going to do the same with rodriguez in fortyone days larry durrant is going to die if anyone in the state of louisiana in fact needed reminding and at that point what his family means to him or in turn him to them is going to have little relevance except in memory so youll perhaps excuse me if i appear not to have much time for your tiptoeing around prison protocol and what might or might not seem right between you and larry durrant rodriguez fired jac a similar sly challenging smile to durrants when hed finally conceded the other day youre good but then his expression quickly sank back into doubt as he weighed up his position look there was somethin that happened recently with larrys son joshua he said finally looking up he bit lightly at his bottom lip as if still uncertain he was doing the right thing but if i say anythin it wasnt from me okay i got nough injuries already without having to put up with a neck brace for a few months jac smiled and nodded his assent and i say that not just because of breakin protocols between myself and larry rodriguez continued but cause of the confidences i should keep as one of the main men in the communication room on both counts i shouldnt be saying anythin about this jac met the concern in rodriguez eyes with a more solemn gaze and nodded again i understand rodriguez shuffled slightly in his seat as if he was still getting comfortable with what he was about to say i dont know whether larry has told you or not but hes had very little contact with his son over the years the first five years in here francine didnt visit so no contact at all then when she did start finally visitin at most once or twice a year she only brought joshua occasionally maybe one in every three visits so eighteen months or two whole years would roll by without him seein his son as a result hes only seen josh a handful of times in all the years hes been in here and when francine did bring him shed make sure to keep the boy in the background say hello to your pa good now you sit back there like a good boy while we talk maybe only a handful of sentences too have therefore passed tween him and the boy rodriguez shook his head its been one of larrys greatest sources of guilt and regret that boy in particular because of the promise he made to francine at the time rodriguez paused as he levelled his gaze at jac when josh was born he promised francine thats it no more robberies then just three months down the line hes in the roche home which lands him in here so you see he feels guilty for havin broken that promise and deserted the boy through all these years in fact he sees most of this in here as punishment fo that retribution and all that bible stuff he got into later on maybe that was some kinda penance asking gods forgiveness not jus for being a bad man and a murderer but for being a bad father and lettin his family down rodriguez took a fresh breath but when larry did have contact with josh id see the change in him that weight o guilt would lift from his shoulders and there was a fresh light in his eyes as if finally he saw some hope hope maybe that with fresh contact he could make good on havin let the boy down and deserted him rodriguez shrugged and gestured with one hand but like i say his meetings with joshua were rare and so the same went for his hopes of makin good until just under a year ago this time rodriguez pause was heavier as if purposely adding significance or waiting for the prompt what happened then jac asked well yer know id been handlin things in the communication room for over eighteen months by then so i was first to see them come through emails from joshua rodriguez paused briefly again to let the information settle with jac the first month there were just two then they increased to once or sometimes twice a week with larry always makin sure to answer em by the next day rodriguez smiled man larry was alive through that period like i never saw him before then suddenly about seven weeks back without warnin they stopped nothin nada rodriguez smile faded just as quickly and larry sank back into his gloomy pit but probably even worse than before because now hed been given a taste o what things could be like with his son only fo it to be yanked away again no more contact and as larry sees it no hope again jac rubbed his forehead as he considered the information he could see now why rodriguez was cautious about sharing it it cut deep to the roots of durrants family and personal psyche any indication as to why the emails might have stopped jac asked no only guesswork larry sent another halfdozen emails askin for a reply or explanation before his pride foolish or otherwise made him give up got to the point where he felt he was beggin rodriguez shrugged maybe his mom or new stepfather cut in stopped him sendin more emails or joshua himself decided to stop feared he was gettin too close specially when his father likely wouldnt be around much longer lot easier to take the loss of someone youre not that close to or his computer has broken down or his aol account has been cancelled in the end were fishin rodriguez grimaced thats why things were planned earlier with the prison break larry didnt rate the chances of candaret givin him clemency and if he got out there he could find out whatd happened with joshua right jac nodded glancing towards the glass screen even with the red light off he felt uneasy at the mention of prison break it wasnt the best thread on which to hang larry durrants life he thought the wants and reasoning of a twelveyearold boy but at this stage he was glad of any small mercies so you think that if there was email contact again from joshua or at least some reasonable explanation that would give him hope of future contact that might make durrant feel differently rodriguez shrugged again only guesswork but its the best chance i can think of to raise larrys spirits maybe make him wanna start livin again asking a twelveyearold boy to go through the emotional trauma of contact with his father while the shadow of execution hung over him and no doubt with his mother and new partner strongly opposed to it for those same reasons it wasnt going to be easy but it looked like the best he was going to get jac pushed a tight smile and nodded thanks for that and for those too he gestured towards the books if we can convince larry durrant that theres still something worth living for they might come in useful in convincing others hes worthwhile keeping alive sokay rodriguez nodded back with a light snort except that down here in the south could be dangerous ground black man daring tfool around with the classics could send him for the chop straightoff for that alone rodriguez smiled slyly and thank god larry never got round to editing the bible if he had and havelin got wind of it hed make sure to switch on the poisonfeed himself early the next morning while sipping at coffee jac took the folded paper from his jacket pocket and spread it out on his dining table hed looked at the printed email and his reply already countless times had unfolded and folded it back more often than he cared think about but perhaps without the noise of the office buzzing around him something might leap out that he hadnt picked up on before i hear youre representing larry durrant i know that he didnt do it it wasnt him i know because i was there at the time dont let him die no name initials or signoff just the email address durransave hotmailcom and the time and date jacs eyes shifted to his reply i need to know more to be able to do anything with this who you are or at least how and why you were there at the time also why havent you come forward before i need to know more to help save larry only four lines but jac worried that already hed said too much frightened the sender off yet what else could he have said he was just telling it how it was on its own the message meant nothing he couldnt help durrant with it unless he had more information but the other reason he was looking at it again now was because of something john langfranc had said the other day with still no reply hed finally told langfranc about the email and theyd brainstormed just who might have sent it friend of durrants relative hoaxer any of the new supporters hed found since hitting the press again recently or capital punishment opponents keen to throw a spanner in the works at the last moment when langfranc arched one eyebrow of course one other possibility we havent thought of the murderer himself that need to confess that criminologists are always talking about not to mention guilt with durrant getting close now to his final day no surely not i mean why would he then suddenly jac stopped himself as he thought about the emails wording i was there at the time if it was just a hoaxer then why not say simply that he knew or could tell them why be so bold and say that he was there at the time those same words leapt out at jac now until everything else on the page evaporated and that was all that seemed to be there i was there at the time for the first ten minutes they skirted around each other keeping the conversation to safe inconsequential ground how long had he been in the states how was he finding it relationships with his mother and aunt but with that he found himself choosing his words carefully he knew that at least from aunt camilles perspective she considered the bromwells to be quite close and he didnt want to be too ungracious but as jennifer bromwell sensed his awkwardness she reached across the table and lightly touched the back of his hand their first physical contact its okay i find her a big snob too sometimes too much to take so dont be afraid to speak your mind and jac in turn found her skewing her lip slightly when he asked about her father he reciprocated by touching her hand back look i dont even know him but if i said he was a snob as well would that make it any easier for you to talk about him they laughed and from there the conversation flowed easily family work life france shed visited twice paris for two days as part of a whirlwind european trip and a holiday of two weeks spent between cannes and monte carlo her work was in the pr and marketing department of a local fashion house theyd gone to le bon temps roule his choice but under her guidance of liveliness and ambience before haute cuisine i go to enough stuffy highclass joints with my parents there was a funky jazz trio playing in the back room where theyd planned to go after eating but all that reached them among the front dining tables was its steady bass beat and the occasional forceful vocals or saxophone burst at one point jennifer paused again more thoughtfully as if despite his efforts to put her at ease something still perturbed her look about my father my mother too to a lesser extent i feel i should say this now before things get too far on because if you found out later youd only be upset jennifer glanced briefly towards the bar before looking back at him directly all of this was my fathers idea with my mom as always meekly backing him up and mainly because of my boyfriend who they dont happen to approve of rock musician you see but just small gigs here and there and as my father likes to put it not heading anywhere fast young lawyer with a blueblood background looks a much better bet she shook her head briefly and reached out and lightly touched jacs hand again but now that im here dont get me wrong im glad i came youre a really sweet guy jac resisted filling the gap with but it would only make her feel more awkward when it was obvious what the answer was there wasnt any sexual spark between them and wasnt going to be he appreciated her boldness in speaking openly and because it took the pressure off him he felt the least he could do was return the gesture same here with me with my aunt camille doing the pushing except in my case it was because i havent had a serious relationship the past few years not since i split up with my girlfriend in france madeleine oh im sorry her hand reaching out and consoling again though jac wasnt sure whether the sorry was for his split from madeleine or because with him not having much of a lovelife these past years he might have expected more from this date now jac shrugged i dont do too badly i get the occasional fresh date now and then he didnt want her to feel awkward for things not heading anywhere between them but he stopped short of mentioning he had one of those fresh dates the night after next like this one she smiled she started picking at the breaded prawn and calamares the waiter had just brought up lawyer and blueblood was the bait used to get me here so what did camille use with you money no point in tiptoeing around it blunt honesty had been the order of the day so far oh that she said it with the disdain that comes only from those whove had big money for a while so used to it that it invokes only boredom and by now sufficiently wellschooled to be wary of the associated problems and baggage that come with it jac went on to explain the tragic chain of events that led to them leaving france his fathers financial collapse illness and eventual death and as a result being forced to live in aunt camilles grace and favour what didnt help also was me choosing to switch from corporate to criminal law otherwise things might have been a bit easier financially and id have got my mother and sister out from under camilles wing by now jennifer sipped thoughtfully at her wine looks like you take after your father in that respect youre not that bothered about money thats exactly what camille says that like him im foolish when it comes to money a dreamer as a result i make bad choices jennifer shook her head i wasnt criticising i meant it actually as a compliment kelvin my boyfriend is exactly the same just follows his dreams and where his nose might lead him doesnt give a damn about money thats what makes him so different so refreshing the problem i always found was that guys either came sniffing around me because of the money put more effort into trying to impress my father than me or they got intimidated by it and were frightened off jac studied her closely for the first time more belinda carlisle than britney spears a touch of red in her blonde hair hinting at depth and fire beneath and jeanmarie had been right he did like her she was far from the spoilt rich brat hed feared though cute was without doubt too lightweight didnt embrace her strong savvy streak jac wondered for a moment that if she didnt have a boyfriend and if he didnt have his thoughts filled with the girl next door since setting the date hed kept running through mental scenarios of how it might go whether anything might have developed between them but they were past that point now and almost two hours later when theyd exchanged more likes and wants and stories about family and work and put half the world to rights she was again reaching that hand across the table this time to set in stone how their relationship would be in the future friends he nodded and smiled yes friends she said that shed like to see him again and he nodded yes id like that too though with the main reason for them continuing to see each other gone he doubted that either of them would keep to it although two consolations jac thought hed had an enjoyable evening when hed feared originally it might be a nightmare and in part it would be like a dryrun for his date the night after next would help ease his nerves but it wasnt and it didnt watching the reaction in francine durrants eyes as jac explained his dilemma with her husband was like viewing one of those oldfashioned joltingframe movies pain regret fear sadness smiles and triumph though the last were rarer fleeting seconds and always tinged with irony as if they had no place amongst such an overriding swamp of regret and sadness the past thirteen years of her life with durrant condensed into a rapid succession of flickerframes mirrored through her eyes the home she shared with her partner was a small woodframed bungalow in a sector of the upper ninth ward close to bywater clinging to middleclassdom by its fingernails with halfderelict project complexes and shotgun houses only three blocks away greenpainted shutters and a mass of terracottapottedplants on its front veranda assisted that clinging though perhaps it was just to brighten its facade and make it more homely since the one photo jac had seen of francine in durrants file taken at their wedding shed aged well maybe shed gone up a dress size from an eight to a ten with a few faint lines now around her eyes and her wavy hair was tinged lighter and redder now stronger contrast against her coffeelightonthecream skin tone but otherwise little change except perhaps that her open smile from then was now far tighter more constrained although possibly that had more to do with his visit and the subject being discussed maybe as soon as he left her old easy smile would return as he got to the part about the emails from their son joshua her mouth became tighter still and she could hardly bear for him to see her reaction any more she looked down and away chewing at her bottom lip when he finally finished she was slow in looking back up at him and who told you all of this larry himself no he was pretty closemouthed and defensive when i started asking about family it came from his close prison buddy roddy rodriguez she smiled crookedly figures he was pretty closemouthed during our marriage too rarely told me what he was up to the darker flickerframes were quickly back again including that night he was at the roche womans house jac reached a hand towards her but fell a few inches short of actual physical contact im sorry mrs durrant i know how difficult this is for you and if there was any other way of doing this without coming here to see you believe me its okay she forced the smile back after a second but it was more laconic and bitter now that was actually one of the biggest sources of argument between us you know larrys reluctance to communicate openly along with the drink the drugs the shooting pool and card nights when i suspected he was with other women and i would start phoning round his friends she shook her head the stone mountain they used to call him when he was boxing not because he was particularly big he was just lightheavyweight or could take a lot of punches but because he never said much never gave away what he was feeling inside she clamped one hand to her breast and maybe thats okay when youre preparing for a boxing match and want to appear like a lump of stone immovable to your opponent but let me tell you mr mcelroy its pretty hard to take day in day out in a marriage i know i understand jac said although he had little idea he was keen to get her back on track not just because the more maudlin she became wallowing in her husbands failings the harder it might be to gain her cooperation but because of time twentyfive thirty minutes before her partner came home shed said unless he could keep her away from memory lane hed never get what he wanted in time he took a fresh breath it isnt my intention to get young joshua into trouble here but did you know about the emails he was sending to his father in prison she cast her eyes down for a second as if weighing up the implications of her answer yes yes i did or rather my partner did he was first to discover them on the computer and told me and was it you that stopped joshua sending more emails or did he decide to stop of his own accord she forced a pained smile more of a mutual decision really between me my partner frank and joshua i see jac could just imagine what say joshua had on the issue with the combined weight of his mother and stepfather ganged up against him i know what youre thinking francine said catching his look and at times theres been issues between frank and joshua particularly where larry was thought to have had an influence but this is one occasion where i was right behind frank we might try at times to treat josh like the little man of the house but hes still only twelve mr mcelroy she met his eyes challengingly for a moment before looking down emails back and forth back and forth right up until until her voice cracked slightly and she bit at her lip as she looked up again how long is it now that my larry has left thirtysix thirtyseven days just enough time for josh to get close again to his father huh real close close enough for him to really feel and know just whats happening to him can you imagine how thats going to crush the boy the first time hes really got close to his father and the next minute francine snapped her fingers hes gone is that what you want mr mcelroy no no jac shook his head thats what were trying to avoid thats the whole point of this clemency plea now to hopefully get the governor to commute the sentence and what if you dont succeed mr mcelroy and we let young josh get sucked into this in the hope of keeping his father alive only for it to fail and job well done he gets close enough to give his father real hope to want to live again that closeness and hope thats all going to get to the boy too francine grimaced tautly make him do this and the loss of his father is going to hit him like a freight train its going to hit the boy hard anyway mrs durrant she snorted yeah but its going to be ten times harder if we get josh close and build up his hopes that his father might actually live when jac had phoned francine durrant earlier shed initially refused to see him saying that she had a new man and new life now and that old life always drags us back makes our new life more difficult to get on with even more so from my new partners point of view he wont stand for it for a minute hed had to push hard to get the meeting tell her about her husbands deathwish and its apparent link to lack of contact with joshua so while i understand your resentment if it goes as far as actually wanting to see larry die then fine dont see me hearing francine durrants heavy sigh her conscience wrestling with the demons that had no doubt already ripped her apart during these past eleven years jac had felt guilty using the sledgehammer approach but now he realized it might take more of the same to finally shift her stance i take your point mrs durrant its not ideal to have josh get close at this juncture but then probably anything he does at this stage is going to be far from ideal if he cuts himself off from his father and has little contact do you think hes going to feel any better jacs eyes searched hers for a moment before she looked down possible concession probably not in fact he might even feel worse knowing that he purposely kept his distance and had no contact in those vital final weeks of his fathers life i appreciate that too francine closed her eyes for a second but the way we looked at it that option was the lesser of two evils the lesser of two evils jac repeated with a questioning tone is that what its come down to now between your son and his father and what if your son finds out at some later stage that his lack of contact in those final weeks was the main reason his father didnt want a clemency plea made on his behalf francine closed her eyes for a moment again chewing at her lip he wont find out hell never know when she opened her eyes again she kept them slightly averted she didnt want jac to see what lay there hell never know jacs repetition had now become faintly mocking theres going to be a fair bit of media coverage of this maybe even some books too its pretty rare that a prisoner doesnt want clemency put in on his behalf in fact wants to die gary gilmore was the last if i remember right that generated countless articles and books people were still debating it years later and one of the key questions raised is always why they wanted to die you think all of thats going to happen without your son ever finding out itll only be the first year or so i can keep it hidden from him for that time francine fought for conviction to mask the desperation of the comment she took a fresh breath besides as you say and i also know from bitter past experience larry is always so closemouthed no way is he going to admit that his wanting to die is down to his son not making contact hes going to say just what he told you that hes simply sick of facing more time in prison and this is his going to god his ascension day give her credit she was standing her ground well jac nodded and held a palm out that as may be but theres always people like roddy rodriguez keen to speak out jac knew that he was on more uncertain ground here it had been hard to prise from rodriguez the family backdrop to durrants deathwish it was unlikely hed speak so openly to journalists and even if that wasnt the case youd always know something that might prey on your mind every time you look at joshua but as francine looked at him directly and jac saw the fiery spark there he knew that hed stepped too far dont you dare lay that on me ive done nothing but think of larry practically every time ive looked at the boy these past eleven years so another ten or twenty isnt going to make much difference and its not just that his fathers been locked away practically since he was born that im reminded of when i look at joshua all those taunts and jibes at school hes had to shoulder through the long years you know what im reminded of most when i look at him jac shook his head and quietly mouthed no his voice suddenly choked of any strength what im reminded of most is the promise that larry made when joshua was born that he wouldnt cross his heart and hope to die do any more robberies he couldnt face doing time again and spending even a minute away from the boy especially now we were both depending on him so heavily and just three months later hes in the roche house and who knows maybe even other robberies in between maybe he never stopped did you happen to know that too mr mcelroy about the solemn promise larry made to his family yes yes i did jac looked down slightly as if he was somehow ashamed of sharing that knowledge and did larry himself tell you about that no it was rodriguez again some of the fire eased and the sly smile was back at least hes consistent the stone mountain remains closemouthed till the end he might have found god but hes certainly not found his tongue i know how you must feel mrs durrant and youve got every right to feel angry for what he did and the consequences that you and joshua have had to endure jac felt immediately at a loss for just how to fight back all he could think of was placating so that at least she was more receptive when he finally found the right words he glanced quickly at his watch only six or eight minutes before her partner was due back but the thing is i jac broke off as she looked sharply over her shoulder and he too picked up on a faint shuffling in the hallway in that instant shed packed joshua off to his room when jac first arrived with the strict instruction not to disturb them either the boy had come out of his room or her partner was home early joshua is that you there she called out they heard more shuffling that sounded as if someone was moving further away along the hallway then yes i was just getting a drink from the kitchen okay well you head back to your room now leave us private like i said she waited patiently until she heard his footsteps fully recede and his bedroom door click shut again but as she looked back at jac her face was slightly flushed and he could imagine what she was thinking how long had the boy been close by in the hallway and had he overheard any of their conversation the momentary break had allowed jacs thoughts to gel as he recalled rodriguez words in fact he sees most of this in here as punishment for having broken that solemn promise retribution and all that bible stuff he got into later on jac shook his head as i was about to comment mrs durrant i find it ironic that you should mention that promise because thats one of the main reasons rodriguez puts forward for larry wanting to die guilt over having let you and josh down oh i see she let the words out on a heavy breath jac could see that shed taken the information badly one of the main arguments behind her not helping now completely turned around as a cry for help her husband wanting to die because of guilt over the promise hed made to her and joshua and now she was ensuring he succeeded in that by cutting off further contact with his son rodriguez said that when the emails started coming through from joshua he saw the change in your husband some hope and light in him that just hadnt been there before rodriguez again francine nodded but now the comment had lost any of its bite and was more of a knowing confirmation than a question yes hope and light that maybe with that contact your husband would be able to face the years ahead and not just because it felt good to have continuing contact with the boy and gave him some future purpose but because larry saw the emails as some sort of proof that his son had forgiven him for breaking his promise and letting him down deserting him through all those years francine visibly shuddered as she put one hand up to her mouth and closed her eyes for a second jac noticed as she opened them again the tears welling and she held the same hand out as if to shield them as she shook her head please mr mcelroy dont say any more believe me ive got the picture she wiped at her eyes with the back of one hand and if i could help i would but im afraid mr mcelroy franks a good man and i dont want to lose him over this jac held one hand out but surely if you explained to him the situation as difficult as it might be in the end hed understand she shrugged maybe he would maybe he wouldnt worst thing is id probably never know not that is until he just upped one morning and left said that he couldnt cope with me and josh any more because thats what happened with my last partner she shook her head wearily and i just cant afford to have that happen again now with frank i see maybe you do maybe you dont she shrugged again and smiled tightly do you know what i earn mr mcelroy what jac was caught offguard bemused as to what that had to do with anything barely thirty bucks a day at the shoe shop where i work mainly because i leave at four most days to collect josh from school and i only got that job because the shops owner was friend of a friend lucky to get the job with such kindly hours i was told at the time and dont i know it or if i ever get close to forgetting when things arent going so smoothly ill get reminded of it by the manager well apart from the fact that franks a good man and been good to me and josh without him we just couldnt manage on my wage and it seems at times as if im just hanging on to that job by the skin of my teeth taken on is the expression oft used lucky to get taken on francine shook her head and fixed her eyes levelly on jac and its pretty much the same expression used when a man takes on a woman of my age with a child in tow particularly one still married to the father of that child let alone that he might be on death row for murder i see i understand and for the first time since arriving as much as it went directly against what he was there for he did see and understand im sorry mr mcelroy but you can see the dilemma im facing if i went against frank over this and got young josh to her voice trailed off as with a jolt she looked towards the clock on the far wall the mention of frank reminded her that shed got more carried away with explaining than shed realized frank was due back at any minute i i think well have to leave things there mr mcelroy he fired a tight but understanding smile as he got to his feet then handed her his card as they walked towards the front door if you should happen to have a change of heart please call me please jac clasped her hand gently and felt it shaking slightly but she hardly looked at the card in her hand or at him her eyes were busy darting between the front door and a side window which gave a partial view towards the road they said a hasty goodbye and jac gave a small wave just before he got into his car towards francine durrant who was still looking through a sixinch gap in the front door she was obviously anxious for jac to be clear of the house before frank got there so that she didnt have to explain anything but at least jac now had a better understanding of her fears as pitiful as it might be she was simply clinging to the remnants of life left after her husbands long years in prison a badly paid job and what she saw as her last chance at a relationship when he was a block away from francine durrants house he checked his cellphone and saw that haveling had called but hadnt left a message good news or bad marmonts condition improved or marmont dead haveling rejecting or accepting durrants account jac pulled over to the side of the road and eased out a slow tired breath as he dialled havelings number but it hardly mattered any more he reminded himself if he couldnt shift francine durrants stance the whole case was dead anyway nelm had spent the last few hours watching an apartment hed seen jac mcelroy head into the building at pm but it was almost two hours before he saw mcelroy leave again with a girl that was strange nelm hadnt seen the girl go into the building and from the information hed so far gained mcelroy was meant to be single wasnt shackedup with anyone well hed soon know what the score was they looked dressed for the night out but still nelm left it ten minutes before going into the building in case they forgot something they needed to go back for straightforward bar and tumbler lock nelm had it opened with a pick and credit card in just fifty seconds he went round the whole apartment first to get his bearings before starting to go through drawers and wardrobes he paused in thought as he finished then gave all the side tables and shelves one last scan not a single bra panty or stocking in any of the drawers and no makeup or womens perfume to be found anywhere so for sure she wasnt living here with mcelroy maybe she had sneaked in the building without him noticing nelm shook his head this one was a twentyfour carat babe hed have spotted her in a crowd at a hundred paces even if he was halfcomatose strange too that there wasnt a single photo of her anywhere either she was a very recent event or mcelroy wasnt that serious about her nelm sat back in a nearby armchair and eased out a long breath there was something else niggling at the back of his mind about the girl but he just couldnt put his finger on it he glanced at his watch timing for when theyd probably be back much of the conversation from jacs side was the same as two nights ago with jennifer bromwell but practically everything else was different theyd gone to a more formal restaurant begues and the waiter was overattentive kept asking if everything was to monsieur and madames liking or there was anything else that they desired yes monsieur would like to be left alone without interruption for ten minutes so that at least he is given a chance of impressing the girl of his dreams dreams that was half the problem right there in the same way that jennifer bromwell complained of boyfriends being intimidated by her fathers money he found himself intimidated by alaysha reyners beauty his mouth felt constantly dry and he kept sipping repeatedly at his water and he could tell from her facial expressions that he wasnt hitting the right notes maybe because it had been so long since madeleine and he was coming across as too anxious overeager or because part of his thoughts were still tied up with durrant haveling had phoned to say that marmont was off the critical list one bit of positive news at least but hed found himself dwelling more and more on his meeting with francine durrant something perhaps hed missed some way of convincing her to get joshua to make contact again with his father or if there was to be no more contact any other way of shifting larrys stance the thoughts spun through jacs mind as he took his shower the water running for so long that he shook off a shiver along with his unresolved thoughts as he finally got out and the same thoughts were plaguing him again now as he focused back on alaysha reyner across the candlelit table and forced his best smile thered even been as with jennifer bromwell two nights back a confession from alaysha when she thought the moment was right i wanted to put this on the table straight away because a lot of guys dont handle it too well including my ex she grimaced wryly glancing to the side to make sure their overattentive waiter wasnt within earshot and so i think its only fair that you should know straightoff i work as a lapdancer oh i see but even that part hed got wrong hed kept his reaction bland so as not to give away that he already suspected i just dont like other guys looking at you like that but from her eyes searching his he could tell that shed expected something more and it had probably come across that he was shocked or offended and had opted for a bland reaction to mask it its mainly to keep my little girl molly shes only four now her father and i were never married and besides he headed for the hills within six months of her birth and not a penny in maintenance since so its just been down to me ive been interested in interior decor for a while just bits here and there for friends but i decided in the end to take a course and that meant extra money so i thought ive got maybe four or five good years left in me before as she fought to explain he felt he had to stop her he reached a hand across the table really you dont need to justify it to me im not shocked or put out by it all those years in france most of the girls wore the same as the average lap dancer on the beaches every day id have to be a real hypocrite to be shocked by that he smiled coyly and shook his head but i didnt want to smile and be too positive about it otherwise you might think im a real lech her return smile rose uncertainly as she squeezed his hand back thanks i appreciate it a couple of favour points gained perhaps if lucky he was scoring four out of ten now maybe the thought hit him he could tell larry he knew about the emails from joshua say that he was sure theyd start again later convince larry to hang on but then that would also mean giving away that hed heard it from rodriguez when hed promised rodriguez that he wouldnt betray that confidence something bothering you jac brought his attention sharply back sorry problems with a case im handling one of those impossible catchs you get hit with every now and then oh jac hadnt intended to say anything originally but now it seemed odd holding back and at least it removed the spectre that what was troubling him might have been due to her he kept durrants name out of it in deference to client confidentiality it was all just this prisoner throughout as you can see a pretty bitter history on both sides him and his wife and ironically much of it revolving around his son and those same broken promises that are weighing him down so alayshas face clouded briefly she ran one fingertip halfway round the rim of her wine glass so if there was contact again from his son you think that might change his stance solve the problem yeah high chances but it doesnt look like theres any way of that happening she gave a pained understanding smile but then as she fell silent and thoughtful the noise of the restaurant around crashing in for a moment jac feared hed said too much spoilt whatever remaining chances he had by burdening her with his work problems though as she started to open up with some of her own problems he realized that shed just been thinking about what or what not to share or whether to say anything at all and as for the first time the tension between them eased he knew that it had been the right thing to do for the first hour or so theyd just been politely fencing with each other now they were getting to the core of what shaped and drove them as alaysha reyner talked the stark differences to jennifer bromwells life became apparent where jennifer had been financially cosseted alayshas background had been one of dire poverty the family arriving from port of spain when she was only seven and her father got a job with a local new orleans trawling fleet things eased financially for a while but when her mother felt she couldnt take any more of her husbands erratic behaviour and periodic beatings they parted and alayshas father quickly disappeared to avoid maintenance payments they were on their own and in dire straits again with a vengeance and that had practically been the pattern since alaysha had gone out to work rather than go on to university mainly so that she could earn to provide for her mother and younger brother but at least unlike jennifer bromwell there hadnt been any parental interference in her lovelife shed been able to make her own bad choices without any help from them after mollys father had headed for the hills when molly was only six months old thered been a couple of brief disastrous relationships but gerry now an assistant bar manager at the golden bay casino in biloxi had been her first serious boyfriend since then things had been okay for the first year or so but then hed become increasingly paranoid about her work he hasnt hit me yet just a lot of pushing and shoving but give him time i know he would and im not waiting around for that to happen she played thoughtfully again with the rim of her wine glass seems to me like im continuing my mothers cycle hopelessly drawn to guys who either cant put bread on the table or are handy with their fists or both words would have been wrong at that moment empty promises which probably alaysha reyner had heard far too many of in her life so jac just reached out and gently squeezed her hand in reassurance to their side an arched window looked onto a resplendent tropical courtyard new orleans finest milling through it to the luxury hotel beyond sharp contrast to the life alaysha had just described though with part of what shed said bread on the table jac had felt a stab of conscience given that same choice career or family unlike him it appeared shed put family first every time youre obviously very close to your mom jac tightly smiled his understanding do you take after her a little i suppose but i probably look more like my father as much as i might not feel comfortable with that she glanced down fleetingly before looking at jac more directly i think that was part of the problem right there he knew he was goodlooking so thought that gave him the right to push women around treat them bad felt that theyd always come running back for more she sniggered uncomfortably and in a way he was right at least where my mom was concerned shes far better off without him by the sound of it as tough as it might have been jac touched her hand again hoping hed read it right after all shed had to sacrifice there too her mothers happiness put before her losing her father while she was young you both are suppose so alaysha smiled and shrugged as if freeing the weight momentarily hanging there though the other weight hanging over her would be more difficult to shift she reflected wondering whether shed ever know him well enough to tell him that and looking across at jac she realized in that moment what had attracted her about those bluegrey eyes when theyd first met the sadness and loss in them made him look soft vulnerable understanding most vitally given her and her mothers history with men he didnt look like a man who would ever hit her lets just hope that i dont take after him in temperament if you do ill remember to wear my body protector next time alayshas smile widened and she lifted her glass to clink with jacs raised glass more points scored enough as the evening wound to a close and she kissed him lightly on the cheek by his apartment door for her to want to see him again do you like creole food she asked to which he nodded put it this way since being in new orleans ive developed more of a taste for it its been either that or starve she chuckled lightly okay maybe i can invite you round for some home cooking later in the week jac squeezed her hand in thanks and returned the kiss both cheeks this time french style i look forward to it enough for another dinner date though not enough to be able to share her bed that night though when forty minutes later she phoned and asked are you still up he thought for one hopeful moment she might have had a change of heart yes yes i am not in bed quite yet because that problem you mentioned earlier i thought of how you might be able to get around it if youre interested the second jac picked up his phone the tape activated and the soundman vic farrelia leant closer as he listened nelm had left the apartment almost two hours before mcelroy returned having finished his search and planted the bug and within half an hour he had farrelia set up in a small room on perdido street six blocks away and when just after midnight farrelia phoned and related the first call to come over the line nelm nodded thoughtfully from this moment on jac mcelroys life was never going to be the same again the first time that adelay roche called clive beaton got his secretary to lie and say that he was tied up until late morning so that he could prepare himself before returning the call there were so many worrying nogo paths the conversation could take that he began to doubt the wisdom of talking to roche at all but his mounting curiosity finally won the day roche quickly sought to quell beatons worries i know youre probably thinking that we shouldnt be speaking given the delicacy of things at this juncture but you know weve been skirting around each other for eleven years for the very same reason and now that everything is finally drawing to a close i felt i should make contact roche drew a fresh breath in particular because what im calling about has nothing to do with the durrant case beaton felt a weight ease from his chest as roche explained how hed been watching for the past couple of years the activities of one of the firms associates ralph miers an expert in tax law seems to me hes one of the few guys in the state to also wear a strong hat on environmental issues i saw what he did for gulfwest petroleum and let me tell you i was impressed beaton was happy just listening it meant that he didnt have to defend any of the nogo conversation areas hed run through as roche went on to explain that miers looked like just the man he needed ive been stalling on changes to my refinery at houma for nigh on four years now but if i can please the greens and environmentalists and at the same time get the right tax breaks for making the plant environmentally friendly im all for it roche chuckled which quickly became a heavy wheeze that is assuming im correct in my judgement that your man miers is right for the job and can get the government to pay indirectly for every penny of those changes and hopefully more im sure he is beaton said with a spark of conviction to hopefully lift it beyond stock response as his thoughts automatically turned to the potential value of such an account so i thought i should touch base now that the curtain is about to finally come down on the durrant episode and im glad you did i really appreciate it beaton measured his words carefully warmth and sincerity to hopefully lure roche into the fold but due deference and legal correctness for the firms current client durrant but it would probably be incorrect of us perhaps even tempting fate to second guess just what governor candaret might do with durrants plea for clemency roche chuckled again i might have agreed with you if it wasnt for the stunt that durrant just pulled with his attempted prison break his wha beaton stopped himself sharply stock reaction had for a second overridden one of the prime legal commandments never give away that you dont know everything about your client you mean you didnt know roche pressed of course i knew beaton recovered quickly beating back the resurging tide of his nerves and apprehension he should have realized that roche wouldnt have called without a sting in the tail its just that i was caught off guard as to how you knew especially since were still in the midst of how to handle the situation i see roche had to admit beaton was good his thirtyfive years of keenedged law practice shining through but the splitsecond falter had been enough to tell roche that beaton hadnt known for whatever reason his rookie lawyer had decided to keep durrants attempted breakout under wraps he could all but feel the seething anger in beatons undertone he couldnt wait to get off the line and get his hands around mcelroys neck well lets speak again when you feel the dust has settled enough on the durrant case for it to be right for us to do so jac had just returned with a cup of water from the watercooler when he saw the fresh email on his computer and as he clicked and saw who it was from durransavehotmail he jolted sharply almost spilling it after six days with no reply hed all but given up on another email from his mystery sender his hands shook on the keyboard as he opened it sent at one minute forty seconds ago would they still be sitting there to do something else or have left immediately jac clicked on the trackback software its screen overlapping the email so that he couldnt read it jacs fingers tapped anxiously on his desk as it traced and started displaying then he doubleclicked itnumber find and forty seconds later it popped up on screen internetional on peniston street an internet cafe he or she was moving around jacs heart was beating doubletime his finger tapping almost in time with it as he called and waited to get routed through please still be there please jac became aware of langfranc looking at him through his office glassscreen langfrancs expression weighted with concern as he spoke on his own phone jac yanked his attention back as a girl answered internetional may i help you jac introduced himself and explained what he wanted computer number fourteen message sent just over three minutes ago are they still there jac held his breath in anticipation im not sure one minute her voice trailed off and jac heard her speaking with a colleague jac looked again towards langfranc but this time langfranc looked slightly away as jac met his eye as if he felt suddenly awkward or embarrassed jac closed the trackback screen so that he could see all of the email the girls voice returned yeah computer number fourteen looks like hes still there jac leapt up okay okay he hooked his jacket from the back of his chair im heading down to you right now should be with you in no more than ten or twelve the email was now displaying random phrases leaping out at him id have incriminated myself know what i saw larry durrant didnt kill jessica roche langfranc seeing jac about to leave in a rush suddenly seemed equally panicked ending his call abruptly and swinging his door open as jac was only two paces away from his desk jac jac that was beaton just then going on about something youve held back from him about the durrant case he wants to see you in his office right now i cant i cant deal with this now jac took a step further away eyes shifting frantically somethings broken on the durrant case that just wont wait ive got to sort it out now beaton sounded pissed as hell youre taking your life in your hands fobbing him off like this jac langfrancs face flushed as he forced a tightlipped grimace but okay its your neck how long thirty forty minutes hour tops jac took another couple of steps away all that filled his mind at that second an image of durrants mystery emailer leaving his internet cafe computer okay ill tell him but your story had better be good when you get back jac otherwise its probably kissyourassgoodbyetime here ive hardly ever heard beaton that angry jacs stomach dipped at the possibility he returned langfrancs grimace and held one hand up thanks hold my job for me till i get back if you can and sprinted out a silent prayer on his breath that hed make it in time jac ran to the corner of thalia and chestnut street so that he had the benefit of cabs from both directions and hailed one in less than a minute he said that he was late for a meeting and the driver seeing in his mirror the anxiety on jacs face and the sweat on his brow put his foot down might be able shave off a minute or so if were lucky the airrush through the halfopen taxi window buffeted jacs face as they picked up speed along magazine street older twostorey antebellum buildings with quaint railedterraces giving way to taller newer flatfronted shops and offices the transition from old to new as new orleans became less colonialfrench and more like any other american city internetional on peniston you say the taxi driver confirmed over one shoulder yeah though as he said it jac was suddenly hit with something he should have covered while hed been on the phone to them before jac took out his cellphone and punched in internetionals number but as he pressed to dial another voice was suddenly there crashing in his heart leapt for a second fearful that it was beaton deciding to give him a roasting over the phone or fire him but it was morvaun jaspar the forger hed got cleared a couple of months back jac got a problem big problem i cant do this now morvaun ive got someone ive got to call right now urgently this too jac this too the local blues have just pulled me in and its bullshit absolute bullshit theyre tryin to nail me for everyone they find with a forged document or looks like one and no doubt all cause we pulled the rug out from em last time its a complete sham shakedown and i aint about to morvaun i cant handle this now jac could imagine his mystery emailer getting up from his seat and leaving as they spoke and if he didnt get back to the people at internetional before that happened he might not even get a description i really have got someone ive got to call right now lets talk again later i cant call back later jac this is my one allowed call you gotta get down here otherwise im here for the duration okay okay where are you now fifth district stationhouse ill get there as soon as i can about jac cradled his forehead as he remembered that he was meant to be back sharp to see beaton but he couldnt just leave morvaun hanging for what might be almost two hours hed have to get langfranc to tell beaton that his outofoffice meeting got more involved was going to take longer jac sighed heavily about forty minutes or so your office is only fifteen minutes from here jac cant you im halfway across town right now morvaun trying to sort something else out but i promise ill get there as soon as hold on yeah okay hear you loud n clear jac not much else fme to do instantly morvaun rang off jac redialled internetional jac mcelroy again i called a couple of minutes back is he still there computer number fourteen jacs breath froze in his throat in the twosecond wait for the girl to look and answer yeah i can still see him okay okay jac exhaled heavily can you try and get a good look at him i i cant see him that well from here hes turned away from me looking at his computer right whats your name by the way personalize to get closer jac thought uuuh tracy hesitant as if worried what he might do with the information okay tracy i dont know how easy it is because im not there but if you could shift more to a sideview without that is being too obvious making him suspicious just in case he leaves before i get down there myself to see him jac looked up as they crossed washington avenue only a dozen or so blocks now to peniston four or five minutes at most hold on hold on oh okay but tracy still sounded uncertain and if he does start to leave before i get there maybe try and hold him up a bit if you can keep him there only the sound of tracys breath falling for a second that might be more difficult i know i know but maybe tell him that theres a free coffee today for customers ill cover for it when i get there i i suppose i could oh oh hearing her sudden intake of breath jac asked sharply what is it he hes looking round starting to get up jac felt his stomach tighten but then hed suspected all along that he wouldnt hang around long his voice lowered a conspiratorial hush okay tracy try what i suggested ill try ill do my jac could hear her breath falling shorter sharper as she broke off for a second then a faint tremor in her undertone or perhaps it was just jac picking up on it because he knew she was nervous sir theres a free coffee for customers today i forgot to tell you about earlier aline street flashed by only four blocks to go now at internetional the man africanamerican latethirties in a maroon hilfiger jacket paused for a second looked tempted but some noise from the street outside reached him then strains of a brass band playing a block or so away and he glanced distractedly over his shoulder for a second and as he turned back tracy saw something shift in his eyes flicking between her and the phone picked up a bad vibe or just acknowledgment that he was interrupting her thanks for the offer he pushed a terse smile but i gotta rush someone to see tracy watched helplessly as he scurried out though maybe like he said he was in a rush she let out a long sigh as she brought the receiver back im sorry tried my best but hes gone i know i know jac had heard it all his end closing his eyes as the sinking in his stomach spread made every part of him feel empty cruelly cheated though as he opened them again and saw the next cross street flash by a spark of hope resurged but you got a good look at him yeah sure did tracys tone brightened one thing to have gone right only two blocks away now if jac got a good description maybe hed still be able to pick him out as they turned into the street but at that moment the taxi slowed then braked sharply jac looked ahead four cars backed up at the next intersection as a procession of sixty or seventy people some with banners marched and sashayed by in rhythm to a small brass band leading jac exhaled heavily feeling his stomach dip again he wouldnt make it now thats okay he said resignedly ill be there in just a couple of minutes give me all the details then mr mysteryemailer would be long gone by the time he got there and if hed now been spooked that would probably be the end of any more contact jac looked up towards the procession as it finally passed and the taxi crossed the junction in his few years in new orleans hed discovered that bands were broken out for anything and everything weddings funerals gay marches dogs birthday though from the banners this looked like a save some bay or other environmental protest jac suddenly became aware of a man in the crowd looking back at him smiling and waving probably just somebody random catching jacs eye as hed looked towards them but in that moment it became jacs mystery emailer teasing taunting you wont find me you wont find me black guy broad bit of bulk on but not fat and height fiveten maybe six foot age mid to late thirties maybe forty anything that stood out beard moustache prominent scar or birthmark no clean shaven but oh he had this gap between his front teeth when he smiled and what he was he wearing hilfiger jacket sort of darkred and jeans and a baseball cap darkblue or black jac paused at that point looking back at his notes for anything he might have missed at the outset hed ascertained from tracy an earlytwenties shortcroppedblondewithalimegreenstripe and more nose rings than a krishna that it had been paid cash as hed suspected no trace back now the description wasnt giving him that much either could fit twenty to thirty percent of africanamerican males in that age band but as jac puckered his mouth tracy commented but hey you can check all that for yourself she eased a sly smile as she looked up above the entrance we should have him on video jac followed her eyes towards the camera there and uncertainly as if taking a second to believe his luck mirrored her smile the atmosphere in the interview room was laden tense morvaun jaspar looked tired worndown by the questioning and psychological games the two policeman had rained down on him over the two hours hed been held pretty much the same mutt and jeff black and white game as before jac knew the black officer jim holbrook from last time the supposedly friendly voice in morvauns ear hey come on bro make it easy on yourself but the white lieutenant pyrford jac hadnt seen before rakish with heavily receding redbrown hair a toothpick that he seemed reluctant to take out the corner of his mouth and a look of disdain down his nose at morvaun that spoke volumes jac could imagine that ten years ago hed have been addressing morvaun and probably his partner too as boy jac had no doubt looked troubled and on edge as soon as he walked into the interview room which had set the mood for what followed hed watched only a few seconds of the video with tracy just to make sure maroonhilfigerjacket was there and it was the right segment then had taken a copy to look at in more detail later no time right then hed phoned langfranc on his way over to morvaun to tell him hed be delayed langfranc warning that it could be one delay too many the one that might just tip the balance on beaton preparing your dismissal letter but jac had become equally concerned about something else asking langfranc if there was any indication as to just what he was meant to have held back on no no clue at all or perhaps where beaton might have got his information from no clue there either im afraid jac all i know is hes madder than hell and says he wants it all straight from the hip from you right now in his office what had suddenly hit jac started to panic him was that he had no idea just which of his withheld secrets beaton knew about the alleged prisonbreak attempt or durrants deathwish he was facing a firestorm back at the office with beaton but with no idea from which direction the fire was coming and if he picked the wrong one beaton would then know about both full house morvaun had acknowledged him with a numb smile as he walked in he was wearing a bright crimson jacket with a silvery wave trim on each cuff quite conservative by his standards morvaun liked to think of himself as a tough cookie but he was no longer young and beneath the veneer of bluff and bravado hed built up over the years jac could clearly see as he had done halfway through their first case together his fear and frailty fear that if he got anything more than a four or fiveyear term he might not make it through i hope you two had the good sense not to ask my client any more questions after he informed you he had counsel on his way jac said as he put down his briefcase stamp his authority on the meeting early of course goes without saying pyrford said with a dry smile jiggling the toothpick in the corner of his mouth we just kept it conversational after that mild weather for the time of year and what a fine head of hair he still has for a man of his age holbrook looked down at the floor and jac swore he could almost hear a groan riding on his sigh never let it be said that youd indulge in pointless questions or comments jac said peering sharply at pyrfords shiny wisphaired crown lets get to the bottom line shall we jac continued curtly is my client being charged and if so whats the evidence against him not yet pyrford was put off stride by the directness flushing slightly he injected more authority into his voice but we got a women in custody alvira jardine a haitian national with forged papers passport and drivers licence and theyve got your clients trademark all over them has ms jardine named mr jaspar as having forged them for her no she hasnt though we pyrford fought to regain his step the control hed had over the meeting only minutes ago but jac rolled straight on and apart from my clients trademark what other evidence is there that might link him to this jacs tone was acid and impatient he had no intention of making it easy on them one look at morvaun told him how much hed been railroaded over the past two hours well we increasingly flustered pyrford looked back towards holbrook for support but holbrook did a wideeyed dont include me on where you might be heading weve done our own comparisons with mr jaspars past work and from that alone had more than good reason to bring him in now but im not at liberty to discuss that or the other evidence we have until weve got the full analysis back from the lab im confident though that will back up our findings to date and then believe me your clients really going to feel our breath down his neck not to put too fine a point on it jac said cuttingly wouldnt that have been the best time to haul my client in when youve got your lab conclusions rather than bringing him in on this fine afternoon just to comment on what a good head of hair he has for a man of his age he smiled wanly pyrfords jaw tightened he glared at jac for a second before answering dont worry hell be the first to know when couple of days tops fine jac picked up his briefcase and nodded to morvaun look forward to it me too counsellor pyrford said his stare icy me too thanks jac morvaun said as they headed down the corridor he gave a lopsided smile but less of the two whiteboys egoposturing next time if you could if things turn sour its my po black ass they take it out on ill try jac said returning the smile they went through the stationhouse doors and out onto the street but if theres no connection with you on this one morvaun stop worrying theyre not going to be able to pin it on you ill make sure of that the confident tone of a lawyer who having cleared his client for a crime he did commit thought one he didnt should be a walkover like i said jac im clean on this one never even heard o mrs jardine before theyre just tryin for a fix most likely cause they couldnt nail me last time and they wont this time either jac smiled tightly and laid one hand reassuringly on morvauns shoulder as they parted dont worry watching morvaun jaspar head off along north claiborne avenue shoulders slightly sunken jac wondered whether it was simply the gait of an old man worn down by the two hours of questioning or if there was something morvaun wasnt telling him though as jac turned and looked out for a cab he probably appeared little different the spark of fresh hope from the video in his briefcase not enough to lift his spirits from the nightmare showdown he was facing back at the office with beaton i thought i should let you know i read what happened to raoul ferrer yeah you and half of new orleans that read beyond the first page of the local rags nelm said with a huffed breath and your point is it had taken truelle three full days to work up the courage to make the call hed turned over which path the conversation might take so many times in his mind that his concentration had started lapsing during sessions at work and hed had to ask patients to repeat themselves he thought hed better make the call before it drove him and his patients mad or madder to be more precise with both of them or ditch the idea completely the final bit of dutch courage was provided by an extracurricular visit to bens bar but he was still uncertain about the wisdom of making the call after the first shot his hands still shaking he ordered another but then eyed it hesitantly hed need all his wits about him tangling words with nelm he could feel the warmth of the drink in his hand drawing him in maybe he should just knock it back and forget the idea of making the call stay here in the warm cocoon of the bar and order another and another and he slammed the drink back down on the table and pushed it at arms length as if it were poison getting quickly to his feet and heading out before his resolve went completely he made the call to nelm when he was a block away from the bar but now with just a few testy words from nelm his nerves were back with a vengeance his hand shaking on his cellphone he wished now that he had downed that second shot my my point is the timing you visit me one day to make sure im okay with everything going down now with durrant then the next day raoul ferrer is dead coincidence in ferrers line of work hes just one step away from a bullet every day in fact annoying little snakeeyed creep that he is or was im amazed he lasted so long are you trying to tell me that you didnt kill raoul ferrer im not trying to tell you anything its you thats made the call doctor but if youre any good at analyzing what your patients say you might have gathered from my last comment about ferrer catching a bullet from anywhere that yes thats exactly what im getting at nelms tone was teasing taunting truelle purposely kept his tone flat matteroffact didnt want to give nelm the satisfaction of knowing that hed risen to the bait you can say it whichever way you like that doesnt mean i have to believe it oh is that what youre saying to your patients these days you can tell me youre batman as many ways as you like but that doesnt mean i have to believe it i thought you guys had more subtle ways of putting things like as much as you might have liked to take such an action yourself the actual taking of it is too shocking and burdensome for your conscious mind to cope with so your subconscious then develops various alternative scenarios truelle bit at his lip nelm was playing with him he should never have made the call should have known that he wouldnt get a straight answer but he just couldnt resist the snipe back yes youre right we do have more subtle ways of putting things i just dumbed it down especially for you ooohh my my we are feeling frisky today nelms voice suddenly dropped becoming more menacing but then if you truly believe that i did waste ferrer maybe thats not the wisest thing to be saying to me aint that the truth truelle said it flatly it was probably the only bit of truth to pass between them in the past couple of minutes and he still had strong doubts that the call in itself was the wisest move he took a fresh breath lets cut to the chase and the main reason for my call now if you were responsible for ferrer and if you and roche have got it into your minds to do the same with me then think again i took the precaution way back of preparing a couple of insurance policies everything surrounding us and the durrant affair chapter and verse all in sealed envelopes only to be opened in the event of my death truelle paused to let the revelation sink home so you see you and roche have a great vested interest in keeping me alive in fact those envelopes get opened whichever way i happen to go even in an unsuspicious unrelated accident so if theres been any talk of me being taken care of then literally speaking thats exactly what should be happening if youve got any time to spare making sure the roads clear before i cross or theres no banana skins in my way or i havent had one too many drinks before i get into my car as truelle got into his stride of taunting nelm in similar mode giving as good as he got he felt his nerves ease for the first time since hed got on the phone he couldnt resist a lightly mocking chuckle as he hit the last words but it died quickly in his throat we know all about your little insurance policies have done for some while now what truelle quickly forced another chuckle to cover his surprise but feared it had come across as quavering and uncertain surely nelm was bluffing they might have guessed hed somehow covered his back but they wouldnt know any of the details he took a long breath to calm his voice sound more certain of his ground i can read you like i read practically every one of my patients you know nothing dont kid yourself leonard we know everything every little move you see weve been listening have been for some time now nelm paused smiling slyly as he heard truelle swallow hard and his breathing become more rapid either truelle was walking fast or the comment had hit the mark youve been what you heard man listening you know what youre meant to do every day with your patients when i get off the phone from you now i can go to a little room where a man will replay everything weve just discussed and thats been the way for many a year now we got more tapes with labels on them than the friends reruns library every little detail most of it painfully boring but hey some of it pure magic nelms jocular taunting tone was back especially where youve tried to outwit us and weve been listening in knowing that youve failed before youve even started youre bluffing truelle said but his voice was suddenly hoarse lacking any conviction the blood was pounding so heavily through his head that when a large truck rolled past close by the sounds merged one thunderous vibrating roar that seemed to fill the street you just keep telling yourself that leonard our little man in his room is laughing himself stupid right now as we speak nelm started laughing then and it too became a roar that merged with the noise of the passing truck until truelle cut it short by ending the call and left there in the silence of the street as the noise of the truck faded into the distance at least now truelle had his answer he shouldnt have made the call his legs felt weak and unsteady and there was a sudden wave of acid bile in his stomach that made him want to retch though when he shuffled to the kerb and leant over nothing came up as he straightened and noticed a man passing on the opposite pavement looking over at him he was reminded of past times when this had happened he felt like shouting out i havent been drinking but of the two sick with fear or from drink he knew now which he preferred he looked pensively back along the street towards bens bar wondering whether the drink hed left on the table might not have been cleared away yet a faint tremble ran through jacs body as he walked back into his apartment after work that evening a combination of what hed seen on the video tape from internetional an hour before he left the office the first undisturbed moment hed been able to grab on the video player in the boardroom annexe and his earlier confrontation with beaton you see mr beaton the reason that i didnt say anything to you or indeed anyone was that warden haveling specifically asked me not to not that is until hed had time to deliberate more on a certain situation with lawrence durrant youre talking in riddles mcelroy i wanted to see you because i discovered youve been withholding information from me and youre still doing that now im sorry mr beaton but as you can see its awkward with my hands tied like this by client confidentiality before the meeting jac had quizzed langfranc again but there wasnt even a hint as to which withheld secret beaton knew about so jac hoped that if he fumbled around vaguely in the opening minutes beaton might let it slip but thered been several anxious scrambling moments before he finally did beaton eyeing him as if he was some sort of alien bug as jac explained about the differing accounts between the prison guards and durrant giving haveling pause for thought and in turn haveling asking jac to maintain secrecy until hed decided which account had the most validity as soon as jac was inside his apartment he slotted the video tape in his machine his jaw setting tighter as it played then stopped rewound and played the segment again then one final play this time stopping it at intervals and moving closer to the screen to gauge angles and clarity beaton had made it clear though that he was far from happy youve stretched confidentiality by the thinnest of threads here mcelroy one more incidence like this just one his parting words settling as a dull ache of tension at the back of jacs neck as hed returned to his desk no doubt left in his mind what would happen if beaton ever found out about durrants deathwish let alone their planned email ruse and jac felt that same ache now he went across to the side cabinet and poured himself a brandy closing his eyes as he felt the first mouthful trickle down it looked like mr mystery had been well aware of the cameras position had kept his head tilted down peak of his baseballcap obscuring his face on the way in and out and had chosen a computer with his back to it throughout there were only a few seconds with a part profile from cheekbone to chin and only a splitsecond with slightly more from bottom of one eye to chin but it was so fleeting and indistinct that it could still be anyone busta rhymes cent martin lawrence take your pick jac took another quick slug trying to focus on what he did have a video that could fit three hundred thousand male africanamericans in new orleans a description that at most would narrow that down by half an untraceable email address and a sender that might well have been spooked and so wouldnt make contact again jac rubbed his forehead but in that moment as jac turned it all over in his mind once more the images on tape tracys description and langfrancs earlier comment all coalesced and another unease suddenly gripped jacs stomach while yes it could well be a hoaxer or one of durrants friends from all of that it could also be as langfranc suggested the murderer himself jac noticed his hands start to shake as he opened out the earlier email and read it again i couldnt give my name or come forward before because id have incriminated myself and that still stands now but i was there and i know what i saw larry durrant didnt kill jessica roche jac bit at his lip recalling something else criminologists said that often those guilty gave a clue to what theyd done by only telling half the truth along with i was there another phrase now leapt out at him id have incriminated myself hi bellsouth my names leonard truelle and i made an earlier call requesting an engineers visit to check my line telephone number and zipcode nelm gave them and waited anxiously while the girl checked the details on the computer as agreed with roche hed left it twentyfour hours from his conversation with truelle before making the call if there was no request made hed have to backtrack quickly and say that hed instructed his secretary but she obviously hadnt made the request yet staff these days then make the same call twentyfour hours later nelm felt the tension ease from his chest as the girl started speaking again yes here it is appointment for an engineer to call at fourthirty pm at the number you gave me and another one here under the same name the following morning but a different number and address yes that ones for my office nelm said but the problem is i didnt have my diary with me at the time i made the appointments and i fear those times might now be a problem you said fourthirty tomorrow for my home visit and what time was it for my office eleven the following morning thursday nelm sighed i feared as much somethings cropped up and i just dont think im going to be able to make those now do you want me to reschedule them for you no no its okay if you cancel them for now ill phone in and book them again when ive got my schedule a bit clearer as it is i might have been worrying for nothing with the checks i wanted made thats been done for you now sir those engineer visits have been cancelled and we look forward to your contact again when youre ready thank you for calling bellsouth nelm phoned roche straightaway hes taken the bait but not just with his homeline hes having his office checked as well you really did light a fire under him i think it was that bit about a man in a little room listening in for the past few years well thats exactly whats going to be happening from here on in roches chuckle rode a laboured wheeze nothing like a touch of irony to brighten the day tally shavell counted down the last of forty pushups on his cell floor then with a sharp sucking in of his breath changed from flat palms to closed fists on the cell floor for a further twenty as he finished his breathing hardly faltering from the exertion he straightened up and admired himself nothing larger than small shaving mirrors were allowed at libreville not only because of the danger of all that jagged glass if they were broken but because vanity was frowned upon by haveling but pictures and paintings were allowed again with havelings approval and as long as they had perspex rather than glass covering so tally had chosen a fivefoot high poster print of othello from a production at chicagos shakespeare theater the poster depicted othello looking towards a light high in the wings to which he was making an impassioned handoutstretched plea the light picked out only his face part of one shoulder and his outstretched hand everything else the rest of his body and the surrounding stage scenery was blacked out tally knew that with its strong cultural and black roots tag haveling wouldnt dare give it the thumbsdown but it wasnt the image itself or its message that had attracted tally it was its blackness he could see his reflection in the darkness surrounding othellos lit face and perhaps in an ironic way he felt it also mirrored how he saw himself at libreville operating in the darker shadows beyond what everyone saw on the surface he took a deep breath and pumped up his torso and biceps he wasnt as dark as the actor in othello his fathers arcadian indiancreole french blood had tempered his mothers african lineage to make his skin tone a dark bronze with grey undertone it showed up well against the darkness of the poster his skin shining and glistening with the sweat from his pressups he tensed more until the veins stood up proud and bluegrey on his skin then kept his left arm rigid as he reached with his right hand for the syringe on the table to one side he found the vein without hardly looking and slowly and firmly squeezed it home ice or chalk it was favoured by those in the prison who wanted a sharper adrenalinpumped high which included most of his crew rather than become zombies from crack or heroin tally had his hand in the supply chain of nearly everything at libreville and most chalk or ice was supplied in tablet form or in crystals for smoking though tally preferred it intravenously he liked to feel that hit after only seconds preferably while he was still looking at his reflection and could see it practically coursing like a lit fuse through his bulging veins before exploding at the back of his brain his head jolted back as it hit and every nerve end tensed of its own accord he felt like that scene in highlander electrical surges connecting his body to the sky and half the universe beyond lifting him off his feet and he savoured the sensation knowing thats how hed feel when he made his next move against rodriguez he knew that he couldnt leave it long people were starting to talk cant even finish off a midget mexican these days he knew that each day he left rodriguez alive he risked letting slip his power grip over libreville and as if echoing that thought he felt the effects of the methamphetamine start to slide away from his body he stared back at his image through the blackness his widely dilated pupils settling back as he focused and started to plan where and when as they took up their seats in the canteen bc nudged rodriguez and looked towards the end of the table hey don forget new kid on the block yeah yeah rodriguez studied the boy barely in his twenties brushcut black hair wideeyed and bewildered from arriving at libreville just the day before rodriguez hardly felt in the mood for it with everything with larry still hanging by a thread if mcelroy got no joy over joshs emails to larry that was probably it throwinthetowel time but it had become standard routine his greeting of new inmates to the cellblock his audience now expected it of him looked forward to it one of the high points to break the dour stifling routine rodriguez headed towards the end of the table theo mellor sitting next to the new inmate promptly getting up and swapping places with him everyone knew their part in playing it out hey howya doin rodriguez held out a hand in greeting which the boy uncertainly took to shake roddy roddy rodriguez im the communications guy here yer know for any letters and emails you wanna send to family and friends an it also falls down to me to give you a quick introduction to whos who here an you are billy billy hillier still uncertain a faint smile threatening to break through well billy the first thing youre gonna have to know is everyones names roun here get their names wrong and theyll likely slit your throat before you even started what you were gonna say to em hillier went deathly white and rodriguez left it a few seconds before easing a smile and nudging him just joshin rodriguez glanced briefly back along the table all eyes now on them expectantly some already allowing themselves a small grin they knew what was coming and this one looked like he was going to make a good mark and to make it more confusin everyone round heres got nicknames so the trick is to fix somethin in your mind thatll help you remember them now lets start with a few easy ones sal peretti along there his first names salvatore and maybe youll remember sal by the bit of salt in his hair well more than a bit by now and gill arneck up there we just call him neck though thats as much cause he aint got much neck his fat head just sits straight on his shoulders the smiles broadening along the table a couple of chuckles and myself roddy rodriguez held one hand out for hillier to fill the gap uh uh short for rodriguez rodriguez shook his head knitting his brow now you see thats where you can easily go wrong here sometimes the nicknames are obvious sometimes not so obvious tgive you a clue i used to be a pimp rodriguez raised an eyebrow but hillier remained blank none the wiser an a few of the girls used to pay me a compliment rodriguez glanced down so that there was no remaining doubt but still it took a moment for hillier to catch on oh right right hillier smiled hesitantly yeah rodriguez shrugged off the accolade with a coy smile it was either that or woody or stallion more smiles and chuckles from around the table now lets get to the guys you gotta be real careful about gettin their nicknames right you see that guy two tables away over there guy with a mean look shoulders like a lineback and skin colour somewhere between coffee and death rodriguez nodded towards tally shavell rather than pointed then as hillier looked over hey dont look too hard he might think youre tryin to read the tattoos on his eyeballs gets him real upset hillier looked swiftly away then as around the table a few chuckles broke out he smiled crookedly youre kidding right yeah right deadpan rodriguez shaking his head in wonderment but lets see how you do with his nickname his names shavell and he runs most of the rackets in here and his nickname comes from the figures hes always addin up to share out the take any ideas i dont know hillier shrugged einstein einstein was a fuckin nuclear physicist not a beancountin prisonfixer the chuckling heavier now peretti laughing so hard that he was holding his stomach rodriguez lifted his eyes heavenward for strength though equally it was in thanks for sending him such a live one its tally from tallying up all those figures and that guard up the end there wit the dark lank hair his names sam morovitz but whats your guess for his nickname this time though hillier just puckered his lips and shook his head morezits rodriguez said after a moment holding out one hand sorta subtle wordplay to fit his tenderizedhamburger face or maybe not so subtle more in your face rodriguez eased a brief sly smile hes jus one of many lapdogs of headguard bateson the main guy you gotta keep clear of here bateboy ill point him out later and the guard we call the dark one torvald engelson hes actually one o the good guys rodriguez shrugged like i said sometimes its confusin rodriguez took a fresh breath and nodded along the table now our good friend here that looks like tysons mentallychallenged brother lets do it the other way roun ill give you his nickname bc letter b letter c then by lookin at him see if you can work out how he got it hillier pulled a face shaking his head after a second uh its difficult look at the flat shape o the head that neanderthal look that what the smiles and chuckles rising as much in anticipation this time it was going even better than usual you know as in prehistoric like a cave man hillier chewed his bottom lip for a second i know he said stabbing a finger at rodriguez he thought hed nailed it this time bc like in that film million years bc no thats not it rodriguez shook his head but to give you another clue his surnames crosby hillier pondered for a moment studying the table for inspiration before looking up again hopefully okay its his initials hes a bob or a billy like me no not it either though again not a bad guess rodriguez left another pause relishing along with everyone else hilliers bafflement before giving the final clue you dont see it on him now but when bc showed us some of his ol photos he had more chains roun his neck and rings on his fingers than mr t hilliers eyebrows still furrowed the chuckles starting to rise again around the table you know bling bling crosby then it became just bc the group around the table had heard the punchline a score of times but still it sent them into raptures of laughter becoming heavier as hilliers expression remained puzzled and rodriguez had to prompt bling crosby you know as in bing crosby but hilliers eyebrows just knitted heavier and as he said who the laughter became thunderous peretti bent over double as if he was in pain rodriguez fired his audience a deadpan jack benny look he should have realized that bing crosby to the rap generation was like paul robeson to his longgone no longer relevant rodriguez was glad hed done the routine despite his concerns about the timing it had certainly gone down well with his audience and maybe at a time like this with the shadow of larrys death edging closer they needed their spirits lifting all the more even larry was appreciative nodding his way with a smile eyes bright and the shadows that haunted them gone for a moment as if to say thanks that might be the last time ill be able to enjoy that roddy prison clown thats what he did best rodriguez thought wistfully sneakthieved some smiles and laughter from the doom and gloom where he could and if he couldnt do that then he wasnt good for much else but as the laughter died the grey walls and the dour routine settled back around them like a cloak with only the faint clatter of their cutlery to punctuate the silence jac had just come out of the shower and had started to get dressed when the phone rang he thought for a minute it might be alaysha asking him to bring something over such as oregano if he had any or that dinner was taking longer to prepare than shed anticipated or more worrying cancelling completely but it was jennifer bromwell you know i said i didnt think we should date again or rather we both more or less came to that conclusion well ive been thinking and maybe it is a good idea if we did jac paused halfway through buttoning his shirt but i thought you had a boyfriend the rock musician that your father wasnt keen on what kelvin oh sure im still with him jennifer chuckled lightly as she realized hed grabbed the wrong end of the stick i didnt mean date date i meant pretend to continue seeing each other as if we were dating oh right i see although he still had little idea the way i see it my dad and mom dont want me to continue seeing kelvin so every time i go out with him i get grief and theyre already pressing for when im next meant to be seeing you because when they asked how our date went i said great fine not only because thats what they wanted to hear but because the love and romance bit aside thats exactly how i think the date went great and i thought that was pretty much how you felt about it too yes i did jac said automatically he still wasnt fully up to speed on where she was heading and he had half an eye on the clock hed left it tight as it was to get dressed on time and as if to remind him next door he could hear the soft clatter of pans and opening and shutting of kitchen cupboard doors the final minutes of preparation and setting the table so the thing is i can see that im going to continue to get grief from my parents every time i date kelvin and youve got a similar problem with your aunt camille true jac agreed hed only had one call so far from camille asking how it went but since hed said much the same as jennifer great fine nice girl no doubt the enquiries would soon increase in intensity his excuse that they hadnt yet set the next date because of his heavy workload was only going to buy him so much time and if it wasnt me shed only try to set you up with someone else that she considered suitable so i thought if we made out that we were continuing to date that would take all the pressure off for both of us i could keep seeing kelvin whenever i was meant to be seeing you and you well at least you wouldnt have camille pushing every bucktoothed richkid in the state in front of you thatd be fine i can see the sense in that jac said sighing gently as he prepared to let her down only problem is im starting to see someone else my my jac mcelroy you dont waste much time we only just started courtin and already youre cheatin on me jennifer feigned a heavy southern belle accent which lapsed into a chuckle i know i know just came up out of the blue but with the thought of alaysha so close to that of aunt camille his mind fastforwarded to the possible nightmare conversation thanks for the offer of louisianas finest and most eligible but ive decided in the end to date a lapdancer family struggling downatheel immigrants originally from portofspain father a wifebeater deserted the family early mother on welfare oh and shes already got a child by another man who didnt have the courtesy to marry her and headed down the same route as her father lashing out and leaving early thats why shes lapdancing to support the child that would go down with camille like an islamic terrorist at a barmitzvah shed probably oust his mother and sister from her house that same night though wait a minute perhaps this could work out as you say to both our advantages if camille thought that he was going out with jennifer bromwell at least she wouldnt ask any awkward questions but i dont have the time right now to go through all the details im already running late for a dinner appointment so can i phone you when i get in from work tomorrow and well work out the timing for the first date make sure we get our respective stories straight great look forward to it jac and having just agreed to dating another woman he finished getting ready for dinner with alaysha reyner dinner was typical creole shrimp remoulade chicken and smoked sausage jambalaya and catfish etouffee alaysha was wearing jeans with a black semitransparent gauze top that showed her bra but it was an elaborate dress bra black with silver stitching and studs that was meant to be seen molly was staying with her grandmother that night alaysha explained as they sat down noticing jacs eyes stray and take in the room for a second almost a mirror image of his apartment except that the decor was ten steps above a lot of salmon and soft pastels it somehow seemed larger yet at the same time warmer more inviting with the way that her wavy dark hair tilted and swayed as they ate her smiles and laughter at intervals as the small talk gathered pace her lipgloss making her lips look moist inviting and those warm brown eyes with green flecks that seemed to make him melt every time they settled on him the effect was dazzling as before jac found her beauty intimidating his mouth suddenly dry with nervous anticipation of what might happen between them and on top of that he had the tension a writhing tightening ball in the pit of his stomach of what he now had to broach with alaysha after the letdown with the video tape havelings call the day before had given him fresh hope that he might be on a roll again good news on two fronts dennis marmont had finally come to in hospital and while haveling had decided not to fully accept one account over the other guards or prisoners that midground stance had at least meant that nothing would go on durrants file about an attempted prison break and hed overall provide a fair and sturdy reference to support his clemency petition jac headed to libreville to see rodriguez straight after because it wasnt the sort of thing they could discuss on the phone faking the emails from josh durrant but rodriguez wasnt able to help communications were monitored too closely monitorin guard would pick up straightoff that the message came from inside the only thing he could help with was to smooth the way for it incoming if someone else was able to send it from the outside i could also send the last few emails from josh tmake sure the flavour was got right but as rodriguez looked across sharply with an arched eyebrow and jac realized that rodriguez was suggesting that he send it jac explained that he couldnt he felt uncomfortable enough even being involved with it let alone actually sending himself if something like this was traced back directly to me id be struck off the bar before i could draw breath id never be able to practice law again theyd sat in awkward silence for a moment before rodriguez commented with a shrug somehow dont sit right us all givin up for no other reason than all our hands are tied mine cause i cant send the message yours cause o your career and franny durrant cause shes afraid of losin her new partner and meanwhile we all just sit back and let larry die jac had nodded numbly eyes closing for a second as he felt rodriguezs words settle like a tenton weight on his shoulders why couldnt rodriguez just stick to comedy when it suddenly struck him who might be able to send it the person in fact who first suggested the idea what some lawyer buddy who unlike you don mind playin dirty no its a lapdancer i just met rodriguez beamed widely now youre talkin slip a cnote into their gstrings and those girls will do just bout anything no seriously if you jus met her dyer think shell play ball on this only one way to find out yeah rodriguez nodded with wry smile but one word of advice if i may youre meant to fuck em before you let them too much into your private life otherwise you risk fallin into that awkward midterritory of justfriends just friends jac had immediately discounted langfranc or his sister too close and while alaysha would keep it at arms length from himself and yes it had been her suggestion it was still a hell of a favour to ask of someone youd just met jac swallowed hard as he looked across the table at alaysha and the last impression he wanted to give now was that that favour was even close to the main purpose of the date so hed decided to wait before broaching the subject besides from the way that at moments her eyes clouded and shed look to one side he got the feeling that she too had something on her mind he decided to let her go first but equally she was slow getting round to whatever was troubling her as if it was awkward or she feared it was too sensitive for an early date its amazing weve lived next door to each other all this time without ever seeing each other she commented yeah jac shrugged ive had a hectic time the last year or so with fresh bar exams and a lot of weekends i head out to see my mum and sister in hammond alaysha nodded thoughtfully and is it your mom thats originally french yes my dads scottish jac explained that his mothers parents hailed from near bordeaux but because of their antivichy stance they left france during the second world war and settled in scotland which is where she had met adam jacs father thats why when my father hankered after opening an artists retreat he chose the bordeaux area it would be like a return to roots for my mum and thats where we lived from when i was eight years old up until just three years ago when my father jacs voice trailed off enough death hanging over him with durrant alaysha smiled tightly as if in understanding but the silence settled deeper as the seconds passed a faint tension creeping into it hows the jambalaya alaysha asked breaking it just how i like it he held up a forefinger and thumb pinched together in an o even though ive only had it a couple of times before give you some grits and gumbos and youll almost be a native she smiled again and jac raised his wine glass in acknowledgment returning her smile the small talk was running thin but still she looked briefly again to one side before making the final resolve to say something this prisoner you mentioned the problems with is it by any chance lawrence durrant she held her gaze on him unflinchingly and he had the same feeling as when hed first met her as if she could somehow see through to his very soul and lying to her at this stage wouldnt exactly help him when he got around to asking his favour yes yes it is he said on the back of a resigned exhalation what made you suspicious think that it might be him oh intuition clemency appeal and wanting to die all but narrowed it down to a possibility of one yeah but how did you work it out from there he ducked as she smiled and threw her balledup paper napkin at him his brow creasing as he straightened really was it that transparent pretty much there hasnt been an execution in louisiana for over a year and the only one i can see scheduled any time soon is that of lawrence durrant at least from what i see in the news ill have to be more careful in future not to mention death or clemency just saying the prisoner obviously isnt enough to protect my clients identity looks like it she mirrored his thoughtfulness for a second before introducing a more upbeat tone but hey one hell of a case to land you must be excited it would have been so easy to play the big shot and score points by saying that hed got the case because he was such a highflyer at payne beaton and sawyer but as with everything else so far with her he had the feeling shed see straight through it it wouldnt get him anywhere not really jac shrugged the firm only gave me the case rather than keeping it for one of the senior partners because its such a nohoper all the juicy stuff was apparently exhausted at appeal all im left with is sweeping up the dust but looks like ive broken my broom after the first couple of strokes im striking out before ive hardly started alayshas eyebrows knitted but that suggestion i made the other day i thought that was meant to have helped shift the deadlock jac nodded it would have except that durrants prison buddy rodriguez cant do it everything in and out of the communication room is strictly monitored so thered be no way of him getting away with it oh i see as alayshas eyes settled back on him jac felt a stab of conscience still it felt wrong asking her to do it too early youre meant to fuck em before you let them too much into your private life maybe that was the tradeoff any chance of a relationship with alaysha gone to save larry durrants life jac swallowed shook his head i cant do it either it breaks every possible rule of lawyerclient trust jac repeated much the same he had to rodriguez about being struck off the bar in a heartbeat if he was found out the only possibility i hit upon while with rodriguez was that someone else do it someone not directly linked with durrant jac was watching alayshas expression closely throughout but it took her a second to realize that he was asking her if she could do it the faint jolt to her body and clouding in her eyes was late in registering she looked down fleetingly before looking back at him directly thats a pretty big favour to ask i know and id understand if you felt you couldnt help no i didnt mean it like that okay yeah it was my idea but asking me to be handson and actually do it thats another level entirely it means that that you must trust me in turn it took jac a second to realize that she felt strangely flattered rather than outraged he smiled tightly and cast his eyes down as if in coy acceptance he didnt want to dilute the sentiment by saying he couldnt think of anyone else because in his few years in new orleans he hadnt made that many close friends or as roddy had put it crooked lawyer buddies and is this your last hope of getting durrant to want to live as you see it she asked pretty much if this doesnt work id have to admit to being stuck for what next to do she looked down briefly again as if searching for invisible inspiration in her jambalaya okay okay ill do it she said finally exhaling as if she was easing a weight off her chest jac eyed her cautiously are you sure youre okay with this yes im sure her initially hesitant smile became fuller more confident in fact im glad to be able to help jac nodded gently as he saw alayshas last reservations slip away he wondered whether to tell her about his mystery emailer reciprocation for helping out with something so momentous showing her even more trust but in the end decided against it there probably wasnt much advice she could offer and besides hed already overstretched client confidentiality they were silent for a moment only the clinking of their cutlery and a clara moreno album playing softly in the background jac saw something in alayshas eyes then a warmth and soulfulness that went deeper hit another level he hadnt been aware of before as if shed purposely shielded it from him till that moment though he had no idea what it meant until almost an hour later as she was clearing away and leant in towards him and started kissing him they were tentative at first as if she was testing the water before diving fully in but after that it was almost two minutes before she pulled back for air again looking at him thoughtfully as she traced the moistness shed left on his top lip with one fingertip now that ive agreed to do a big favour for you well looks like i might need one in return it involves my boyfriend jac was quick to give his agreement to what she asked probably far quicker than hed have been without the heat of her closeness firing him on because much of what she was suggesting helped close the door on the chapter with her boyfriend and left the way clear for himself and as he nodded and their bond of clandestine mutual favours was sealed with more rapid fervent kisses and alaysha started unbuttoning his shirt before leaning back to slide her own top over her head that look returned again to her eyes and jac knew then what it was it signalled the moment that shed first decided she was going to sleep with him straight after shed agreed to help him with his lastditch duplicitous bid to try and save larry durrants life their lovemaking felt like a dream happening so quickly fervently breathlessly that the images were little different when they replayed in jacs dream later that same night tinged with the same hazy glow of the streetlight filtering into alayshas bedroom her coffeecream skin bathed in orange light her hazelbrown eyes drawing him in like a welcoming blanket of autumn leaves the beads of sweat massing on her top lip and when he looked down spread across her entire body like fine raindrops and her breath hot and urgent in his ear urging him on oh fuck me fuck me jac fuck me but beyond her body heat and him frantically keeping rhythm with her he started to hear the bed banging though he could never remember that at the time and he realized it was someone knocking at her apartment door her boyfriends voice who have you got with you what are you doing in there then suddenly there was the banging of a door behind him then another the same banging hed heard on that first night through the apartment wall successive doors slamming like pistol shots as her boyfriend moved inexorably towards them but as the bedroom door burst open it was larry durrant standing there gun in hand as in his previous dream yet this time as the bullet hit and suddenly it was jessica roche beneath him he didnt pull back repulsed but clung on eyes searching for clues he might have missed last time something something her blood hot and clammy against his skin mingling with his sweat no no no no larry shouting from the doorway was little more than a silhouette the stark light behind that of the corridor at libreville his desperate cries echoing through its cavernous grey depths his face fearful and beaded with sweat became suddenly quizzical pleading dont tell anyone what just happened here please mr mcelroy perhaps we can hide the body somewhere so that nobody will know maybe then ill get to hear from my little boy again i havent heard from him in a while jac awoke with a jolt as the thunder crashed only a second after the lightning flash his heart was beating wildly and his body was bathed in sweat as if he had only seconds ago been making love to alaysha jac swallowed trying to get his heartbeat settled again he wondered if he was getting into a repetitive dreamcycle again as in the year after his father died the settings were usually familiar their farmhouse isle de rey beaches but in many of them he was having fresh conversations with his father as if he was still alive and hed start to panic that if he said the wrong thing his father would then realize he was dead the storm outside growled and rumbled it had been hot with the humidity skyhigh before jac went to sleep pressurecooking its way steadily upward through much of the day the sort of weather that made you sweat just buttering toast let alone making love if it was uncomfortable here it would be unbearable at libreville hot and foetid at the best of times and for a second he had a mental snapshot of durrant laying on his prison bed listening to the same storm thinking about the days ahead until his execution and the many things hed now never get to do like holding his son in his arms again or maybe he was sleeping easy like a baby after all he was finally going where he wanted his ascension day he was still uneasy about misleading durrant over his sons emails though at least he was able to console himself that the end keeping durrant alive justified the means but what was starting to unsettle him more was misleading durrant that his clemency would buy time to prove his innocence and finally gain him freedom jac hadnt even given a second thought to that because from what hed seen in the police and trial files such a quest seemed hopeless impossible so while he might hopefully get durrant clemency now at best it would be a commute to life imprisonment in the end all hed be doing was sentencing larry durrant to another ten to fifteen in that foetid oppressive hellhole and thinking about that now maybe durrant had been right all along given that choice maybe death would be preferable death everyone at libreville thought about it those on death row perhaps more than they should even if their execution might be five or ten years away with any number of possible lifelines inbetween appeals and clemency pleas state governors offering across the board pardons upon retirement from office as had happened once before death was still there in some dark corner of their minds where they pushed everything they didnt want to face gnawing steadily away but with an impending execution among their number only thirtysix days away it was that much harder to push away and not think about larry durrants approaching death hung over all of them sudden stark reminder that it could be them next and maybe not so long away as they thought death reached out its icy hand to every corner of the prison trickled down cell walls along with the ingrained grime and sweat the smeared blood and faeces brought a chill to the air and to inmates spines even when it was touching and if death row was the nucleus of that at libreville the queen bees hive it didnt lack for supporting drones eightytwo per cent of inmates incarcerated at libreville would die there of pneumonia heart failure cancer tumours drugs overdoses aids murdered by fellow prisoners or simply of old age so there was a prison hospice a chapel for prayers for the dead and a graveyard libreville seemed reluctant to let go of its inmates even in death and while most prisoners families would choose to take the body home for burial their only chance to get loved ones back many had been so long forgotten by their families that burial at libreville remained the only option of that amount the executioner would grimreap less than two per cent but that small number by far overshadowed all other deaths because it underscored the reason they were all there you commit murder we kill you when were good and ready and the passage of time while helping inmates push the spectre of death away in their minds also made it like a slowdrip torture death might be trickling down their cell walls slowly but that ensured its omnipresence paradoxically of all of them larry durrant was probably the least worried because hed resigned himself to death long ago but others on death row watched with foreboding that passage of approaching death as the days wound down to larry durrants execution wondering when it might next reach out to claim them there were spaces though in the prison where you could escape places that breathed life transported you to the world outside in your mind or simply numbed you made you forget where you were for rodriguez it was the prison radio and communication room all that contact with the outside world made it easy to transport himself if only for a few moments here and there to where that contact came from or when he was playing songs closing his eyes and imagining he was a dj at some farflung station tklm tahiti or remembering where hed been and what hed been doing when hed first heard that song for larry it was the library and his books that would let him drift to other places in his mind and for other inmates it might be working the ranch the annual rodeo or the muscle yard rodriguez had never been much for muscle training and category a prisoners werent allowed to work the open ranch so the only common area where he found a quiet corner was the showers not for the reason they were favoured by many inmates scoping for prison bitches but because with his head back eyes closed and the water running down his body he could escape he could be anywhere under a waterfall on some south pacific isle waiting for one of his stable of fine women to join him under its spray or maybe at home when he was younger and his mom calling out if he was going to be long because dinner was ready it washed away the sweat and grime the invisible aura of stale and trapped humanity of oppression and death that seemed to cling to the skin like a sticky blanket within hours wash it away wash it away rodriguez scrubbed hard then when he felt hed washed the prison away he tilted his head back and closed his eyes letting himself drift with the spray hitting his face and running down his body pacific waterfalls fine women soaping his body at home and about to put on his best threads for a saturday night out and hed been more successful in his reverie this time rodriguez thought because hed even managed to tune out the clamour and echo of the other voices in the showers the hand clamping suddenly over his mouth snapped his eyes sharply open two striplights his end of the showers had been switched off and the five guys showering in his section and the guard by the showers open entrance had suddenly gone probably the other people showering and the guards further along out of sight were still there but as rodriguez writhed and tried to call out to get their attention he made no more than a muted whimper the hand across his mouth was clamped too firmly rodriguez couldnt see who was holding him the arm too across his chest was clamped tight only feel his breath against the back of his neck the only person he could see in that instant sliding into the side of his vision a few paces away was tally shavell a towel around his waist upper body glistening muscles tensed like steel chords the veins in his neck taut as he grimaced malevolently sorry didnt bring no reading matter wi me this time the open razor at towel level in shavells right hand was flicked out silently imperceptibly as he stepped closer and rodriguez knew in that moment that death had come for him sooner than he had thought should be no problem handling two addresses i got a friend mo who does much the same as me ive only got one bell uniform but i can head over to his place after ive finished and hand it to him are you sure it will fit nelm quipped very funny barry responded dryly but if it looks like theres a problem i can always stitch up the back for him barry lassitter had become barryl then simply barrel since hed been three hundred pounds for more years than he cared to remember but he was one of the best exbell men that nelm knew and from the name hed given his company warpspeed communications he obviously didnt mind the world knowing that he was an ardent trekkie nelm would have put in the bug himself if it wasnt for the fact that truelle would recognize him also he needed someone who could do it in one minute flat rather than five or six nothing like a good stitch up nelm commented also make sure theres no telltale egg or ketchup stains down the front that might give the game away that its the same uniform barrel huffed and muttered a response that nelm didnt hear and let me know as soon as theyre both in place and were live larry had just gone through the gate at the end of his cell block to head down to the showers when he was approached by one of the guards dan warrell youre wanted up in the library am i back on duty there then warrell shrugged dont know about that all i know is the guy up there perinni peretti yeah well hes apparently stuck with something needs a hand okay larry nodded he wasnt suspicious warrell didnt have any allegiances with bateson was very much his own man if you had a grievance and wanted it dealt with fairly and evenly warrell or torvald engelson were the best to go to ill see your way up there warrell led the way up the two flights of steel steps then along forty yards of corridor half of it flanked by cells warrell took out his security card as they approached the gate beyond lay store rooms a guards watch room and canteen and the library peretti was at the far end of the library and looked surprised to see larry though pleasantly so back to give me a hand then he smiled crookedly couldnt trust me to be on my own too long in case i screwed everything up but you said you wanted a help out with something larry pressed one eyebrow arching not me naah peretti shook his head larry turned to warrell his eyes narrowing i thought you said i was wanted here yeah that was what i was told who told you with the intensity of larrys glare and his cutting tone warrell flinched slightly uh bateson glenn bateson jesus larry ran ahead of warrell realizing he needed him as he came up to the gate get me back through this and quick under larrys icy glare warrells hand shook uncertainly as he slid in his card he wasnt about to argue or question back along the corridor down the two flights of stairs leaping them three and four steps at a time larry was already breathless as he hit the passage by his cell block at full pelt one more flight down to the shower stalls and another thirty yards of passage before the security gate by the shower stalls breath ragged heart pounding larry saw that there were five or six men by the gate to the showers being handed towels and waiting for that same number to come out so that they could go through the normal routine but what was not normal larry quickly picked out were the lights out at the far end and no guard looking into that section man in distress at the far end larry shouted pushing through the men waiting the guard by the gate fisk in thick with bateson blocked his way defiantly what are you talking about i said man in distress at the far end larry raised his voice to screaming pitch his only hope was rousing the attention of the three guards by the early sections and hoping to god they werent all in on it with bateson man in distress one of the guards looked uncertainly towards the rear cubicles then back at the gate confused larry saw the alarm button a yard to one side and remembering rodriguez in the boilerroom leapt across and hit it the jangling bell finally galvanized the guard into action larry keeping up his mantra man in distress man in distress as the guard darted towards the rear cubicles though larry feared that it was already too late byebye had got his nickname because fellow malastra capos and soldiers had noticed that it was usually the last thing he said before he wasted someone with his favoured cougar mm and as malastras main triggerman it was something he said often though with the name apparently came some unintentional humour often when he called out byebye in parting others would flinch or lift one arm up worried that any second his cougar would be pointing and firing but it was difficult for george jouliern to laugh about it now because pretty soon those words would probably be the last thing hed hear they were in an old warehouse musty and humid and jouliern looked morosely at the blue plastic sheet usually used as a damp membrane in construction spread beneath him eight yards away a furnace probably lit over two hours ago glowed red from its aperture jouliern sat in the middle of the blue sheet his hands tied behind his back but his ankles free byebye held his cougar on him steadily from three paces away and at points when byebye had leant over or turned jouliern had noticed the sheathed machete and knife tucked in the back of his belt jouliern knew the routine well enough hed be shot with the cougar his body chopped into pieces the whole mess then wrapped in the blue plastic and thrown into the furnace within forty minutes thered be absolutely no trace of him joulierns stomach sank at the thought of it he looked up trying to inject a hopeful tone into his voice you kill me youre not going to find out who else was in on it with me you think i did the whole thing alone byebye smiled tightly you know theres no deals on something like this you know the score george i know joulierns tone sank back as he arched an eyebrow so youre saying you dont want to know who else was involved i didnt say that byebye contemplated his shoes for a second look if you tell me who else was in with you the best i can offer is to make it quick and clean painless now it was joulierns turn to look down contemplating but when he looked up again his stare was icy fuck you thats what i say then twisting himself as he rose up without warning he lunged headfirst towards byebye his voice rising to a scream fuck youfuck y byebye took him down with two shots before hed moved a yard didnt even get time to deliver his favourite words that was good malastra commented when byebye returned and explained what had happened so he got his quick and painless death without having to give us any names byebye shuffled uncomfortably happened so quick boss malastra held his stare on him a moment longer all ram and no harddrive but the advantage was that by the time of byebyes next cheeseburger hed have forgotten all about killing george jouliern hed sleep easy that night okay malastra waved him away his gaze shifting back to his computer screen his eyes narrowed as the first image of the bay tree casino floor came up on the screen hed have to find out who else jouliern had been involved with by tracing who hed met over the past year and what might have passed between them particularly any envelopes and one of the key questions raised is always why they wanted to die you think all of thats going to happen without your son ever finding out itll only be the first year or so i can keep it hidden from him for that time besides as you say and i also know from bitter past experience larry is always so closemouthed no way is he going to admit that his wanting to die is down to his son not making contact hes going to say just what he told you that hes simply sick of facing more time in prison and this is his going to god his ascension day as much as joshua durrant tried to shake the conversation he had overheard loose from his head over the following days it kept replaying he tapped fast and furiously at the keyboard frank g frankg frank g frank was a good enough guy and that wasnt joshua simply sharing his mothers standpoint because hed been good to them joshua liked him because frank gave him quality time when needed and accepted him as if he was his own but there were times when franks reasoning ran thin and more often than not it involved joshs father joshua had accepted at the time his moms and franks reasoning over the emails and the last thing hed want to do is upset them or cause any problems but now with what hed overheard his father wanting to die unless he sent more emails that smashed through every possible rulebook was something he couldnt bear for a second being responsible for and what frank and his mom didnt know wouldnt hurt them fg flg flg fg fg fg are you okay there josh his moms voice trailed from the kitchen his hands paused on the keyboard heart thumping in his chest yes fine mom its nice to see you getting down to your homework so early but you do seem to be putting in a lot on this project i ive got to finish by the end of the week im already late with it frank had passwordblocked all internet access josh had fed in over a hundred possible keywords in the half hour before frank got in the night before mostly around franks name initials and birthdate without success and now he was on franks lucky numbers hopefully his mom wasnt getting suspicious he looked at intervals over his shoulder as he resumed tapping the computer was in a small recess in the hallway but even if she came out from the kitchen she probably wouldnt know the difference between his searching for entry keywords and his school project work just in case to one side he had a project page with the civil war and paul revere to click on and cover he tried another batch of combinations and glanced anxiously at his watch another six or seven minutes then hed have to quit until the next night but as he continued he started to sense the futility he might have thousands more possibilities to work through and even if he hit gold while he could delete the emails sent how on earth was he going to coverup the replies unless they arrived in the half an hour before frank got home he was sunk his hands slowed on the keyboard hed give it his best shot that night but if there was still no breakthrough tomorrow hed approach danny thorne one of his closest schoolfriends and the resolve made his hands picked up speed again on the keyboard becoming suddenly a furious race against time to find the password because he knew now this would probably be his last opportunity franklg franklg franklg or maybe it was his and his moms initials or the first three letters of their names combined with franks lucky numbers joshua continued working through the combinations and was over halfway through when the screendoor suddenly slamming made him jump hed got so engrossed that he hadnt even heard franks car pull up his heart beating wildly his hand trembling and suddenly clammy on the mouse he quickly clicked off the password page and clicked on paul revere the document leapt to the forefront just a second before the door swung open and frank stepped into the hallway like fortknox four heavy dead bolts on the door as i was let in and as you suspected motion alarms in the main lounge and the hallway at his end of the line nelm nodded thoughtfully as barry lassitter ran through his visit to truelles apartment the main factors that had stopped nelm simply breaking in and planting the bug himself he hovered for a bit watching me but he had a coffee in his hand so i nodded to it smells nice he offered me one and i finished up while he was back in the kitchen and he took the bait that his phone had been bugged yeah held it up for him to see exact duplicate of what id just wired in while he was making my coffee good going let me know when the other ones done lassitters return call came at the next morning just got the nod from mo everything went fine at his office too no hitches thanks nelm hardly paused for breath before calling vic farrelia thats a go now for lines two and three as well then he called adelay roche my man just phoned truelles just been done too home and office so were live on all fronts thats good to hear roche commented now we might be able to better decide just who needs to be dead when joshua broached the subject with danny thorne of using his home computer danny was wary its not to go pornsurfing is it no no nothing like that out of his three closest friends at elbrooke high hed chosen danny because he was the only one to have his own nonparentally controlled internet access hed worked before at dannys house on school projects so no eyebrows would be raised by him going over there for an hour or two after school but from the concern on dannys face he was suddenly reminded that danny was probably also his most cautious conservative friend its to send some emails to my father oh from dannys heavy exhalation it was unclear whether that was actually worse than pornsurfing why cant you send the emails from home you were sending some before i remember you telling me my mom would still let me like a shot but franks stepped in put his foot down he could see the clouds of doubt forming rapidly in dannys eyes please danny youve got to help me out here if there was any other way you know i wouldnt be asking okay okay let me think on it a bit ill let you know tomorrow by the next day joshua had spent another frantic half hour keyword searching without success before frank got home so was even more desperate but dannys doubts and concerns seemed to have increased im worried about my parents finding out and from there you know its only a heartbeat before yours find out too how will they find out get real you know they speak sometimes on the phone and theyll get talking even more if youre round my place once or twice a week reminding you what time dinners ready or josh has forgot this or that and i know my dad checks my emails now and then hed kill me if he found out i was trading emails in and out of libreville when i shouldnt they were in the corridor just after a lesson and as their voices raised theyd started to get the attention of some of the other students filing out come on danny im real stuck here cant you at least but danny was already sidling away as joshua reached one hand out imploringly and then they were both distracted by one of the onlookers ellis calpar whod stopped to pay more attention to their conversation thats the problem wit those oreoles ellis called out moving a step closer when it comes t the crunch the white tightassed be eversocareful anal side always wins trough danny was mixed race and as his friend headed away along the corridor joshua fired him a tight grimace that made it clear he wasnt keen on the barb either but then you expected no less from ellis calpar libreville thats where your ol man is isnt it not much time lef now from what i see on the news so whats the beef with you and danny i thought yo two were always like that ellis interlocked two fingers at first joshua wasnt going to say anything but elliss tone was weighted with understanding more than teasing and he recalled one time when one of elliss crew had started to give him a tough time and ellis had stepped in go easy on him man his ol mans at libreville for murder the crew member had jolted back a pace as if hit with an electric shock to ellis and his buddies having a father in prison for murder was a mark of respect rather than one of ridicule as joshua explained elliss eyes lit up like a christmas tree he put a welcoming arm over joshuas shoulder look no further you have just foun your libreville email sender not me personally i dont have a computer but one o my crew friggy does thats our main message centre joshua felt immediately uncomfortable hed never got involved with ellis before let alone with something as personal as this its okay ellis you dont have to trouble yourself none im sure i can find another way round this no sweat tall man would be a real pleasure passin emails in and out of libreville to your ol man ellis smiled slyly and the fact that your mom and new dad are against it and yo not meant tdo it makes it all the mo fun ellis gave joshuas shoulder one last pat as he broke away and went ahead of him along the corridor ill talk to friggy and let you know the timin later man but as joshua watched ellis get swallowed up among the other students filling the corridor he couldnt resist a sense of foreboding he might have solved his email problem but how was he going to explain away to his mom and frank spending time after school with ellis calpar and his crew for sure theyd fear he was getting primed for future autotheft or crack dealing before contacting rodriguez jac wanted to check again with alaysha that she was still okay with taking part in the durrant email ruse in case it had just been the heat of the moment or the wine talking the night before it wasnt the sort of call he could make from the office so he phoned just before he left for work she was still on for it hed never truly doubted and for the first time he got some insight into her rationale though she brought a tingle to his cheek when she talked about the night before and he could still feel a warm pang inside at the thought of her as he signed off and called rodriguez were on for those emails jac said as rodriguez came on the line the lapdancer you mentioned the other day the same what did you have to do to her to get her to agree rodriguez jibed well you know its a dirty job but someones got to do it a handful of conversations with rodriguez and already jac was sounding like one of his cellblock buddies rodriguez chuckled but it died quickly he shook off a faint shiver as he thought about his close escape that morning the shouting and alarm ringing had come as tally was only a step away already raising the razor hed have no doubt had time to slit his throat but getting away cleanly was starting to look like a problem tally brandished the razor in warning your guardian angel again by the looks of it but he aint gonna be around much longer then quickly palmed the razor and slipped away as the guard approached rodriguez decided against saying anything to mcelroy there probably wasnt much mcelroy could do and he had enough on his plate trying to save larry without worrying about two of them the only thing is i gotta get back on communicationroom duty to receive it rodriguez said also to send out those last few sample emails from jd haveling mighta halfbelieved our account but most of our privileges are still cut you didnt mention this before no need before it didnt look likely we were gonna be able to get any emails to larry now it does jac sighed okay ill phone haveling see what i can do do you know someone who might be good for that i do as it happens and just down the road from me right here in morgan city bob stratton scrolled down his excel address list yeah here it is dan souchelle the thought had suddenly struck jac while shifting some files from his desk first thing that morning recalling that in one of them a shoplifting case the police had requested image enhancement on the key security camera pictures jac wrote down the number thanked stratton and dialled it straight after hed hung up souchelle confirmed that he could do the job and promised a fortyeight hour turnaround any chance of quicker sorry were backed up like crazy right now having trouble even keeping to that at times but ill make sure this one doesnt run over jac said hed get the video tape over to him straightaway then seconds after hed put the phone down from fedex to arrange the messenger it rang again less than half an hour at his desk and already his fifth call lieutenant pyrford jac felt his pulse twitch in his jaw as pyrford in smug singsong tones informed him that morvaun jaspars next police interview was later that morning eleventhirty be there or be square not that i care either way ill be there jac slammed the phone down sharply enough to hopefully make pyrford jump the other end fourteen minutes later the fedex messenger arrived and as he left with the tape jac eased out a tired breath closing his eyes for a second two days but at least there was a fresh glimmer of hope again with his anonymous emailer a chance rather than no chance pyrfords call had unsettled him pyrford had no doubt made the appointment tight to give jac little time to prepare himself and it wasnt the best time for it to be happening right in the middle of organizing the email to larry durrant and there had been that nagging glitch in morvauns demeanour that made jac worry morvaun was holding something back from him some big surprise that the police would suddenly spring but it wasnt just that jac realized it was something else not so easily quantified jac had immediately warmed to morvaun jaspar when they first met sixtyseven sharp as a razor the product of an africanamerican father and irishfrenchafricanamerican mother he had wavy black hair and an easy full smile showing one gold tooth five from the back on the top row all mine hed proudly proclaim to anyone interested or not except this one his dress was often wild and eccentric somewhere between mr bojangles and vivienne westwood morvaun had been a serial forger for over twenty years before that hed been a makeup man for a local theatre group and when it disbanded the only work he could find was piecemeal with a brief flurry at carnival time morvaun took a sidestep into forging to supplement his income where before he was dealing with skin hair and flesh tones now he was dealing with paper photos and document stamps the core aim of both was the same to create an illusion and sometimes there was crossover between the two which had provided jac with the vital key to getting morvaun off the last charge morvauns last lawyer had retired and when he approached the firm beaton swiftly passed it down the rungs to jac possibly because it was too lightweight possibly because like durrant he saw it as hopeless but jac quickly saw some hope in morvaun jaspars case mainly because this time thered been no forged documents involved antonio amador a mexican national had used the documentation of his brother enrique whod gained american citizenship six years previous all morvaun had done was make antonio look like enrique one drawback to their scheme was that antonio wouldnt be able to use the documentation to work otherwise it would look like enrique had two jobs but that hardly mattered since antonios main aim was to move freely back and forth across the mexican border running cocaine apprehended one day during a routine search antonio promptly gave morvauns name in a plea bargain but jac argued in court that no forging of documents had taken place and since all mr jaspar had done was make antonio look like his brother unless hed informed mr jaspar in advance that it was to perpetrate some criminal activity mr jaspar himself had committed no crime given the circumstances its unlikely that antonio amador would have shared that information with mr jaspar the judge agreed and directed the jury accordingly it was unlikely and on its own it was no crime to make one person look like another hollywood did it all the time some chuckles from the courtroom floor and a beaming hug of thanks for jac from morvaun when forty minutes later the jury acquitted him but the police and the prosecuting attorney were far from pleased good result jac good result langfranc congratulated him on his return but you want to watch out youre not pushing your luck too far the police might now target jaspar go all the harder on him pushing your luck as soon as langfranc said it jac realized that the morvaun jaspar case along with a few others embodied how he saw himself as a lawyer beaton would hand him these hopeless cases that nobody else wanted and because he was eager to prove them all wrong and not fail hed go that extra mile or two push his luck perhaps it went deeper than that trying desperately to prove that in no way was he continuing his fathers cycle a scream back at the world and aunt camille he was never a failure and nor am i jac realized that his main strength was also his achilles heel and began to worry that one day langfranc would be right that hed push his luck too far jac busied himself with preparation for morvauns police interview but felt his chest tighten with anxiety as it approached eleven his mouth suddenly dry with still no answer back from haveling jac wondered if finally his luck was about to run out no i told you jac im happy to help out and send the email no morningafter second thoughts none but if youre fishing for reasons why someone you just met would help out with something momentous like this well you know its not often we get a chance to change things in this life i mean really make a difference and helping to save a mans life must surely come close to the top of that poll if this works i can look at durrants face in future newscasts and think smugly to myself hey i actually helped save that mans life i made a difference for once i can understand that but how about you after last night no morningafter second thoughts none because you know its not often we get a chance to really make a difference with things in this life a chuckle so the spicy dish went down okay and im not talking here about the jambalaya a treat except that it left my legs a bit weak heading back to my place well at least you didnt have far to go if you couldnt make it a dozen paces then i was rougher on you than i thought nelm waved one hand indicating for vic farrelia to wind forward to the next conversation theyd already played the tape once this was just a highlights rerun so that explained why he hadnt seen the girl going into mcelroys building that night or why there was no trace of her belongings in his apartment she was his neighbour and with the earlier call from that other girl it certainly looked like mcelroys love life was more complicated than most as the tape came to mcelroys conversation with rodriguez i gotta get back on communicationroom duty to receive it also to send out those last few sample emails from jd nelm suddenly sat forward the final pieces of the puzzle falling into place on that first taped call mcelroys new girlfriend had suggested someone else sending an email now she was doing it herself but still he was no closer to knowing why an email from josh durrant held such a crucial key to keeping his father alive a bloodless coup all over in less than twenty minutes jac shouldnt have worried from the outset it was clear that the police evidence was slim and while with a good deal of posturing and dark innuendo lieutenant pyrford tried to make more of it than it was the crunch came when he passed across alvira jardines forged passport do you recognize it now no i dont morvaun said indignantly his glasses perched on the end of his nose as he inspected it and you should be ashamed of yoselves tryin to link a piece of shit like this with my handicraft an eightyearol could do a better job morvaun pointed out its many flaws and failings as pyrfords jaw twitched if youd taken the trouble to study in detail any o my jac stopped morvaun there before he incriminated himself on any past cases more congratulations from langfranc lucks still holding with jaspar by the looks of it but it did little to make jac feel good quell the uneasy feeling that some day soon it must surely run out and that each time he got away unscathed merely increased the chances of a fall jac finally got a call back from haveling just before lunch forty minutes after his return from the fifth district stationhouse agreeing to let rodriguez back into his seat in the communication room later that same day sometime between threethirty and four jac left his office immediately to call alaysha from his cellphone she had to pick up molly around that time so shed drop into a nearby internet cafe theres one a couple of blocks away on palmyra street netwave ive used it a few times before probably fourthirty by the time i get there thats fine aside from haste jac didnt mention the other reason he was keen on the suggestion it pushed things still further away from any connection with him he explained that her initial email to rodriguez should be as if josh durrant wanted the last few emails to his father mistakenly deleted sent back to him to check on something that way hopefully nothing will seem untoward with the monitoring guard when rodriguez sends those samples out to you as a guide then send back the main email when youre ready itll probably be twenty minutes to half an hour after the samples arrive before i send it i want to make sure to get this right ill go to their cafe section with molly or maybe round the corner for a while in between alaysha explained that netwave had dedicated email numbers for each computer to save people the time of setting up personal email accounts so tell rodriguez not to send me anything else meanwhile because ill probably be sending that final email from another machine okay will do jac tucked his head deeper into his shoulder as the passing traffic got louder and once again alaysha thanks for helping good luck then he phoned rodriguez and after the usual long pause of getting routed through to the phone at the end of the cell block kept his instructions ambiguous were on for fourthirty one email incoming with the address for the samples we discussed to go out to and then the main return twenty minutes or so later okay good going counselor catch yer later sorry to trouble you mrs durrant my names jim whitman from the prisoners liaison committee its just a general survey but i wondered if i might ask a few questions about what contact you and your son have had with your husband lawrence durrant while hes been incarcerated at libreville prison well i suppose so nelm could tell that she was hesitant guarded so he kept the first few questions very general type and regularity of contact without homing in on either her son or emails and when was your last prison visit nine ten months ago now any other contact since just one phone call about six or seven weeks after that visit and the rest has been my son joshua sending emails regular email contact well i suppose you could say twenty or more emails over the past year but thats stopped now too for a while how long ago did that stop oh a couple of months back i suppose any particular reason for it stopping by the pause and heavy intake of breath from the other end nelm knew that hed stepped too far look if this has got something to do with my husbands lawyer calling the other day trying to persuade me by coming at me from another direction youre wasting your time lawyer im sorry mrs durrant youve lost me we work completely independently we dont know anything about your husbands lawyer visiting nor indeed have any contact with him im sorry no need to be but youve intrigued me now mrs durrant why was your husbands lawyer visiting and if you dont mind me saying you sound somewhat troubled by it nelm felt a tingle of anticipation as he realized he was poised on a knifes edge shed either open up or step back completely in which case hed get nothing and be left wondering but with another long breath she started to relate jac mcelroys recent visit falteringly at first but gaining momentum with her rising indignation while nelm made a couple of cryptic notes at his end a slow smile creasing his face as the final pieces of the puzzle fell into place hed struck gold big time and couldnt wait to get off the line to share his treasure with roche believe me mrs durrant you or your son dont have to make any contact with your husband that you dont want to nelm assured and his lawyer has no right to try and persuade you to do so regardless of the reasons i i suppose i shouldnt be too hard on him she mellowed as she became reflective hes only doing his job i suppose i mean its not his fault that larrys suddenly decided he wants to throw in the towel no i suppose not except these lawyers dont give much pause for thought on whether they should be too hard on us when they present their bills francine durrant joined him in a brief chuckle before asking and who did you say you were again jim whitman prisoners liaison committee and i thank you kindly for your time today mrs durrant youve been most helpful are yo done there yet friggy just signing in now aaaand were there all systems live and running okay man okay make room for josh let im do his stuff as uncomfortable as joshua durrant felt because of the neighbourhood and company he was in and what he was about to do he had to admit they were going out of their way to make him feel at ease ellis calpar and his crew treating him like royalty it felt totally alien reminded him he was on unfamiliar ground and so added to his anxiety but even so he could easily get used to it the neighbourhood was on the bad side of st claude close to the railyards though the house itself looked decent enough and a good size the computer was in the garage but there was no car there only a couple of mountain bikes and a ton of junk tvs stereos ghettoblasters microwaves car radios cellphones there were at least two of each item but with the predominance of car radios and cellphones more than a dozen in each case joshua caught on that it wasnt because friggys father was an electrical repair man this was probably stolen gear aside from friggy there were two others from calpars regular crew along with all the junk about all the garage could take friggy leant over and with a couple of taps got the email box up for him joshua sat staring at it for a second then with a quick look over his shoulder brought his hands up to the keyboard step back everyone give im some space ellis ordered this is mean tbe private remember joshua took a final deep breath to compose himself this was one of those important moments like exams or making sure he was nice to his moms new boyfriend or when you got passed the basketball just before the hoop and the whole school was watching it had to be the right tone and straight from the heart but without giving away that he knew his father wanted to die only one chance to get it right rodriguez hissed yessss under his breath and went to make a clenched fist salute as the email came through but not too high in case nielsen the monitoring guard with his eyes fixed to his computer screen at the end of the room paid him too much attention but his fist hardly got above chest height as he thought about its timing then he read it again and looked at the email address oh shiiiiii the clenched fist was abruptly dropped he looked towards the eight phones on the far wall separated by glass sidescreens and nodded towards nielsen quick call to make okay nielsen mumbled something indiscernible without hardly looking up and gave a begrudging nod it took alaysha reyner only eight minutes to get the email from joshua durrant half right but from that point on it was slower going despite three more drafts and numerous small changes it was still no more than seventy per cent there one hundred per cent right was starting to look elusive shed hopefully got the overall tone and phraseology right from joshuas last few emails but then she reminded herself that thered been a long gap from the last email and also durrant was now that much closer to his execution date after a brief explanation and apology for the lack of contact it should without doubt be weightier and more emotional than the past emails after all this might be one of the last times joshua durrant would have contact with his father alaysha dabbed at a stray tear as she became deeper immersed in the email and what it represented molly at her side was looking concerned are you okay mommy yes im okay honey im fine she gave molly a reassuring hug though now alaysha started to worry that she might have overcooked it too much emotion not enough she continued juggling to try and get the balance right jac found himself looking more and more at his watch as the afternoon progressed all of it happening out there in cyberspace between the city and libreville prison and now having set it all in motion the realization that he no longer had control over it everything hanging in the balance durrants life jacs career too if it went wrong and to make matters worse hed suddenly found himself facing a flurry of work to assist john langfranc with a trial preparation jac didnt want to let langfranc down but he was finding it increasingly hard to focus as it approached fourthirty langfranc understanding as ever had only asked once hows it going but he couldnt help noticing langfrancs look when hed returned after disappearing without warning for twenty minutes to make his calls outside to set everything in motion the minutes dragged even more excruciatingly as fourthirty passed jac rubbed at his chest tension was knotted so tight there that it felt like indigestion he took a deep breath to try and ease it pushed again to immerse himself in langfrancs case if nothing else as a distraction and at some stage he was partly successful his notemaking on a pad at last beginning to flow because when his cellphone rang at pm with rodriguez call it made him jump slightly we got that email through or should i say an email from josh but theres somethin that worries me about it jac felt such a rush of elation and ebbing of tension at rodriguez first words that he only halfabsorbed what followed whoa whoa back up a minute what is it exactly that worries you about it like i said first thing is that it arrived only fourteen minutes after i sent the samples whereas i thought itd be twenty minutes or so second thing is it said a couple o things that didnt relate at all to those earlier samples unless that is shes into makin really big not to mention brave leaps omagination and third and main thing is it didnt come from the same email address where i sent em or anythin like it how different are they rodriguez read them out and jac had to agree it definitely wasnt from the same internet cafe and its personalization friggy bore no relation to alayshas name or what they were doing that day are you thinking what im thinking jac voiced even though we didnt think he could yeah thats what i thought immediately i saw it the main man himself jac left his sentence unfinished in case of prying ears and no doubt for the same reason rodriguez said man instead of boy in case it was too obvious but they were both clearly leaning the same way that somehow against the odds joshua durrant himself had sent it jesus as the knockon implication hit jac it brought him to his feet that means if she still id better get hold of her before he was still trapped in a cycle of unfinished sentences exactly my thoughts counselor wed be in an overkill situation thats why i called you straight off you got some pretty fast shoeshufflin to do yeah instantly jac cut off he called alayshas cellphone but it went straight into her service providers message service shed obviously switched it off so that she wasnt disturbed while preparing the email alaysha if you pick this up in time something unexpected has cropped up so for gods sake dont send that email and phone me as soon as you get this message he dialled to get the number for netwave and took the option of being put straight through jac looked anxiously at his watch already three minutes over by her shortest estimate six or seven to go by her longest but as he started explaining what he wanted he noticed john langfranc looking over at him again jac quickly averted his eyes to his desk as if in concentration hed no doubt cut a picture of perfect panic the past few minutes cant miss her mixed race real beauty somewhere between beyonce and mariah carey and shes with a young girl im sorry sir the computers are all upstairs and most people head straight up there so often i dont get a good look at them she said shed be there now and its really important that i get hold of her could you go up and see if shes there for me i uh its pretty irregular sir and real difficult right now im on my own here and theres already people backing up waiting on their lattes i just cant break away at this moment lattes she said shed be having coffee for a while as jac spoke he tapped out a quick message to alayshas last email address she said shed shift to another computer but it was worth a try maybe shes still with you in the cafe mmmmm no sorry nobody here right now fitting that description then she must be upstairs he was getting desperate please im begging you its absolutely vital that i get hold of her a matter of life and death im sure it is sir but if i break off right now and my manager finds out itll be my death his voice drifted for a second as he addressed someone in the background yes i know i know coming right up he sighed heavily as he came back to jac look give me a couple of minutes to serve these two people then ill go up thats the best i can offer okay thanks jac in turn eased his own sigh of relief but hanging on the line listening to the background clatter and hiss of the espresso machine as the seconds ticked by jac felt his nerves too begin to bubble and steam if alaysha had already sent the email they were sunk with the one just arrived the monitoring guard would know immediately it was false the last chance of saving durrant gone and no doubt the deathknell for jacs legal career too if it was connected back to him jac looked up with a jolt as john langfranc broke into his thoughts something wrong jac put one hand over the mouthpiece shrugging with a tightlipped grimace im trying desperately to hunt down a lap dancer langfranc raised an eyebrow cant you wait until after work to see them like the rest of us jac forced a conciliatory smile this one unfortunately is just about to do something that she shouldnt langfranc kept the eyebrow arched i thought thats exactly what they were paid to do every day things they shouldnt jacs smile was weaker this time still the empty background clatter on the phone the rest of the world going on as normal oblivious probably it was already too late and all these obstacles were for a reason he was being given the message not to be so foolhardy and push things just let durrant go where he wanted to be with his god jac sighed and closed his eyes briefly in submission before looking up again at langfranc sorry john i havent been much use to you so far this afternoon but as soon as ive got this sorted out ill jac broke off holding one hand towards langfranc alayshas voice yep nice to catch up after so long but one of the reasons for my call now tom you know that envelope i sent you to safekeep all those years back only to be opened in the event of your death have to say leonard thought it was pretty morbid at the time the same the same well i need you to send it back to me you dont need to safeguard it any more the second call was in much the same vein but as it came to truelles third call all made within minutes of each other roche sat forward paying more attention you already got a note of that address he quizzed nelm know who it is old colleague of his from new york now lives upstate in binghamton not that much imagination his lawyer and a cousin for the first insurance policies now he trades for an old work colleague and roche let the sentence hang as the tape rolled on to truelles fourth call but nelm felt immediately more uncomfortable the fourth made two hours later possibly because of some small time zone difference was far vaguer he had little clue where it might be yeah sure buddy no problem just send it to the same mailbox number thanks chris i appreciate it hows the weather right now in the frozen north not too bad actually not that cold hard weather hasnt hit yet and real pretty autumn gold on the trees everywhere you look when you get so as you start feeling sicker than your clients you should head up here and pay me a visit get some fresh air for a change christmas is particularly nice nelm let it play to the end watching roches face cloud is that it roche quizzed no address town or even a country just a mailbox which we dont even have the number of and chris fraid so all we know from frozen north is that its either close to the canadian border or more likely canada itself or maybe alaska well that really narrows it down roche waved one arm effusively do you want to head up there with your snow shoes and start looking or should we call on americas finest whove been searching for bin laden for the last few fucking years nelm nodded in resignation his face flushing roche rarely swore we just have to hope for a break hope that they speak again and we get more detail roche raised an eyebrow but as you and i well know that might not happen in fact probably wont truelle will just send his envelope and they might not speak again for six months or a year maybe longer and we dont have that sort of time weve only got thirtyfour days i know i know nelm closed his eyes for a second in submission ill think on how i can push things on like i did with the lawyer i grant you roche shrugged raising one hand you did well there this was how he liked nelm the puppy dog seeking approval rather than posturing and cocksure kidding himself he had anything like equal say on their best next move and for the same reason control roche loved what nelm had just laid in his grasp the option of destroying jac mcelroys career at the drop of a hat but the last thing he wanted to do was let nelm know that although we still have to worry that if we get rid of mcelroy clive beaton might simply put someone else in his place and someone that might be more able and competent yeah but surely once durrant gets to know the email is false nelm pressed its going to be gameon again with him wanting to die and the clemency bid and all the lawyers with it then go straight out the window true and its nice to know that durrants finally got the message of what everyone wants from him roche smiled thinly but it faded just as quickly however the problem is that in achieving that wed also show our full hand and apart from the legal lines crossed in taping mcelroy not to mention phoning francine durrant and posing as a prison liaison officer some awkward questions might arise of just why we were doing all of that so if its okay with you id like to give it just a tad more thought before deciding the best way to proceed nelm felt stung by the meeting with roche hed gone there with such high hopes the situation with truelles insurance policies eighty per cent there and the whole caboodle about durrants apparent deathwish and the fake emails uncovered what the fuck more did roche want nelm popped back a blue pill from his glove compartment and pointed his car towards the french quarter he felt he had to take his frustrations out somewhere and right now misha seemed as good a bet as any nelm had been married once a disastrous three years when he was only twentythree no children though his wife blamed her two miscarriages on their arguments and his verbal abuse he had never hit her since then hed taken solace at a number of cat houses in the city the age gap between the girls and himself becoming ever wider though in the last few years hed managed to narrow it down to a handful of regular favourites of whom misha at madame bs was top of the list a bubbly curvy africanfrench mix with wild red hair and nipples like mahogany door stops not your normal friday night then madame b greeted him no nelm kept things short and sweet as he paid and was led to a bedroom by misha he couldnt wait to get down to business couldnt wait to be inside her even cutting short halfway through their normal ritual of her slowly undressing him and kneeling before him allowing only a halfdozen languorous slides between her lips before throwing her back on the bed and entering her as she felt the urgency of his thrusts misha commented someone lit a fire on your tail tonight damn right damn right and as he felt her responding felt that her gasps were somehow stronger than before he remembered from a couple of past visits that she enjoyed mild asphyxiation that it seemed to heighten the sensations even more he raised one hand to her throat gently pressing oh ohhh yes yesss misha closed her eyes in abandon hissing through clenched teeth as her breath became shorter though at some stage it became roche in his grip and he started pressing harder harder want to give it a tad more thought do you oblivious to the fact that mishas gasps of pleasure had suddenly turned to ones of panic her eyes were wide and pleading and she started beating at nelms shoulders and arms but nelm had already shut his eyes lost in reverie that it was roche beneath him the tortured breathing convincing him all the more that it was him or maybe youd like to put on your snow shoes and search up there yourself with your stump legs and emphysema youd be lucky to get five miles from the fucking canadian border squeezing harder harder a tingle of pleasure rising as he felt the last life ebbing from roche the beating at his arms becoming weaker the breathing was just short strangled bursts now almost nonexistent nelm kept up the pressure felt one hand now clutching at his hair in desperation the other nelms eyes opened sharply with the sting of the fingernails digging in and raking down his back suddenly snapped back to reality of who was beneath him saw mishas eyes stark and bulging with fear her face starting to turn blue but he was too close felt his orgasm snaking up the back of his legs and so he held her there for his last few thrusts only letting go as he came his ragged tortured breathing finally matching hers misha rolled quickly away coughing and spluttering for her first full breaths it sounded for a moment as if she was going to vomit and when shed finally got her breathing back to near normal she glared at him whats wrong wit you you halfkilled me there sorry bad day at work nelm forced a lame smile yeah well next time you have a bad day dont come seeing me in fact bad day or not dont come seeing me again yer hear nelm nodded dolefully frustrations all around and so when he got back to his apartment he was pleased to hear the message from vic farrelia particularly when he phoned back and gained more detail nelm drove straight over to hear the latest tape offering from mcelroys phone line his trademark sly smile firmly back in place as it finished roche wouldnt be able to delay any longer in making a move against mcelroy freedom oh freedom thats just some people talking mike coultaine looked wistfully across the city marina and the mississippi river beyond from the back deck of his cabin cruiser so thats what durrants after these days he doesnt ask much it wasnt a straightout request jac filled in the background with durrants initial deathwish although now ive finally convinced him to put in a plea he has little interest in that possibly extended life still behind bars it only has appeal to him if he might gain freedom either now or in the near future so as part of putting in clemency i promised oooh promised thats something a lawyer should never do coultaines teasing smile faded as he looked at jac directly but if candaret turns down that appeal which he probably will given recent history were talking now rather than near future how long left thirtytwo days coultaine looked out pensively across the marina again three days and everything had changed alaysha had come on the line exuberant that shed finally got the tone right with the email so when jac had told her no need now to send it joshua durrant had already sent one shed immediately felt deflated youve got no idea how long i sweated over that jac mcelroy no idea and then in protest didnt speak to him for twentyfour hours before finally softening durrant too let him stew and when after two days he still hadnt heard anything he put in a call to rodriguez i tell you counselor he was like catsgotthecream with that email from josh but you know what larrys like proud stubborn so it dont surprise me he hasnt called you i think its gonna be down to you givin him a little nudge nudge quickly became push with jac informing durrant that this was absolutely his last visit to try and convince him to put in for clemency when i walk away from here now thats it so if theres anything anything that might make you want to continue clinging to life nows the time to speak up it was as far as he dared go he couldnt risk durrant catching on that he knew about joshuas email but still durrant was guarded closedhanded before we get into that how you getting on with gaining me freedom from this rathole made any moves yet ive already spoken to mike coultaine your original lawyer jac had lied got more background from the trial and appeal but youre going to have to help me too give me some good reasons why you think you might be innocent something to fight with durrant flinched at the think you might be a sudden reminder that he couldnt know for sure and his face clouded as he fought to explain though maybe it was the darkness of the images still haunting him as much as lack of clarity jac made brief notes and nodded knowingly at some points as if they might be significant and perhaps they would be when he finally got to speak to coultaine jac looked back over his notes as he finished shaking his head i want to help lawrence i really do but all of this is going to take time time which we just dont have and theres another reason why we need that extra time jac had pondered long and hard whether to tell durrant about the anonymous emails had finally decided that he had to at some point now it might be just the thing to tip the balance durrant was lost in thought for a moment a long moment a wry smile finally surfaced though uncertainly as if the revelation had painted an extra confusing layer to his thoughts that would take him a while to filter anything through clearly nice to know someone else out there is thinking about me thought you were the only one he asked a few questions for clarification jac stressing that while it could be a hoaxer or could be genuine again it would no doubt take time to find out which time which we dont have right now durrant looked down thoughtfully at that point was slow in looking back up again okay counselor there is something thats given me some hope as you call it so bring on whatever paperwork you have to ill sign it secretive as ever durrant didnt elaborate on what might have given him fresh hope but equally jac didnt pursue it was eager to tie up the details before durrant changed his mind but as jac shook durrants hand in parting durrant reached up and gripped his forearm tight promise me counselor on a bible if thats what it takes for you to really mean it after ive signed these papers you wont just forget about me and leave me here to rot youll do all you can to get me out i promise jac felt the strength in durrants grip saw the fiery intent in his eyes because theres somebody ive been apart from already far too long and i dont want to spend the next ten to fifteen with us only being able to clasp fingertips through the holes in a glass screen jac had phoned mike coultaine when he got back to his apartment but still now he found himself swallowing back a lump in his throat as he thought about the promise hed made and what it signified to durrant coultaines gaze across the marina telling him just how distant and out of reach making good on that promise might be you can actually see adelay roches yacht from here coultaine said pointing that gin palace on the end of the second quay i see jac wondered if thats why coultaine had arranged to meet him here at the same time give him a feel for the victims family never moves far roche either has parties on board so that everyone in the marina can see him or at most it goes no more than a few miles offshore always still in sight of the refineries that paid for it coultaine smiled tightly makes this thing look like a bathtub jac cast a quick eye around coultaines boat ft bayliner more than big enough for coultaines favourite pastime of sports fishing he seemed to have slipped fully into the lifestyle too blue deck shoes khaki shorts and denim shirt with his greying brown hair tied back in a ponytail a far cry from his croppedhaired pinstripesuited days defending durrant you know at one point in the appeal i really thought we were getting somewhere coultaine looked keenly at jac for a moment before his gaze drifted again across the marina and the river beyond inspiration for distant thoughts the steady timeless surge of the mississippi pushing them on truelle the pyschiatrists testimony and everything surrounding durrants initial confession was starting to look shaky i mean he still had gaps in his memory about so many other things after his car accident so how could anyone be sure that his recall about what happened that night was accurate but his depth of detail of the events that night with jessica roche things that only the killer could possibly have known killed it if youll excuse the expression coultaine forced an awkward smile that and the dna evidence jac nodded before meeting coultaine hed gone through the trial bundle again to get the sequence clear in his mind the police working a general suspect list which didnt include durrant his car accident four months after the murder and his resultant partial amnesia and recovered memory sessions with truelle in which details of the murder emerged then the final damning dna evidence pretty conclusive from what i saw in the trial papers yep four blood spots on one of durrants jackets with a hundred per cent match with jessica roches dna found at his house straight after his confession and on top witness identification even though it was from a hundred yards away at night coultaine shrugged so however much we might have cast doubt on durrants confession due to the fractured state of his memory at the time we were never able to shift from the jurys or the appeal judges mind the fact that durrant must have been there coultaine looked at jac with his head lowered eyes lifted the look a judge might give above his pincenez and if you dont mind me saying i think youll find exactly the same but if you want to give it a shot because of the promise youve made to durrant or whatever ill gladly give you some names and pointers thanks thatd be helpful though jac wasnt sure what he was thanking him for it looked a hopeless quest jac started making notes as coultaine related the key points and contact names his memory at times stretched as it leapt the elevenyear gap lieutenant patrick pat coyne thats it he headed the investigation hes probably long retired by now he was over fifty at the time but he had a brighteyed assistant frier or friar something like that good chance hed still be around truelle youve already got and we had a psychiatrist countering for defence whose name for the moment escapes me ill have to phone you later with that as coultaine finished he asked whats durrant given you that might help fight his corner he said that he cant imagine hed have broken the promise to his wife not to reoffend especially with their son just born that old turkey and he has doubts about the jacket with jessica roches bloodstains says almost certainly hed have worn one of two other jackets for a job oh and the gun used hes pretty sure it wasnt one of his doesnt recall it at all the jacket hes mentioned before except then he just wasnt sure but the guns something new at the time he simply didnt recognize it but then he didnt have recall of any gun hed had with him on past robberies so at least his memory appears to be freeing up some makes a change most peoples memories fade with the years his seems to be getting clearer coultaine grimaced but its still all supposition larry thinks this larry believes that if durrants memory reached the stage where he could actually remember where he was that fateful night apart from at the roche residence drinking playing pool seeing a mistress whatever because all his wife remembers was that he was out then youd be getting somewhere jac nodded pensively anything you remember from the investigation whereby there might have been another eyewitness that never came forward no not that i recall but thats something you could ask coyne or his sidekick when you speak to them i suppose its possible that if someone else was seen say by the woman walking her dog but never came forward it might not have featured in the police report if they decided it wasnt relevant but its unlikely coultaine shrugged then looked at jac more keenly why do you ask i was there at the time jac passed across the best of the three photos from the twelve enhancements souchelle had sent him and as coultaine examined them at moments turning them as if for a better angle jac explained about the emails his close call with catching up with the sender at internetional and the thought processes hed run through with langfranc coultaine pursed his lips shaking his head after a moment no cant think of anything from the police reports that might fit in with that he handed the photos back and cant say the face rings any bells either from what little i can see there i know best i could get jac sighed his disappointment when the photos first arrived mirrored in coultaines face in that moment a hundred per cent improvement from the cam shots but still far from enough for identification not even worth trying for an anyone recognize this man posting with local newspapers coultaine was lost in thought for a moment his gaze drifting again across the river for what its worth id throw my bet in with you and john langfranc there hoaxer friend or anticapital punishment campaigner without doubt look the prime suspects but the murderer himself theres a thought coultaine raised a brow have you told durrant yet yeah but just the other day i stressed that it could well be a hoaxer so as not to falsely build up his hopes and for the same reason i didnt show durrant the photos or mention the possibility that it could be the murderer thought that might be just too confusing for him at this stage not to mention cruel if they didnt finally come forward yeah coultaine nodded grimacing tautly confusing and cruel pretty apt words given that durrants starting to have doubts as to whether he actually committed the murder and still cant clearly recall half his life from that time a heavier mood suddenly hung over them a cooler breeze for a moment drifting in off the mississippi as if in sympathy though jac couldnt tell whether the same thoughts had gripped coultaine in that instant durrant confused memory fractured and as the days wound rapidly down towards his execution and his doubts grew about his guilt a bolt comes out of the blue from someone claiming that he didnt do it though cruellest fate of all even if they were real they might well not reveal themselves in time to save his life coultaine introduced a fresh tone but you know with durrant now remembering more that could well be the key hed started to recall more even by the time of the appeal i checked out a couple of pool buddies then hed suddenly recalled that might have been able to give him an alibi coultaine held up one palm didnt head anywhere in the end but now who knows if you could find that one person to corroborate that he was somewhere else that night then youd have struck gold youd have something solid to counter the dna evidence true jac cast his eyes down for a second before looking up absently at half a dozen geese flurrying briefly in midriver before taking flight again dna whatever else he might come up with they were always going to be facing that final stone wall but hey dna these days coultaine said as he caught jacs expression million miles from where it was then practically its first days now with a bit more analysis and tweaking here and there you could easily get lucky and be able to cast doubt on the original findings and thats probably all youd need to do cast doubt but jac knew that coultaine was saying it mainly to lift his spirits it was far more likely that it would simply cement the original conclusion he was kidding himself if he thought he might be able to prove durrants innocence and worst thing was that durrant had so little recall of the events of eleven years ago he was kidding himself too had no idea if he was innocent or not nelm was having one last coffee before heading over to roches with the latest tape offering when vic farrelia rang another call just came in same guy as the other day coultaine yeah coultaine nelm checked his watch okay ill be right over he downed one final gulp put his foot down hard for the two miles to farrelias stakeout on perdido street and signalled farrelia to hit play as soon as he walked into the room got that name of the defence psychiatrists for you ormdern gregory ormdern and coynes assistants name is friele dave friele thanks i appreciate it but if i were you id see truelle first get the sequence right for how it was then prosecution case then counter arguments he in fact was top of my list because it seems to me that everything kickstarted with the taped admission in truelles session nelm signalled for farrelia to stop the tape he didnt want to be late hed play the rest at roches more than enough to hang mcelroy already he thought banging his hand against the steering wheel on his way over clenching and unclenching his fists on his knees as he patiently sat through roche listening to what hed already heard on the two calls as if he couldnt wait to unfurl them and get them around mcelroys neck i daresay though its not going to be easy jolting elevenyearold memories because like i said the other day while durrants memory might have improved and filled in some of the gaps others will have faded i know but i promised which you said a lawyer should never do looks like im about to find out why uneasy laugh from mcelroy im finding myself torn on this i dont want to give in too easily throw in the towel before ive started just because it looks too daunting and hopeless to try and prove durrants innocence and on the other hand i dont want to mislead him and falsely build up his hopes he deserves better than that well im sure larry durrants happy to know he still has friends out there batting on his behalf and i say that for my part too i wish i could have done more for him at the time so its nice to see that he appears to be in good hands thanks oh and for whatever it might help ill do a support letter to go along with the clemency plea character reference durrant making good with his selfeducation that type of thing along with the questionable ethics of executing someone who still doesnt have possession of the faculties to know if their guilty or innocent maybe the first time thats happened you want to check the records on that spin it out for even more mileage if you can when are you putting it in day after tomorrow straight after durrant has signed it ill make sure to get the letter over to you by then roche waved a hand for nelm to stop the tape silence stone silence they were in roches terrace room an over sized conservatory replete with white wicker furniture palm trees and a white cockatoo in a sixfoot high moroccanstyle white cage in one corner to complete the image roche was wearing a white robe with his initials emblazoned in red on one breast pocket the initials were the only splash of red in the room though it was probably the most tasteful room in the house nelm reminded himself the rest was oppressively baroque with gilded statues of angels and cherubs everywhere red velvet curtains on every window and red and gold silk draped over practically every outstretched limb or other protruding appendage of the angels and cherubs nelm hated it with a vengeance it reminded him of a cross between a funeral parlour and a s whorehouse the only sounds were the gentle hum of the pool filter beyond the glass and the occasional caw of the cockatoo though that too seemed to have fallen silent with the stopping of the tape last thing we want is mcelroy seeing truelle roche commented exactly my sentiment thought nelm but all he said was yeah probably wouldnt find out anything but its the sort of thing that might just hit the final panic button with truelle just what we dont need right now another yeah nelm contemplating roche coolly evenly after the other day he wasnt going to put his head in the noose and try and push roche this way or that only to be shot down in flames again so hed decided to say little or nothing just let roche get there on his own and we certainly dont want durrant getting frisky starting to remember things he shouldnt certainly dont hed noticed roche flinch at that juncture on the tape whiledurrants memory might have improved and filled in some of the gaps roche was anxious now as it hit him for the first time that he wasnt getting much feedback he looked at nelm expectantly as if hoping hed elaborate but nelm just kept the same cool stare straight through roche youre on your own this time fuckhead and uh well looks like we cant hold back any longer from taking action looks like it nelm relishing roches discomfort as he noticed some sweat beads break out above his top lip though it appears were spoilt for choice there small chuckle from roche that fought for bravado but failed his breathing suddenly more laboured destroy his career or as you so aptly put it a few column inches alongside raoul ferrer nelm didnt say anything simply shrugged one hand of roches clutched at his thigh as he struggled with the decision faint sweatbeads now on his forehead too which route do you think we should go he pressed you know i always leave those sort of decisions to you nelm smiled tightly refusing to be drawn this time he didnt need to say anything the tapes had done it all for him hardly any options left now for roche the silence heavy palpable nelm suddenly aware of something he hadnt noticed before gently playing in the background like the soft nondescript piped music in an elevator an instrumental version of fernandos hideaway weighing up not just the best option but one which will ensure no possible links back obviously nelm shrugged roches hand rose briefly to rub at his temple before returning to his lap a small nervous tic appearing at the corner of his mouth his breathing rattled faintly as it rose and fell and of course the best timing another shrug from nelm roches mouth dry his fat pink tongue snaking out to moisten it his hand clenched back on his knee starting to tremble slightly but nelm just held the same stare steadily on roche wallowing in every small nuance of his discomfort while on his own knee he started to drum a steady rhythm with his fingers as he waited impatiently on roches final pearls of wisdom as frank sinatra invited librevilles inmates to come fly with him and try some exotic booze in far bombay rodriguez might have swayed to it if he hadnt heard it a hundred times before now with all privileges returned rodriguez had his daily minutes back on the prison radio alternating between a am and a pm slot with another prisoner tyrone sommer or tireddrone insomnia as hed been nicknamed an exparttime dj from a small station in shreveport who played far too much country music for the inmates liking sad and lamenting at the best of times the crops have all failed my wifes done left me and my dog just died it was noticed that the prison suicide rate was far higher during and just after sommers slots rodriguez sessions were decidedly more upbeat latin reggae calypso rock latinjazz with carlos santana his alltime favourite but over sixty per cent of their respective programmes and playlists were controlled by haveling prison activity announcements for the day and evening which had been the original purpose of setting up the radio slots followed by uplifting religious music then interspersed with their own playlist choices havelings favourite music swing songs from musicals and bacharach within rodriguez and sommers respective playlist choices haveling also wielded a heavy guiding hand no heavy rock nothing too aggressive and rousing which left only santanas lighter instrumental tracks and nothing which might have sexual violent or drugs connotations which discounted most of the rest of rock music with swing songs from musicals and bacharach rodriguez had a far freer hand yet even there haveling had presented them with a list of preferred tunes he wanted playing xnumber of times a week of which sinatras come fly with me was one and when rodriguez had studied the list in more detail one day fly me to the moon girl from ipanema somewhere over the rainbow bali hai do you know the way to san jose beyond the sea darrens mack the knife was banned he couldnt help noticing that many of them had overt themes of freedom or faraway places places that most of the libreville inmates would never get to see perhaps they were indeed havelings favourite tunes or perhaps he was slyly rubbing salt in the wounds of their incarceration like most things with haveling you never knew but you stepped outside of havelings recommended playlist at your peril he even stopped me playin moonriver for fucks sake rodriguez once complained to larry thought the line ill be crossing you in style tonight might give people the idea of escapin across the river it was great to have all privileges back but now that he and larry were again in general circulation the risks from tally and his crew were far greater the initial guarded warning looks had now become icy and openly hostile as if saying you got lucky a couple of times but that aint gonna be the case for much longer on one occasion tally had even tapped his watch to make the message clear tally had been thwarted made to look a fool and that was something rodriguez could barely remember happening before let alone twice librevilles corridors and shower rooms or even open areas with the right distraction like the canteen or tv room were going to be far more dangerous places from here on in he and larry were going to have to be extravigilant watching their backs rodriguez leant forward to the mike as sinatra came to an end and thats ol blue eyes there croonin about places thatll be all too familiar to all you wellheeled jetsetters here at libreville just lay back on your bunk and fly fly away but now its time for a touch of my main man carlos santana rodriguez reached for the record and cued it samba pa ti played today for a very special lady and not to be confused with samba party a swedish film which was tradin at some high prices a few months back as risque as rodriguez dared get he sat back and closed his eyes letting the softly soaring guitar and mellow background bongo suffuse through him he was ten days late playing the tune but then hed been in the infirmary at the time better late than never he thought wiping a gentle tear from the corner of one eye while carlos santanas guitar sailed and cried through the concrete caverns of libreville prison larry durrant sat up on his bed he knew what the tune meant to rodriguez hed played it at his mothers funeral along with her own favourite besame mucho four years ago now late fall not far from this date and every year since on the same day rodriguez had also played the tune various other times over the prison radio but with the mention of for a very special lady larry knew that today was significant rodriguez had taken his mothers death hard coming just fifteen months after his incarceration hed partly blamed himself larry could imagine rodriguez in the radio room now tears streaming silently down his cheeks then as soon as it finished playing hed be back to his lively bubbly self again lifting everyones spirits if not his own larry wondered what francine and josh would play at his own funeral marvin gayes whats going on sly stones family affair both songs a decade ahead of his teens and so long past now he doubted that franny even remembered his favourite tunes any more although he had no idea what joshs tastes in music were either maybe something he could broach in future emails but the thought had already mugged him deep inside without warning too long apart and a single tear rolled down one cheek at the lost years nobody rushing to work that morning paid much attention to the man in a lightweight grey suit entering the car park on st charles street and exiting ten minutes later he appeared just one of many hurrying to work having parked their cars except the man didnt head towards an office he went fifty yards along the street to the nearest kiosk to make a call its all done great and whats the best point eight to eleven miles in but i wouldnt leave it beyond that okay got it eight to eleven nelm clicked off and dialled straight out again with another anxious check of his watch jac started reading through draft five six hed lost count of durrants clemency plea please no more changes no time and coultaines support letter which had arrived forty minutes earlier by messenger hed managed to give only a light skim though the postscript had leapt out at him thought you might find the enclosed of interest found it amongst my old papers itll save you asking truelle for a copy remember everything started with this jac twirled the cassette tape briefly in one hand before bringing his attention back to durrants plea on his computer screen but found his eyes drifting back to the tape at intervals finally the distraction too much halfway through reading what he hoped was the final definitive version he leapt up grabbed a cassette player from a nearby shelf slotted it in and resumed reading again as soon as he pressed play session fourteen seventeenth of august nineteenninetytwo subject lawrence tyler durrant one of truelles sessions with durrant there was a minutes preamble settling durrant down before truelle hit any real topic durrants heavy drinking the night of the accident you mentioned feeling guilty about that was that because of what resulted the accident or the drinking itself mainly the drinking because id promised franny yer know to stop and do you remember drinking other times after youd promised to stop or was it just this one time there were a fair few other times i recall all around that same time i was goin through a real bad cycle man didnt know what i was doing half the time and why was that or didnt you know that either oh i knew all right knew all too well thats why i tried to bury it burn it from my mind with as much rum and whisky as i could lay my hands on but however hard i tried it stayed with me i jus couldnt shake it shake what lawrence more guilt thats what durrants breathing suddenly more laboured more guilt because that wasnt the only promise id broken to franny guilt over what lawrence what other promise i i its difficult durrants breathing hissing hard i know but perhaps if you unburden whatever it is youll be able to break the cycle listening to durrants fractured and uncertain breathing jac realized that this was one of the sessions where truelle had used hypnosis to draw out his buried memory as durrant struggled with the decision whether to take the leap or step back jac felt as if he was suddenly there with him in the moment suspended he snapped out of it quickly no time now stopping the tape and reading the last few paragraphs of the plea okay okay plea coultaines letter and get there fifteen minutes early to read havelings support letter he slid the papers into his briefcase grabbed the tape recorder and with a quick wave to john langfranc who mouthed good luck through his glass screen skipped down the stairs two at a time there was a small holdup along esplanade avenue but as soon as he was clear of the main downtown traffic twenty yards after making the turn into claiborne avenue jac hit play again on the recorder now on his passenger seat it it was another robbery thats why i felt guilty and not just cause id promised franny i wouldnt rob again but because it went wrong terribly wrong in which way did it go wrong there was somebody there when i broke in a woman shouldnt shouldnt have happened durrants breathing erratic again i id checked for a few nights bforehand and there was no car either in the drive or lights on that i could see she she wasnt meana be there and where was this house garden district do you remember the road coliseum street but i don remember the number exactly four hundred and something thats okay lawrence relax take it easy and in your own time tell me what happened there jac became aware of truelles tactic getting background detail district road because they were easier for durrant to relate got him talking more freely truelle had obviously worried that if he asked straight out what happened with the woman durrant might lapse into rapidbreathing catatonia and that would be all hed get even now with a more general softedged approach there was a long pause only the sound of durrants uneven breathing coming over on the tape jac turned the volume up as he hit the start of the lake pontchartrain causeway with the increased tyrenoise on the rougher road surface he couldnt hear whether durrant had started speaking again or not as as i said there were no lights on at the front or the side which is where i broke in maybe if id gone round the back id have seen a light on or maybe shed gone to bed early and thereda been no light on there either so you broke in at the side truelle confirmed as durrant paused again heavily as if each time he sidetracked it took a moment to get the sequence clear again in his mind yeah removed a glass pane and wired through on the frame so as not to break the alarm circuit two minutes and i was in took a quick tour tsee where the best stuff was and found a safe in the library that i reckoned i could break by drilling the lock without too much trouble and i was just preparin for that when i heard something behind me and she she was suddenly there like like out of nowhere not there one minute then the next jacs hands gripped tight at the steering wheel feeling durrants tension coming across in waves as if he was right there alongside him as jessica roche confronted him the police photos filling in the details of the room in his mind he was suddenly reminded of coultaines words depth of detail things that only the killer could possibly have known durrants breathing was again erratic as he struggled with the images or perhaps in anticipation of what he did next what are you doingshe barked she was pushy had me rattled and strange thing is i dont even remember takin out the gun but suddenly it was there between us her eyes wide staring at it a heavy swallow durrant fighting to get his breathing under control you know even then i didnt plan to to the pause was even longer this time and it looked for a moment as if truelle had lost durrant completely his final actions too traumatic to voice or perhaps part of him in denial that hed actually done it jac tapped two fingers on his steering wheel counting off the seconds the sun creeping out from behind a cloud stinging his eyes as it reflected off the water jac slipped on his sunglasses and halfopened one window feeling the warm bayou breeze tease his hair but memories of isle de rey seemed distant today as he felt himself immersing deeper into the shadows of the roche residence of twelve years ago plan to what larry truelle prompted as the silence prolonged what happened then jac tapped out another fifteen seconds with his fingers before durrants voice finally returned it it all felt unreal distant like it was happenin to someone else and i was just looking on but in instead of stepping back she stepped forward and i i panicked did the wrong thing i didnt mean to and and she was layin there then blood everywhere looking at me with wide eyes and she was in pain real pain a pitiful throaty groanin that went right through me so i i even though jac knew what happened next he found his own breathing rapid and short in anticipation almost matching durrants and his hands gripped tight to the steering wheel started to shake a sign to his right displayed the mile causeway mark i didnt want to but she was in pain the blood bubbling up from her mouth her wide eyes almost pleadin with me long silence again ragged uneven breathing what happened then lawrence what did you do truelles prompt quicker this time the edgeoftheseat listener impatient for what happened next in that heated moment holding sway over the trained psychiatrist she wasnt meant to be there wasnt meant to be i i and jac impatient too fastforwarded in his mind to the closeup police photos of jessica roche both shots fired stomach and head sepiagrey blood pools radiating from each whether the image momentarily distracted jac or he glanced fleetingly at the tape recorder in expectation of durrants next words the only warning was a reflected glint striking his eye something suddenly different in the vista of roadway and sundappled lake spread each side a truck overtaking its chrome bumper catching the sun as it veered lazily from its lane towards him suddenly swung sharply across his front wing pushing him towards the sidebarrier jac swerved stock reaction hitting his brakes hard as the barrier loomed before him but they did nothing nothing and in panic he swung the wheel back but not enough he hit the barrier at a thirtydegree angle at almost the same speed feeling himself shunted sharply forward and the airbag exploding against him along with something else sharper harder against one leg momentary darkness then the sun and lake seemed to be fighting through a hazygrey mist and as the mist became darker denser jac realized with mounting panic that his car was in the lake and sinking feeling the first water swill against his thigh as it poured in through the halfopen window sinking sinking jac felt as if he was in a washingmachine tumbler the water swirling in relentlessly the car swaying tilting then as it finally hit the bottom of the lake a cloud of mud was thrown up cutting visibility to almost nil how far was he down thirty feet fifty jac frantically tried the door but it wouldnt budge with the pressure outside his heart raced his breath falling short the water already up to his waist maybe the window but it wasnt open enough to get through he fumbled for the switch in the gloom found it pressed it but after a second it fizzled out with a spark and the window stopped moving twothirds down maybe enough jac squeezed his head and shoulders into the gap but the surge of water rushing in was too heavy impossible to push against no choice but to wait until the pressure equalized he pulled back and hoisted up until his head was against the car roof water up to his shoulders now breathing in the last foot of air trying to time it right the airgap teninches eight praying that he wasnt too far down to make it to the surface six and fighting to keep his breathing even ragged and frantic as it kept time with his racing pulse so that he had maximum air in his lungs when four jac made the break then got his head and shoulders quickly through his chest but as he tried to snake his waist through he felt something snagging on one leg holding him back his seat belt or maybe part of the airbag he wriggled hard desperate to free it knowing that he was using vital air with each second lost and as jac frantically jerked and tugged to get free the images of jessica roche were again there with him the sepiagrey of the police photos merging with the murky waters surrounding him clogging his nose his mouth suffocating his last breaths maybe because they were the last images in his mind before his car hit the barrier or because he now shared jessica roches emotions in those final seconds as durrants gun barrel pressed against her temple hoping against hope that she might survive but knowing in her sinking heart that it was already too late february silence the thrum of the city pushed away and cushioned by the resplendent mansions of the garden district each sprawling edifice with its cosseted oleander juniper bamboo and magnoliarich grounds a punctuation space of tranquillity separated from its neighbour on and on until the city itself and its hubbub seemed distant remote almost another world jessica roche was wrapped in the spacious cocoon of that silence the only sound coming from the house itself the tv on low with a cheers rerun a grandfather clock ticking in the hallway the faint hum and churn of the dishwasher in the kitchen their maid rosella had packed it and wiped all surfaces clean when shed left for the day fifty minutes ago the sharpest sound the turning of magazine pages as jessica roche flicked through a recent elle decor she glanced fleetingly at her watch over two hours gone theyd be well into the desserts brandies and afterdinner speeches by now one of those boring business functions all of the talk will be about trends and quotas and how to improve tanker facilities at port arthur you wouldnt enjoy it but at the back of her mind shed begun to wonder if adelay was purposely keeping her away from business functions because of their recent argument it had all been behind closed doors nothing overt that anyone else would have been aware of even rosella maybe this was his way of punishing her shutting her out in the cold for a while leave the trophy wife at home to cooloff realize her place or perhaps keeping her away from business functions a more direct message dont get involved in my business matters and things that dont concern you in sober reflection possibly she had been too volatile rash taken things a step too far or at least threatened to but then as so often hed been so annoyingly offhand and condescending trophy wife at the time it had seemed the only way for him to pay her any notice take her seriously otherwise hed have just rolled straight over her she stroked her stomach gently with one hand as she felt it twitch and tighten hopefully finally some activity there rather than just unease dr thallerey her obstetrician had said that the next month or so would be the most telling for the treatment perhaps she should backstep with adelay and try and calm the waters over the next few days the last thing she wanted they wanted was any upset that might affect the success of the treatment after all they finally had something to look forward to some hope where before she froze a tingle running up her spine a sound out of place among the other faint noises of the house a door opening maybe a window somewhere towards the other side of the house she held her breath listening more intently soft rustling scratching faint pad of steps towards her or were they heading along the corridor hard to pickout clearly as a gust of wind outside rustled the oleander bush close by the drawingroom window the door to the hallway was ajar just a few inches she got up and moved closer to it trying to hone her hearing to the sounds beyond fearful now of actually opening it if somebody was there the first thing she should be doing is shutting it sharply locking it and lunging for the phone to dial something there but very soft not she backstepped sharply her heart in her throat as the door started swinging wider open although by only a few inches their grey persian cat scurrying quickly through she reached down and scooped it up majestic its only you she hugged it close feeling her heart still racing against its soft fur she looked along the corridor to the recroom with its basket obviously the door hadnt been left sufficiently open as it usually was and itd had to scratch and paw the door wider open but stop sneaking around so will you you gave me the phone rang in the library adelays business line shed better get it hed told her before going out that he was expecting an important call and had specifically requested that she pass on his number at the function rather than let it go to answerphone no point in upsetting him even more majestic was abruptly dropped again as she went across the hallway to answer it everything had gone smoothly breaking in the sidewindow and wirecrossing the alarm had taken no more than a few minutes but then had come the trickiest part edging three doors down the corridor without being heard he glided silently feet floating an inch above the floor each step hardly connecting before lifting and gliding again he was sure hed made no sound but then the hackles suddenly rose on his neck as he passed the last but one door and saw the cat staring back at him from the near darkness hackles also raised back hunched as if it wasnt sure whether to lunge forward or shrink back he swiftly reached out and closed the door all but the last inch the sound of it touching home would carry he glided silently on breath held gently opened the library door and again left it open only an inch as he headed towards the leather seat at its far end sat down and waited four or five minutes until the call came through he checked from his watch theyd left more than enough leeway but it felt like a lifetime waiting in the silence of the big house his own heartbeat almost in time with a tickingclock in the hallway and beyond that the muted sound of pages turning and when after a few minutes there were some stronger closer sounds it made him sit up sharply rustling scratching the cat was trying to paw its way out of the room movement now too from across the hallway her getting up to investigate he slid the silenced from his jacket he might not even have to wait for the phone call a suspended moment then the sound of the cat scampering across the hallway and her voice riding a sharp intake of breath majestic its only you but stop sneaking around so will you you gave me the phone ringing only a few feet to his side sounded obscenely loud he took his own intake of breath in anticipation and pointed his gun towards the door lieutenant coyne of nopds district didnt arrive on the scene until am over two hours after the first squad car arrived there were a few reasons for that first thered been a reported major incident on magazine street started as a simple fenderbender but the saturday night specials had quickly come out and first radio reports were that world war three had erupted two shop windows were smashed a passerby hit in the leg from the stray bullets and amazingly one of the combatants took four bullets and still survived second he didnt like to arrive on crime scenes too early felt that it took a while for all the confusion and emotions to settle down and anything clear start to emerge but in this case there was a third reason when it came to bigshot or celebrity incidents coyne had often found the participants highhanded and difficult and as shots went they hardly came any bigger than adelay roche hopefully roche would have vented his worst whether blubbering or barking that they should be out there chasing his wifes murderer rather than tramping his best shagpile on his assistant ds dave friele who hed sent there within minutes of the radio alert coming through while he stayed to finish things up on magazine street tell me was all he said to friele as he slipped under the yellow tape across the front doorway homicide two calibre wounds one to the stomach the other to the head close range victim jessica anne roche age thirtytwo married no children friele glanced at his notepad only once her husband adelay roche was first to discover her at what time twelve twentysix or at least thats the time logged for his call and what estimated time for the shooting two hours beforehand maybe more medics found no trace of warmth from her body and rigor had already set in though obviously well know more from the full autopsy obviously but for now it doesnt look like mr roche simply shot his wife then waited half an hour before calling no doesnt look like it and where was the illustrious mr roche tonight at a business dinner function okay first thing to check time he arrived at the dinner time he left theyd been edging down the hallway as friele gave the details and as the main drawingroom came into view with adelay roche at its far end coyne turned back to friele hows he been he asked lowering his voice been ranting why arent you out there on his wifes killers trail rather than asking him stupid questions telling you that youre useless no hes been pretty subdued as it happens still in shock i suppose coyne looked thoughtfully at roche it wasnt a cold night but he had a blanket draped over his shoulders while a uniformed officer spoke to him getting fillin details neighbours names numbers he could be reached on other relatives of his wife that would need to be informed and would you like us to do that for you sir roche looked frail and shaken answered stiltedly real shock or an act coyne smiled tightly as he turned back to friele obviously thatll come when he gets to know you better what else sign of breakin at the side of the house a windowpane removed and alarm wired through which appears to support the mo of an intruder who was subsequently disturbed by jessica roche although the actual shooting took place in the library by the pause coyne knew that it was meant to be significant any reason for that the safes there it looks like maybe he was casing it when he was disturbed but hadnt started to break it no frieles gaze shifted to the open doorway two doors down on the opposite side the muted sounds of somebody making dictaphone notes drifting through okay lets take a look at her coyne had specifically asked that the body not be moved until he arrived despite the many corpses coyne had viewed through the years it never got easier one side of jessica roches face closest to where the bullet had exited had half collapsed her teeth and gums on that side exposed all the more and stained reddybrown in a rictus grimace the blood pools by her stomach and head had already congealed to a sticky brown film the latter carrying faintly glistening fragments of skull and white brain matter the smell of body waste was strong and pervasive one disadvantage of the twohour wait and hit high in his synapses like an ammonia burst making him dizzy for a second he pulled the cover back over the body and straightened up he looked towards the forensics officer speaking into a palmheld recorder now examining dusted patches on the desk the safe and windowframe had already been done any joy on prints the officer shook his head not by the looks of it probably wearing gloves no telltale clusters on the window where he broke in at least and ballistics coyne addressed friele we got the two bullets they found one the head shot friele pointed deflected through and was found a foot away embedded in the carpet the stomach shot looks like its still inside her will have to be retrieved at autopsy coyne was halfway through a scan of the room looking for anything significant or out of place when some excitable voices and movement from the hallway broke his attention a patrolman slightly ahead of his sidekick leant into the library doorway lieutenant looks like we might have a witness a woman a hundred yards down the street was out walking her dog and saw a man leaving the roches house about the time of the shooting coyne followed the patrolman back along the hallway and looked towards the woman standing by the three patrol cars beyond the tapedoff front gate their flashing lights reflecting starkly on her face shed obviously seen the squad car lights and drifted along to investigate she get a good look at him coyne asked not sure sir we thought it best to leave her for you to question coyne had interviewed the eyewitness but her description was far from conclusive africanamerican stocky build six foot to sixtwo maybe more thirtyplus maybe forty wearing a darkblue or black jacket maybe darkgrey or brown the maybes had concerned coyne her core description was vague enough could fit ten per cent of africanamerican adult males without stretching the boundaries further and with sixty per cent of new orleans africanamerican they were a million miles from a workable suspect list as district chief captain vincent campanelli had demanded on day one of the investigation pat coyne looked thoughtfully towards his neatlytended garden beyond the small back verandah as if it might give him clearer focus on the events of twelve years ago strange he thought often he could recall the events of that time clearer than things that had happened only months ago would she recognize him again i asked not sure she said i took that as a no but thought if we narrowed down the list of possible suspects and got a few faces in front of her we just might get lucky so we started working things from the other end putting together a list of house burglars with that mo was larry durrant one of those on that list no no he wasnt mainly because his past mo hadnt been violent we were looking at a particularly brutal killing in the course of here somebody who could kill without raising much sweat we had halfadozen suspects whod shot and wounded or beaten their targets half to death in past robberies two that we suspected of killing but had never managed to nail and two more whod tied up and tortured their robbery victims we were spoilt for choice without looking at the likes of larry durrant so were you surprised when his confession came in purely on a mo level yeah coyne shrugged but then everything else tied in not only the jacket with the dna match but his descriptions of the murder itself things that only the killer could possibly have known particularly the head shot why was that coyne shrugged with a palm out okay first off it was the one thing that might not fit in with a robberygonewrong theory more hitman territory but thats also why we held it back from any official releases press or otherwise so that we could filter out any false confessions all we released was that jessica roche had been shot twice apparently while disturbing an intruder most people would assume sudden surprise blamblam from five paces and out and thats pretty much what came in coyne smiled ingenuously celebrity murder like that we actually expected more but there were six confessions in all three were white one was way off the mark of the eyewitness description and of course the other two we grilled like all hell they got all manner of things wrong with internal descriptions of the house but most tellingly neither of them mentioned the closeup head shot the only one to describe that was larry durrant coyne was silent for a second the only sound from a couple of bees hovering by a nearby azalea bush the muted sounds of the city beyond like a more distant swarm but were getting a touch ahead of ourselves here he continued hand in hand with us narrowing down the general suspect list we also took a closer look at adelay roche my superior captain campanelli wasnt at all comfortable with that felt wed get all kinds of backlash from roche word had it that he was pretty buddybuddy with the assistant commissioner at the time but its standard procedure you know looking close to home and roche wasnt giving us any grief at that stage which also struck me as somewhat strange not running completely true to form coyne took a fresh breath but after months of digging into adelay roches background we found nothing no possible link to him killing his own wife and most importantly no motive no other woman no arguments no pressures or problems that anyone was aware of and no big insurance policy on her not that hed need the cash in fact everyone we spoke to said they seemed very much in love and to cap it all they were hopeful of soon having their first child mrs roche was undergoing fertility treatment with high chances of success according to her doctor perhaps if her doctor had said that the fertility treatment hadnt gone well and there was no possible hope of future children then we might have had the seed of something or lack of seed in this case the henry the eighth motive i think its known as coyne smiled dryly but noticed that his visitor mirrored it only halfheartedly as if the subject was too weighty for humour or perhaps because of what hed mentioned when they first sat down but even if i had gone to campanelli with that hed no doubt have told me that i was being too much of a cynical prick as often was his wont to do and i was stretching things too far then just as the dust was settling on the adelay roche front he did run more true to form and start screaming why werent we making more progress in finding his wifes killer maybe it took him a while to get over the initial shock and become obnoxious again who knows then just two weeks later durrants confession landed in our laps and did you feel comfortable with it you know given your concerns about durrants mo coyne held out one palm i had some reservations but listening to durrants voice on tape there was only one possible conclusion he had to have been there so either he was the killer or a fly on the wall at the time and when the dna evidence came in that sealed it coynes visitor looked faintly crestfallen at that moment perturbed it took him a second to decide where to head next and the eyewitness incidental by that stage all she was able to do was provide a general fit for durrants appearance not an exact id early on wed narrowed down our list of hardhitting robbers to three possibles and put them in a lineup with five others including two police officers she was split between three of them two suspects and a police officer which i suppose from a hundred yards away at night is understandable so we didnt want to push our luck with durrant otherwise the defence could have had a field day but by then we didnt need to his visitor glanced absently towards the garden for a second before bringing his attention back and were there any other witnesses or others on the scene at the time that werent mentioned in the police report perhaps say because they didnt come forward no the lady with the dog was the only one or at least if anyone else was there they werent seen by her or any of the roches neighbours we questioned coyne raised an eyebrow was about to ask why when his visitor leant forward and passed across three photos this is someone in touch recently by email claiming that he was there at the time and so knows durrants innocent probably a hoaxer or maybe even a friend of durrants but you never know strike any chords coyne studied them grimacing tightly after a moment cant say that they do even if there was more to pull a match from here coyne shrugged as he handed the photos back but like i say doesnt become a factor here nothing to match to no other sightings if there had been theyd have been in the report his visitor nodded his gaze towards the garden this time seeming to stop in midspace as if something was hanging there he couldnt quite bring into focus before he looked back at coyne thanks for that mr coyne youve been most helpful he switched off the tape recorder and put the photos back in his briefcase perhaps my assistant dave friele will remember more coyne said hes still with the department though now hes moved to central eighth division but thats about all of importance i can think of now what with the passage of the years mr mr langford langfranc his visitor corrected john langfranc it was meant to be my colleague jac mcelroy making this call today but as i say with his accident i ive had to take things over from him yes im sorry to hear about that mr langfranc coyne grimaced tightly as he stood to show langfranc out but feel free to call me if theres anything else you need clarification on shall i tell you about my life they say im a man of the world ive flown across every time ive seen lots of pretty girls rodriguez had phoned jacs office and been put through to john langfranc we wanted to play somethin for him here on the prison radio felt yer know thats the least we could do do you happen to know his favourite tune langfranc didnt but he had a number for jacs mother and sister hed phone them and ask and phone rodriguez straight back langfranc hadnt wanted to give their number to an inmate or get them involved in whatever prison relationships jac might have forged langfranc phoned back minutes later having just spoken with jeanmarie there were four choices stings roxanne simply reds holding back the years oasiss wonderwall or fleetwood macs man of the world the last apparently because it was also his fathers favourite song rodriguez could only find roxanne and man of the world in the prison record collection and given his own rapsheet history and havelings likely reaction to him playing a song about a hooker there was only one choice left played today for jac mcelroy one of those who took the time and trouble to care because god knows theres few enough o them left these days and paid the price for it more maudlin a song than rodriguez would have liked maybe more tireddrone territory but the words werent too bad a fit perhaps even would have described part of his own life and he loved that guitar work reminded him of his main man carlos s with everything that had happened with jac mcelroy larrys emotions were already raw and close to the surface he lay with his back flat on his bed listening to the song as it played staring up at the grey ceiling it had in fact been his suggestion to rodriguez that they play something for mcelroy hed already prayed for him even though he no longer had an altar just a four by three foot upright board where his altar used to be covering the fresh cement laid behind but hed used the board to pinup the photos from his altar that meant something to him only five of the religious photos sent by perettis aunt from perugia cathedral though made the transfer the majority were of larrys family his mother father franny joshua most of all joshua joshua a year ago the most recent photo standing with his mother at the side of a brown buick probably franks joshua blowing out the candles at his eighth birthday party joshua at five or six in front of orlandos seaworld again with his mom larry aware that often the person whod snapped the photos had taken his place in their lives joshua at three years old looking up from playing on the floor with some toys but the only photos to have any life and movement in them were the two taken shortly after joshuas birth one a week after francine had come out of hospital lovingly cradling joshua in her arms the other with himself holding joshua aloft towards the camera beaming proudly look unbelievable isnt it hes mine all mine from just those two photos larry was able to roll out in his mind everything else that had happened around that time when the birth was announced in the hospital his mother bought a cigar and a small bottle of champagne from a nearby liquor store a benjamin she didnt want to encourage him to drink too much shed defended when hed remarked about its size barely gave them half a glass each to toast with rocking joshua in his arms at every opportunity he got staring down at his cradle at night in wonderment sometimes for as much as an hour feeling joshs tiny fingers and the gentle fall of his breath against the back of one hand staying awake sometimes for hours and checking regularly fearful as he listened out that that gentle breathing might have suddenly stopped and when joshua did wake up in the middle of the night crying larry swaying him softly in his arms and humming a viennese waltz to get him back to sleep francine laughing as on one occasion she found him slumped in a chair asleep with joshua still in his arms the humming having lulled both of them to sleep the images playing clearly on his cells grey ceiling where hed played most of them through the years and then nothing nothing but static frozen pictures his whole life with joshua condensed into just a few months then nothing after that larry tried as best he could to shift those other images give them some movement in his imagination but hed never managed to bring any life to them as they scrolled across the grey ceiling only in his dreams sometimes could he imagine talking or playing ball or mocksparring with joshua as he was in those photos when he was older hugging him now and then and then hed awake to the cold reality of his cell a slow tear already at the corner of one eye even before he faced again the cold static photos and the tears began to flow more freely all those lost years gone gone forever hed stare at the photos wideeyed as if trying to immerse himself in their world his body not moving only his breath slowly rising and falling as the tears streamed down his face immobile static frozen as if somehow if they were both in the same pose frozen he would feel closer to joshua in that moment static and thats probably just how he in turn had seemed through the years to young joshua the stone mountain a pitiful grey figure frozen inside his prison cell with little colour or movement or life that joshua could attach to it in all the years hed never told joshua how much he loved him francine neither oh sure hed told his precious god how much he loved them many a time but in all their visits or his letters or emails with joshua hed never said it directly just talked about daytoday stuff how are you how are things at school basketball team huh new computer thats nice what are you reading these days given a few tips where he could arms length holding at bay his deeper feelings as if afraid that if he opened up the dam would burst on the tidal wave of emotions hed bottled up through the long years hold it back hold back be strong be strong and hed been the same when jac mcelroy had visited played his cards close to his chest kept everything tight inside guarded given mcelroy a hard time sure mcelroy had mainly just been doing his job but as roddy had said he was one of the few that had actually taken the trouble to care had stuck his neck out and gone that extra mile for him and now and now the tears welled heavily in larrys eyes roddy hadnt told him which song hed be playing but as he heard the softly lamenting guitar riff and opening words he found the tears impossible to bite back any longer was that how it would forever be set in stone for his probably short time on this earth his epitaph never able to tell people how he truly felt only his god holding back holding and as peter greens soulful cry i just wish i had never been born cut through the cold concrete caverns of libreville prison finally the dam did burst he cried for the lost years cried for all the things that now he might not get the chance to say cried for having let franny and josh down deserting them just when they needed him most cried for breaking his mothers heart cried for jessica roches longgone soul and now for jac mcelroy too how many more maybe best that he was going soon he cried and cried until it became a pitiful sobbing that racked his entire body sudden rapping on the side wall three sharp knocks startling him you okay in there larry theo mellors voice from the next cell you okay man yeah yeah he clawed back some composure wiped some of the tears away with the back of one hand bad song choice thats all real bad song choice grey everything grey clogging his nose his mouth trickling down and burning his lungs at most twentyfive seconds before he finally wrenched his leg free but it felt like a lifetime sapping him of strength and vital time to get to the top to burst free for air then he was rising up up his lungs searing and aching with the pressure and about to explode faint distant light now touching the grey how much further twenty feet thirty his lungs finally gave just over halfway up the water bursting down his gullet and as the sunlight hitting the lake surface cut through last of the grey making him squint his consciousness in turn started to dim dragging him back into grey again then finally black he recalled briefly some voices though had no idea how long after i thought i saw him move a little nah hes not moving hes dead and he thought im not dead i can hear you and he could also feel a soft breeze from the lake hitting one cheek just before hands started pressing hard at his stomach pumping but the second voice was right he realized must have seen that he was a hopeless case because once again the grey started dragging him back down back towards the black there was a strange dream at some stage later a dream that tried to fool him that maybe hed made it and was still alive his last subconscious bid not to accept that hed actually died he was lying in a bed whether at home or a hospital he couldnt tell because everything was whited out and indistinct and alaysha was leaning over and hugging and kissing him oh jac jac you had us all so worried the softness and warmth and perfume of her felt so good it made him ache and want to cry and his mother and jeanmarie were also there got to meet and talk to alaysha for the first time john langfranc too and even his occasional squash partner jeff coombs all of them smiling nodding talking telling him how good it was to see him it was like that closing scene in a wonderful life where half the town turn out to greet jimmy stewart and tell him how good it is to see him alive except that in this case jac knew that he was dead because he could see his father hanging in the shadows at the back of the room and then the grey was there again dragging him back down clogging his nose his mouth deeper into the blackness away from the light at the top of the lake jac jac alaysha kissing him again but this time he pushed her awaynono ive already had that dream dont tease me like this jac jac wake up wake up struggling against her as she shook him harder but unable to resist the blackness this time feeling himself dragged deeper and deeper into it the water again rushing into his mouth black and thick with mud filling his gullet his lungs stifling suffocating no no no his scream was still reverberating in the room as he sat up his body soaked with sweat he was trembling violently and felt suddenly cold eyes blinking adjusting looking around to get his bearings salmon pink and beige alayshas bedroom she leant over and kissed him once more one hand lingering on his shoulder as she pulled back eyeing him concernedly bad dream again yes yes he eased a tired sigh and smiled crookedly unless im dead and this is the dream then as he shook the last of the nightmare away everything that had happened in the ten days hed been away from the world flooded back in he was seen surfacing from the lake by the occupants of two cars passing on the causeway and was pulled from the water within minutes by one of them brave enough to take the plunge four more cars stopped as the drama unfolded and thankfully one of their drivers had basic first aid experience going through the resuscitation process for the first time with a reallife case a lot of water was coughed up apparently shallow breathing resumed and a weak pulse finally felt but jac was still unconscious and remained so despite medics giving him oxygen and a shot of adrenalin in his drip feed on the way to the hospital for the next nine hours there was some residual water on his lungs which was duly drained one badly bruised and cut leg was stitched and strapped and a scan of his brain carried out no signs of problems there and when jac finally awoke he felt as right as rain and was in good spirits as if nothing had happened and his visitors whod so far been kept at bay waiting anxiously between the coffee room and corridor outside were finally allowed in to see him his mum jeanmarie alaysha john langfranc jeff coombs just as in the dream except for his father and not all at the same time his assigned consultant talked about releasing him in only a couple of days just need to run a few more tests some fresh strapping on that leg and let you rest a bit more then you should be fine to go home but the night before he was due to leave hospital his temperature rocketed to f further tests ensued this time considerably more frantic a lung infection was discovered presumably from the lake water but it had already entered his bloodstream septicaemia had set in the greyness was again dragging jac back towards the black void as for the next four days jac hovered close to death alaysha stayed with jacs mother and jeanmarie in the corridor outside his room for most of that time didnt go to work and had her mom take care of molly jacs mother found a church two blocks away where she lit a candle for him and prayed there were prayers too from larry durrant inside libreville and rodriguez had even played a song for him over the prison radio all of which jac was brought up to date on when he finally emerged from the grey abyss bringing a wry albeit weak smile to his face four more days for more tests and for him to regain his strength he was told but the first thing jac thought about then was durrant six days already lost now another four on top twentyone days left till durrants execution john langfranc had already reassured him about the clemency petition dont worry i got everything necessary off your computer put all the file attachments with it and went out to libreville and got durrant to sign it its gone off already copies to both candaret and the board of pardons when jac voiced his concern about the extra four day wait langfranc again offered to help i can interview coyne or friele and put it on tape for you at least get something rolling on that front hopefully youll be able to pick up the ball from there jac had played the tape countless times during his last days in the hospital as well as gone through again his earlier notes and the original trial and appeal files so that head shot and durrants past mo had initially struck coyne as out of place but everything else from coyne the eyewitness durrants descriptions of the house and the murder further bolstered by that final head shot being held back from all press releases the blood spots on his jacket matched to jessica roches dna piled everything irrevocably against durrant jac felt weak his strength sapped not just from the accident and his illness but with what he now faced with durrant hed just fought his way out of one grey abyss yet just how he was going to fight his way through this daunting ocean of proof against durrant he didnt know i know this isnt the best time to bring this up alaysha said but you know that warning letter we talked about having sent to gerry she sighed and rested her hands in her lap i think it would be a good idea to now send it when alaysha had first mentioned likely problems with her ex jac had suggested sending an initial warning letter on the firms letterheading then if that didnt work theyd go the whole hog and get a restraining order i know you said hed been phoning you jac arched an eyebrow but has he been round here at your door too alaysha closed her eyes for a second and eased out a sigh of submission yes yes he has i didnt want to say anything before while you were ill jac nodded pensively was it bad no ii alayshas eyes flickered briefly shut again yes it was he came round a couple of days before you came out of hospital banging and shouting and i told him to stop molly was home and he was frightening her he kept shouting a while more then finally calmed saying he had a jacket of mine id left at his place a few weeks back hed come to give it back i checked through the spyhole and sure enough i could see it in his hand so i said okay but i was leaving the door on the chain he wasnt coming in he seemed fine with that just nodded numbly as if all the fight had gone out of him okay babe okay i understand he says alaysha shook her head her eyes shutting heavier this time as the memory of what happened played against the back of her eyelids she bit at her bottom lip as she opened her eyes again as if still fearful of what they might see then as soon as soon jac reached out and gently touched her arm consoling thats okay dont worry ill ill get the letter sent off as soon as i get to the office thanks jac i appreciate it she swallowed hard shaking off the last of the images you know i thought he was going to rip the chain right off the door i i dont know how i managed to shut it again she glanced back briefly towards the door again as if it still might suddenly burst open then she looked down uncertainly something was still troubling her what is it jac asked unfortunately it it didnt end there jacs concern gripped like a stomach cramp his hand laid lightly on her arm pressed gently what happened alaysha what happened he came by the club the night after making a scene the shadows in her eyes shifted hesitantly as she forced a tight smile but thankfully the security at the clubs good they made quick work of getting rid of him thankfully jac felt his jaw tighten but what was going to happen when next time he tried and there was no security or a chained door between them i suppose if all else fails theres always one way of handling gerry jac held a fist up oh alaysha eyed him curiously young kid doesnt last long on the streets of glasgow without learning to use these and my father always kept a boxing bag at our rochefort farmhouse said that it was one of the best ways to keep fit alaysha gave another quick tight smile unsure whether jac was serious or if it was just bravado to make her feel more secure jac wasnt sure either hed spent the first night out of the hospital at her place for various reasons he had no fresh food at his place he was still weak and alaysha commented with a sly smile that she wanted to nurse him a bit their relationship had changed markedly while hed been in the hospital without much actually happening between them not only because hed seen how much she seemed to care about him belying the short time theyd been involved but so had his mother and jeanmarie from witnessing alayshas vigil at the hospital and talking with her there hed begged both of them not to say anything about alaysha to aunt camille she probably thinks im still going out with jennifer bromwell courtesy of jennifers parents its a long story ill tell you later but he decided to wait a while before telling them that alaysha lapdanced from what shed told them they appeared to think she did interior decorating and some modelling hed also finally met molly almost as if alaysha kept molly away at her moms while any new boyfriends visited until theyd passed the initial acid test alaysha had brought molly with her on her last visit to the hospital and introduced them and molly was there at alayshas when jac first came out are you okay now she enquired he couldnt help smiling her soft high tone attempting to be adult and grave yes fine fine he put one hand lightly on mollys shoulder as he knelt down to her height and you fine too she said then he spent the next half hour on his knees as she led him through the fantasy world of her dolls and informed him who hadnt been fine recently amongst them alaysha touched his cheek with the back of one hand its so good to have you back jac so good for me too he closed his eyes at her touch he could feel them getting closer and wanted so much for it to work but hed seen those shadows in her eyes when shed described gerry trying to break her door down and visiting the club just what baptism of fire might their relationship have to endure to finally be rid of him alaysha stroked her fingers gently across jacs cheek and back through his hair before taking her hand away there was something else gerry had said while at her door that had sent a chill through her but that was the last thing shed want to tell jac about after all that was the whole point of this lawyers letter now hopefully finally closing the book on her past life with gerry and what shed done with him she swallowed took a fresh breath when are you supposed to be hearing from the police tomorrow or the latest the day after they said shadows in his eyes knowing finally if his car dragged up from lake pontchartrain had been tampered with he put one arm around alaysha and gave her a reassuring hug and when gerry gets this letter lets just hope he gets the message and leaves you be lets hope so but jac could see from her tight smile that she was as unconvinced as him rodriguez felt in fine form this morning jac mcelroy had made it the sun was breaking through a thin cloud cover and the air was clear and crisp rodriguez inhaled deeply as he sauntered across the exercise yard one of the first times the air had been crisp for a long while rodriguez liked this time of year the temperature inside the prison was bearable for once and hopefully would remain so for the next few months rodriguez fired a quick fakecap acknowledgement to bc and larry lifting weights on the far side of the yard bc was by far the keenest musclefreak in their little circle in the yard practically every day larry theo mellor and gill arneck trainedup at most twice a week and himself and peretti never hey you wanna try this som time roddy bc called out as he approached your arms are startin to look like strands o spaghetti nah might give myself an injury roddy made a mock grab at his crotch would ruin my wild sex life here bc shook his head and smiled yer know roddy at times youre such a pussy yeah well roddy shrugged amiably like they say you are what you eat bc and larry laughed out loud bringing a glare from tally shavell six yards away at the other end of the muscle yard with jayt and another crew brother the separation between them obvious nobody else daring to go into that electrified no mans land rodriguez gave them a guarded sideways glance and signalled to larry with a small nod that he wanted to talk they should move further away from tally and his crew they sidled five yards away so that even bc would have trouble overhearing them but rodriguez kept his voice low in case just got an email in from jac having almost lost his life trying to help larry suddenly he was jac instead of mr mcelroy one of them as you know his sidekick langfranc filed last week with the bop and candaret and part of that jac reminded me was talkin about your literary expertise hed like to send a couple o the books you edited to back that up if thats okay edits a bit strong a term all i did was make some comments in the margin and change some words where i felt the same one had been used too much larry shrugged but sure thats okay he expects candaret to finally spill forth in about two weeks but apparently the board of pardons will haul your ass in front of em four or five days before that so theyll be the first youll hear from larry arched an eyebrow what the hell will they expect from me show im a literary buff by quoting from poe and shakespeare yeah yeah justice justice where for art thou justice rodriguez smile quickly faded as he looked levelly at larry no i think its mainly to fin out if youre a reasonable balanced guy reformed character and all that shit so dont be your normal indolent uncooperative self okay ill try larry smiled lazily i desperately need you to tell me more to be able to do anything with your communication as it stands it could be from anyone a hoaxer a friend of durrants i cant even begin to put it in front of the da or governor if you cant give your name for some reason then we can talk about protection and anonymity you can also feel safe in initially sharing that information with me under client discretion if you are serious about helping larry durrant then please come forward and at the same time ill do everything i possibly can to help you jac gave the email one last read through then pressed send hed felt increasingly uneasy just leaving everything on that final flawed note with his mystery emailer very likely spooked and so no further contact and when the night before hed shared his thoughts with alaysha finally told her the whole saga shed urged him on dont just give up with him there jac keep pushing send him more emails try and draw him out if he is real he must have a conscience to have made contact in the first place remember that try and play on that jac had nodded a slow acceptance her words in that moment seeming so right but now having sent the email he wondered whether it wasnt just that added voice to his own thoughts but because of his other frustrations the desperate need to keep things rolling positively on at least one front four calls hed put in to truelles office leaving messages before he finally got a call back now there was a further fortytwo hour delay early the day after tomorrow before hed actually be able to see him sorry thats the earliest im afraid im up to my neck with things thats why the delay in getting back to you and dr thallerey jessica roches old obstetrician was away at a medical convention in houston till the end of the week he doesnt like to be disturbed at these things so we have strict instructions not to do so unless its an absolute medical emergency does it fall into that category sir no no its okay ill contact him when he gets back jac felt the clock ticking down against durrant like a tight coil at the back of his neck superficially he looked fine after his accident except for a slight limp in his right leg a thigh gash had taken fourteen stitches and his calf muscles had been heavily bruised probably from when he wrenched his leg free the doctor said that within a week it should have healed enough for the limp to subside but what was going on inside jacs head was another matter now that the clemency plea had been filed he was back assisting john langfranc with other cases and was meant to spend no more than four manhours a week on the durrant case for what beaton described as residual maintenance but jac found it hard to concentrate on the fresh files before him and more than a few times hed noticed john langfranc look up at him through his glass screen a searching appraisal that hadnt yet fully verged into concern yet sometimes when jac tried to focus the words would swim and merge and become little more than a blur a grey blur that seemed to draw him in becoming deeper darker as he sank through it and suddenly hed back in the lake again lungs bursting choking for air jacs line buzzing broke his thoughts lieutenant wallace for you penny vance called across the office thanks jac swallowed and took a fresh breath noticing john langfranc look through his glass screen as he picked up the police mechanics report on his car dragged up from lake pontchartrain jacs brow knitted as he tried to disentangle wallaces description of brake fluid pressures and condition of joint threads what exactly does all of that mean wallace took a fresh breath it means that the findings are inconclusive but if we had to put money on something itd be on it being caused by a fault or wear and tear rather than on tampering otherwise the thread on the brake fluid joint would have been clean and in perfect condition it wasnt the thread had shorn off i see jac knew that he should have been relieved but that emotion still felt out of reach along with any clarity on wallaces account all he felt was numb perhaps the joint simply got weakened with time and wear and tear then with the sudden jolt of you braking hard it sheared off but what about that truck alongside swinging in and the fact that he didnt stop i know but it might have been a driver simply distracted or falling asleep rather than purposeful and once hed straightened up hed have been past you by then might well not have seen what happened to you yeah possibility i suppose jac sighed resignedly might might might he wasnt convinced langfranc came out of his office as jac thanked wallace and signed off accident jac said looking towards langfranc doesnt look like brake tampering at least thats what hes putting the money on well thats a relief yeah jac nodded dolefully thats a relief schlish schlap schlish schlap schlish schlap the monotony of the windscreen wipers was starting to wear on dr thallereys nerves might have got close to sending him to sleep if he hadnt stopped just forty minutes back for a strong fresh coffee and popped a ritalin straight after hed decided to drive because since he just couldnt abide airports any more oneandhalf to two hours before check in with invariably more delays on top by the time hed sat for three hours bored mindless at an airport he could be halfway there in his car he tried to keep to mph but invariably hed edge up to sixty on clear flat stretches two hours more and hed be home schlish schlap schlish schlap thallerey peered through the intermittent film of water on his windscreen at the murky road ahead a quarter moon was there somewhere drifting in and out of heavy cloud cover his squint suddenly widened hands gripping tighter to the wheel as out of nowhere not there in one sweep of the wipers there in the next red tail lights loomed ahead and he had to brake sharply thallereys speedo plummeted he glanced at it as it bottomed out twentytwo miles an hour ridiculous he edged out a large doubletrailer truck hed need a clear straight stretch to get past it they followed a long slow bend seeming to take forever and as they straightened out thallerey peered through the gloom at a clear stretch illuminated in his headlamps no curves for at least a couple of hundred yards he swung out and floored it forty fifty he should be past it soon longer than he thought a lot longer it struck him that he wasnt making much progress past it the truck had at the same time picked up speed he pushed the pedal harder fiftyfive sixty the curve in the road still a good hundred yards away yet still he gained only a few yards appeared to be in much the same position alongside it just past the coupling for the rear trailer which meant that it must now be doing the same speed sixty deciding that he wasnt going to make it past thallerey eased off the pedal and braked to cut back in when a sudden blast of lights flooded him from behind headlamps full beam now a top searchlight switched on as well looked like a big fourwheeler but hard to make out fully beyond the glare it had obviously swung out to overtake following him and was now showing full lights as if to say go on go on get past it he hesitated for a second whether to go for it but then saw that the bend in the road was only forty yards ahead he beeped his horn and hit his brakes again to pull back in behind the truck but the truck also seemed to slow alongside him and now the lights behind were even closer only yards from his back bumper he felt his chest tighten beads of sweat starting to break on his forehead they had him jammed in he braked and beeped his horn twice again but still no give the truck in turn also slowed and the fourwheeler beeped back still jammed tight behind its headlamps flooding his car then as if the driver had a sudden change of thought the fourwheeler pulled sharply back and tucked in behind the trailertruck in that split second thallerey was disorientated his car still seemed to be floodlit wrenching his eyes from his rearview mirror to the road ahead as it hit him just why the fourwheeler had cut back in so quickly an oncoming trailertruck suddenly startlingly clear in the upward sweep of his wipers bearing down on him fast at least hed now also be able to tuck in behind the truck he reckoned braking hard but again it braked to hold him there and there was one difference between his braking and the trucks perhaps because in his panic hed braked that much harder his wheels locked and his car started to slew on the wet road his last hope as he squinted against the dazzling white of the oncoming headlamps and every nerveend tightened and froze the breath in his throat was that the oncoming truck seeing him blocking the road would brake and stop in time but it didnt it just kept going at the same speed shunting the front of his car straight through him yeah okay babe yeah another one nelm tucked a twentydollar bill into the girls thigh garter as elegantly defying her nearnudity the garter stockings and cobalt blue highheels were all she wore she lifted her leg alongside his chair coffee skin with a touch of aulait eyes almost matching pale toffee with green flecks full lips a teasing slant at the corner of her eyes chestnut brown hair in ringlets breaking on the curve of her breasts and a bubblebutt to die for up close she was even better than viewed from a hundred yards through a car windscreen nelm considered far better especially with her clothes off nelm had remembered why the girl struck a chord where hed seen her before mike miko ortegas pinkies club miko managed four lapdancing clubs on behalf of carmen malastra three in new orleans and one in baton rouge of which pinkies was his latest addition miko and nelm went back twenty years to the days when they both worked together providing club security muscle and hed called in on miko not long after pinkies first opened three years ago now the girl hadnt been there then but nelm had reason to visit again eleven months back when roche wanted to put the squeeze on a planning officer obstructing his application for a new refinery theyd discovered that he was an on and off visitor to pinkies and a few steamy photographs landing in his wifes lap would be none too handy the only problem was that no photography was allowed inside the club unless that is you first cleared it with miko and slipped him a g sweetener that was when nelm had first seen the girl nelm swallowed his mouth suddenly dry as she bent down inches from him parting her legs and looking back at him for a second before swinging round and from a halfsquat her breasts only inches from his lap slowly rose again swaying as she went love hangover played more his generation he would like to have recalled dancing to it but more likely than not he and his wife would have been shouting at each other above it in some disco or other or miko and him would have been in a club sidealley pounding some drunk theyd just ejected in time with its beat okay the girl mouthed mostly lost in the music turning it into a wet pout as she half closed her eyes in abandon oh god she was good nelm nodded back with a satiated smile in turn halfclosing his own eyes as he felt a wave of sensations hed rather not have especially with what he might soon have to do to her wash over him halfway through her first dance for him hed asked her name just to make sure shed leant over so that she was heard above the music her mouth close to his ear alaysha sounded like the gentle swish of surf on a tropical beach thought nelm hot breath on his ear and her closeness sending a tingle through his body no question it would be a shame to have to kill her he paid her for one more dance then went over to the bar to talk to miko any chance with her for an old fool like me do you reckon nelm said it jovially as if he was only halfserious nah missed the boat there she just hitched with a new guy though you might have stood a chance while she was still going out with the last crazy guy crazy yeah real schizo pushing her around an all sorts miko shook his head even came by the club here just last week making a scene oh miko didnt take well to people making a scene in his club let alone boyfriends of his dancers so hed made sure to find out all he could about alayshas ex from a couple of the other girls nelm made out that he was only mildly interested but he committed the key details firmly to memory gerry strelloff assistant bar manager golden bay casino biloxi nelm checked his watch staying long tonight miko enquired no gotta move soon maybe just one more dance but he never got to it alaysha was tied up with another client and he was deliberating whether to ask another girl for a dance maybe best that he didnt get too close to alaysha when the call he was expecting came through he escaped the noise of the club to take it waving a quick goodbye to miko all done the voice at the other end confirmed but sure this time nelm pressed a hundred percent sure yeah the impact cut him in half theyre still scraping bits of him into plastic bags and clean too i hope if youll excuse the oxymoron absolutely three firm witnesses the two truck drivers and yours truly in the bronco all saying the same thing he swung out without warning didnt give the oncoming truck a chance of stopping and her eyes her eyes what about her eyes lawrence she looked up at me then just before i i durrant swallowing hard his breathing uneven on the tape and uh the damnest thing was i couldnt tell if she was angry with me or was saying thank you for putting her out of her pain but it stayed with me you know that look i found it hard to shift from my mind as i ran out as durrant described fleeing and seeing a woman a hundred yards away walking her dog jac realized that absolutely everything on tape matched the physical evidence of jessica roches murder the shot to the head the telephone ringing the witness the only odd thing was that durrant never actually described pulling the trigger either time the gun was there and the blood and pain was described but durrant had skipped over the instant of actually pulling the trigger as if it was too traumatic for him to fully face thats it truelle commented stopping the tape i brought durrant back out at that point and the session ended jac brought his focus back to truelle across the desk im sorry dr thallerey died last night in a car accident were still all in shock here from the news jac wished now that he hadnt made the call at least not just before his meeting with truelle hed had half an hour spare before leaving to see truelle and he remembered that dr thallerey was due back from houston the night before the news sapped him of all strength left his legs weak worst of all it numbed his thoughts and so hed asked truelle to play the remainder of the crucial tape with durrant at the roche residence after durrants made the first shot ive already heard up to that point while it played hed get some breathing space to hopefully clear his thoughts truelle had heavily thinning sandy brown hair and looked worn tired with heavy bags under his eyes as if hed taken much of the woe of his patients on board personally the word seedy might have sprung to mind except that he had a faint tan and his dress was quite dapper with a navy poloneck and burgundy corduroy jacket with leather elbow patches that screamed academia or doctor jac sensed an edginess beneath truelles tight ingratiating smile and professional patina though perhaps no more than warranted by the adversarial nature of their meeting truelle had spoken for the prosecution and jac represented defence but as the tape had played rather than jacs thoughts about thallereys accident settling theyd gained momentum surely too much of a coincidence his and thallereys accidents so close together but why on earth was dr thallerey seen as a threat and by whom after all he was only jessica roches obstetrician jac swallowed cleared his throat and that was the fourteenth session with durrant yes and how many sessions with hypnosis had there been by then truelle considered for a second that was the sixth i believe fifth or sixth we had eight or nine conventional sessions before deciding to try hypnosis in order to dig deeper presumably because you didnt feel you were getting that far with conventional sessions exactly truelles hands on his desktop fingertips pressed together in a cradle parted for a second dont get me wrong there was some progress conventionally but i just felt that if he proved a good subject wed make progress tentimes faster with hypnosis the hands opened and closed again he was and we did i see jac looked briefly at the notes hed made earlier how often were the sessions twice a week normally every monday and thursday except for a couple of weeks where i could only see him once because i had such a busy appointment book jac nodded he doubted that under normal circumstance truelle would have recalled the days that far back but having to repeat the same thing at both the trial and appeal three years later it had no doubt become ingrained jac nodded towards the tape recorder and this session number fourteen was the last you had with durrant you contacted the police straight after truelle shuffled slightly in his seat not immediately after i wanted a short while to think over the implications ethics of confidentiality in particular truelle forced a tight smile so first thing i did was cancel durrants next session to give me some time to consider but when i checked confidentiality didnt stretch as far as a murder confession in fact if id withheld the information i could have been implicated as an accessory truelle opened and closed the cradle again trapped within it so in the end i had little choice but for that reason there was a twoday delay from durrant making the confession to my contacting the police jac rubbed his forehead if it wasnt for his earlier notes hed have had trouble continuing but he found it hard to push his focus beyond them as hed planned when he first made them thoughts about thallerey kept bouncing back crowding out all else if both crashes werent just accidents how had whoever was responsible made the connection between him and thallerey thallereys name had only come up when john langfranc interviewed coyne and as far as jac could remember he himself hadnt mentioned planning to visit thallerey to anyone in fact hed only phoned once to thallereys office just before he went back into work that first day back so fourteen sessions over two months jac confirmed all recorded and with diary entries to match yes thats right truelle took the tape out of the recorder and jac caught the heavy scent of cologne along with something else peppermint the trial judge ordered that i keep everything relating to durrant until all possible appeals and pleas were exhausted which i suppose would include this plea now truelles smile this time was more hesitant his cheeks slightly flushed reminder perhaps of durrants life hanging in the balance with what they were discussing truelle cleared his throat is there anything at this stage that might have given you cause for concern regarding the evidence against durrant no not particularly jac contemplated truelle coolly from the transcripts truelle had been given a hammering at trial and appeal over both the reliability of hypnosis and the ethics of revealing the tape despite any residual concern truelle might have for durrant he was obviously more concerned that his reputation might again be brought into question except that is whether its right to execute a man whose mind is still only halfclear regarding what he was doing around that time yes i can appreciate that truelle swallowed his flush becoming deeper but apart from that nothing particularly untoward no nothing untoward from truelles expression it was obvious hed had some stabs of conscience about durrant over the years jac eased back after the grilling at both trials little point in putting him through it again now especially if he might later need his cooperation in answering more questions jac shrugged durrant has some doubts in his own mind about his guilt mainly because of some promises he made to his family at the time but that on its own isnt really sufficient to telephone the thought hit jac in that instant like a thunderbolt hed called thallerey from his home telephone that first morning and been told at the time that he was away till later in the week at a medical convention thats how theyd made the link and knew that he was keen to see thallerey plus also found out where thallerey was the other call hed made at that same time had been to truelle truelle the desk and the room beyond suddenly seemed more distant jacs ears ringing with the sudden bloodrush to his head truelle was eyeing him curiously jac blinked slowly as he fought to regain some clarity im sorry i i know this might seem a strange question but has there been any interference with your phones recently either here or at your home someone perhaps listening in no i i dont believe so slight hesitation from truelle fazed by the sudden change of direction or something else at the back of his mind jac pressed him again or anything thats happened with your car recently that might have looked like an accident on the face of it or come close to it or any other incident where you feel your life might have been put in danger why in what way as crazy as jac knew he risked sounding he felt he had to say something if theyd monitored and targeted himself they might well have done the same with others which meant truelle could be next with a fresh breath he explained about his recent encounter with a truck his brakes failing and his car plunging into lake pontchartrain i was lucky to escape alive jac said truelles face had clouded his hands now clenched tight together jac shrugged as if to make light of it the police say that it was an accident natural failure though i have strong doubts and with the call i made just before coming here in which i learnt that dr thallerey died last night also in a car accident i now believe i was right to have those doubts truelle looked perplexed struggling to make sense of what jac was saying and as he asked who dr thallerey was and got jacs answer he in turn blinked slowly heavily no doubt thinking along similar lines why on earth would anyone kill jessica roches old obstetrician i i dont see truelle said gesturing once more with his hands me neither as to why jac shrugged all i know is that i phoned to arrange to see dr thallerey then the next day he was dead and the other person i phoned that same morning was yourself dr truelle jac saw it hit truelle then saw him flinch but it was almost as if it was a blow hed been halfprepared for he looked anxious more than surprised and you you think that i might be next truelles voice was tremulous his attempt at a weak smile lopsided of course it might all be just coincidence jac grimaced tautly but it would have been remiss of me not to say anything though obviously ill know more once ive jac stopped himself then struck as to just why truelle might not have at the same time been targeted or at least one good reason why and suddenly some of truelles words rather than politely enquiring became more ominous anything at this stage that might have given you cause for concernbut apart from that nothing particularly untoward truelle had been fishing for what jac might know jacs pulse throbbed tight at his temples he had to get out of here now couldnt risk saying any more though with his lips suddenly dry and his tongue sticking to the roof of his mouth it felt as if hed hardly be able to jac checked his watch and mumbled an excuse about an urgent appointment hed suddenly remembered hed forgot to rearrange and with a hasty goodbye and thanks for the information on durrants sessions he left the office of a somewhat bemused leonard truelle in on it with them the thought haunted jac over the following days he called bob stratton from a payphone and asked if he knew anyone good to make a soundbug sweep of his apartment if its just a basic check and sweep i can do it myself but if it looks like its going to get complicated i gotta couple of names stratton arranged to come round his place at six oclock that evening straight after work but lets first sit in my car parked in front and map out a game plan we dont want your snoopers if youve got them to know what were up to strattons car instructions took only a few minutes jac followed them as he went ahead of stratton back into his apartment put on a cd and turned it up loud bruce hornsby had been top of the cd stack and the first track was the way it is its heavy piano cadence filled the room as stratton moved silently and deftly around swaying a small metal probe from side to side stratton kept his eyes glued to its monitor needle as he went the atmosphere was tense the heavy music jarring on jacs nerves as he watched stratton expectantly no talking throughout some intermittent hand signals from stratton only giving jac half a guide as to what had been found stratton finished his sweep just as hornsbys second track was starting he motioned jac out to the corridor to deliver his verdict all clear on your open spaces lounge and bedrooms which means we dont really need to be standing here like two cia spooks but you were right about stratton broke off as mrs orwins door opened across the corridor though his you want something stare had obviously been honed to perfection over the years jac had never seen her door shut so quickly as i was saying you were right about the phone bug but its connection activated switches on only as you pick up its not picking up anything else youre saying in the apartment jac nodded thoughtfully hed noticed stratton keep his finger on the cradle button as hed lifted the receiver and carefully inspected so just the phone confirming it as if it was a lesser issue that hed somehow got off lightly belied how jac felt a shiver ran up his spine as he thought about the many conversations hed had that had been listened in to his mum and jeanmarie john langfranc alaysha and then rodriguez coultaine and his calls to arrange to see truelle and thallerey that had finally targeted him to be killed okay okay jac eased a burdened sigh how do we get rid of it we dont stratton said shrugging not that is without them knowing jacs eyebrows knitted with the impact the bug had so far had on his life he couldnt bear the thought of it being around a second longer stratton gestured towards the apartment he didnt want to explain on the corridor they went back into the apartment and jac turned down bruce hornsby think about it jac stratton said if youre right in your assumption whoevers bugging you has already tried to kill you because theyre afraid of what you might find out if we remove the bug theyre gonna panic even more thinking youre up to all sorts they dont know about stratton shrugged as he viewed jacs discomfort fear of the unknown odds are theyll try again to get rid of you but how will leaving it in help especially given the sort of conversations im having right now on the durrant case because you can use it for a handy bit of disinformation stratton smiled slyly as he saw the first spark of realization hit jac you make sure that all vital calls on the durrant case are made on your cellphone and you warn all potential incoming callers of the same nothing surrounding the durrant case to ever come in on your landline here he nodded towards the phone then to complete the picture having primed a few key people on your cellphone you call on your landline here and tell them that youre not going to be doing anything further on the durrant case youve looked at every possible angle but it appears hopeless trying to prove his innocence the whole thing now rests with governor candaret as to whether he gets clemency or not jac mirrored strattons smile so they think ive given up and meanwhile ive got free rein without having to worry about watching my back yeah and you can even play things up some more if you want you set up a call to your phone here someone claiming theyve got vital information on the durrant case youre officially off it you say but if its that vital okay youll meet them they then give you the name of some hotel in rio or montevideo and a time for the meet meanwhile you sit back here with your feet up and raise a glass knowing that youve sent them on a wild goose chase halfway across the world as uncomfortable as jac felt leaving the bug in place the thought of being able to mislead whoever it was get some of his own back was irresistible jac arched a sharp eyebrow youve done this before yeah stratton smiled wanly just a few times while jac had been right about the phone bug he wouldnt know whether his other suspicion truelle being involved somehow was right until some days had passed which brought a smile to alayshas face when he explained the rationale behind his thinking let me get this straight alaysha said taking the first sip of the red bordeaux jac had just poured for her if over the coming days truelle is killed or as happened with you theres an attempt on his life then hes probably one of the good guys but if he remains alive then most likely hes one of the bad guys is that about it yes more or less jac shrugged awkwardly unless theres some other reason why unlike myself and thallerey he cant be targeted alayshas mouth skewed half quizzical half humorous sounds like one of those old witchcraft trials if she sinks and drowns then shes okay if she floats and lives then she must be a witch youre not exactly going to be able to phone him after the event and congratulate him on passing the test hey youre okay after all lets go for a drink and talk some more jac held one hand out smiling dryly unless that is like me he survives the attempt yeah yeah alaysha agreed gleefully taking another sip of wine durrant case survivors club maybe you can have tags printed hold a little convention i couldnt have done more with truelle jac introduced a more sober tone i told him what happened with me and warned him he could be next well thats really going to brighten the coming days for him the darker heavier side of their light banter hit them both at the same time alayshas expression fell sharply and she reached out and gently stroked jacs cheek with the palm of one hand oh jac jac have you thought seriously about giving up throwing in this whole thing with durrant i mean youre only durrants lawyer for gods sake not his keeper and protector and certainly not at the risk of your own life yeah he nodded slowly i thought about it a lot especially in those last days recovering in the hospital jac took a sip of his own wine as he focused his thoughts his eyes staying on the glass for a second as if the greyness of the lake might somehow lay beyond the red sure i was scared out of my wits thinking about how close i came to death and now i have the knowledge that it probably wasnt an accident along with the worry that they might try again but against that and not just because i promised to try and help i cant shift durrant from my mind cut off from his family for eleven years his life ruined and his death now only seventeen days away unless by some miracle he does get clemency a certainty and everyone else has given up on him as a lost cause deserted him apart from young joshua something tugged at the back of jacs mind about durrant that harked back to his own fathers death but he just couldnt bring whatever it was to the forefront he shook his head i cant desert him as well especially not now what makes now so different to before because however much the evidence against durrant appears overwhelming what happened with me and now dr thallerey convinces me of one thing theres something crucial im missing something these people are keen for me not to find out if only i could discover what alaysha shook her head but its not just what jac you have no idea who who is trying to kill you true that would certainly help know thy enemy ill make a note to ask them when they next make contact then held one hand up in apology as he became more serious i know what youre saying alaysha but like i said it would be wrong to give up on durrant right now just when ive seen the first strong sign that he might be innocent alaysha looked at him levelly sombrely even though it might end up costing you your life jac jac could see the brewing stormclouds in her eyes weighted emotions struggling for balance one part of her admiring what he was doing in trying to save durrants life the other questioning the terrible risk he was taking he couldnt tell which one held sway i know i know jac closed his eyes for a second in submission as if accepting some of that weight and concern shed already almost lost him once understandable that she wouldnt want to go through that again but hopefully this little ploy of bob strattons will take their eye off of me take most of the heat and danger away as alaysha looked down for a second in muted acceptance she noticed that her hands were trembling all this talk of danger and lives threatened had got to her though not just because of jacs plight shed read the small entry in the timespicayune just the day before he was noted only as missing but now with his family receiving no contact for two weeks the police were beginning to fear the worst her mind had gone into a whitehot spin wondering when the knock might come at her own door and shed be next to go missing butterflies of unease writhed in her stomach made her feel queasy she gripped her hand tighter on her wine glass to kill the trembling as she raised it and looked up again at jac hopefully she said and took another sip but jac could see that his attempt at reassurance had done little to shift her concern the stormclouds still lingered in her eyes so gary did more lines this week how many three and did you show your parents not at first but i think they they kinda guessed so in the end i did show them what he did and were they upset a little sure but at least now they dont blame me any more they seem to accept that its gary doing them not me truelle nodded pensively one of his most intriguing cases fourteenyearold boy brad fieschek recommended by social services due to selfmutilation discovered by his parents three months back although it had probably being going on for some time before that the marks were thin knife or razor cuts on his arms and sometimes wrists lines had quickly become his comfortzone term for them truelle discovered possibly to soften the impact in his mind because some of the cuts had been so deep that when made on his wrists his parents were convinced that it was a suicide attempt but from there the case became deeper and darker still because brad claimed a secondary character gary was making the lines perhaps again to push away what was happening to him but the worry now was that schizophrenia was developing and that this secondary character might become increasingly violent the selfmutilation would get worse it was a case that required all of his attention all his skills and so he should have known better than to schedule his meeting with jac mcelroy for earlier that day truelle noticed his hand starting to shake again and pressed his pen firmer on his pad to steady it hed broken the golden rule when with the excuse to his secretary that he was grabbing a coffee from the deli hed had a quick shot of bourbon before his appointment with mcelroy it steadied his hands slightly but he kept them clasped as much as possible during the meeting to mask any remaining telltale signs he popped back a few peppermints to kill any smell on his breath then sprayed himself with some cologne from his office cabinet just to make sure but the shaking in his hands was back after talking to mcelroy with a vengeance phones bugged an attempt on mcelroys life jessica roches obstetrician killed he managed somehow to brave it through the one remaining patient session before lunch then dived out to the nearest bar what hed intended as just one more shot quickly became two then three the bourbon did little to quell his churning thoughts but at least took most of the tremble out of his hands he looked at them again now still not too heavy a tremble not too noticeable he focused past them to his notepad and took a fresh breath and as i suggested last time have you asked gary to stop no no i havent why not because because im afraid brads eyes flickered uncertainly im afraid thatll make him angry will just make it worse hell give me more lines looked like hed taken out those phone bugs and changed his insurance policies just in time if he hadnt hed have probably gone the same way as thallerey by now i can understand that but you know as we also discussed last time if you dont confront gary hell just become bolder it could become worse anyway i know but like i said im afraid i just dont know what to do confront them know what to do afraid truelles hands were starting to shake harder he clenched them tightly maybe it should be him laying on the couch maybe he could get one of his old colleagues from new york to pull him apart guide him through what to do pull him apart before he fell apart he swallowed took a fresh breath but sometimes brad however hard it might seem at the time we have to confront our worst fears i know otherwise they just become stronger i know doc i know brad biting at his bottom lip close to tears but sometimes its difficult i know truelle in that moment feeling as if he wanted to join brad in bursting into tears he dabbed at some sweat beads on his forehead with the back of one hand and uh have you been able to find out why gary is doing this why hes giving you the lines brad looked quizzically at truelle his eyebrows furrowing yes we discussed that at my last session of course of course truelle covered quickly reminding himself what i meant was have you been able to probe more about that with gary you were never really satisfied with what he said because you thought that you were pleasing your parents with what you did i could try but i dont think hed tell me its like like his little secret his main hold over me knowing better than me what might please my parents truelle knew that he should have stopped the session there he was far too distracted as mcelroy had been maybe it had been due to thallereys death but then what had mcelroy suddenly thought of to make him cut everything short and head off in such a rush and why on earth had they killed thallerey how could he possibly have presented a threat truelle pressed his hands firmer against his notepad as the shaking ran deeper but this time the pad simply started shaking as well oh god help me help me truelle battled his way through the remaining twenty minutes of the session keeping his comments concise and simple so that he didnt make any more mistakes but when he finally ushered brad out his secretary cynthia seeing truelle pale and shaky enquired has it got worse it took truelle a second to detach from his own thoughts and realize that she was talking about the boy not him no no much the same as before with brad he shook his head its just a small fever that seems to have hit me cancel and rearrange my last two sessions today would you he headed back into his office without waiting for a response went into the adjoining washroom and splashed water on his face as he leant over the sink straightening up his head was still burning as if about to explode his eyes pinpricks unable to fully focus on his reflection and his hands shaking worse than ever maybe he should head out and get another drink or two to steady them again but he knew that if he did it would end up as four or five and by the next day hed be on half a bottle a day or two after that a full bottle and so he stayed in the same position hands gripped tight to the edge of the sink as if it were the last planks of a sinking ship that he dared not let go of does durrant know yet that you cant do any more not yet im heading out there tomorrow to tell him nelm had already heard the taped calls once at farrelias so wound through to the main highlights mcelroy on the phone to mike coultaine so thats it now last time youll be seeing him apart from sitting in with him for the bop hearing or if theres something else needed connected with the clemency plea but thats going to be the only focus now from hereon in it all rests with whether or not candaret feels generoushearted coultaine consoled that at least hed given it a shot before they signed off nelm wound forward to mcelroys following call to pat coyne i know that my colleague john langfranc said that id probably be following up on some details that wont now be happening ive decided theres nowhere left to go with it apart from the dna i just cant get my mind past durrant describing that final shot to the head particularly since you held that back from all releases i understand me neither and ive had twelve long years to think it over but thanks for your time and the information you gave nelm wound forward to the next call this time incoming and left on mcelroys answerphone jac jennifer jennifer bromwell i heard all about your accident your sister jeanmarie kept me up to date i didnt visit the hospital because well i i understood your girlfriend was there much of the time but i hear from jeanmarie that youre fine now so this is to wish you well and also to ask and id understand perfectly if you didnt think you were well enough yet for it about one of those dates we discussed i sneaked off to see kelvin a couple of nights back but theres something coming up in a few nights thatll be hard for me to find an excuse for so if you thought you could oblige call me nelm stopped the tape and smiled thinly hardly got his pulse back and mcelroys convoluted lovelife was fullon again screwing his lapdancing neighbour while playing charades with this second girl shame though it wasnt about to get more complicated thought nelm hed already started to bring the lapdancers exboyfriend gerry strelloff into play only a few words spoken on his anonymous call but effective and as much as roche would be pleased to hear that mcelroy had finally thrown in the towel with durrant nelm couldnt help feel disappointed that they wouldnt now be taking things to the next stage his plan for mcelroy had without doubt been his best yet nelm picked up the phone as it rang he tapped a finger slowly at its side something nagged at the back of his mind about mcelroys recent calls but the thought hadnt sufficiently formed to be worth mentioning to roche he simply told it how it appeared didnt look like mcelroy was going to be giving them any more grief try try and remember durrant looked at jac levelly you think i havent tried time and over again these past long years to remember more fill the gaps havent had too much else worth thinking about durrant shook his head smiling crookedly you think its all going to magically come back to me just because youre pushing i know jac closed his eyes for a second in acceptance but this could be our last shot at this larry our very last shot dont you think i know that too durrant arched an eyebrow sharply believe me im trying raking and going over everything ive ever recalled these past years every damn thing they were on the same side now pulling in the same direction but it would have been easy to believe from their often heated exchange of the past halfhour that they werent still stuck in the same mould of jac pushing hard and durrant resisting except that this time it was durrants lack of memory providing the resistance trying to push beyond the shadows that shrouded his life of twelve years ago the effort creasing and raising sweat on his brow the room they were in was hot and claustrophobic no windows no oneway mirror with guards looking on no faint murmur or sounds of the prison beyond the surrounding walls were sixteeninches of thick concrete jac had requested privacy from haveling and had got it in spades theyd been allocated one of librevilles quiet rooms originally constructed for prisoners whod gone mad so that their ranting and screaming didnt disturb anyone prisoners or guards theyd hardly been used since the opening of a dedicated sanatorium wing twelve years ago back in those dark days inmates would be leatherstrapped to beds and chairs bolted to the floor now the room was completely bare and a small table and two chairs had been brought in jac and durrant sat facing each other their voices echoed faintly in the bare concrete room the silence when they werent talking so absolute that when the door spyhatch had been slid back eight minutes ago the only guard check so far it had sounded like a rifle shot making them jump on the table between them were jacs handheld recorder its cassette slowly turning and his notepad jac took a fresh breath okay lets see what weve got he flicked back a page in his notes then to the front again these regular pool games were usually tuesday thursday or saturday nights with no particular pattern as to which night thats right it was usually one of those nights at most two in the week but not too often durrant grimaced some of the guys didnt want to get flak from staying out half the week you say some of the guys did that not include you from what i remember i was better after josh was born durrant shrugged lamely but i was still drifting off some nights to other bars durrant caught jacs look dont ask cause i hardly remembered then let alone now the only one that i ended up recalling probably from reading coleridge was the aint showin mariner along marais street if i remember right durrant smiled briefly the rest of what he was reaching for sinking back quickly into shadow probably changed hands a dozen times since jac made a brief note before looking up again anywhere else you can think of there was a regular poker game i used to go to but that was always on a friday if it was on sometimes wed miss a week or anyone else that you could have been with that night durrant thought briefly not that i can think of and thats not just because it might have slipped from my memory after the accident i just dont think there was anyone i was seeing then at least not regularly so no other women then durrant smiled slyly i know that was what franny thought some nights i was out but no it was just me and my pool buddies or me and a hand of cards or me and a bottle or if truelles tape and the evidence is right durrants expression darkened me and more house breakins aint no damsel suddenly going to come out of the wings to save my ass okay jac held durrants gaze for a second before nodding his acceptance going back to these pool games at the bayou brew if you cant remember which night your game might have been the week of jessica roches murder could anyone else there durrant shook his head slowly doubt it when i was arrested already six months had passed even if i had remembered the game then as a possible alibi and the police had talked to the people there theyd have had problems remembering by then when i did finally recall the pool games and one of my playing buddies nat hadley were talking three years later just before the appeal coultaine spoke to him on the phone but he couldnt remember which night it was that week now twelve years on forget it thursday night that was the crucial night jac had circled it on his notepad if durrant had been playing pool then and had stayed until pm then he couldnt have been halfway across town killing jessica roche what about the other two in the game bill saunders and ted levereaux durrant blinked slowly i couldnt remember either of them back then still cant picture them fully even now their names were given to coultaine by hadley coultaine spoke to saunders but he couldnt recall which night it was either and levereaux he wasnt able to contact hed moved to st louis then apparently on again from the last number given jac nodded pensively he could try to locate levereaux it was an unusual enough name that it shouldnt be that difficult to track down and perhaps go back also to the other two to try and jog their memories but as durrant had pointed out what were the chances of anyone remembering after twelve years thered have been other people there though jac reminded himself bar staff waitresses perhaps people on set shifts that would have a better chance of remembering which night it might have been jac asked did coultaine try any of the bar staff at bayou brew no he never got into that durrant shrugged but again were facing that twelveyear gap staff all longgone bar changed hands or maybe even isnt there any longer but as durrants shoulders slumped jac found himself more firedup work rosters payslips giving working times maybe even someone who kept a diary jac shared his thoughts with durrant weve only got to find one person who used to keep some sort of written record and weve struck gold were not relying on twelveyearold memories any more yeah suppose so durrant agreed half hopeful half sneer dont have much else worth trying then sudden afterthought he shrugged and smiled wanly that is if theyve still got those records or diaries after twelve years jac nodded soberly rubbing one temple something vital and elemental had changed between himself and durrant since their last meeting before durrant had been indolent uncooperative now he was helpful cooperative and finally appreciative of what jac was doing thered been a maudlin moment when jac started the interview and durrant looked across at him meaningfully his eyes moistening i went hard on you last time and im sorry for that it wasnt called for you put your neck out for me and theres not many would do that but with me being such an ass you might have got the impression i dont appreciate what youre doing but that aint so i do durrant twisted his mouth as if something still didnt quite sit comfortably only total honesty would do or rather maybe i didnt last time but now i do youre all right but there was still something holding durrant back and often he was still defeatist though where before hed been couldntcareless and relaxed now he was tense and anxious perhaps it was that death was now that much closer only fifteen days away and it was finally hitting him given that and the fact that everything tried before had failed jac could hardly blame durrant for looking on the downside with contact again from josh no doubt he did now want to live cling to hope as jac had earlier sold him so hard on but worn down by the trial the failed appeal the long years of imprisonment abandoned by his family for much of it and throughout it all not even sure whether he had committed the murder or not hed probably given up long ago on just how that might be achieved distant dream a handful of old poolbuddies and the bar they used to play at now his only remaining hope jac spent a while filling in details those that durrant could remember then stopped the tape faint rustling shuffling alaysha went to the door and looked through the spyhole nobody there she cupped one hand over her far ear to mask the sounds of molly watching rugrats in the lounge no sounds now either second time in the past half hour she thought shed heard something probably just people passing on the corridor or mrs orwin shuffling around and being nosy rather than anyone hanging around outside shed been anxious and on edge ever since gerry had called at her door particularly with what hed shouted through the forced gap shed countered quickly that he couldnt say anything because hed be implicated too thats the beauty of it babe i was just a gobetween made an introduction all that was ever passed to me in envelopes at the bar were receipts its the courier theyll be looking for and thats you babe thats you then when shed read the news clipping the other day her nervousness had leapt to a new level maybe gerry had already said something and theyd started targeting those involved maybe the knock would come at her door at any minute and she tried to put it out of her mind concentrate on what she should prepare for dinner for herself and molly but opening the fridge and kitchen cupboard doors she found herself staring blankly at their contents unable to focus on anything and when the bell did ring a couple of minutes later it made her jump a voice partly muffled by the tv came through the door its okay alaysha its jac molly was quickly on her feet confirming it as alaysha passed her to answer the door its jac mommy its jac i know i know alaysha felt the weight ease from her chest probably the sound a moment ago had been jac going into his apartment or perhaps hed disturbed whoever was in the corridor if there was anyone she slid back the top lock and turned the door handle as she unhooked the chain with her other hand then as she caught the shape of who was there before hed even looked up fully beyond the baseball cap peak partly obscuring his face she went to ram it shut again she broke two fingernails clawing the chain back on but she couldnt get the door closed the last inch gerrys weight was quickly against the other side pushing hard so that is his fucking name jac your new boyfriend dont know what youre talking about stock reaction breathless from the exertion of pushing against the door her mind scrambling for how he might have found out yes you do and you sounded real pleased to hear it was him never answered the door that quick to me even when we were at our hottest what are you doing here gerry you got my lawyers letter yeah i got your smarmy fuckin lawyers letter he thrust harder against the door as he said it and she couldnt hold it back any longer it burst hard against the chain rattling is that gerry mommy wh whys he being like that alaysha looked back at molly a few paces away pulling anxiously at a few strands of hair trying to be adult to cope with the situation alayshas anger surged fuelling a whitehot adrenalin burst she barged the door back an inch felt the satisfaction of a grunt from gerry as he took the impact i wont have it gerry i wont have you coming round here terrifying molly were getting a court restraining order yer hear you come round here again next stop for you is a jail cell yeah challenging sliding into a mocking chuckle you do that and youre dead babe youre gerry broke off as mrs orwins door opened behind him and as he halfturned with the distraction alaysha managed to shove the door closed the last inch and flip back the latch there were a few words spoken between mrs orwin and gerry that alaysha couldnt make out clearly beyond her ragged breathing and pounding heart last time gerry called mrs orwin had been late in opening her door no doubt because shed been watching some soap at decibels alaysha swallowed holding her breath for a second listening silence for a second then a light tapping at her door gerry or mrs orwin alaysha looked through the spyhole gerry was silently mouthing something which she couldnt make out obviously he didnt want to audibly threaten with mrs orwin still looking on through the gap in her door but shielded from mrs orwins view by his body the signal he made with one hand was unmistakeable a gun pointing his thumb flicking down like the hammer striking gerry brought his face closer as he mouthed a kiss goodbye his features warped all the more by the fisheye of the spyhole jac looked at the rain on the cafe window as he took the first sips of his coffee large splatters spaced a second apart which had been enough to bring him in from the street teasing warning of the deluge to come and when it did arrive a minute later the patter building like the drumming of impatient fingers before finally bursting loose jac could hardly see the street beyond for the water running down the glass everything became a blurred pastel grey yo okay there jac maybe wanna nother po boy no im okay henny thanks then as henny saw him look thoughtfully back through the window don worry mackll sho hes slow an sometime annoyin as hell but he ain forgetful not yet at leas jac nodded and smiled again no problem im here early because of the rain momma henshaw more affectionately henny or sometimes momma henpeck because of the cafe shed run for the past twentyfive years the red rooster a regular ninth ward landmark according to some of the locals jac had spoken to an she one of yo best hopes fo information on anythin and everythin from roun here specially from years back jacs enquiries hadnt been getting far the bayou brew was now jayjay cools the new owner jay cole had been there three years and knew only the name of the guy hed bought it from not any of its history before that and i think he only had the place two years so i aint sure how far back his recall would go either but i can give you his name and number jac took them and phoned on his cellphone minutes later miraculously given his luck so far it was answered on the second ring but he too only remembered the name of the owner in turn before him rob harlenson who jac had already discovered died two years ago from bill saunders the only one of durrants old poolbuddies hed so far tracked down he didnt know the old staff or the head barman hadnt kept any of them on when he took over jac was particularly interested in mack elliott the old head barman from the bayou brew with harlenson dead elliott might be the only one to know about past staff records and rosters just who might have been working the night jessica roche was killed and whether that could possibly have been durrant and his buddies pool night saunders didnt know where he might find elliott jac looked at the other two names on his pad nat hadley and ted levereaux hed phoned hadley yesterday and was told by his wife that he worked night shifts jac had left his cellphone number but no call back as yet the trail with levereaux petered out at his last known address in st louis and while it might be an unusual name a search in all states south from missouri to louisiana had alone brought up one hundred and twelve seventeen with initials e or t jac had phoned nine of the seventeen e amp ts before it got too close to midnight to be calling any more and if the phone was in levereauxs wifes name hed have to trawl through all hundred and twelve jac felt worn down by it all the endless phone calls delays deadends the headshakes as hed asked about mack elliott or any of the old staff at the bayou brew and as durrant rightly pointed out even if and when he did track them down what on earth were they going to remember after twelve years jac had a sinking desolate feeling that hed still be tramping the streets of the ninth ward and making phone calls that went nowhere as they strapped durrant down for his injection only thirteen days left now and as henny had seen jacs hand shaking lifting his coffee cup his gaze through the window weary and lost shed asked if he was okay the light was sinking fast through the window of the red rooster as if mirroring jacs mood he was only able to get to the ninth ward at lunchtimes and after work as dusk was falling now second night there the rain and clouds had smothered the remaining light even quicker the only brief spark of hope had appeared earlier towards the end of his lunchtime visit when sixth or seventh headshake on mack elliott or the old bayou brew someone finally pointed him towards hennys cafe but henny had already seen him through the window asking questions in the street with one of her old regulars izzy lifting a bony finger her way and so she had one hand on her hip to greet jac as he walked in whats a white bo like you doin askin questions roun the ninth ward yo a cop or yjus got a death wish no im a lawyer henny arched one eyebrow extravagantly oooh yo have gotta death wish jac explained about durrant and trying to track down mack elliott or any of the old bayou brew staff henny nodded thoughtfully taking the hand from her hip and gesturing to a table tryin to save larry durrants neck put a differen complexion on it but yo still wanna be careful askin questions roun the ninth whit bo in a nice suit an all yo might not be able to spit alla dat out befo someone takes yo head off with a shotgun henny gave jac a potted guide to the ninth ward safe around the main jazz clubs on st claude avenue but venture a couple of blocks either way and it was a dangerous nomans land particularly at night and particularly if you were white almost exclusively africanamerican the birthplace of louis armstrong fats domino and a long list of jazz greats through the years on one side the ninth ward had a rich and proud cultural heritage but on the other its gritty underbelly was still dirt poor and a place that half the citys muggers robbers and drug dealers called home the police never ventured too deep into the lower ninth at night unless they were two or three strong hands close by their guns in readiness and if yo were fool nough to drift sfar as tricou or dalery on the north side presumin yo was still alive by dat point you might swell jus phone the funeral parlo befo yo get dere tell em where tpick up yo body jac smiled looked like hed survived so far through ignorance and luck with hennys cafe now at least one safe haven and most importantly she did know mack elliott and where to get hold of him and had phoned him to arrange a meeting at her cafe duck gumbo dirty rice boiled crawfish beef pboy hennys was noted for its grassroots creole cuisine her reputation stretching far beyond the ninth ward nofrills but homely with red plastic tablecloths a gospel version of praise you played in the background one that jac hadnt heard before the sort of place where youd expect aretha franklin to suddenly stand up from a table and burst into song or the blues brothers start doing somersaults through instead mack elliott walked in tall rangy slightly hunched over with age or perhaps through constantly reaching down to greet people henny called over to jac that it was him otherwise he wouldnt have known and as jac stood to shake macks hand whether just hopeful thinking or the setting sun dipping below the cloud layer he thought he saw fresh light hanging over mack elliotts shoulder but what jac didnt notice as they sat back down and started talking was the dark maroon pontiac bonneville parked thirty yards back on the opposite side of the street nelm sat inside obscured by the fading light and the water running down his windscreen hed only started following jac again earlier that day but already he was beginning to wonder alaysha couldnt stay there any longer every small sound movement on the corridor mrs orwin or someone else further along opening their door the faint hum of the refrigerator the muted sounds of neighbours from the floor above twisted her nerves another notch tighter made her worry that gerry might head back to try and get in again or someone else threatening far worse she couldnt shift that last image of gerry from her head the gun pointing the trigger hammer going down it would be okay if jac was there feel him hugging her tight stroking her hair consoling theyd sink themselves deep into a bottle of good chateauneuf but still she wouldnt be able to tell him everything shed been listening out but still no sounds of him opening his door or moving around where was he she felt alone vulnerable unprotected unprotected as soon as the thought hit her she turned to molly come on molly were going over to your granmas halfway over to carrollton in the taxi molly asked am i staying at granmas tonight no no im just picking something up there then remembering that with all the fuss shed forgotten to cook dinner and well get a pizza on the way back yeah yeah pizza pizza alaysha pulled molly in close her smile fading back to taut anxiety unseen by molly as she nestled one cheek against her daughters hair alaysha wondered if her mother still had the gun an old colt shed got hold of when shed finally kicked out alayshas father fearful that hed return any day to give her an even worse beating same too now with gerry shed explain but again she wouldnt be able to tell her mother everything that would have to stay her secret just her and gerrys jacs own breathing within the hood all he could hear all he could feel his own hot breath bouncing back at him stewing his pounding head all the more and the occasional prod with the gun in his back move mofucker move this way yeah whats wrong yo blind or somethin brief chuckle but one from what jac had seen of the two edgy bugeyed teenagers before the hoods were put on him and mack elliott that could easily end with an impatient gunshot for stepping the wrong way or saying the wrong thing or because the kids last few hours on their gameboys had been frustrating jac was beginning to think this wasnt such a good idea as jac had halfexpected mack elliott hadnt been able to recall which night durrants pool game was the week of jessica roches murder long time ago now long time i know but i wondered if you might have kept a diary or anything with old work rosters that could give a clue no fraid not then seconds later his sullen thoughtfulness lifted might be a chance of yo striking lucky though might jus be a chance mack explained that there were two eighthour shifts at the bayou brew with a barman and waitress for each one and himself and the owner rob harlenson alternately running the bar and one of the barmen lenny rillet used to keep a diary though not fo the best of reasons mack looked down at that moment thoughtful troubled as he weighed something up probably the best shot youre gonna get at it though cmon youll be safe wi me mack explained as they headed deeper into the ninth ward lenny rillet used to keep a diary because he was dealing drugs from behind the bar small stuff then packets of marijuana and speed for which hed enter times names weights and payments in his diary in code harlenson was already suspicious found one o the diaries one day and finally got rid of lenny but that was way after larry durrant wen down and i know lenny used to hang on to those diaries cause in each one hed have new names an contact numbers business resource yo might call it specially with how things turned out later wi lenny rillet had either left drugdealing for a while or stayed so small time that nobody noticed but then suddenly five years ago hed burst back on the scene big time and now was one of the ninth wards main crack dealers only a couple o blocks away now well be there soon jac felt his anxiety mount as they sank deeper into the shadows of the ninth ward now four blocks from hennys the efforts at revival with reformations or newer community blocks started to fray giving way to rows of older houses many of them dilapidated or derelict the light was sparser too with many of the streetlamps smashed the shadows in between heavier more worrying a wino suddenly appeared from one dark patch making them jump though mack commented that he was probably playing lookout for someone then only twenty yards on two sets of eyes emerged from the darkness of a car on bricks watching them warily as they passed don worry youll be safe with me now hes one of the ninths main crack dealers you might swell jus phone the funeral parlo befo yo get dere late fifties mack elliott was already slightly out of breath though maybe that was partly anxiety too jac thought because suddenly he wasnt so sure how safe theyd be certainly the nods and smiles of acknowledgment mack gave to the few people they passed were now tighter more hesitant and as they came to the row of eight halfderelict shotgun houses that lenny rillet apparently called home and mack announced himself as an old frien of rillets and the hoods were slipped on them by two armed teenagers jacs foreboding settled deeper shotgun houses were four or five rooms stacked back to back with no corridor so called because if you fired a shotgun at the front the bullet would pass through every room in the last minute of their approach mack had explained that rillet would move from room to room he could be in the second room of the fourth house or third room back on the sixth nobody ever knew and all visitors were hooded and spun round several times to disorientate them before being led through two or three armed teenage clockers out front half a dozen or more inside plus two or three older more experienced guards few people knew what rillet looked like and the chances of getting to him before catching a bullet were remote thats how hes managed to stay alive sfar and now the smells as they were led through stale musk urine faeces vomit a pungent burning like rubber mixed with rope and a faint chemical smell that jac couldnt place and now sounds muted mumbling coughing a few groans a sudden wild cackle subsiding to a chuckle and every few steps jac could feel debris or rubbish around his feet or maybe it was clothing and people something brushed past one ankle a hand reaching out or a rat jac felt himself descend deeper into hell with each step his head was burning inside the hood his pulse pounding at his temples his mouth dry each step had taken them further into the shadows and into danger away from the light and safety now within only fifteen minutes hennys cafe seemed a lifetime away ill be okay jac told himself mack had promised youll be safe with me but as he heard rillets tone greeting mack and the argument that ensued between them jac felt that last vestige of hope slip away he knew then that they were about to die why yo bring someone here mack he hes the lawyer tryin to save larry durrant thats why i brought im to see you uhhmmm larry durrant you think thats gonna score points wi me you an i we aint eyeballed each other in what six seven years so fo sure you don score no points there mack hes tryin to get some information on larrys movements at the brew from twelve years back i couldnt help with that and i thought yo might be able to an even when we used to see each other we din xactly swim in the same waters if yo know what i mean it was like two disparate conversations with neither party listening to the other mack desperately pleading his case of durrant and the bayou brew of twelve years ago while rillet was making it clear that their past association cut no ice and mack had made a big mistake in coming there mack took a fresh breath introduced a more hopeful tone thing is lenny i thought to myself while yo might not remember that far back you always kep those diaries as soon as the words left macks mouth it became chillingly clear that it was a step in the wrong direction sealed rather than saved their fates ooohh those diaries yeah funny thing that cause ya know i always suspected it was you that told harlenson bout them got my ass fired from the brew wasnt me lenny promise harlenson was already suspicious and he foun that diary that day all by hiself without no help from me i didn say nothin to him the desperation in macks voice was heavy clinging by his fingertips to what little ledge was left silence rillet let macks words hang in the air savouring his discomfort yo know mack thats where all your figurin has gone sadly wrong since you and i were on noddin terms i changed mo than yo can imagine ive had guys killed here simply cause i didn like the tones o their voices didn think they gave me nough respect or cause i thought a splash o red on the walls would bring the graffiti more to life resigned derisory snigger so wi the heavy doubt i got bout what you jus tol me what makes yo think nows gonna be any differen silence again heavy cloying and then breaking it after a second sounding deafeningly loud the slide on a gun being snapped back please lenny don do it im not here for myself im here tryin to save larry durrants ass nothin more silence again longer than before jac found that his breath was held his body starting to shake legs weakening as he anticipated the gunshot at any second thats the beauty of the hoods you cant see m face don know if im smilin scowlin makin the signal to fire or wavin my boyz gun arms away a purposeful pause rillet wallowing in their fear a conductors baton poise that could fall either way an even if i am smilin or wavin them away right now that could all quickly change jac jumped with rillets sudden clap only a foot behind himself and mack it was no doubt intended to resemble a gunshot jac was hit with the realization that rillet had probably done this before many times and that he relished the feeling of power it gave him over his victims and riding aboard that the hope however slim that it was just that a game and rillet wouldnt have them killed silence again rillet milking the tension for every ounce jacs breathing rapid and shallow within the hood his pulse doublebeat wondering whether next to expect a bullet or his hopes confirmed that it was just a game there was a bang then but it was too distant for a gunshot a door swinging open and banging back in one of the adjacent rooms then a frantic rustling as someone ran through the debris and prone bodies and a breathless urgent voice someone out fron come on der tail yo brought someone here mack rillet screamed no no were alone din bring nobody mack quavered struggling for conviction you fuckin brought someone here snoopin an that somethin i definitely aint got no movemen on and as quickly as jac felt hope enter his grasp it was slipping away again as nelm saw them turn into tricou street he thought twice about following them he didnt want to end up getting carjacked or his nice paintwork spraypainted or shot at by some punks a car just didnt look right on the north part of tricou unless it was rusted graffitid standing on bricks and stripped or pumped with bullet holes two bars visited questions on the street then the red rooster cafe now heading out with some black guy who looked like a retired basketball coach nelm knew that the ninth was larry durrants old stomping ground but then the same held true for seventy per cent of new orleans black criminals nelm was trying to get to the point where he knew what mcelroy was pursuing in the ninth something to do with durrant or a new client when he saw them enter the warren of dilapidated crack houses ahead he thought that he had his answer new client but then from what hed heard the guy operating on tricou lenny rillet was meant to be a heavy hitter and mcelroy was way down the feeding chain at his firm didnt normally get that calibre of client anything more complex than a straightforward plea petition and he wouldnt have been let within a mile of the durrant case nelm decided to keep watching see what might transpire or where mcelroy might head next that would make all the pieces finally slot into place nelm saw the fifteenyearold clocker come out and give the street a quick up and down onceover but sixty yards down on the opposite side it didnt seem hed taken much notice of nelms presence the clocker though at the same time as heading in to alert rillet also signalled his buddy towards the back of the shotgun houses a routine theyd played out several times before the second clocker headed along the back yards of the neighbouring houses and slipped out again onto the road forty yards behind nelms car nelm didnt see him at first he only picked up a shadowy flicker of movement when the clocker had already scampered twenty yards closer and as nelm focused intently on his rearview mirror to be sure of what he thought hed seen there was movement too from ahead with the first clocker starting to head his way ohh shiiiiii nelm hit his ignition slammed into drive and swung out flooring it a shot came from behind thudding into metal somewhere on his trunk and now the clocker ahead was moving into aiming stance an ignoble epitaph that would be killed by two clockers barely in puberty nelm headed straight for the clocker ahead ducking down at the same time he heard the shot zing past saw the kid start squaring for a second shot but nelm was bearing down fast less than ten yards away the kid hesitated for an instant then realizing that nelms car would hit him halfway through firing he leapt out of the way as nelm flashed past nelm kept low heard two more shots one missed but the other hit his back window shattering it into a thousand icepellets breath held nelm did a quick selfcheck for injuries pain blood flesh or clothing fragments where they shouldnt be nothing he eased out again and swung off hard at the next cross street nelm was already fifty yards past the crack house as rillet came out with mack elliott and jac they had their hoods yanked off which jac could now see were white pillow cases rillet stood behind them looking clownish and ridiculous though nobody would dare tell him that in a george bush mask dubbya meets the kuklux klan in front of a crack house yo know that car o that man rillet asked mack answered first no never seen him befo an don know the car me neither jac echoed dont recognize the car or the man even at first sight the man inside had been little more than an indistinct shadow now he was a good seventy yards away silence again the george bush mask giving nothing away no sign of whether rillet accepted their claims or not but watching the fading brake lights of the pontiac bonneville as it turned off of tricou street jac was suddenly struck with an idea if he lived to implement it soon after alaysha had put molly to bed she took the gun out of her drawer and held it in her hand turning it slowly getting the feel of it flicking the safety catch on and off a colt cobra it felt heavy in her grip alien but at the same time reassuring her mother had been anxious about her taking it getting her to swear on the madonna and promise that she wouldnt use it unless your life is in danger because gerry has a gun too no i told you mom its just to frighten him off hes not going to come calling with a gun not him but the other knock she feared at her door was another matter theyd have a gun pointed through the gap before the chain was barely off she swallowed hard felt her hand trembling against the weapon in her grip sudden concern that if and when it came to it she wouldnt have the resolve to actually pull the trigger she gripped the gun in both hands and stood up bracing herself in aiming stance and after a second felt the trembling subside not completely but enough to squeeze off a shot without missing wildly alaysha went to put the gun back in the drawer but then at the last second decided it wasnt a good idea to have it anywhere within mollys reach she opened her wardrobe and put it on a high shelf tucked under a few of her clothes is that jac mcelroy yes yes it is i understand that youre handling the larry durrant case thats right because ive got some information that i think youll find interesting who is this thats not important but if you want some information thatll help crack the case you might want to talk to me thats very true i would so tell me what it is you know no not over the phone its too sensitive we should meet whoever told you that i was handling the durrant case should also have told you that im not that active on it right now the plea petitions already in so now were just waiting on its outcome jac sighed heavily but okay now youve intrigued me lets meet they arranged to meet at pm the next day at a coffee bar on camp street jac could walk round the corner at lunchtime from work the man said that hed be wearing a lightblue jacket and carrying a salmonpink folder under one arm it was all spy vs spy stuff but the next day sitting by the cafe window sipping at a latte jac wasnt looking out for the man he knew already that he wouldnt show the idea had come from strattons suggestion about a fake call on his land line to send his snoopers on a wild goose chase combined with alayshas comment from the other night but its not just what jac you have no idea who just who is trying to kill you the final catalyst had been seeing the pontiac bonneville speeding away from rillets crack house the other night if jacs fake caller claimed to have something juicy on the durrant case without doubt his snoopers would make sure to be there watching bob stratton in turn would then watch them note their registration number and take photos more spy stuff but at least jac would hopefully finally discover who wasnt keen on him digging too deep into the durrant case the next few days went by in a whirlwind as stratton suggested jac waited in the cafe twentyfive minutes past the appointment time before finally leaving stratton said that hed wait no more than fifteen minutes by then he should have been able to observe all he needed and take more than enough photos jac spoke briefly with stratton on his cell phone shortly after leaving the cafe it was a dark maroon pontiac bonneville as you suspected stratton confirmed i got the registration should have the results back on that tomorrow and enough photos of the guy in it to fill a wall black midforties salt and pepper hair tall wellbuilt but not heavy or stocky wirymuscly if you know what i mean now a description slightly the other way from durrant than his anonymous emailer less stocky slightly older that night jac had another bogus date with jennifer bromwell she was dropped off by her father tobias a squat bear of a man who beamed broadly and shook hands with jac through the open window of his mercedes s perhaps he suspected something and feared she might be meeting kelvin or wanted to check jac out in person blueblood lawyer okay but did he have one eye one leg or half his face tattooed jac felt slightly guilty at the subterfuge now having met mr bromwell he sat with jennifer for fifteen minutes in a bar talking about the club where kelvin was gigging that night and his own accident so sorry about that she said as she gingerly touched his forehead as if afraid he might still be delicate enough to crumble and then for the umpteenth time she thanked him for doing this just before heading off to see kelvin jac headed back to his apartment to hit the phones six more t or e levereaux to go two numbers constantly rang with no answer and another was on answerphone the three times hed tried hed left a message on his second call the same routine every time im trying to locate a ted levereaux that used to live in new orleans and worked at the bayou brew bar in the ninth ward between nineteenninety and ninetyfour and variations on the same answers each time weve never lived anywhere but st louis never worked in a bar my husbands an edward always known as eddy i was only thirteen in ninety couldnt work anywhere let alone a bar or just sorry got the wrong person jac felt numbed worn down by it all the questions and now the answers too starting to become mechanical and so when a teen boys voice said one minute ill get my pa jac took a second to snap his concentration back he checked on his pad to see which number it was one of the two that before had rung with no answer ted levereaux jac felt immediately more anxious a faint edge and tremor now in his voice when with the number of times hed been through the same introduction it should have come across as plain and matteroffact god in a bucket bayou brew that takes me back a ways levereaux exclaimed then realizing he perhaps should have done it the other way round question before commitment a wariness crept into his voice as he asked and why pray might you be enquirin mr mcelvey was it mcelroy jac mcelroy and jac went into the rest of his prepared speech that hed rarely had a chance to use larry durrant jessica roches murder possible alibi from the regular pool games he used to have if you could remember which night they might have played the week of her murder jeez hardly remember which nights i was there myself now you spoke to any of the others worked there then as jac went through the names and outlined what hed gained so far levereaux commented didnt know harlenson had died and my goodness good ol mack he still aroun still livin in the ninth you say levereaux went off at a tangent for a moment about how nice it would be to see mack again and catch up before bringing his focus back im sorry mr mcelroy don think i can be much help to yer too far back i wondered if you could try one thing for me try if you can to remember where you were when you heard jessica roche had been shot i mean was durrants pool game of that week before or after you heard the news because if you remember the news coming straight after the pool game the night before theres a high chance they coincided put the person in the moment jac had read somewhere that theyd remember more it wasnt quite the same as everyone recalling where they were when kennedy was shot but for new orleans jessica roches murder had been big news so the chances were reasonable hed done the same with mack elliott nat hadley and bill saunders elliott and saunders had said straight away that it didnt help they still couldnt recall anything but hadley had said hed call him back in twentyfour hours when hed had a chance to think it over yeah yeah know what you mean levereaux said and lapsed into thought muted sound of a tv in the background a womens voice talking above it for a moment snapshot of life at pm in st louis another to add to the brief soundbite snapshots jac had gained across half the south the past few nights sorry still can place much from that far back not straight off anyhow do you maybe want to think on it a bit jac prompted call me back yeah yeah okay levereaux said after a brief pause jac left his number and levereaux promised to call back the next night jac eased out his breath as he hung up and looked at his notepad on the table four names with lines through them two names blank two with question marks now three as jac put a question mark by levereaux name jac had felt each line hed had to put through a name like a hammerblow to his chest and he wondered if thats why hed opted so quickly to delay levereaux rather than pushing him there and then one more bit of hope left however slim rather than another strike against but that was how jac had come to measure everything over the past days strikes against another chance gone of being able to save larry durrant balanced against hope remaining another strike against came the following day when nat hadley phoned him just before lunch to say that sorry he just couldnt fix in his mind which night the pool game had been in relationship to jessicas roches murder then another name added to jacs notepad and as quickly crossed off again when at lunchtime hed gone out again to the ninth ward to see the new owner of what used to be the aint showin mariner now a shortorder and burger restaurant jac was wary of visiting the ninth at night after the incident with rillet but at least the timing had been fortuitous because the proprietor had the previous owners number and had been able to raise him straight away on his phone but taking the first bites of a prawn and sliced avocado on rye back on home ground on felicity street a part of jac wondered whether he wouldnt have preferred some delay again two more strikes against in just an hour gave him the uneasy feeling that the few names left on his pad would go the same way leads evaporating in no time and then thered be no hope remaining nothing left but to sit back and count the days until durrant died maybe he was kidding himself either way whether slowly treading water or a quick freefall the result would be the same every name on his pad would end up with a line through it coultaine had followed part of the same route at appeal only three years after the murder and could hardly get anyone to remember anything then what chance was there as larry had aired doubtfully after twelve years on the last few bites jacs cellphone rang bob stratton with news on the pontiac registration traces back to a holding company of no other than adelay roche himself and the guy driving is one nelson timothy malley fortysix years of age down as head of security at roches houma refinery ill get the photos messengered over to you this afternoon a chill ran through jac with the information answers not only whos been following me but who apart from larry durrant might have killed jessica roche jac swilled back a residue of chewed rye with a gulp of orange juice but suddenly found it harder swallowing looks like the police should have kept doing what they normally do looking closer to home thats one interpretation jac but dont get too carried away the other is that roche simply wants to know your every move is convinced that durrant killed his wife and wants to ensure you dont get him freed at the last moment on some technicality or rabbit out the hat guys as powerful as roche seen many a time where they wouldnt even leave it just to the police would take justice into their own hands so steamrollering over yours truly in the middle wouldnt present much of a problem true stratton chuckled lightly though theres another interpretation there too we cant say for sure that they tried to kill you all we do know is that theyve been nosin and had your phone bugged the police might have been right on that score maybe it was just an accident now it was jacs turn to say true but with no laugh attached he could still feel the cold darkness of the lake shiver through him attaching blame giving it a home maybe hed be able to rid himself of it or perhaps it meant that hed keep shivering because they were still hanging over him like a shadow listening in on his phone silently watching waiting for the next time to try and kill him that shiver ran deeper still when three hours later the envelope arrived at jacs office and he looked at the photos inside another for the gallery of jessica roches possible murderers larry durrant the mystery emailer now roches henchman nelson malley at least it was one bit of positive news after the two rapid namestrikes of earlier one more shade filled in know thy enemy though as quickly countered the pendulum again swinging the other way when ted levereaux phoned early evening not long after he returned from work and told him sorry in the end he couldnt remember anything either racked my brain every which way but nothin nothin another strike against jac felt weary tired his nerves shot from the rollercoaster ride of the past days his hand shook as he crossed out levereaux name and looked at the two names remaining lenny rillet and lorraine gilliam the waitress that worked the other shift to rillet rillet said that hed phone if he managed to find his old diaries hed told jac and mack elliot in parting to say a prayer in thanks to larry because that was the only reason he was letting them go always felt a sorta kinship with larry even more so when he wen inside so im curious to see how this one plays out if youre gonna be able to save his ass or not but jac doubted that rillet would phone what you want to not get shot and get a phone call lorraine gilliams phone simply didnt answer and mack elliott wasnt hopeful that shed remember anything dizzy blonde if yo know what i mean xcept she was a redhead had trouble even recallin half the drinks orders in the distance just from the tables to the bar jac felt lonely cold and deflated that night lonely and cold because alaysha wasnt there had taken molly to her moms for dinner and to stay the night while she worked her regular fournightaweek ritual and deflated from the days letdowns and the scant remaining options he could have done with sharing his woes with alaysha felt her hugging and reassuring him and in turn hed have reassured her about gerry told her that the restraining order arriving in the assholes lap the next day would surely stop him in his tracks hopefully soothe the lines on her brow and the quiver hed seen on her lips when hed come back from rillets and shed told him about gerrys second visit jac reached for the brandy bottle to warm himself and lift his spirits but stopped short after two heavy measures tucking the bottle back in the cabinet he knew that if he kept it close hed probably half finish it but it was enough with the hectic wearying day to slide him into a doze not long after dinner and so when his cellphone rang at some stage later jac didnt know how long hed lost track of time it took him a moment to orientate himself lenny rillets voice coarse and throaty as if hed just woken from the dark tomb that was his crack house that be the same jac mcelroy pinchin his ass that he still alive sharp rattling chuckle from rillet cause i thought youd like tbe the first to know i foun those diaries leonard truelle was only twenty yards into the dusk light of the sidestreet heading towards his car when the blow came to his lower back feeling like someone had hit him with a sledgehammer his legs buckling as the pain shot up his spine and lanced like an icepick through his skull then another blow quickly after sending his pain sensors into overload as the breath left his body in a strangled groan and he fell to his knees something was slipped over his head then some sort of fabric the smell of cotton pleasant welcoming but the darkness he was plunged into suddenly not being able to see anything was decidedly unwelcome frightening aware now of sound and movement for the first time rustling shuffling they seemed to have come out of nowhere behind him and he hadnt heard any approach one person no two he realized as he felt himself being lifted and carried but still no voices nothing said between themselves or to him which somehow made it all the more terrifying no more than eight or ten paces before a car door was opened and he was thrown brusquely into the back truelle trying to recall which cars hed seen close by as it started up and pulled out he could feel mucus on his chin or maybe hed vomited without realizing it and the pain in his back had now spread like burning oil to his stomach razor shards shooting up his spine as his body lurched with two sharp turns one after the other a long flat stretch for a while a half mile or more and a voice finally came from the front you know you should never have had those phone bugs cleared otherwise we wouldnt have to do this now nel m as much as nelms voice made truelles skin crawl each time he felt an odd sense of relief hearing it now a face at least put to one of his abductors two faceless abductors would have been more ominous worrying better the devil you know weve become concerned about what you might have been saying because we simply dont know any more and that makes us worry perhaps more than we should nelm had got part of the idea when hed looked in his car mirror the other night and seen the hood being taken off mcelroy the other part had been from an interview with truelle in a psychiatric journal that roche had got hold of in which truelle had talked about drawing out patients fears and phobias with a brief aside about his own fear of heights do you like dancing leonard what what the hell are yoouuu a cough rose from the back of truelles throat and became a brief coughing fit that he thought for a second would lapse into retching nasty cough you got there leonard maybe some fresh air would help like somewhere up high way up high nelm smiled to himself as the silence settled deeper he could almost hear the wheels in truelles mind turning in time with the thrum of the wheels on the road where where are we going hesitant tremulous as if afraid of hearing the answer silence nelm purposely let it lengthen let the unknown the uncertainties multiply in truelles mind as he motioned vic farrelia into the next turn and then two hundred yards along pointed out a good parking spot no words between them as had been agreed at the outset this was stretching farrelias call of duty and so he wanted to remain as anonymous as possible they bundled truelle out from the back a dozen or so paces counted by truelle before the sound of a door opening closing four more paces and then another door mechanical sliding an elevator nelm didnt speak again until the elevator started rising like i said leonard somewhere up high way up where you and i can get a good view of the city a real good view but nelm knew that truelle was only halflistening he was timing and counting in his mind just how far the elevator was rising eighteen floors nelm could have told him but wasnt going to the elevator wasnt that fast in truelles mind it probably seemed more out of the elevator along and through a door then up the steps to the roof and over to its far side they stood truelle up but nelm kept one arm around him bracing again nelm didnt speak throughout and he waited a moment now wanted the air wafting up from eighteen floors below to hit truelles senses nelm took a deep breath real nice up here and fine view fine view indeed you can see the whole city he knew that his words combined with the heavier breeze on the rooftop had painted enough of a picture for truelle inside the darkness of the hood he could feel truelles body trembling in his grip but you know we dont have to do this now we dont have to go dancing if only you just told us where youve got those insurance policies held what dancing truelles mind was scrambled all he could think about was nelms last words that view i i cant tell you youd just kill me then possibility that i would i suppose nelm was silent for a moment thoughtful but you know leonard if youd seen some of the things i have in my lifetime youd know that theres actually worse things than death like pain and dancing there it was again thought truelle dancing had nelm gone completely mad was looking to book a session on his couch he was still trying to work it out as with an okay huuuup from nelm he felt himself being lifted bodily he thought for one horrible moment the intake of breath rising sharply in his throat making him dizzy as it hit his brain that he was being thrown straight over the edge but then he felt something firm again under his feet and nelm close his breath hot against the cloth covering his face strangely comforting given how hed have normally felt about that now youre going to have to keep real close leonard and hold real tight like were dancing nelm said because this ledge it aint that wide oh god oh god and suddenly it all made sense to truelle and he clung on to nelm as if his life depended on it because now he knew with certainty that it actually did nelm could have found buildings higher thirty floors or more but this was the only one he knew with such a wide ledge running around just over two foot enough for them to move around on as long as they kept in close at each corner and in the middle of each side were large roman urns with squat fan palms probably the main reason for the width of the ledge but there was still a good thirtyfoot between each urn for their dance run nelm observed nelm started moving then swinging truelle out for a second to feel the drop heard him gasp and felt the trembling in his body run deeper then swung him sharply back in again so shall we try again where have you left those insurance policies i i cant its its my only pro protection truelle was trembling so hard he had trouble forming the words his mind half gone all he could think of was where he was putting his feet and that drop only inches away nelm reached deeper behind truelles back as they moved two steps forward two steps back gently swaying now where was it i punched you there there i think truelle felt the pain rocket through his brain nelm eased off for a second then dug even harder with two fingers into truelles kidney heard him groan as the shudder ran through his body his legs buckling nelm held him upright now dont you go giving up on me leonard just as were starting to get into the rhythm nelm smiled the only thing missing from making this little scenario a hundredandten per cent perfect rather than just a hundred per cent with the hood truelle couldnt see him gloating his eyes dancing see how much nelm was enjoying it see what i mean about pain being worse than death leonard keep that up for a while and youd be begging me to kill you but wed have to be in a dark basement somewhere for that where half the neighbourhood couldnt hear your screams and im a real softy for mood atmosphere much better up here with the city spread below us dancing nelm leant in closer his mouth only inches from truelles ear his smile widening as he swore he could all but feel the shudder of revulsion run through truelles body with his next words dont you think lenny baby nelm started moving again more fluidly dramatically swaying and leaning truelle even further over the drop at times truelle exclaimed breathlessly please please dont do this youre not crapping out on our romantic date already are you lenny you know i used to know this chick down at a club on toulouse street half pure congoafrican half spanish creole and boy could she tango nelm started moving again man wed swing up and down so hard and fast wed clear half the dance floor more elaborate swaying and swinging now relishing truelles gasps as he hung him over the drop at almost a ninetydegree angle at points not like you all stiff and formal stumbling on your step something worryin you lenny nelm chuckled please im begging you wanna die yet lenny think thats suddenly more appealing nelm chuckled again lower more menacing or have you worked out yet which you prefer dancing or pain on the last word nelm dug his fingers again into truelles bruised kidney felt his body jolt as the pain shot through it truelle spluttered breathlessly i cant i cant tell you nelm wondered whether to give truelle a few more swaying steps probably his first taste ever of real rhythm then just drop him over the edge last tango in new orleans but the fallout might not be containable and there were other things he wanted to know okay okay if we cant do that then tell me what happened when mcelroy came to see you hes making out that he stopped doing anything on the durrant case soon after he saw you but ive got my doubts strong doubts so what did he say to you lenny not much really i mean did he tell you that he was going to stop digging was going to leave everything just with the governors plea no he didnt say that but but also there didnt seem much he knew and you didnt tell him anything did you lenny no no of course not they started moving again then but slowly less flamboyantly but truelle was still petrified fearful that with the slightest false halfstep hed fall over the edge so what did happen in that meeting lenny not that much not that i can think of that didnt seem to please nelm the step increased the swaying bolder think lenny think its important well he he seemed concerned about hearing that doctor thallerey jessica roches obstetrician had died in a car accident and an accident too that hed had himself thought they might be linked you see you see you can do it when you try the swaying subsided a little what else i dont know not much else really the step and swaying picked up again think harder lenny like i say its important he he left in such a rush thats why there wasnt wasnt much else truelle was having trouble talking and concentrating on his step at the same time he nev never told me what had troubled him so just before he left the step steadied again okay i buy that anything else with with what had happened with himself and thallerey almost like like a warning i might be next you might be leonard another quick looping sway with truelle held dramatically over the drop before quickly righting again nelms gloat slid into a brief chuckle you might be and he truelle suddenly stopped himself worried that this part might bring back questions about his insurance policies what else lenny the swaying step increased once more dont hold back on me now he truelles left foot slipped over the edge then nelm quickly pulling him back up tight but the pain lanced through him again as nelms hand pressed harder into his back truelle took a second to regain his composure and breath he he asked me if my telephones might have been bugged said he was worried that his might have been now it was nelms turn to hyperventilate and he almost let truelle loose from his grip with the jolt that went through him or maybe it was as much shoving him away in anger taking his frustration out on the nearest thing as everything hit him in a rush mcelroy saying that hed dropped the case and then the sudden lack of any meaningful calls on his home phone except one the one where hed followed mcelroy and nobody had showed up not only had mcelroy thrown them a curve ball over his bugged phoneline hed also no doubt had yours truly followed the other day now knew more about himself and roche than he dared think about but one consolation he thought hed get to play out his plan b with mcelroy roche would now jump for it quicker than well quicker than a psychiatrist falls off the edge one last pause as he pondered whimsically what a shame it was that he wouldnt now be reading that headline tomorrow then with one hand he helped truelle down from the ledge and thank you kindly for the dance mr truelle its been most most enlightening torch and candlelight outside the prison gates if jac didnt know that there wasnt long left now until durrants execution hed have become aware from the people holding vigil outside libreville only a small group now eight or nine but in the final few days those numbers would swell local protesters and an increasing number of anticapital punishment supporters mostly from out of state to probably a hundred strong by the end jac had received the news that the board of pardons hearing would be in only two days time it wasnt the sort of news he wanted to give durrant over the phone it warranted facetoface and after the news from rillet there were a few things he wanted to ask larry directly there was also something he needed to pick up after work before heading out to libreville so the last of the dusk light was fast fading as jac hit the pontchartrain causeway a shiver still running through him each time he crossed it ghosts even the corridors at libreville now held them for jac memories of when hed first headed along their grey footstepechoing lengths shirt sticking to his back nerves bubbling wildly to see larry durrant for the first time felt like a lifetime ago now because now it seemed like they were longlost old friends larry hugging him in greeting before they took up seats each side of the table in the quiet room larrys expression darkened as jac told him about the bop hearing in two days time what do you think are the chances weve put in a strong plea no denying good character strong religious values your selfeducating and of course the key issue of executing someone who even now doesnt have all their memory faculties i even sent in a couple of case examples to back that up but against that weve got the thorny problem of aaron harvey reoffending killing again theres a lot of political pressure on candaret because of that and so seeing durrant hanging on his words with fresh light hope in his eyes jac sidestepped moderated what hed initially planned to say so its all in the balance larry all in the balance larry nodded thoughtfully and jac felt a stab of guilt to his chest having told himself that he couldnt and wouldnt fool larry in the end hed weakened and done just that the odds were far worse than fiftyfifty from what hed seen in the press and talking with john langfranc the political pressure on candaret was so intense that the chances were probably no better than two or three percent but having spent the past weeks giving larry something to cling to filling him with hope jac couldnt just come along now and tell him that there was little or no hope kill the faint light in durrants eyes hed only just put there jac introduced a fresh tone but theres been movement too on other fronts he told larry about mack elliott and rillet and his conversations of the past few days he didnt mention the crack house or being worried for their lives at one point because larry hardly remembered rillet in any case a reminder to jac of how little larry recalled from his past how far he might be stretching for what he wanted now and miracle of miracles rillet did manage to dig up his diary from that week oh thats great jac held one hand up calming as that hopeful light came back into larrys eyes its only given us half the picture unfortunately he wasnt working the night of jessica roches murder so he cant tell us anything about then but the good news is that the pool game wasnt one of the nights he was working that week otherwise wed have struck out straight away one trait jac had gained from his father look to the bright side when jac had first heard that rillet hadnt worked that key night hed felt immediately deflated especially after the lines hed put through name after name over the last few days but then hed shaken himself out of it started to look at the other options so of course that means with the pool game taking place on one of those nights remaining it could well have coincided with the night jessica roche was murdered out of those nights you used to play tuesday thursday or saturday rillet was there saturday and it wasnt then so that leaves just the tuesday and the thursday the night she was murdered weve managed to narrow it down to just two nights jac held durrants gaze for a second thats the other reason ive come here now larry to hopefully try and fill in that final gap ive asked everyone else but not you okay fine durrant nodded something in his eyes lifting as if only then did it fully dawn on him where jac was heading fire away jac gave the background to how hed handled things with hadley saunders levereaux and mack elliott putting them in the moment so im going to ask you the same as them do you remember where and when you first heard jessica roche had been murdered but as quickly as that light had come into larry durrants eyes it receded i dont know its difficult i know jac smiled tightly but try try its important larry nodded applying more thought his eyes darkening with concentration im not sure but but early evening news i think early evening not daytime news or in a newspaper durrant shook his head no dont think so i wasnt working but i was out in the daytime a lot looking for work so i think thats the first time id have seen it think dont you actually remember where and when you saw it larry an edge now in jacs voice dont know durrant looked down again that uncertainty the shadows worming deeper thats how i seem to remember it evening news evening news okay okay and what do you remember feeling when you saw that news feeling durrant shook his head his tone incredulous im still working on where and when and now you want me to tell you what i was feeling and whys that so important because larry if youd just killed jessica roche youd have been scouring the newspapers from first light or at least made sure to catch a news bulletin a bit before early evening thats why and when you did first hear that news a stone would have sunk through your stomach oh right durrant exhaled dramatically forcing a tight smile since you put it like that he applied more thought for a moment faint shadows drifting behind his eyes again then as if as an afterthought what did the others recall ive still got a couple more leads to hear from jac lied he didnt want to tell durrant that there was only one lead remaining and that it was a scatterbrained waitress who hardly remembered your drink order minutes later let alone what where and when from twelve years ago larry nodded okay blinking slowly as he sank back again into thought but the shadows in his eyes just seemed to settle deeper and after a moment he squinted and shook his head as if hed tried to read a distant numberplate on a dark night but the car had driven off at the crucial moment he smiled wryly you know when i first lay on truelles couch i couldnt even remember my sons middle name or his birthday my mothers name had gone too and what my father looked like and how old i was when he died and everything about francines mother though at first franny thought i was just doin that on purpose all completely lost out of reach larrys lopsided smile quickly faded im grateful just to have been able to get that back jac let alone remembering what i was feeling twelve years ago i know i know jac nodded sombrely but its just that you said youd started to remember more yeah larry held one palm out in tame concession like a bit of where and when and a couple of old buddies names but i think that what i was actually feeling then is gonna be stretching things maybe always will be okay where and when jac grabbed for what he could lets concentrate on that see if you can remember when that weeks pool game was in relation to you hearing about jessica roches murder i mean was it just the day after or did there seem to be more of a gap i dont know day after day after larrys eyes and thoughts drifting again maybe something there but jac sat forward desperately afraid that whatever thin thread durrant had grasped might be lost again try larry please durrant nodded blinking slowly if only i could remember whether bill saunders was there that week you see if it was a tuesday i recall that often bill wouldnt show then because he had to take his little girl to some sort of dance practice so wed get someone else from the bar to fill in so that would then leave just that crucial thursday night jac nodded eagerly yes yes it would the night jessica roche was murdered he fell quickly silent again so as not to break durrants concentration larry was squinting at that distant number plate again for a second it looked like he might have fixed on it but then it was as if the taillights had in turn moved further away he peered harder to try and compensate but it was no good it was lost again jac noticed larrys hands and arms trembling then as though the effort of remembering had set off a gentle quake in his body larry shook his head finally im sorry jac maybe led you on some there too with the where and when i cant remember whether bill was there that week overall i can recall only a handful of pool games and maybe a handful of incidents too from those games but ask me now which incidents were from which games or which week or month or even year they were id be lost never mind when one particular game was in relation to jessica roches murder jac nodded closing his eyes for a second in acceptance and could almost feel the shuddering in durrants body pass through him seeing durrants eyes dark and haunted grappling for segments of his life that were out of reach and probably now would forever remain so jac felt like running down the corridor to haveling or getting on the phone to governor candaret screaming you cant kill him look at him look at him jac took a fresh breath one other thing on that tape you made for truelle do you recall anyone else being around apart from that woman walking her dog as you ran away but perhaps forgot to mention jac said on the tape because outside of that he doubted durrant would recall anything durrant pondered for a second no why no particular reason jac shrugged i was there at the time although hed told durrant about the emails hed held back the senders claim of actually being there one more thing durrant would now never know or perhaps even just the sense that someone else was there either in the house or outside looking on that you didnt mention to truelle no larrys eyebrows knitted heavily and jac thought that was simply because he found the question odd but the shadows returned to his eyes then dragged him away again to that place where he found it hard to picture anything clearly though its strange you should ask that because ive had this dream a few times where its someone else pulling the trigger on jessica roche not me im there just looking on oh and do you get to see a face in those dreams do you see who it is nah larry shrugged smiling hesitantly you know what its like with dreams a tease when i first had it it was all tiedin with my mother staring at me in the courtroom man i could feel her eyes like they were boring a hole right through my shoulder i could feel all her shame and disappointment at me in that stare and i thought if i could just see his face see that it wasnt me i could turn and shout that out to her in the courtroom it wasnt me ma it wasnt me i saw him i saw him larrys last words echoed starkly in the bare concrete room and again a faint shiver ran through jac larry smiled tightly the shadows the lost hope drifting away again from his eyes but you know it was just a damn fool dream and in any case he never did turn my way in the dreams always stayed just a hazy shadow turned away from me pointing the gun larry gave a halfsnort halfsnigger as if with that tossing the image from his mind but maybe it was just my mind selfprotecting throwing up all this because part of me couldnt accept that id done it another brief derisive snort though i was way away then from the likes of truelle and any psychiatrists couch thats just me selfanalysing jac swallowed hard didnt say anything couldnt say anything as he felt the guilt weigh him down here he was shielding truths or only dealing halftruths with durrant while meanwhile larry was baring his soul to the bone almost a complete reversal of their first meeting together but at least it perhaps answered why on the key tape from truelle larry never actually described pulling the trigger even then his mind was selfprotecting pushing away that hed done it or the other explanation he hadnt done it hadnt done it jac wondered whether he should mention roches henchman nelson malley trailing him the other day and the photos theyd gained but like the mystery emailer it would just torment durrant all the more putting substance and a face to someone else who might have been the murderer when they were still a million miles from proving that the cruellest fate of all knowing that someone else might well have done what you were about to be executed for yet with nothing left to stop it jac bit at his lip another secret buried there was a gentle thrum in the background maybe the prison boilers but jac could feel its rhythm coursing through him now along with the dull pounding of his heart like a distant drumbeat driving him on after all the madness and fallen hurdles of the past days as if saying you cant give up now you cant youve gone too far but jac felt tired worn down from it all and now the few options left appeared even more remote as hazy and out of reach as the images in larry durrants fractured mind from twelve years ago as the silence became uneasy jac said but while im here and with a fresh expectant breath he reached into his briefcase hed picked everything up before heading out to the prison and now probably needed more than ever clear the air of stale halftruths and halfmemories hanging over them jac pulled out the two bottles and balloon glasses with a magicians flourish voila choose your poison twelveyearold malt whisky or twentyyearold cognac symbols of my two past cultures larry beamed shaking his head jeezus youre a man of many surprises jac mcelroy most people would try and sneak in a file or a gun you turn up with two bottles of liquor larry applied brief thought and pointed to the cognac i hear thats the new black yuppie drink of choice been out of touch for twelve years might as well be in vogue now and ill join you in that jac poured the two glasses and passed larrys across he wanted to feel as close to and in harmony with durrant as possible at this moment of all moments jac watched as with eyes halfclosed larry took the first sip jac remembered as a child going out on a hot day in the woods around the rochefort farmhouse and getting lost hed been gone almost six hours in the hot sun without a drink and his lips were dry and blistered as he lifted the glass his mother handed him he remembered still vividly that feeling when the water first touched his lips and trickled down and knew that it was akin to what larry durrant was feeling now the first real drink after twelve years and mellow twentyyearold cognac pure nectar they drank in silence for a moment a long moment larry alternating between closing his eyes as the cognac trickled down and its warmth hit his stomach as if it was just another dream and not really happening and smacking his lips relishing its taste man thats good thats sooooo good larry leant forward after a moment peering at the label whats this stuff called frapin its one of the best man oooohhh man i can taste that for myself even if you hadnt told me larry took another sip closing his eyes for a second in reverie then sank back into silence again smiling jac smiled back twelve years without a drink and suddenly larry was acting like a connoisseur this was one of those moments when they were meant to be silent after all theyd done nothing but rake over the coals of old ghosts and old memories the past forty minutes said everything that needed to be said but as larrys eyes narrowed after a moment it looked like there was something else on his mind he took another slug as if clearing his throat for the words or perhaps now they were drinking that final bit of dutch courage licence to become more maudlin one thing i never did work out about you jac why you went out on such a limb for me i mean it got to the point where your life was in danger man maybe still is my girlfriend asked just the same the other day dont blame her larry smiled crookedly she likes you maybe shes keen on keeping your ass around a while longer jac mirrored the smile took another sip of cognac i think the first thing was big case and wanting to prove myself but a lot of that was also wrapped up with what happened with my father he died young well not exactly old he was only fiftyfour when he died larry slanted one eyebrow so you got a thing about people dying young is that what youre telling me jac shrugged no well i suppose thats a pretty natural instinct for a lot of people but it had more to do with the circumstances surrounding his death jac explained about his fathers business collapse and disastrous financial situation when he died with a lot of people including jacs rich aunt as a result labelling him a failure so when anyone gets close to suggesting that i too might fail on something its like a red rag to a bull ill go to all sorts of lengths to prove them wrong its almost like im batting too on my fathers behalf setting the record straight on how people remember him jac took another slug thats how they were painting this case originally at payne beaton and sawyer little hope bound to fail thats why they gave it to a young blood like me rather than one of the senior partners but what they didnt know was because of that fear of failure how hard id fight it looks like i got the right man then larry raised his glass smiling tightly his expression faintly quizzical as he thought about the skewed logic of what jac had just said i think a bit more truth jac thought but again he still held back hed come here intending to be brutally honest lay every possible card on the table because it might be his very last chance but once he was actually in front of durrant his resolve had melted and hed only told half the truth the real reason hed gone out on such a limb for durrant had hit him in the dead of night the day after alaysha had asked him awoken him in a cold shivering sweat at the same time it was strangely calming settling at least now i know now i know and thered been a moment now a natural conversational leadon when he could have said it dying young lived before he died but as he looked at durrant saw the eleven years of pain and loneliness in his eyes hed once again balked felt it might be too harsh for durrant to take with only days left now until his execution jac shrugged or maybe its just that i dont agree with the state killing people anticapitalist punishment thing jac took a quick slug grimacing almost required thinking for a european larry nodded thoughtfully yeah i know you dont have it over there jac nodded back easy to forget at times that durrant wasnt just another homey how wellread he was there hasnt been anyone executed in over thirty years in most of europe and it doesnt seem to have affected the murder rate still a quarter of that in the states pretty much the same here states with no death penalty dont have higher murder rates in fact in most cases lower jac lifted his glass towards larry in a way youre proof of that jac made sure not to say living wasnt too long ago that i asked you which might be preferable death or another ten or fifteen in here andwell we both know what you said death possibly so near now that jac found himself tiptoeing around the word often a long sentence is as much a deterrent larry nodded again this time more slowly his eyes shifting uncertainly as if if asked the same question now he wasnt sure any more what hed answer you miss your father dont you he said after a moment yeah jac looked down at the table and the bottle as his eyes moistened and hardly a day goes by that i dont think about him i understand larry contemplated jac steadily warmly same here too with my mother then he closed his eyes for a second though this time in acceptance rather than savouring the cognac they drank in silence a moment more and something crossed larrys eyes then something darker more worrying his eyes went between his glass the bottle and jac as if he was struggling to fully fathom what it was and the rest hit him in a rush then jac pushing so hard for a possible breakthrough the drink the maudlin philosophical conversation he nodded at his glass and blinked slowly dont think i dont appreciate this jac cause i do i really do but this is a dying mans drink isnt it you dont see much hope left do you no no of course not like i said theres still some leads left weve got a strong plea in with candaret and well kick the bops ass like you wouldnt believe the day after next and im sure that jac stopped himself then felt himself sag under larrys steady withering gaze under that weight of halftruths hed fed larry since walking in the room sag quickly becoming crumble as with a heavy exhalation he met larrys gaze more directly calmly sorry larry sorry its not looking that good im going to do my best with the bop and candaret and with the few leads remaining but it would be wrong of me to kid you larry nodded and suddenly jac didnt need to say any more as if larry had understood perfectly well all along had seen through the subterfuge right from the start jacs eyes watered the tears hitting him then without warning perhaps because of larrys quiet acceptance or his last words dying mans drink the sudden realization that this might be one of the last times hed see larry and there probably wasnt much more he could do for him larry leant forward putting one hand on jacs shoulder gently shaking its okay okay you did your best but that physical contact made it all the worse the tears flowing more freely and then they were on their feet hugging larry patting jacs back consoling you couldnt do more jac couldnt do more dont beat yourself up so then after a pause larry saying hed be fine and dont worry about him and jac biting back the tears saying that he wasnt giving up on him and there was still a lot to do still strong hope both of them knowing in that moment that what they were saying was more wishful thinking than truth and jac thinking it was strange that they were standing now in this tableau because in his mind driving to the prison if the emotions had become too much it had been larry tearful and jac consoling and thanks for the cognac jac larry said as with a last few backpats they parted and sat back down its made my day my year they sat drinking in silence again like two old friends who knew each other so well that often words werent needed the warmth of the shared drink and their companionship enough and when jac looked in larrys eyes he could see that the shadows had gone no longer haunted by chasing distant outofreach memories he was calm again at peace are you sure as sure as can be nelm said that laboured unsettling breathing from the other end darth vader watching porno i dont know what other explanation there can be for him leaving his phone bug in after telling truelle he was sure it was bugged then all that crap with him saying hes dropped the case and that false lead the other day mcelroys been playing us for mugs breathing heavier more perturbed as if it was a geiger counter for roches thoughts looks like you could well be right did you notice anyone following you the other day no but then i wasnt particularly looking out for them because i didnt know then what i know now from truelle i think it might be time to i know i know what it might be time to do roche cut in he swallowed struggling to get his breathing back under control let me think on this a while ill phone you back roches call came thirtyfive minutes later but in that time nelm was calm relaxed making a pot of fresh coffee whistling softly to himself watching some breakfast tv because he knew already what the answer would be he wondered what roche had done in that same time played some vivaldi or wagner or sat silently with only the sound of his own breathing rising and falling looking at his cherubs and red brocade his swimming pool surrounded by roman statues the precious gilded world hed made for himself contemplating just how fragile it all might be okay do it but make sure its clean no messy loose ends itll be soooo clean youll be able to eat your dinner off it an hour later nelm was inside mcelroys apartment latex gloves on his hands as he delicately lifted what hed need from countertops and doors and searched through cupboards and drawers for any vital papers jac might have hidden nothing he went over to the phone and removed the bug then listened out for a moment no sounds from next door shed probably gone shopping nelm decided to search there too in case knowing that hed been targeted mcelroy had decided to hide anything at his girlfriends apartment and only minutes into his search running one hand along a high wardrobe shelf he found the gun nelm took it down turning it slowly deliberately examining an out of issue colt but looked in perfect working order his plan was shaping up better by the minute jac could feel even stronger the thrumming of the prison boilers almost in time with his pounding heart as he walked away from seeing durrant with the steady clip of his footsteps keeping rhythm too the same distinctive but strangely hollow sound as if echoing the lost hope of all librevilles prisoners he recalled from his first day going to see durrant now joining that dull driving drumbeat you cant give up now you cant and he could still feel that drumbeat as he drove away though now it was only his heart its beat harder and faster as he drove back across the darkness of lake pontchartrain remembering his breath held for a moment expectant as if waiting for that first gulp of air again as he hit the surface but it wasnt the image of himself fighting up through its murky depths that reached him this time but larry durrant struggling to pick out the images of twelve years ago from its shadowy greyness but them never hitting the light of the surface never becoming clear and staring out across the dark expanse of lake the thought hit jac in that instant its there somewhere its there only you cant see it he drove the rest of the way back to new orleans with only that one thought on his mind and as soon as he was inside his apartment went over to his fathers painting on the far wall of the dining room leaning close to it feeling the texture of its oil brushstrokes their rochefort farmhouse a patchwork of vineyards and wheat and sunflower fields sloping up towards a more prominent pinecovered hillside as backdrop his father had painted it their first year in rochefort when jac had been only nine and when his father had first finished it he asked jac what do you see our farmhouse yes but what else jac had studied the painting more closely looking for perhaps himself or his mother as a small dot hidden in the fields or the hillside like one of those wheres waldo puzzles but he couldnt see anything and shook his head after a moment look deeper into the painting his father prompted its there somewhere its there only you cant see it and after a while jac could finally see it a vague shadowy outline of what looked like their farmhouse in a slightly different position his father explained that hed started laying down the outline of the farmhouse then suddenly decided it would be better from another angle the backdrop and depth of shadow and light more dramatic but rather than waste the canvass i decided to paint over it its something the old masters used to do all the time because canvasses were even more expensive then lean in close to many an old master and youll be surprised what you see buried in the background and from then on jac had always looked whether at the louvre or a local gallery while everyone else was yards away trying to appreciate the overall impact of the painting hed be only inches from it trying to see what might lay beneath the surface jac looked at his watch pm late but he didnt want to delay he dialled out on his cellphone mike coultaines throaty voice answered after three rings that psychiatrist for the defence greg ormdern is he still practicing jac asked i believe so any good at the time one of the best which is why i used to use him as an expert witness why jac explained his thinking to coultaine if truelle had been able to unearth from durrants mind his actions that dark night with jessica roche then perhaps greg ormdern would be able to fill in the gaps uncover the rest from that time the things we still dont know with the last call nelm contemplated the most important thing had been brevity you wanna know who your girlfriends new boyfriend is whos fucking her now his names jac jac with no k hanging up before strelloff had half a chance to think or ask who was calling but this time hed have to go into more detail he sat for almost an hour outside mcelroys apartment in a rented grey chevrolet impala because mcelroy would now recognize his pontiac timing and planning eight oclock mcelroy said that hed be over to eat at her place he still used his home phone for daytoday nondurrant related calls because as nelm hardly needed reminding thats all theyd got the past six days on tape nelm left it half an hour for them to get their appetizers out of the way then took out his cellphone to order their main course gerry strelloff was slightly out of breath as he answered as if hed run from another room to pick up or was on his way somewhere your friend again you know that lawyers letter and restraining order you just got what who is this that doesnt matter nelm knew theyd been sent from scuttlebutt at pinkies with alaysha confiding in a couple of friends just take it that im someone whos got your interests at heart and want you to know what a fool youre being played for because that boyfriend i mentioned the other day jac mcelroy hes a lawyer working for the same firm that sent the letter and arranged the restraining order youre joking incredulous still slightly breathless no fucking joke about it man and they organized it all just to get you off the scene so he could get in there like the slimy jackrabbit he is and take your place shit i dont believe it ill fucking but thats not the best part the touch paper lit nelm could heard the bubbling acidanger in strelloffs voice hopefully this final bucket of petrol would get the flames sky high he lives right next door to her probably even heard you screwing her through the walls and thought i want somma that so thats where he is now right now you safely roped and tied by a restraining order while hes in your place in her bed fucking her stupid what hes there now this minute yeah this fucking minute as we speak probably already at the point where shes screaming his name out loud jac jac oh oh jac nelm chuckled you hurry maybe youll get there just in time for the money shot nelm hung up and looked at his watch twentyfive minutes for strelloff to get over from his place in chalmette correct that seventeen or eighteen with the speed hed be driving when my father died i had trouble coming to terms with it as a lot of people do with something like that jac waved one hand above his wine glass towards alaysha but more than that i felt hed been cheated he was only fiftyfour had many good years left hed been a good person with a kind heart brought his family up well so why him god why him alaysha simply nodded didnt speak she could tell that this was a difficult heartfelt subject for jac to broach so had suddenly stopped clearing their plates from the dinner shed prepared not wanting to make any noise at that moment she could see jac struggling with his thoughts shadows alternating in his eyes like fastdrifting clouds as he tried to sift them into order the main problem was they didnt discover it was cancer until late because of my fathers business problems their first thought was that it was ulcers rather than stomach cancer by the time they got to it it had probably been there for three or four years it had worked its way too deep had reached his pancreas there wasnt a lot they could do jac shrugged but alaysha could see that it was like trying to flip off a tenton weight his shoulders moved but the burden stayed there and shortly after my father had the prognosis knew that there wasnt much hope left his old friend from glasgow archie teale came down to see him archie had kept contact with my father and visited a fair few times over the years but we werent sure this time whether my mother had phoned him or it was some invisible thread between old close friends to tell archie that something was wrong with my father certainly my father wouldnt have phoned archie to spill his woes not his style but the subject did soon get round to that jac smiled tightly though even when it did typical of my father he wasnt worried about himself but more about how his family would cope with him gone particularly because of the financial situation with things not going so well jac held one palm out archie had been an accountant most of his life and perhaps my father thought he might have some useful financial advice archie gave a few tips there perhaps delayed the inevitable a year or two more but it was his moral advice his advice on life that im sure my father and certainly i remembered most because it appeared that archie had visited at that juncture for a reason of his own jac took a sip of wine a heavy sip and alaysha could tell that he was getting to the difficult part his eyes were slightly glassy moist but there was a faint light in them too as if there was some sort of warpedlogic joy amongst the pain of his fathers death archie had just had a heart attack and had been diagnosed by his doctor with congestive heart disease he might last a year or two he might last six or seven but the thing was like my father he wasnt going to make old bones i remember vividly the two of them sitting on the back terrace at rochefort with archie raising a glass and smiling dryly its going to be a race between you and i adam to see who goes first but what stood out most in my mind was what archie said a bit later after the coffees had turned to whiskies and theyd finished most of a bottle between them and reminisced and put half the world to rights archie leant forward at one point gripping my fathers arm across the table as my father became more maudlin lamenting about the mess hed made of things dont you ever think that way ever because thats the one difference between whats happening to you and to me adam youve lived before you died and as my fathers eyebrows knitted over another halftumblerful of scotch each archie explained he himself had been careful all his life counted his pennies but in the end what good had that done him he reminded my father that each time hed come down to see him theyd gone out to the marina at arcachon and looked at the sail boats there that had been archies dream retire get a place not far from my fathers and spend the rest of his days sailing now even with his retirement pulled forward to fiftyfive it looked touchandgo whether hed make it and even if he did how many years sailing would he have maybe only a year or two three if he was lucky whereas he said to my father youve lived your life done what you want from age thirty and bollocks to the rest given your wife and son and little girl a damn good life at the same time watched them grow good and straight and tall amongst the sunshine and vines so dont you ever regret any of that adam because unlike me youve lived your life youve lived before you died jac bit at his bottom lip the tears closer then alaysha saw but he seemed eager to continue as if afraid that he might break down before he got it all out archie lasted only a year after my father jac closed his eyes for a second shaking his head but when you asked the other day what made me fight so hard on durrants behalf not long after thats what finally hit me those words lived before he died jac shrugged grimacing tautly because if you think about larry durrants life such as it is his boxing career going down in flames before it hardly started turning to petty crime to supplement his income then just when hes newly married and got a son on the way just when his life looks like it might be back on track for once he lands himself on librevilles death row and on top a car accident thats scrambled his brain so that he cant even remember half his life from back then cant say with any certainty whether he actually committed the murder or not jacs voice had risen with anger and exasperation and he took a quick breath calming himself again if you think about all of that if the term not living before you died fitted anyone it fits larry durrant and the fact that he might be innocent makes it all the harder to take almost unbearable i know i know alaysha reached out and gently touched one of jacs hands on the table with the talk about his father the pain and loss shed seen in his eyes when they first met she now better understood but then an awkward silence fell a pregnant pause that felt as if perhaps she should fill it with her own story and the signals were all there illness sacrifice and risktaking for family of what that story should be alaysha swallowed hard wondering if the time was finally right to tell jac if she didnt it would become like an evergrowing boulder between them get in the way weigh them down but then jac started speaking again that thought that realization had hit me before i saw durrant the other day but when he asked me the same question as you what had made me go out on such a limb for him and i looked at him life to date pretty well worthless and in ruins last eleven years spent in hell without a single touch of warmth and closeness from his family hardly even knowing what that was like from his own son and only days left now until his execution the fact that hed probably now never get the chance to make good on all of that i just couldnt come flat out and tell him the truth jac shook his head his eyes moistening again tell him that id done it all because his life so far had been so worthless that i couldnt bear the thought of him not being able to live some before he died jacs eyes closed for a second in submission or perhaps to blot out the images of durrant in his cell a single tear rolling down one of jacs cheeks which he wiped away hastily and alaysha had never felt closer to him than in that moment now that hed bared his soul all the warmth softness and vulnerability shed never known in the men so far in her life and probably looked for all the more as a result but with what jac had now added to the pot holding back secrets his emotions raw and close to the surface with the guilt of it she felt her bottom lip trembling the lump in her throat now almost impossible to swallow past jac theres something alaysha broke off looking past jacs shoulder faint noise outside on the corridor jac didnt seem to have picked up on it but then she had become more tuned in to sounds outside her door these past days in fact he hardly seemed to have noticed either that shed started to say something as he continued so i did what people often do when theyre hiding something i brought a couple of props along for distraction that was a nice touch though jac and by the sound of it much appreciated jac had told her about sneaking in the bottles and durrant the cognac connoisseur at the start of dinner she looked briefly past his shoulder again nothing there now probably just someone passing on the corridor she reached across the table to his hand again gently pressed the thing is jac i her doorbell rang then seconds later a highpitched voice sounded like a young boy im looking for jac mcelroy got a message to pass to jac mcelroy they exchanged glances for a second before alaysha went to the door and sure enough about a foot below the spyhole was a young boy holding out a folded piece of paper stories abounded of attacks from young gang boyz but this lad was too young no more than twelve and besides this wasnt the neighbourhood for that probably was just what it appeared message for jac mcelroy he repeated alaysha flipped back the latch unhooked the chain and had barely got the door a few inches open when it was barged hard into her swinging wide as she was flung back she pushed back against the door reflex reaction but gerry was already through it eyes wild and glaring as the kid scampered off along the corridor jac was only a couple of paces behind alaysha his eyes locked with gerrys in recognition assessing weighingup through the red mist of gerrys rage you must be gerry swung his punch on his last word and jac only managing to get his arms up in partial defence caught it as a glancing blow on his left cheekbone knocking him back half a step but he had his guard up better for gerrys next punches one blocked fully and the other deflected into his shoulder they clinched and started to grapple with alaysha now raining punches on gerrys shoulder and back screaming no no stop before wideeyed as if shed suddenly remembered something she ran into the bedroom alaysha swung the wardrobe door wide and ran one hand along the top shelf for the gun what she ran it back and forth a couple more times not believing that it wasnt there she raised up and looked just to make sure then breathless now frantic quickly searched in the drawer in case unconsciously shed put it back there nothing heavier tussling now from her hallway a low groan she ran back relieved to see that the groan was from gerry not jac it had taken jac a moment to focus and realize just how wild and misjudged gerrys punches were in his surging anger he found the next two easy to dodge and the one following no trouble to block and swing beneath it a solid punch to gerrys stomach gerry buckled and jac got in another good one this time square to gerrys face knocking him back against the wall by the door jac seized the advantage bringing his left hand tight to gerrys throat pinning him back against the wall his right fist cocked only inches from gerrys face he felt gerrys body move saw one arm rising up again and pressed harder against his throat tensing his cocked arm but gerry just wiped the bit of blood from beneath his nose with the back of one hand it aint the end of this my friend by a long fucking way it is for now jac said flatly pushing gerry back through the door and if you come round here again bothering alaysha ill jac broke off noticing for the first time mrs orwin looking through the gap in her door eyes wide as she watched jac hand gripped around gerrys throat frogmarch him into the corridor she hastily closed her door as jac looked her way youll what mr get a restraining order so i can fuck the girlfriend mcelroy gerry taunted smiling youll what jac glared back long and hard finally youre not worth it and with one hard push against gerrys throat gerry falling back a step and almost stumbling over jac turned and slammed the door behind him a moments breathless pause with his back against the door taking stock letting the adrenalin rush settle with alaysha eyes on him somewhere between relief apology and surprised admiration that hed actually been able to see gerry off then a bang against the door a punch or kick and gerrys voice again your new girlfriend ill bet you one thing ill bet you she hasnt told you what we did together our dirty sordid little secret because well because cleancollar lawyer like you youre just too goodytwoshoes to know that kinda shit another punch or kick of frustration against the door then silence jac kept his gaze steadily expectantly on alaysha and alaysha held the look back both of them knowing in that moment that as soon as they were sure gerry had gone the question would come and alaysha perversely for the first time wishing that gerry wouldnt go so that she wouldnt have to answer but at that moment came another voice on the corridor muffled indistinct with a brief surprised exclamation from gerry halfway through then a gunshot nelm had fingertapped against his steeringwheel while waiting on gerry strelloff after a while the sound felt stark uncomfortable in the silence so he started pushing buttons on the radio to find some music classic soul jazz and latin samba were his favourites and he finally settled on dave brubecks take five on an easy listening jazz channel two songs later though it was playing louis armstrongs wonderful world less conducive to fingertapping or his mood at that moment so he stabbed some buttons again after a moment finding stevie wonders superstition as gerry strelloff swung his car in nelm checked his watch nineteen minutes not bad he watched gerry run into the building then exit again only twenty seconds later looking up and down the street as if hed forgotten something his eyes settled on a young black boy thirty yards along and nelm watched as he talked for a minute with the boy the boy nodding finally as gerry handed over a piece of paper and tendollar bill from his wallet the boy went into the building gerry waiting anxiously for thirty seconds or so pacing up and down before heading in after him nelm too was starting to get anxious he didnt like sudden changes and if the boy stayed in there it was going to kill his entire plan as stevie wonder wailed about thirteenmonthold babies broken looking glasses and seven years of bad luck nelms fingertapping stopped his hand gripping tight to the steering wheel it felt like a lifetime that the boy was in the building but was probably less than a minute nelm eased out his breath in relief as he saw the boy run out he slipped on his latex gloves and got out of the car the gun was already in his pocket and he gave it a reassuring pat halfway towards the building entrance the boy had by then disappeared into the first turning forty yards away but still nelm gave a quick eachway glance to make sure nobody was paying him too much attention as he went into the building everything was in full swing by the time he got to the top of the stairs he held back out of sight a foot from the corner where the corridor turned towards the girls door thirty feet along faint scuffling raised voices footsteps now a door closing but he didnt think it was the girls he could hear gerry strelloffs voice taunting mr get a restraining order so i can fuck the girlfriend mc elroy youll what silence so heavy that in that second nelm held his breath fearing that if he even swallowed they might hear him youre not worth it more scuffling and then a door slamming hard this time it probably was the girls seconds pause then a thud followed by gerrys voice again some dirty secret mcelroy apparently didnt know about perhaps her and gerry were into bondage then with a halfgrunt halffrustratedsigh another kick against the door from gerry nelm tensed putting his right hand into his gun pocket this was his cue and as he heard gerrys first steps away from the door he emerged from around the corner a smile rising in greeting hey man thats not the way you do it voice low hushed as if he was sharing a confidence with gerry that he didnt want anyone else to hear what who the hell dont you recognize the voice gerry your friend and like i say thats not the way you do it his voice little more than a whisper now as he walked past a bemused gerry strelloff until he was between him and the door then he turned taking the gun out in the same motion this is the way you he fired only inches from gerrys face dropped the gun instantly and ran for the corner and the stairs leaping them three and four steps at a time as jac opened the door he heard the last couple of frantic steps on the stairs and the entrance door slamming he ran a couple of steps past gerrys body then halted gerry might still be alive surely he should be tending to him first seeing what could be done and with the moments indecision he knew that the assailant was by then long gone he moved a step closer to gerrys body inspecting a lot of blood but any sign of breathing he knelt down feeling for a pulse among the blood and if the full horror hadnt hit him then hed have known by alayshas gasps and screams oh god oh god no she brought one hand up to her mouth as if to stop hyperventilating no pulse that jac could feel though he was no expert but then he noticed the portions of skull amongst the blood one section almost three inches round seeing then too the glistening brain matter and he straightened up quickly taking a deep breath as he felt his stomach turn the bile starting to rise he looked up sharply like a cat caught in headlamps as mrs orwins door opened across the hallway her eyes darted rapidly going over the scene a couple of times the body on the floor jac the blood all around as if the first time she didnt believe what she saw then she started shouting youve shot him youve shot him no no jac implored reaching a bloodied hand towards her it was another man who came by on the corridor shot him and ran off youve i i mrs orwin started shaking heavily and as jac moved a step towards her still with the same hand held out imploringly she hastily closed her door jac shook his head in disbelief but as he looked back at alaysha her eyes were transfixed on the gun what is it i i think i recognize that gun i think it its mine what do you mean you think its yours i didnt even know you had a gun i didnt but i alaysha swallowed trying to get her frantic breathing under control i picked it up from my moms the other day be because of gerry coming round as she was met with jacs questioning penetrating stare she shook her head i was frightened jac okay he had me and molly terrified terrified and what else is there you havent told me alaysha all that crap from gerry about dirty secrets that jac stopped it all hitting him in that second the killer breaking into her apartment to get the gun her fingerprints still on it mrs orwin as an eyewitness the perfection of the setup i was trying to tell you jac but jac wasnt paying attention his mind still reeling mrs orwin probably already on the phone to the police weve got to get rid of this gun alaysha what your fingerprints are no doubt on it and its traceable right back to you through your mom have you got a never mind he could see that alaysha was practically in a trance frozen biting at the back of one knuckle so he ran past her into the apartment grabbed a napkin from the table and seeing the bag hed brought the wine in still folded on a sidetable picked that up as well and ran back out he lifted the gun with the napkin wrapping it around once and tossed it in the bag shaking alaysha gently by one shoulder as he stood its a set up alaysha a setup dont you see but whyi and in that moment finally she did see perhaps this was the other way they dealt with these things rather than her disappearing and turning up in the river months later a frameup that got her locked up with the key thrown away she nodded hastily yeah yeah okay patting his chest in acceptance as she said it but also a parting take care gesture he grimaced back tightly and was about to lean in for a parting kiss on one cheek but he could imagine the alert being put out as mrs orwin spoke there might even be a squad car just a block away and whether just dutifully filling that gap in his imagination he swore he could hear distant sirens in that moment in the end he just gripped alayshas shoulder once more in reassurance and ran off leaping the steps three and four at a time as gerrys killer had done only a minute before the sirens seemed louder closer almost filling the air as jacs feet hit the pavement outside he didnt know whether they were for him they could have been heading to something else nearby but he instinctively headed away from them he took the second turning off eighty yards along felt the first would be too obvious running flatout all the way the sirens still closing in seeming to echo all around him now he paused ten yards into the turnoff taking stock his breath already falling short they were coming from two directions now thats why the echo hardly mattered which way he ran if he kept straight on hed be heading towards the french quarter where there was usually stronger police presence especially at night but he had to keep moving the urgency of the sirens pressing in on him screaming get away run and keep running he decided to take the next turnoff on the left the closest siren seemed to be coming from the right as jac made the turn the nighttime activity of the street was busier some groups of people milling between the bars and restaurants there a dozen or so sitting at the pavement tables by one bar as jac noticed a few eyes on him starkly questioningly he thought it was purely because he was running and was now out of breath frantic but as a woman he passed sucked in breath sharply taking half a step back he took in his appearance for the first time as he looked down his bloodied hand from feeling for gerrys pulse had brushed against his shirt at some point and some of it was also smeared on the bag in his hand while nobody might guess it was a gun in the bag it could as easily be a body part hed just removed the siren closest by stopped jac could feel his heart still pounding hard but at least the constriction eased a bit he had to get rid of the bloodied bag with the gun perhaps a restaurant row somewhere with bins out back in an alley like the street he was on now he scanned frantically back and forth as he cleared the corner saw what looked like a service alley ten yards to the right and darted towards it he paused his eyes taking a moment to adjust to its darkness and shadows a couple of small bins halfway down then a delivery truck parked in tight behind there might be some larger bins beyond it but jac couldnt tell from where he was he ran towards the bins and the truck but what jac hadnt noticed as he was surveying the alley was the patrol car gliding silently along behind him theyd seen him run towards the alley but perhaps wouldnt have paid him too much attention if he hadnt started running again they stopped by its entrance and the officer in the passenger seat shone his torchlight down calling out as its beam hit jacs back hey hey there jac turned sharply his shock slow to register because it took him a second squinting against the glare to make out the police car and patrolman shouting from its window but he could tell from the look on the patrolmans face that the image he cut blood on his shirt the bloodied bag in his hand hit home quicker he turned and ran hold it stop jac glanced back as the shout came but the patrolman hadnt got out of the car and didnt have his gun aimed through the window and by then jac prayed that he was too far away for a decent shot the patrol car swung back turning its headlamps bathing the alley for a moment then as if deciding that it might be too tight a squeeze past the delivery truck it pulled off again with a screech of tyres siren winding up jac knew that they were going to try and race him around the block head him off and he put on an extra spurt his chest aching now with the effort legs weakening again the siren seemed to echo and spin around him so he couldnt tell whether they were still behind him in the parallel street running alongside or just ahead he burst out of the alley at full pelt eyes darting for the next alley on the opposite side thirty yards along he cut across at an angle after eight strides just in front of a green dodge neon which was forced to brake sharply and got to the mouth of the alley as the police car made the turn its siren spilling onto the street jac unsure whether theyd seen him take the alley or not the siren closer closer filling all of jacs senses above his pounding heart and ragged breath the police car slowing the patrolmen inside craning their necks and then jac had his answer as it screeched and swung in after him its headlamps washing the walls and fencing of the narrow alley but he was only ten yards from its end by then and it had to slow halfway down to negotiate past some bins and a badly parked motorbike jac heard a faint bang behind him sounded like one of the bins falling but hed turned off by then frantically scanning for the next alley twelve yards away on the opposite side though as he took his first strides towards it he had second thoughts too obvious just where theyd expect him to go he changed tack to the alley twentyfive yards along on the same side effectively doubling back on himself hoping and praying that he made it to the turn before they hit the street and saw him they flew out with their spinning siren scream just as he made the turn jac again unsure whether theyd seen him a silent prayer into the night air as he listened to the direction of their siren above his pounding step and as he heard the siren fade slightly heading away from him his gasping breath fell heavier with an added burst of relief his step eased a fraction at the same time unsure what to do next he should put more distance between himself and the siren but already he felt exhausted his legs like jelly the ache in his chest so heavy that he felt as if a knife had been plunged into it and the more he ran on with the bloodied bag in his hand the more attention he drew perhaps running into another squad car he had to get rid of it before he went much further the sound of the siren had paused not moving away any more as if they were edging down the alley opposite very slowly or perhaps theyd already stopped realizing he wasnt there and were about to head back jac picked up pace again and it was then that he noticed the boarding sheet to one side a rusted chain looped through a hole in it and the gap between it and the next sevenfoothigh boarding sheet could he squeeze through it the siren same distance away or moving closer he had to decide quickly the gap appeared too narrow but the board looked like it might have some give and as jac became surer that the siren was moving closer again he barged against it pressing hard he got a shoulder and part of one thigh through but couldnt get further he pushed again got a few more inches in but not enough closer if he didnt hurry hed still be there stuck halfin halfout as the squad car rolled by the alley with a heavy grunting shove he finally felt something give the chain biting deeper into the rotting board and he slipped through long weeds and grass rubbish strewn between closer jac pushed the board back so that it was adjacent with the adjoining board didnt look like thered ever been a gap and eased out his breath a dark derelict building seven yards behind an old warehouse or shop looked like it had been sealed off for development then abandoned the siren stopped then but a moment later there was the sound of radio static on the night air if they werent actually by the entrance of the alley then they were very close jac held his breath the sound of another siren moving closer louder it cut off when it was only half a block away then seconds later there was the sound of another engine idling and more radio static on the air voices conferring jac closed his eyes oh god theyd called in support to close the net the voices more urgent for a moment one of them calling out yeah yeah sure then a car door closing and an engine revving stronger jac not sure at first what it all meant until he saw headlamp lights point up the alley then the sound of the patrolcar engine edging closer echoing slightly as it bounced off the sides of the narrow alley it was moving slowly ever so slowly and jac became aware of another light at that moment shifting back and forth along each side the patrolman obviously hanging his torch out the window every inch of the alley being scoured and checked jac sucked in his breath as they came closer only six or seven yards away now but in that instant he also became aware of movement and rustling in the grass something brushing against one leg his first thought with all the rubbish around was rats but he darent move his whole body in that instant frozen breath held swallowing back even to try and calm the pounding of his heart in case they heard it as they edged alongside the rustling moved away from his leg but jac was worried that even that faint sound might be heard by them and theyd stop to investigate his eyes wide as the torchlight hit the board at his side it moved gradually away in a steady sweep then suddenly returned lingering longer this time the sound of the engine idling and the radio static now seemed deafeningly loud as if jac was actually inside the car with them and the torchbeam stayed on the boarding for a full eight seconds though to jac it felt far longer before finally shifting the car though didnt start edging forward again immediately as if the driver was more uncertain about the boarding then its engine rattle slowly tooslowly receded along with the fading torchbeam jac didnt finally ease out his breath again until it was a good thirty yards past and he was sure that theyd gone that one of them suddenly wasnt going to pace back to investigate the sound of radio static stayed in the background for a while longer between anything from half a block to two blocks away it sounded to jac with a fresh siren joining them at one point before it all finally faded away yet still jac stayed where he was breathless body winding down listening to the sounds of the night for almost ten minutes more until he was sure that the police had cleared from the area and no more sirens were coming for him then he started thinking about what to do next he looked at the bag in his hand then the wild grass and earth at his feet it wasnt ideal hed have preferred an absolute guarantee of disappearance but there was still a high chance that it would never be found here and if he ran on with it more eyes raised more risk jac looked around briefly then started clawing at the earth with his hands but what jac hadnt noticed was the man at a third floor window further along who had seen him crouched in the rough grass and wondered if he might have anything to do with the sirens hed heard below a few minutes ago and as he watched jac dig and bury the bag thought he might have his answer nelm was late getting to the phone slightly out of breath glenn bateson a harrowed edge to his voice i tried you earlier i just got back in nelm said hed spent half the evening waiting tapping his fingers anxiously on his steering wheel while mcelroy and the girl ate so after phoning roche to tell him it was all done he felt hed earned a celebratory meal and dived straight into a plate of crawfish and crab claws at deanies bib up to his neck smiling and raising a glass of chilled chablis to the air as he imagined mcelroy at that moment being grilled by the police or perhaps already in lockup and making his one call to one of his buddies to save his sorry ass and hed started to feel mellow relaxed for one of the first times in weeks the sense that now finally it was the end of everything with mcelroy and durrant but with the edge in batesons voice he could feel the first bubbles of anxiety returning what is it you wouldnt believe it yes i would just fucking tell me mcelroy hes arranged for a psychiatrist to come and see durrant some guy called ormdern when for two days time straight after the bop hearing then another session the day after mcelroy will be there as well presumably to no he wont what do you mean no he wont i just picked this up fresh and hot from havelings diary and cant say it plainer than that my friend mcelroy wont be there and if you want to know why i suggest you keep an eye on local news channels between now and tomorrow morning nelm sniggered but he could still feel a tightness in his chest where batesons word psychiatrist had hit him as if part of his crawfish hadnt digested and had decided to burn a hole through his ribs almost certainly everything with the psychiatrist would now be axed too but it was an uncomfortable reminder of how close theyd come more brownie points scored with roche when he told him more backpats for his timely ingenuity or if i were you you know those special occasions when prisoners are allowed to watch tv like the world series or presidents inauguration or last episode of seinfeld or friends and you get them all in one room looking at an oversized screen why dont you arrange that now for the local news then just watch larry durrants face when the piece about jac mcelroy comes on what have you been up to nelm had never liked bateson and while hed invited the question batesons folksy slyly gleeful tone made his skin crawl im not one of your good ol boys asshole he felt like screaming but he immediately slipped into similar sly mode for his response now that would be telling jac went to a cash machine on gravier street and took out to add to the fifty in his wallet then started thinking about how to get a change of shirt he knew hed be hard pushed to find any shops open his only hope was probably the french quarter so hed drifted that way trying to keep in the shadows of the buildings a police car had passed him on the way but hed just kept walking normally one hand by the stain on his shirt as if he was scratching his stomach the car just kept drifting past didnt pay him any attention then as he approached the corner of bourbon and iberville and saw a lenny kravitz lookalike handing out promotional cards for a new club he was struck with an idea jac took one of the cards thanks nodding towards lenny ks chest and have you maybe got some club tshirts to sell like the one youre wearing nah just paid me to hand out these here cards maybe at the club itself doubt it i think these were jus printed up for the barstaff shame theyre nice jazzy design jac smiled tightly how about you selling me that one fifty bucks lenny k smiled incredulously man i got another hour out here wit these an how am i gonna explain away losing my shirt shrunk in the wash amorous stalker ripped it off jac shrugged smiling again despite the protests there was a hint of temptation though maybe with the connected hassle for a tendollar tshirt still wasnt enough a hundred bucks lenny k looked each way as if concerned who might be viewing the transaction and part of his eyeshuffling also took in the stain on jacs shirt one last cloud of doubt before he finally nodded okay man lets do it pulling back into the shadow of a shop doorway as he pulled off his shirt and held it out jac peeled five twenties from his wallet and they made the exchange and as soon as he was round the corner he ducked into another shop doorway to change into the tshirt he bundled his old shirt in his hand and threw it in a bin halfway along north rampart street then headed towards the phone kiosk fifty yards along to call john langfranc jac checked his watch pm just under fifty minutes since the shooting langfranc answered quickly and equally jac started speaking rapidly at one point garbling and running ahead of himself with pentup tension as he struggled to explain whoa whoa back up a bit langfranc said so gods sake i can get this clear in my mind he took a heavy breath somebody comes by and shoots dead your girlfriends ex straight after youve just shut the door on him after an argument and rather than run off with the gun he drops it right there and hes gone before you open the door again to see whats happened have i got it straight so far yeah yeah thats right as i opened the door i just heard his last few footsteps on the stairs but then you picked up the gun and ran off with it thats the bit i dont get why was that again jac jac sighed his frayed nerves riding on it wearily this is the clientconfidential part john okay because as for the official line i think we should make out that the killer ran off with the gun as would normally happen or just no mention of it at all goes without saying jac without saying langfranc sounded mildly offended to even be asked the thing is alaysha recognized the gun its hers or rather her mothers but it was at alayshas apartment at the time thats why i ran off and dumped the gun because i was sure it would have her prints on it it looks like whoever did this must have broken into her apartment earlier and got the gun and then jac was speaking rapidly again slightly breathless as he fought to explain and as he heard a police siren close by his breath froze in his throat the sirens passage counted in tight pulse beats in his neck before his breath finally eased as it drifted past heading away from him then he uses it on her boyfriend and the setups complete i hear what youre saying jac but its not good not good i know you and so i know that youre telling the truth but listening to this now wearing the hats of a couple of hardboiled homicide cops who dont know you and on top have heard it all before it sounds like a story jac and not even a good one at that theres a witness too from jacs downbeat tone langfranc knew already that it was bad news and dont tell me they didnt see the shooter either no old woman across the hallway opened her door a minute after the shot was fired shooter long gone and just me and alaysha standing by the body started screaming youve shot him youve shot him low groan from langfranc and a throaty doomladen terrific i need your help john thats why i called now help yeah miracles take longer i need someone i know to represent alaysha i need to know whats happening which direction everything might go i can understand that langfranc was quiet for a second but this isnt just protectiveness for your girlfriend is it jac something else is worrying you about this yeah deflated sigh the seed of doubt had been there from the moment hed realized it was alayshas gun rankling deeper as hed ducked between the shadows of the nighttime streets during the past fortyfive minutes the question thats bothered me is why frame alaysha with everything else thats been going on i thought id have been the main target for something like that so if theyve gone to the trouble of lifting her gun from her apartment what else might be waiting in the wings some hefty accomplice to murder rap perhaps from other evidence theyve planted thats why i need to know the lay of the land john before coming forward i can see that there wasnt a timespicayune photographer there to snap you as you left the apartment block with the gun was there no jac chuckled and langfranc joined him a second later as if making sure first that jac was ready to see the light side though langfrancs chuckle quickly died when jac told him that he was spotted by a patrolcar a few blocks away and i ran jac sighed heavily it was dark though and i was probably too far away for a good id lets hope so langfranc took a fresh breath as he focused on the remaining options what few were left after jacs catalogue of horrors and errors did the old girl across the hall see the gun no dont think so okay hopefully then well get away with the story of the killer running off with it or as you say just dont mention the gun because thats what the cops will naturally assume hopefully too the story will wash that you ran off in pursuit of the shooter as for why youre still awol ill think of something in the meantime langfranc sucked in his breath all will depend though on what alaysha might have already told them how long will the cops have been with her now half an hour maybe more id better get there couple of good detectives could pull her apart in that time have her head reeling did you prime any sort of story with her no no time but shes bright shell know not to mention the gun particularly with it being hers lets hope so because if she mentions the killer dropping that gun on the hall floor were buried before weve started and you also have to pray that the cops dont find that gun dont worry where ive hidden it theyre not going to find it at least not in a hurry remember you didnt tell me that i didnt tell you that the first to arrive on the scene six minutes after mrs orwins call were two patrolmen from the eighth district who immediately radioed in for what else theyd need forensics homicide and a meat wagon they knocked on mrs orwins door first because shed made the call but with their talking and the harsh static from their communicators alayshas door opened seconds after and quickly sensing some unease between the two parties the officers took one each for questioning mrs orwin hastily ushering her officer in and closing her door behind him two more patrolmen arrived minutes later and having conferred with their colleagues one yellowtaped the downstairs entrance before joining his sidekick in roaming and checking for telltale clues though at all times twoyards clear of the body the hallowed forensicsonly zone questioning was basic at that point setting the general scene which was all dutifully relayed to lieutenant jerome derminget a bloodhoundeyed homicide detective with wavy unkempt saltandpepper hair when he arrived on the scene eighteen minutes later derminget looked like the type that alaysha would have liked under different circumstances while his eyes looked tired as if he read police reports or books late into the night at the same time they appeared warm understanding though that part also unsettled alaysha they looked like they might easily strip away her defences get to the truth derminget spent the first ten minutes questioning mrs orwin and had been little more than that time with alaysha when his station house called to inform him that they had miss reyners lawyer on the line a certain john langfranc and he insists on being present for any official questioning of his client derminget skewed his mouth he didnt like the sound of the girls story one bit the shooter that nobody else had seen appearing magically and firing just seconds after them closing the door at the end of a big argument to boot an eyewitness that saw both the argument and then her and her boyfriend over the body and to cap it all her boyfriend having apparently run off in pursuit of the killer for some inexplicable reason hadnt yet returned it sounded like a fairy story but derminget had so far only been filling in background hadnt yet got to the harderassed questions that might put her account to the acidtest and the involvement of a lawyer so early rang instant alarmbells stank of barricades being quickly desperately put up if he didnt get to those questions before her lawyer showed her story would probably forever get stuck in lala land he saw his escape route in official tell our lawyer friend that were still on the scene and so were not even sure at this stage if there will be any official questioning of miss reyner but if that is to take place thatll be at the station house later tonight about which of course hell be duly informed beforehand one minute the female duty officer broke off and he could hear other voices in the background obviously they had the lawyer on another line before her voice came back he says hes a friend and so hed like to be there in any case for moral support hes on his way okay okay fuck it fuck it derminget had drifted into the hallway as hed taken the call and kept his voice low so that the girl wouldnt overhear he gave his best smile and softeyed look as he turned back in through the doorway now where were we maybe only ten or twelve minutes before her lawyer arrived hed better make the most of it two hours thats when jac had arranged to speak with langfranc again when hopefully hed be back from seeing alaysha and the police another phone booth call langfranc advised because we dont want anything possibly later being traced to your cellphone after the change of shirt jac had instinctively headed away from the french quarter less people less police but as another police car drifted by him on baronne street he felt immediately uncomfortable vulnerable they didnt see him or even slow as they passed but he was struck with the feeling that he was the only person there to draw their eye and if one of them had looked his way hed have frozen or panicked in that gaze the look in his own eyes instantly giving the game away he turned back towards the french quarter he felt in no mood to be around people let alone crowds but theyd at least offer some cover distraction to any passing police hed be harder to pick out amongst a milling throng he drifted along with the tourists and local outonthetowners on bourbon street then turned into bienville street and found a bar after forty yards that looked busy and noisy enough to hopefully get lost in jac ordered a coors at the bar then found a table deep towards the back where he was hardly visible from the street let alone noticeable as jac took the first sips of beer he pictured again hearing the gun going off those last footsteps on the stairs as he opened the door gerrys body on the floor with part of his skull blown away mrs orwin screaming youve shot him youve shot him fourth or fifth time hed run the sequence through for anything he might have missed along now with how alaysha might be coping with the police how shed explain the same sequence of events would langfranc have arrived yet to be able to draw their fire jac sipped anxiously at his beer his running off wouldnt have helped more possible suspicion and less backup alaysha left to fend on her own but with alayshas gun still there it would have been far worse alaysha would instantly have been prime suspect with himself as accomplice only with the weapon gone did they have a chance of getting away with the story that someone else had shot gerry between the crowd at the bar and milling by the entrance jac caught glimpses of the street outside as he drank and over the next half hour he saw a couple of police cars passing the normal french quarter patrols he wasnt unduly worried but when a police car stopped almost directly opposite and a patrolman got out and headed across the road jacs nerves immediately tensed his grip on his beer bottle tightening he watched like a hawk through the revellers past two twentysomethings hugging and backslapping like they hadnt seen each in years past a girl half doubling over and cackling like a witch at the joke of one of her two friends as the policeman went slightly to one side a door or two away jac didnt take his eyes off the entrance or fully ease his breath until two minutes later when he saw the policeman head away again suddenly conscious of a few people at the bar looking his way curiously jac only then aware how hard his eyes had been burning through them a trickle of sweat on his brow his hand starting to shake on his beer bottle and in turn with those stares jac suddenly realized how alone he was separate from them all a day ago even a few hours ago hed have enjoyed the ambience smiled at the bonhomie around him felt the beer chill and mellow him fingertapped to the beat of the music lynryd skynryds sweet home alabama was playing and people had started to sway and foottap one couple even attempting a closeclinches jive but jac felt cut off from it all as if he was a world away the throbbing beat simply fuelling the pounding of his heart and pulse a nerve jumping in time with it just below his earlobe one solid deafening drumbeat that screamed get out get out you dont belong here jac quickly knocked back the rest of his beer and stood up started making his way back through the heaving milling mass the bar had become a lot busier in the past half hour and jac had to push and sidle his way through the atmosphere suddenly hot oppressive the feeling that they were all closing in on him we saw the way you looked at that policeman and were going to keep you here until they come back for you jac knocking the arm of a satinshirted young guy with a ponytail and almost spilling his drink as he leant back into jac sorry sorry jac sweating now heart pounding breath short as he burst through the last of the bar crowd and back out onto the street but the throbbing swirling echo of the music and people still seemed to churn through jacs head as he paced along bienville street crossing bourbon this time a police siren a block away suddenly screaming along with it so that he felt in that instant dizzy his legs weak the feeling that he might have to start fleeing again but now had no strength left the siren faded after a moment and he eased out his breath again raising his hand to a cab as he saw it crossing on dauphine street yeah where to jac had to think for a second his mums place would now probably be too risky midcity on the way to the airport one of the motels around tulane avenue he could make his call to john langfranc from there and as one of the citys most faceless transientclient hotel areas it would hopefully be ideal for laying low for a while as they turned onto canal street the driver asked you know which one no havent booked one yet got any recommendations as the driver threw up the pros and cons of a couple of motels he knew there jac was hardly listening the throbbing beat voices and sirens still ringing in his head get away get away and even when the taxi driver had stopped speaking and a motel had been decided upon it was still there for a while until finally jac closing his eyes and taking slow even breaths in the back of the taxi as the city receded behind him it was just the sound of his own heartbeat and thrum of the taxi wheels on the road steady rhythmic beat though now it was more from jacs fingers drumming by the phone than his heartbeat the only sound apart from the traffic passing a block away on tulane avenue heavily muted through the thick glazing of his secondfloor motel window as jac made his call to john langfranc when jac had first called after the agreed two hours thered been no answer then successively after five minutes eight minutes twelve minutes still no answer his fingertapping by the phone heavier and more impatient each time now again after another three minutes it answered late at the start of the fifth ring langfranc slightly breathless i just got back in this second he said to jacs where the hell had he been ive been going crazy here didnt know what to think jac said what might be happening i know i know it got a lot more complicated while i was there unfortunately you see the thing is how was alaysha jac was only half paying attention to langfranc his emotions so pentup that all he could think of were the questions that had burned through his mind the past two hours how did she cope with the police questioning she coped fine jac but and had she said the right things before you got there so that you were able to cover the bases okay yes shed covered well hadnt but but they found the gun jac langfranc blurted it out midsentence as if afraid that if he got stuck in questionanswer mode he might never get the words out langfranc let his breath out heavily thats our main problem now but how i hid it over half a mile away and i you were seen burying it jac a neighbour a couple of doors away apparently oh god god jac felt as if a trapdoor had opened beneath him but it was alaysha he saw tumbling into the abyss her reaching one hand up desperately her gun her prints on it he shuddered his voice shaky quavering how on earth is alaysha bearing up with that news i i should be with her now he realized something else too in that second and now ive made things far worse for her trying to get rid of the gun made her look guiltier still jac the problem is its jeezus ive made a right pigs ear of everything ive jac was wrapped up in his own thoughts again only half listening as langfranc tried to broach the subject delicately gently soften the blow but in the end as if the only way to get the words across they came out sharply a hatchet swipe jac theyre not alayshas prints theyve found on that gun theyre yours jac felt the words hit but they didnt sink home as if langfranc had said them to someone else then hesitantly thats thats not possible i i never touched the gun with my hands the prints are there jac theyre there no question and as it did finally sink in jac felt himself falling again as if langfrancs words had held him in midair for a moment suspended in disbelief and now that the totality of the setup dawned on him he was in freefall again alayshas gun his fingerprints on it he should have deduced earlier that if theyd gone to the trouble of lifting it from her apartment thats what theyd do after all a part of him had questioned all along that he was meant to be the main target the letter and restraining order the argument mrs orwin seeing him over the body youve shot him youve shot him and now as if he wasnt roped and tied enough him fleeing and trying to dispose of the gun hed provided the final ribbon on top himself uuuhhh all jac could manage a halfgrunt halfwheeze as he felt all the air shunted out of him with the terrible realization after a moment you you know its all a setup dont you but jacs tone carried strong hesitance doubt as if with the sheer weight of evidence even john langfranc might have trouble believing it yeah i know though there was a slight pause and the tone was that of reluctant concession but like i said before jac thats only because i know you with everyone else its going to be tough with the way everythings stacked against you a real mountain climb to try and convince them what can we do yet even as jac said it with the hopelessness of the situation it sounded rhetorical langfranc was a lawyer not houdini langfranc took a fresh breath the first thing is youve got to give yourself up to the police jac give them your side of things to back up alayshas account thats the start point but as langfranc said it jacs first thought was durrant after all durrants fate had been the main purpose of the setup to get him off the scene will i get bail i dont know jac ill try obviously but running off with the gun and hiding it hasnt helped and your workvisa situation too is going to make it tricky the fact that youre not an american citizen da will protest like all hell that you could flee jac had worked with langfranc long enough to read a no langfranc just didnt want to come flat out and say it like everything else so far and no doubt from here on in hed be let down softly in stages only eleven days left now until durrants execution i just cant leave durrant hanging now john not when im so close durrant langfrancs voice was incredulous cracking slightly you wont be able to do anything to help him now jac youll be lucky to save yourself from sharing the cell right next to him way things stand now i cant come in if im not going to get bail dont you see hell be dead before half this is sorted out if it ever is its not just the bail jac langfrancs voice was stretched the tone jac had heard him adopt with difficult clients beatons going to drop you from the firm quicker than a hot potato soon as he gets wind of all this you wont be able to represent durrant in any case jac heard langfranc but another part of his brain quickly rejected it the part in denial still stuck on everything he had planned before it had happened theres the bop hearing tomorrow and ive got that psychiatrist ormdern visiting durrant a few hours after ive got to be there for those and dont you see thats why theyve done this now theyve heard about ormderns visit and are worried that i might be getting too close you cant be there jac i cant say it plainer than that tired worn tone shifted deftly from difficult clients to insane and who the hell are they roche and his henchman guy called nelson malley remember i told you the other day about him following me the photos that bob stratton took yeah yeah i remember now langfranc rubbed his forehead the durrant case had gone through so many hurdles that with his own heavy caseload at times langfranc found it difficult to keep track jac continued im convinced theyre behind this now and in turn im more convinced than ever that they somehow set larry durrant up thats the link between the two right there dont you see the perfect setup part of jacs thinking came across as totally rational langfranc considered the other part now firing on odd cylinders at wild tangents totally irrational perhaps thats something you could share with lieutenant derminget when you see him langfranc said still trying desperately to reel jac in appeal to the rational side feed him everything youve got hopefully save your neck and durrants at the same time silence from jac for a moment as if he was seriously contemplating it before exhaling tiredly no no it wouldnt work theres still too much for me to piece together and this lieutenant whatever is not going to do all that for me and i cant do it while im locked up i need to be out there langfranc lost his last shred of patience then jac jac youre just not thinking straight any minute now theres going to be an allpoints out for you and you wont even be able to go to your local seveneleven without being arrested let alone walk into a maximum security penitentiary to see durrant so how the hell are you going to be able to help him then i dont know i i jac could feel the options practically feel the cell walls closing in on him as langfranc spoke i need time to think get my head clear thats the other problem jac we dont have much time how long derminget originally gave me an hour to talk you in jac but then when the lab came back with the news that it was your prints on the gun all bets were suddenly off and how long he cut it to halfanhour jac langfranc sighed heavily and ive used fifteen minutes of that getting back home he phoned about the prints as i was pulling up outside and of course the six or eight minutes weve now been talking hes expecting me to literally call right back after talking to you he wants to know whether youre coming in or whether hes got to set the dogs loose put out an apb and feed your photo to local news stations and newspapers photo barely a gasp a cramp in his chest made it suddenly hard to breathe yeah they dug one out when they searched your apartment jac closed his eyes the continuing freefall now making him feel dizzy as if hed lost all orientation of where he was closing in spending that very night in a cell it seemed ludicrous unreal though at least from visiting durrant he thought sourly he now knew what that might be like and the many more nights that would no doubt follow an icy chill ran down jacs spine though his skin felt hot clammy the motel room walls suddenly pressing in the same hotflushed claustrophobia that had gripped him when hed first walked librevilles corridors and now only minutes to make up his mind jac swallowed hard his throat suddenly tight his voice strained i i hear what youre saying john loud and clear but i just cant be locked up for the next eleven days cant you see that isnt there some sort of deal that can be cut deal jac langfranc exclaimed breathless disbelief i was lucky to get even this from derminget the chance to be able to talk to you first if hed got his way hed have one minute john jac cut in as a knock came on his door holding the receiver away he called out yes what is it sorry to trouble you mr mr teale desk clerk jac had paid cash and signed in as archie teale but i was wondering if you could tell me if you want a paper tomorrow morning or coffee or tea brought up because your doorhandle cards not here ill mark it and put it out later jac shouted jac brought the receiver back to continue with john langfranc but he could tell that the desk clerk was still there as if waiting on something else and as jac listened more intently the hairs rose on the back of his neck as he heard other muted mumbling voices in the background jac kept his voice low to langfranc are you sure this detective said hed wait until youd spoken to him sure as can be jac but at the back of langfrancs mind something niggled uneasily from dermingets mention of hopefully catching a late news bulletin if mcelroy wasnt going to come in why whats happening im not sure i a heavier rapping came then a booming voice in its wake police mr teale nopd we need to clarify something with you sir jacs stomach leapt into his throat he found it hard to swallow his voice croaky as he shouted one minute then to langfranc an underthebreath hiss this doesnt look to me like hes waiting shiiit swear on my life jac he promised but look now that theyre there just stay calm do what they say dont do anything rash and dont say too much langfrancs words urged calm but his staccato delivery screamed panic before youve even drawn breath at the station house ill be right there to cover the bases jacs whole body started to shake and he only halfheard langfrancs words beyond a sudden buzzing in his head closing in his eyes darted frantically between the door and the window im sorry john i the door ram hit then seeming to make the whole room shudder and jac dropped the phone and leapt back a yard with the jolt as if the ram had hit him directly langfranc at his end hearing the sudden bang and clatter as the receiver hit the table jac jac jac ran to the window opened it looked out a thin ledge just below the window and further along a flat roof a floor below but could he cling to the ledge for that seven feet to then be able to make the jump down and could he make that ten foot jump the second ram strike came then splitting some of the wood on the door frame jac slid out the window onto the narrow ledge swaying nervously after a couple of steps and drawing blood from his fingernails as he clung desperately to the building fearing with the sudden dizzying bloodrush to his head that he was going to fall he took a long breath and opened his eyes again starting to edge along the narrow ledge more rapidly knowing the room door would burst open any second at his end john langfranc heard two more doorram hits before the last of the frame splintered and the door flew off and thudded to the floor the room was suddenly filled with confused voices and rapid trampling footsteps before one voice cut through the rest here over here then after a moment another voice more urgent shouting hey hey stop then seconds later the sound of a gunshot sirens filling the night but this time jac knew with certainty they were coming for him not someone else or a nearby fire hed been about to jump straight down from the side of the flat roof when he saw the two police cars only twenty yards to his left by the entrance one with a patrolman inside the other unmanned jac ran to the right to slip down the end of the flat roof out of sight of the cars when a flashlight beam from his room swung across and settled on him and the shout came hey hey stop jac looked up only briefly before taking the last two strides to the side to scramble down the shot came as hed got half his body over kicking up the roof asphalt two feet away a fleck of it flying up and hitting him on one cheek jac jolting back for an instant as he thought he might have been hit and with that jolt the last strength went from his arms and he fell down the remaining five feet jac halfrolled to break his fall scrambling into a run before hed fully straightened he headed further to the right away from the police cars across twelve yards of motel carpark another shout from the police behind only half registering above his ragged breathing and the bloodrush like heavy surf through his head then he was into the road turning right again putting more distance between himself and the police cars more motels small apartment blocks interspersed further ahead woodenboarded houses and bungalows some with front verandas jac heard the siren winding up as he was only eighty yards along then the second siren a few breathless strides later he glanced desperately over one shoulder as the first car swung onto the road roof light spinning jac became frantic the street was too open wide himself too visible as he ran along the police car would see him the instant its headlamps hit him and he became aware only then of the cool dampness on one cheek wiping at the blood there with the back of one hand as his eyes darted wildly for options the sirens were deafening smashing the nighttime stillness of the street a turning on the left twentyfive yards ahead would he reach it in time before the squad car caught up probably but it would clearly see him take it would swing into the turn and catch up with him not long past it as jac came alongside the first bungalows a curtain was pulled back to see what all the commotion was jacs eyes honed in on a gap between the houses no gate the police car had already covered half the distance towards him no time to dwell on it no other immediate options jac cut across their front yard heading for the gap old bicycle dustbins some planks that jac almost stumbled over a couple of large bushes that jac sped past branches whipping back against him and then he was in a more open lawn area a fence twenty feet away sixfeet high siren closer now almost alongside he picked up his stumbling pace and leapt at the fence hard levering up and scrambling down the other side a dog barking almost immediately his feet landed the other side low and throaty menacing a big dog jacs heart froze fearing it was there with him in the yard but then with another volley of barks its front paws hit the fence a yard to his side with a bang jac jumped back a step reflex response relief quickly overlaying the shock as he ran on sirens paused in the same spot now taking stock of where hed gone a faint flicker of a searchlight spilling over the fence hed just jumped jac picked up pace a clearer lawn area hed covered most of it by the time he heard the sirens moving on again starting to circle round the block a side gate but only waist high jac leapt it easily but as he burst into the front yard breath heaving a couple of black teenagers stood by an old trans am in the driveway surprise freezing them for a second as jac six yards to their side sped past the shout of hey man from one of them carrying surprise as much as indignation wasnt often you saw a white man running from the police in this neighbourhood jac headed deeper into the street away from the sirens some sort of plan finally forming in his mind he glanced anxiously over one shoulder looking to see when the police cars would reach the turning though he could have told simply by listening the tone of the sirens suddenly became starker clearer as they pulled alongside the opening flashlight sweeping from a side window jac knew that theyd pick him out easily he was less than fifty yards into the road but he kept running in the same straight line jac heard the tyrescreech as they swung into the road the stronger revving of engines but still jac kept on straight knowing that soon theyd catch up with him legs pounding flat out until until with one last frantic glance over his shoulder jac saw they were already twenty yards into the road past the point of no return jac cut off sharply at a tangent again towards another bungalow on the far side smiling to himself as he heard the squad cars brake sharply tyres squealing as they negotiated rapid threepointturns but jac didnt run through to the back yard of the bungalow this time he crouched down by its side gate out of sight listening to the sirens receding his frantic heartbeat counting off the seconds until it was safe for him to emerge again in that instant jac noticed an hispaniclooking man eyeing him with concern from a neighbouring window then suddenly shifting from it as if about to come out jac eased up the police car tail lights were just turning off then ran out again legs pumping wildly it was vital he gained as much distance as possible before they realized he wasnt in the next street already seventy yards into the road hopefully at least a hundred before they caught on and turned back jac listened to the sirens still seemed to be the same distance away in the next road a light rain hit jacs face then and he tilted his head welcoming it felt it cooling his bloodboiled head felt some of it touch his dry lips some brighter lights jac could make out now just beyond the end of the road misty and blurred with the rain jac squinted the lights finally falling into focus the toni morrison interchange where carrollton avenue and interstate met a tangled web of highways and overpasses and where the first highway crossed a barrier that jac could see at the end of his road where it formed a t if he could make it to the barrier the squad car wouldnt be able to follow him jac looked towards the end of the road eighty or so yards touch and go whether hed make it to the end by then jacs legs felt weak his chest cramped and aching he wasnt going to be able to keep up the same pace much longer sudden change in the tone of the sirens it sounded like they were turning starting to head his way jac pumped harder pushing himself the sirens drifted away for a second as they headed back up to the top of the adjacent road then turned starting to move closer again jac pushed every muscle to the limit felt them screaming for release sixty fiftyfive yards from the end by the time he heard the sirens spilling out openly as they came alongside the road jac glanced back to make sure saw the spinning glare but they seemed to hang there for a second as if unsure whether he was in the road and jac kept tight in by the front fences so that he wasnt too obvious as the flashlight swayed from side to side probing the flashlight finally picked him up and they turned into the road but by then hed gained another dozen yards or so jac pushed even harder but the more he demanded from every muscle and sinew the more they seemed to ache and shudder beg for meltdown into welcome release it felt like hed hardly be able to make it ten yards let alone forty thirtyfive thirty the sirens pressing in closer filling the air jac glanced back as the first set of headlamps reached him sixtyfive seventy yards behind still almost twenty yards to the barrier oh god god the sirens deafening seeming to fill every space in jacs head as the squad cars bore down as if they were about to run him over as the barrier loomed ahead but they had to slow down the front car screeching broadside as jac reached the barrier and leapt it stop stop a frozen second as jac glanced back from the few yards of waste ground before the highway edge already checking for gaps in the traffic to dart across car door swung wide a patrolman tensed in aiming stance his figure partsilhouette in the spinning glare of the roof lights yet jac saw hesitation too in the patrolmans eyes worried that any stray shot would hit the traffic passing behind and as jac saw a small gap in the traffic he turned and ran through the first clear lane brief pause for a fourwheeler passing in the far lane then on jumping the central barrier jac only half paying attention to another shout of stop more desperate now but less audible with the traffic noise in between and so jac was startled falling back a step when a shot sounded only realizing that it was a warning shot as he looked back and saw the patrolman lowering his gun from the air to point straight at him a moments nervous mexican standoff jac praying that he wouldnt risk a shot with the traffic passing in between though maybe he would if there was a long clear break but then a large truck flashed between them breaking the spell jac darted into the next lane letting one car pass but then had to pause for a second feigning like a matador as the next car approached faster than hed timed another car alongside in the fast lane swinging wide of jac at the last second blaring its horn jac scurried across the last lane and leapt the side barrier rows of concrete and steel stanchions ahead supporting the motorway above heavier shadows between them jac weaved between the stanchions trying to make best use of the shadows to lose himself as quickly as possible from view glancing in between at the patrolmen across the highway the one whod fired was peering hard trying to follow where hed gone his partner now on the radio the second car pulling away possibly to swing onto the highway further along jac hoped by then hed be long gone another busy fourlaner thirty yards away a ramp to one side swinging up to one of the highways above another ramp on the far side of the stanchions a choice of escape routes for once but in that moment above the dull drone and swish of traffic from above jac thought he could hear other sirens three or four maybe more he looked around frantically caught a glimpse of two squad cars in the distance on the highway hed just crossed heading fast his way but the directions of the sirens on the tangle of roads above were harder to place jac ran for the closest ramp he needed to get out of sight quickly from the highway behind more sirens it sounded as if half the citys police were hunting him down jac had given up on judging direction they seemed to swirl and echo from all around as he started up the ramp another sound also reached him then a shudder running through him as he paused midstep to make sure the rapid thudthud of a helicopter winging through the night sky jac looked up but couldnt see its lights yet whether because of the clouds the partial cover of the overhead highway or it was still too far away he wasnt sure but he knew with certainty that it would be upon him any second jacs eyes darted desperately if he continued up the ramp hed be more visible from above but if he headed back down the two police cars bearing down on the highway behind would see him sweat beads massed on his forehead mixing with the raindrops chest heaving as he gasped like a dying frog into the night air he felt completely worn exhausted the sirens echoing and spinning in his head making him feel dizzy unsteady his legs trembling so hard that they felt about to buckle at any second it would have been so easy welcome surrender just to lift his hands to the helicopter searchlight or first police car to arrive he couldnt go on much further in any case but instead as the lights of a car heading up the ramp hit him he lifted one hand to that trying to flag it down it went past sirens moving closer one on the highway above now sounding no more than fifty yards away jac flagged more frantically a camper van and a car not far behind went past too the car beeping as jac took a step in front of it jac could now see the helicopter searchlight as it broke through the clouds about sixty yards to his right moving methodically forward with tight sweeps and the closest siren above now sounded only twenty yards away it started raining more heavily then and jac mouthed one last silent prayer into the sodden misty night air as the scream of the sirens and the thudthud of the helicopter closed in all around him becoming allconsuming and as the next two cars on the ramp also swept past him without stopping the beam of the helicopter searchlight now circling in to within thirty yards jac felt any remaining hope slip away may at first adelay roche wasnt too concerned about the direction of the police investigation the account of a robbery gone wrong seemed to have been accepted the crimescene evidence supported that and so lieutenant coyne was trawling for suspects almost exclusively in that area house robbers with violent past form but every now and then thered be a quick aside a question thrown in out of the blue amongst the standard question line as if slipped in like that the lieutenant thought he might not notice that made roche start to worry that coyne was having increasing doubts about the robberygonewrong theory was starting to fish closer to home the eyewitness had thankfully been distant enough to not be too precise though perhaps if they got nelm in a lineup it would be a different matter and over that final shot to the head roche had vented more than a few choice words at nelm roche was convinced it was the one detail that didnt sit comfortably with coyne and if he kept digging he might unearth more inconsistencies things he wasnt happy with roche phoned to check how much coyne might have been raking around in the background after all it might just be his own empty paranoia pretty much the same routine each time lieutenant coyne said that hed be in touch with you about my wifes investigation i wondered if hes made contact yet the concerned husband checking on police progress hed started to get more on coynes back so his followingup wouldnt look unusual oh right right roche was alarmed at the extent of coynes background calls hed been busy very busy coyne obviously hadnt found anything yet otherwise hed have been on his doorstep with handcuffs and a caution but as the asides and questions started to become more frequent roche worried that soon coyne might stumble on something they needed to get coyne back on track with the robbery gone wrong theory stop his focus shifting and soon after roche struck on the idea of putting someone else in the frame sufficiently roped and tied that coyne would stop looking elsewhere the only thing he could think of that with certainty would head coyne off at the pass stop everything dead house robbers and the citys lowlives were more nelms territory and within a week hed put together a potential list for roche larry durrant was initially way down the list mainly because his past form hadnt been that violent the most serious a pistolwhipping in the course of but the details about his car accident and selective amnesia moved him higher his scheduled recovered memory sessions with a psychiatrist leonard truelle higher still by the time theyd dug down and uncovered truelles drinking and gambling problems and his heavy bookdebt to a street loan shark raoul ferrer durrant was top of the list there was only one thing left to find out whether truelle with the bait set how they planned would go for it the first news bulletin complete with jacs photo went out on a local tv station wwl at pm derminget asked if they could delay to another bulletin in half an hour or an hour but was told that was the last news bulletin of the day its either then or wait until seventhirty am tomorrow immediacy derminget was convinced was the main key to mcelroys lawyer being able to talk him in a bulletin the next morning lacked immediate threat gave mcelroy too long to dwell on it so derminget decided to mislead langfranc that along with the apb hed hold fire with the news bulletin for half an hour though he did keep to his promise about the apb one out of two at least and at first the latenight bulletin would probably only draw the attention of a few blearyeyed barflies it would take more than half an hour in any case for any worthwhile calls to come in but the desk clerk at the palmetto motel recognized the photo straightaway and dialled while the tailend of the bulletin was still on screen a lawyer with local firm payne beaton amp sawyer mr mcelroy has been in the news recently for other reasons his plea petition handling of libreville death row inmate lawrence durrant whose execution is scheduled for ten days time derminget was notified of the call only minutes after putting the phone down from his lastshot warning call to langfranc derminget paused only fleetingly before giving the nod to dispatch the closest squad cars if mcelroys reaction to langfrancs warning call was to flee hed never forgive himself or more to the point captain broughlan head of the station house would never forgive him for letting the opportunity to grab mcelroy slip from his grasp two squad cars arrived at the palmetto motel within only eight minutes impressive but that was the last thing to go right captain broughlan scanned down the catalogue of disasters filed in dermingets report at first light the next morning the sharp glint in his eyes only softened by a teasing leer of disbelief as he finished and looked across at derminget so you had half the eighth and first tight on his ass a chopper too and he disappeared right under your noses broughlan threw up invisible dust with one hand thin air yeah and no sign of him since nothing from any other calls in no none that have panned out derminget nodded dolefully his bloodhound eyes quite sexy to women when he eyed them broodingly across a latenight cocktail bar now morose and defeated looked pathetic he obviously got in a car passing on the interchange obviously broughlan smiled tightly busy that time of night busy enough were not going to be able to narrow down to anything useful from nearby cams our only hope is that whoever picked him up will catch a later news bulletin and phone in theres a lot of coverage right now yeah jem lot of coverage broughlan echoed his tone suddenly harder warier and the reason for that is its a big event would have been anyways with a lawyer on the run for murder but the fact that its larry durrants lawyer with only days now till his execution has shot the story into the stratosphere broughlan held his palms out so as you say a lot of coverage to help us succeed but also a lot of eyes watching for if we dont broughlan tilted his swivel chair back a fraction but his eyes stayed keenly sharply on derminget and with half of new orleans watching on the outcome we cant afford to fail jem thats simply not an option find jac mcelroy and find him quick clive beaton didnt see the pm bulletin but he received a call minutes later from tom payne relating the bombshell news the minute he put down the phone from payne he called john langfranc at home langfranc didnt hold anything back little point with an ongoing investigation most of it would soon be out in the open but most importantly it was the only way to get across to beaton the main details of why jac thought hed been set up that as may be beaton said curtly but until such time as the police adopt that stance hes a fugitive and so for now thats how this firm must deal with him i see langfranc had expected little else beaton distancing the firm as quickly as possible are you saying also that you dont want me to continue representing jac mcelroy or his girlfriend thats exactly what im saying that whole business of you knowing the gun was being hidden could get awkward its one thing knowing after the event but during the cry could come up of withholding and without that mcelroy calling you in the process of that action youve got no rationale for him running off one of the main defence pillars collapses i understand okay resignation in langfrancs voice but he held back from outright dissention beaton had a point and what about durrant its his bop hearing tomorrow do you want me to go along im not sure yet what to do there i need overnight to think on it some more but beaton had decided within the first minute of hearing the news more distance although he didnt want the firm to in any way appear noncaring or negligent so having the next morning prepared mcelroys dismissal letter and immediately notified the local media that due to the circumstances now surrounding mr mcelroy he was no longer with the firm next on his list was prison warden haveling and given the sudden nature of those circumstances weve unfortunately been left short on time to get someone else there for his bop hearing later today haveling mentioned another possible option for the hearing which beaton having engineered a few emergencies to fill langfrancs diary for the day duly relayed to langfranc apparently durrants got a good friend inside hector rodriguez who has basic paralegal experience and more to the point is fully conversant with the bop procedure good chance hell sit in with him langfranc wasnt happy was sure thered been some beaton sleightofhand in the background he hadnt become senior partner for nothing but he reminded himself of that groan of disapproval like the low rumbling of an approaching storm when hed told beaton hed been aware of mcelroy disposing of his girlfriends gun while beatons pen was in dismissallettersigning flow he didnt want to tempt fate langfranc sighed resignedly i suppose all the main arguments mcelroy has already submitted in the petition before them this rodriguez should be able to handle it from there but as beaton agreed offhandly yes he should and hung up the words left a sour tang in langfrancs mouth he was getting almost as bad as beaton almost because while he might now and then spin the right rhetoric he hadnt yet got to the stage of believing it himself jac found it hard to stop shaking another car had passed him on the ramp but a trailertruck behind stopped hed originally told the truck driver half an eye fixed on the approaching helicopter light over the drivers shoulder that he wanted to go to gramercy the first place to spring to mind on highway westbound then when the driver mentioned stopping before that for gas and a quick coffee jac quickly amended well on the way there small community between the highway and great river road ill point it out when we get closer the truck driver pushing forty but trying to cling to youth with shoulderlength hair and an earring obviously hadnt seen the news bulletin yet but if they stopped in a busy roadside cafe chances are someone there would have he had some garth brooks playing in the background which after a moment with a dont bother you none he turned up perhaps hed had it up loud before so hadnt noticed the sirens though at such a busy junction sirens wailing were perhaps nothing unusual at only one point about six miles into the drive did the driver eye him curiously the tshirt and the rain outside perhaps not correlating not the best night to be out breakdown jac said towtruck kept me hanging for forty minutes but i didnt want to miss out totally on seeing this old friend havent seen him for a while since college in fact the truck driver nodded thoughtfully the casual collegebuddy dress jac flustered and wet from the rain his uncertainty about where his old friend lived jac hoped that the component parts slotted in but in the long gaps when they didnt talk at all above garth brooks and the thrum of the trucks wheels on the road jac could still hear the thudthud of the helicopter blades pushing the images of the night through his mind gerry with half his skull blown away youve shot him youve shot himsirens wailing as he ran through the night youve got to give yourself up to the police jac the ram hitting the door the helicopter light moving in your new girlfriend ill bet you she hasnt told you what we did together that coffee stops about five miles up the road now what the thudding so heavy in his head that it took a second for the words to register truck stop crowds of people jac peered at the road ahead he had to get dropped off before then but they hadnt passed any houses or signs of life for a while i i think where i want is not far ahead now jac said hopefully this looks familiar but as another two miles rolled by with nothing either side jac became desperate the tv on in the truck stop people looking between the tv and himself pointing its him its him finally a few shacks and woodframe bungalows appeared two hundred yards to his left yes here here a deadandalive place but it was the best he was going to get he couldnt afford to wait longer quick smile and thanks as he stepped down a sokay buddy from the driver but again that curious stare jac concerned that some things hadnt added up for the driver and as soon as he got down the road hed get on his cellphone to the police jac ran down the narrow road leading to the houses ditches either side fields beyond a small farming community the town if it could be called that half a dozen streets with forty or so small woodframe bungalows was deserted the only person he saw was an old black man eyeing him with lazy curiosity from his front veranda as he went by jac slowed from a run to a rapid walk white man walking around in the dead of night in a small black farming community hands would be reaching to phone for the police as quickly here as at the truck stop and as jac got round the corner already he could hear a siren approaching becoming stronger for a moment before drifting into the distance as it passed on highway jac eased his breath swallowing back against his hammering nerves this was ludicrous only an hour hed been on the run and already there was nowhere left for him to go truck stop small town and as more people saw the news bulletin it would get worse heading back to the city would be out of the question as would contacting family or friends by now almost certainly monitored and the main reason he wanted to stay loose and free trying to save larry durrant in the remaining days left a million miles away impossible jac shook his head he had to face it there was nowhere left for him to go nothing left that he could do im sorry sorry jac mouthed softly towards the night sky letting the raindrops hit his face for a second wash away the guilt i did everything i could jac found a phone booth in the next street but his body was still shaking as he approached it the images still thudding through his mind larry durrants pleading face now among them promise me counselor you wont just forget about me and leave me here to rot because theres somebody ive been apart from already far too long if i could just see his face see that it wasnt me i could turn and shout that out to her in the courtroom it wasnt me ma it wasnt me this is a dying mans drink isnt ityou dont see much hope left jac imagining that his last steps towards the phone booth were larry durrants as he approached the execution chamber and now there was nothing left to stop that jacs hand shook wildly as he fed in the coins to call john langfranc but as the last dime slid in jac was struck with another thought rodriguez thought he was doing fine until the woman on the left of the two men that made up the board of pardons panel started to speak midforties severe hair in a small beehive blackrimmed almondshaped glasses which she perched on the front of her hairdo or end of her nose peering unwaveringly at rodriguez and larry durrant the questioning from the two men one bearded in his midfifties the other a cleancut late thirties had been mostly perfunctory filling in the details when did you become more strictly religious mr durrant five years into your term any particular reason for the timing soon after your mother dying did you feel that might have been a factor then a catalyst for something that was already there you say is that how youd like it termed in our report okay and your correspondence degree in literature how long did that take three years thats a long haul and a lot of application very commendable larry answered most of the questions directly at first but at that point rodriguez took over more as it became obvious that larry was uncomfortable expanding too much about his personal achievements private and guarded to a fault even when his life depended on it rodriguez had been nervous about speaking on behalf of larry at first especially with what was at stake larrys very life riding on how he handled things but with jac obviously not able to be there what other choice was there and faced with that hobsons choice hed egged himself on you can do it can do it pacing up and down anxiously in his cell repeating set pieces and lines and the same too in the waiting room for the six minutes that felt like a lifetime before they were called in except then there was just pacing the words seemed to have suddenly evaporated from his brain the amenable attitudes of the two men eased his nerves a fraction the words starting to come back again but mrs beehive worried him that cool unflinching stare each time he caught her eye the only saving grace was that she hadnt spoken yet and so rodriguez was able to focus more on the two men rodriguez waxed lyrical about durrants literary expertise and character in general and as hed done before with jac hed brought with him a few books and prison magazines to illustrate larrys writing and editing skills a couple of approving nods from the bop panel but as rodriguez used much the same line he had with jac then as you can see hes a long way from the larry durrant he was when he first came to libreville eleven years ago he couldnt help thinking about the absent lawyer bateson had hauled himself and larry into the tv room straight after breakfast and he should have guessed from the gathering there mostly his and larrys clique along with shavell and a handful of his diehards few prisoners without strong allegiances either way that it wasnt for a runofthemill presidential or state governor announcement or a rerun of the last saints game the item about jac was first up as the bulletin shifted from national to local news a wry smile from bateson as rodriguez looked around a more open leer from shavell and the same numbed shock on larrys face that hit rodriguez in that instant though with an added tinge of warped acceptance as if larry had seen so much was so tired of it all with death now close that nothing would really surprise him any more but the little show quickly backfired on bateson as the news item fully unfolded police were apparently close to apprehending mr mcelroy late last night in the midcity area but in the end that bid failed bc on his feet punching the air with one fist go jac go and so he remains at large with the police appealing to the public for fresh sightings and information on mr mcelroy with the accompanying warning that he should not be approached directly as rodriguez got to his feet joining the chorus of two or three that had quickly joined bc bateson redfaced hastily wound everything up barking along with two other guards for them to clear the room and heavy contributions to the prison magazine too i see rodriguez brought his attention back to the bearded man though the question was aimed equally at himself and larry who was nodding the panel had been introduced at the outset of the meeting but rodriguez had promptly forgotten their names theyd simply become beardedman cleancut and beehive yes in fourteen of the sixteen editions i believe rodriguez said doing the quick calculation started four years ago quarterly only two editions that larry hadnt contributed to hes been one of the strongest voices and rolemodels for black inmates at libreville another thoughtful nod from beardedman one more quick note on his pad cleancut following suit but beehive just kept staring at him imperiously and finally she spoke this newfound literary expertise is all very well but im more concerned with how it has been put to use she puckered her mouth as if shed encountered a sour taste as she turned the pages in the magazine before her then held the position with one finger she looked up again mr durrants article in issue nine of libreview rodriguez looked helplessly at the two magazines hed brought along issue nine wasnt one of them right he said a faint flush rising as his mind desperately scrambled for which article that might have been in this edition he comments on the execution of marybeth fuller in texas and questions the texas governors stance in not offering her a last minute reprieve because and i quote marybeth fuller was clearly mad yet the eighth amendment of the constitution is equally clear in prohibiting execution of the insane beehive looked up sharply above her glasses her eyes shifting more directly to durrant this time you go on to say mr durrant that this is a subject uncomfortably close to home because of your own and again i quote poor state of mind and memory at the time of your arrest for the murder of jessica roche which gave rise to your own good counsel questioning your own culpability this time beehive hadnt looked down for the quote shed just held the same steady stare now alternating evenly between durrant and rodriguez yeah i wrote that larry said flatly matteroffactly but im somewhat lost as to what exac im sure mr durrant wouldnt for a minute dream of detaching himself from that article rodriguez cut in quickly sensing larrys belligerent tone heading for a confrontation just because it might now suit him to do so hes understandably proud of everything hes written but at the same time its only an opinion yes mr rodriguez beehive exhaled heavily as if mustering patience to deal with an errant schoolchild but what concerns me about that opinion is the dilemma it now presents to this board two of the strongest factors we have to consider in recommending pardon is firstly that prisoners fully repent their crime and secondly and in hand with that that they fully accept the judgement of the courts justice system and our governor upon whose mercy they now throw themselves yet here we have a prisoner who questions their very guilt so how can we even get to the stage of acceptance and repentance beehive shrugged and on top is also questioning the judgement of our fair governor before hes even considered the issue durrant blinked slowly a faint smile creasing his lips acceptance or challenge rodriguez wasnt sure i can see that rodriguez said eager to speak before larry opened his mouth and possibly dug them in deeper but im sure that though as rodriguez said it he had no idea what he was sure of his mouth was suddenly dry his throat tight as beehive stared at him curiously expectantly iim sure thats not how mr durrant meant it all he could think of quickly the stare stayed steadily evenly on rodriguez one eyebrow now raised imperiously doubtingly and it was obvious to everyone in the room that he was floundering desperately treading water a few basic legalese phrases strung together from firstyear law books combined with some fast talk from the streets and being on the radio who was he kidding shed probably ridden roughshod over some of the toughest lawyers in the state but this might be larrys very last chance he couldnt just give up at the first obstacle i can see how it might look he said injecting more conviction but that articles just one of many that larry durrants written in libreview diversion thought rodriguez if he couldnt win on one front shift to another if we look at some others this one here for instance in issue eleven that ive brought along we see that mr rodriguez beehive cut in sharply with a tired sigh she wasnt about to be suckered in mr durrants literary expertise and comments in other areas are not in question i brought up this particular article because it presents specific problems to this board in its recommendation for clemency i understand rodriguez nodded suitably humbled a light buzzing now in his head feeling slightly dizzy disorientated where else to head what else to try and as that owlish unwavering gaze cut through him his cheeks burning and the room starting to sway uncertainly around him he wished that he was anywhere than here at this moment and so until such time as those issues are answered if they can be then i dont see the point in beehive broke off sharply and looked past rodriguez shoulder as the door opened behind them yes i apologize profusely for the late intrusion darrell ayliss attorney at law all eyes in the room were fixed on the man late forties overweight oileddown black hair greying at the sides hornrimmed glasses a cream suit as if hed just returned from havana as he stepped forward and handed cards to each of the bop panel then nodded briefly towards durrant and rodriguez because of the unfortunate turn of events with mr mcelroy i was not informed of the situation until late in the day by my old colleague michael coultaine who as you are all probably aware handled the original trial and appeal for mr durrant and i got here as soon as i could ayliss adjusted his glasses on the bridge of his nose and pushed a tight smile to all present now you were saying mrs elleridge gloria elleridge mrs elleridge your reputation precedes you heard much about your good work on the board aylisss pronounced southern accent had a smooth lilting singsong edge the compliment raised a faint blush from beehive now you just go right ahead someone else in on it carmen malastra should have realized that from the outset to prevent skimming all employees including the manager were searched going in and out of his casinos and were allowed no more than fifty bucks in their pockets and malastra regularly changed the security guards in case they might get involved so that meant to get any significant cash out of the baytree regularly jouliern would have needed a courier the search for george joulierns likely money courier had gone well at first from the video library of the baytree casino floor malastra built up a strong picture of who jouliern had met with during the eighteen months to two years the scam had been running jouliern was a popular man very popular very sociable a greeting for everyone a few gracious words spoken before hed touch their arm smile and move on but it was the occasions when more than a few words were spoken that drew malastras interest or when a look of concern might cross joulierns face perhaps it might be someone hed just sit next to nonchalantly hardly paying them any attention except that it would have to happen on a regular basis and thered be that moment when an envelope or small package would be passed between them even if halfconcealed beneath a table or left under a jacket draped over a barstool malastra followed every inch of joulierns movements over that period fastforwarding stopping leaning closer to the screen when something caught his interest zooming in tracing one finger over jouliern and the face next to him in the frame wondering could it be you but the problem was there were too many faces too many that jouliern met with regularly and shared more than a few words with malastra had started off with forty or more possible suspects but after days at the computer was finding it hard to narrow down beyond eighteen no regular telltale envelopes passed from jouliern that would immediately lift one of them from the pack malastra became convinced that he wasnt going to be able to find joulierns courier it was going to remain a mystery he decided to pay a personal visit to the baytree casino floor in case there was something hed overlooked the new manager there tony caccia greeted him with a wide smile mr malastra so nice to see you here yeah malastra said curtly he visited rarely and usually went straight to the upstairs office without visiting the casino floor he promptly turned his back on caccia and went round the casino checking the angles of the video cameras the manager following uncertainly from four paces behind having done a full circuit of the room he turned back to caccia any blind spots on the video cams that youre aware of no dont think so why malastra looked at him sharply if youre going to continue working for me the first thing to get clear is never answer my questions with a question only jewish businessmen and wily old italians like myself do that its fucking annoying okay okay sorry then only two days later when hed all but given up on it malastra saw the news item on jac mcelroy lawyer to larry durrant jessica roches murderer of twelve years ago but what piqued malastras interest was the victims name gerald strelloff it rang a bell and minutes later he found it on his computer strelloff had worked as a barman at the baytree at the time of the scam and the exgirlfriend named in the news bulletin as part of the love triangle that led to the murder alaysha reyner still worked at one of his clubs pinkies then malastra recalled that nelm had phoned him when hed first latched on to joulierns scam to apologize for raoul ferrers hit a coincidence maybe but it left malastra with an uneasy feeling maybe thats how jouliern had done it instead of handing to the courier directly hed used the barman gerry strelloff countless conversations between them every week and numerous papers and envelopes with till receipts and stock reorder lists passed between them the ideal cover but then strelloff would also have been searched in and out of the casino so would have needed someone else to pass on to malastra got back to his computer and started searching for the person strelloff might have used over the following fortyeight hours lieutenant jerome dermingets department fielded over twenty possible sightings of jac mcelroy seventy percent of them could be discounted straightaway and of the remaining thirty percent they followed up only one sounded like it might be bona fide an elderly farm cooperative worker from a small settlement out by the great river road if mcelroy had got a lift at the morrison interchange as they suspected then the timing of the sighting coincided with when he might have been dropped off in that area but the man didnt phone in with the sighting until the next morning when he first saw a news report and by then understandably mcelroy had long gone from the area though what most worried derminget was that mcelroy seemed to have disappeared from every other area from the other suspected sightings a couple of closebutnocigars the rest had been a mile off the mark broughlan had been screaming for results yet with each passing hour the chances of finding mcelroy were looking slimmer after twentyfour hours with no more firm sightings despite mcelroys face appearing on every local news bulletin and in the newspapers the first real concerns began to fester at the eight district station house after fortyeight hours still with nothing it was all but official jac mcelroy had disappeared from the face of the earth had without doubt left the state if not the country he was incredible fuckin awesome the zoro of how to cream the bop with a few swift strokes rodriguez mimed two elaborate sword strokes with one hand rodriguez was holding court in the prison canteen the morning after the bop hearing and had the attention of everyone at his long table with some heads also turned from the tables each side first thing is he gets her to repeat her beef which o course straightoff gets her more shaky of her ground then like he was doing her a favour he cuts in halfway and says he knows and respects the point shes makin and is glad shes raised it only someone as astute as yourself mrs elleridge would pick up on the worrying subtext of mr durrants articles in the way you have hes laying on the compliments like thick treacle to soften her up and shes blushin and so open to anything by now that she might as well have her panties down by her ankles so then he gives her the first test jab sayin that hes sure thats not what larry durrant meant by that article what makes you say that she quizzes knees twitchin now worried that she might have made a big mistake leaving herself so open but its too late with a little teasin smile he rams home wit the fuck you says that if she noticed in the article durrant uses the third person throughout he sites texas statutes regarding marybeth fuller and his own lawyer with culpability doubts in his own case at no time does he express those opinions as his own she starts splutterin that as may be realizin now that shes gettin fucked but not sure how to stop it and he rams home with the final killer stroke rodriguez did another sword swipe in the air to accompany his hip thrust and thats supported too by what from his files mr mcelroy was faced with when he first saw larry durrant what was that she asks wide open again this girl jus wouldn learn rodriguez smiled crookedly and shook his head the fact that at that point durrant said he wanted to die didnt want a plea made on his behalf mr smoothsouthernass then looks at the panel long and hard and says now you cant get more accepting of guilt than that you see its not larry durrant himself whos questioned his guilt or felt that his life might be worth pleading for its his lawyers mr coultaine mr mcelroy and now myself and if weve been wrong in doing that then i humbly apologize rodriguez was in his element playing to his audience laying on a thick southern accent for ayliss and switching to high and squeaky for beehive elleridge rodriguez punched a fist skyward as he finished fuckin ace peretti was the first to show his support by slapping the flat of one hand against the table with a yeah yeah which set off more tableslapping along with some wuhwuh fratboy monkey chants rodriguez taking a quick bow before he caught the quizzical glare from elden on guard duty at the far end but as rodriguez sat back down the clamour as quickly dying he knew that it was mainly bravado to fire everyone up kid them and himself that there was still strong hope left drag them away from the reality only eight days left now for larry and little hope okay give me the lowdown roche wheezed heavily into the phone the panic of the past fortyeight hours and the nervous anticipation waiting for nelms call back weighing like a rock in his chest what have you been able to find out about him darrell christopher ayliss one of mike coultaines old colleagues from way back one of the best criminal lawyers in mississippi at the time were talking almost twenty years back to seven years ago latenineties before he went to mexico mexico yeah thats where he hitailed it to after his divorce messy business on top of the half his wife wanted a big chunk of his new partnership he said fuck it in that case there is no partnership headed to puerto vallarta and started selling real estate and handling some conveyance for americans buying there he sent her maintenance though not what she was claiming plus presents and money for their daughter christmas and birthdays she apparently pursued him for the extra money for a while then gave up the ghost when she moved to oregon a few years back is that why maybe he feels its safe to come back here now maybe but if thats the case it was a sudden decision like the minute that coultaine got on the phone and said he needed help ayliss was on the next plane because from what i can find out up until now hes been in mexico roche chewed the information over for a moment his breath falling more steadily so he owes coultaine a favour or two or theyre close enough for that uhhuh ayliss was with bowyer and turnbull in jackson before then did a twoyear stint with payne beaton and sawyer thats where he and coultaine first met and when ayliss went back to jackson to start up a partnership they kept in contact and obviously they have since too one of the best criminal lawyers at the time you say from what i hear of those in the early nineties tipped to be the next f lee bailey ayliss was a prime contender from roches more troubled breathing at the other end that obviously wasnt what he wanted to hear nelm forced a tentative chuckle but after eight years selling condos in mexico hes probably as rusty as shit silence just the steady rise and fall of roches laboured breathing he wasnt in the mood to be humoured and the psychiatrist roche asked after a moment have you been able to find out if its gameon again with him bateson says yeah apparently so when day after tomorrow roche exhaled tiredly all that palaver with mcelroy just to gain three days back where we started and by the looks of it with a stronger lawyer to boot nelm had half expected the taunt with it being his plan but he was damned if he was going to apologize for it despite everything once again slipping sideways it had without doubt been their best plan yet three days delay that might be all we need at this stage and the second session planned is for some reason two days later before with mcelroy it was scheduled straight the day after so another day delay there too you know ticking away ticking away you want to convince yourself so that you feel better about it fine but dont expect me to buy into it if this psychiatrist cracks durrant whether its a day or just an hour before his execution were screwed nelm felt like reaching down the phone and squeezing the last feeble breaths out of roche but he had a point not exactly much were gonna be able to do about it as weve just seen we get rid of the psychiatrist theyll just get another one in nelm could sense from roches breathing becoming heavier more troubled that this was the hardest part for him letting go a lifetime of controlling manipulating with his grubby little paws it was completely alien to him admitting that for once he couldnt push and mould things exactly how and where he wanted we might just have to ride this one out nelm added after a moment and of course pray but roche was hardly listening his thoughts cannoning frantically in rhythm with his fractured breathing there must be something we can do something darrell ayliss was sweating profusely as he paced back through the seemingly endless cavernous grey corridors of libreville he was a large man with an awkward gait and the sweat poured off him testament to just how hot it was in libreville or perhaps equally it was from durrants words still burning through his head from the session just finished with greg ormdern or the crushing reminder that had run through him like a redhot pulse in time with the wall clock ticking down the minutes of the session only six days left now to possibly save durrant ayliss inhaled deeply of the air outside just before he got in his rented dodge stratus observed the mph speed limit for the two miles of shale road back towards the guard post then gunned it once clear the other side he let out a slow heavy breath as if blowing off the steam of the prison and the session and hit play on the tape recorder on his passenger seat ormderns voice drifted out durrants more muted timbre interspersed the tinny tone of the recorder almost matching how hed initially heard it through the small speaker in the observation room with pete folley at his side looking on through the glass screen as ormdern questioned durrant on a campbed set up in the adjoining interview room ormdern had been adamant that there should be no possible distractions in the room and the sound feed and glass screen at the same time gave ayliss what he wanted not only to be able to hear every word but watch every nuance and beat of durrants expression he wanted to feel the experience not just hear it it had taken almost ten minutes to get larry fully under then another few minutes for ormdern to set mood and place put durrant in the moment eighteenth of february the roches garden district residence the night that everything went wrong with the robbery and jessica roche ormdern had said that he didnt want to use overtly leading words like kill or murder theres part of larry durrant probably still in denial most likely why hes never described actually pulling the trigger and i dont want to inadvertently draw that out put up his defences youve already broken in the house and i want you to tell me what you see there in the rooms before youre disturbed by jessica roche inin what way which rooms lets start with the library you went there to rob the house and thats where you found the safe i understand yeah thats where i found it thats where i was in fact when thats okay ormdern cut in sharply what happened with jessica roche has been covered many times already its going back before that im interested in before ormdern dragged the word out giving it a soothing quality larrys breathing had become agitated irregular and as ormdern repeated himself before before it gradually settled back down that room the library itself for instance what did it look like i dont know it was dark i didnt really pay attention okay okay the safe then youd have concentrated on that because you were about to break it yeah yeah larry swallowing a long pause as he applied thought straightforward twisttumbler lock as i recall and the colour i dont know grey or green i think another heavy pause but its difficult as i say it was dark and i was disturbed pretty soon before id really had a chance to thats okay larry thats okay youve done well now it was ormderns turn to pause anything else that stood out in the house or that room however small or inconsequential only the sound of larrys steady breathing a faint swallow then he started mumbling something indiscernible and ormdern lost him for a few moments at that point try and focus again larry focus focus repetitive the voice fading softer each time thats it larry thats it gently closing in ormdern getting the images to settle again behind durrants flickering eyelids tell me what you see noth nothing that stood out that much really lot of books in the room obviously along one side ayliss had to concentrate on the road for a moment he reached over and turned off the tape as he came off highway and negotiated the turn on to the causeway lake pontchartrain spread each side like a dark moody blanket the only relief some faint moon glow one side and the reflected lights of new orleans in the distance ayliss didnt switch on again until he was a few miles into the causeway do you remember which side of the room they were uh uh righthand side as you walk in i believe oh and there there yeah ormdern prompting as larry paused heavily again go ahead larry tell me there was a large clock in the hallway i seem to remember one of those ornate grandfather clocks ayliss clenched a fist tight on the steering wheel the sort of detail that would seal durrants fate rather than save it if his memory of detail in the house had been scant they could have cast doubt on his recall of the murder itself claimed that it had somehow been suggested or even implanted those few details could be enough to support that he was definitely there unless those descriptions didnt match what ayliss discovered at the old roche residence okay weve covered what you might have actually seen in the house but i want to deal now with what you might have actually felt while you were there your fear and anxiety with what happened with jessica roche has already been dealt with in depth but i wondered if at any time you had the feeling that someone else apart from her was there at the time someone watching that you probably didnt see or know about only felt their presence i was there at the time aylisss hands clenched back tight on the wheel as he waited out the long silence on tape recalling larrys brow furrowing heavily finally no i i cant say i did didnt in fact hear any sounds in the house larrys breathing steady measured then after a brief swallow falling shorter again uneven not even jessica roche upstairs otherwise id have got out of there earlier only heard her footsteps approaching at the last minute when thats okay larry you dont need to go there ormdern cut in sharply youve covered that more than enough in the past move on again to afterwards afterwards that drawn out soothing tone again afterwards as youre leaving the roche house apart from the woman walking her dog do you recall anyone else that might have seen you no brief silence not that i can recall at a neighbouring house perhaps in their garden or looking out from a window someone that you didnt notice before longer pause then no sorry nothing i was running hard by then my mind set on just getting away from there perhaps wouldnt have even noticed the woman with her dog if i hadnt looked back right i can understand that flicking of paper as ormdern checked back through the notes ayliss had handed him before the session i want to take you somewhere else now larry same week in but a completely different place the bayou brew bar and your regular pool game there with your buddies nat hadley ted levereaux and bill saunders a moments pause as ormdern let the new location and people settle in durrants mind now i want you to try and recall larry was your game that week before or after that night at the roche house uh uh before i think ayliss turned the tape off again for a moment as he came off the causeway and didnt switch on again until after hed made the turn on to earhart boulevard you think concentrate larry its important can you place the day with any certainty yeah yeah before im pretty sure think pretty sure too easily argued as reflecting uncertainty ayliss considered wouldnt get him past square one with governor candaret okay before then do you remember how long how many days i dont know a day or two before maybe dont know maybe more uncertainty heavy pause as ormdern consulted aylisss notes again looking for the key point mentioned that would help nail the day down bill saunders okay lets see if we can tie it down another way what and who did you see there were all your playing buddies there that night yeah larrys tone offhand ayliss recalled him giving a little shrug at that juncture they were all there as ayliss turned onto louisiana avenue he checked his watch looked like hed get there six or seven minutes earlier than hed said hed had to lay on the southern charm thick and heavy to get the new owners agreement to look through the house though hardly surprising given its past history are you sure about that particularly bill saunders was he there that night yeah bill was there absolutely sure yeah a hundred per cent this time ayliss banged one fist against the steering wheel rather than the airpunch when hed first heard those words an hour ago in the observation room ormdern had looked up at the clock at that point only four minutes remaining then had brought larry back out explaining to ayliss afterwards that he didnt want to get deep into what else larry might have seen in the bayou brew that night only to have to break his train of thought halfway through ayliss slowed as he came to the first houses of the garden district on washington avenue taking the turn into coliseum street two blocks down at least theyd ended on a positive note high chances that the pool game was that crucial thursday night because bill saunders had been there rather than running his daughter to dance lessons ayliss would know just how high once hed spoken to saunders ayliss was counting numbers as he went along he swung in and pulled to a stop as he came to the old roche residence a resplendent antebellum mansion with twostorey high corinthian columns supporting a thirtyfoot wide front portico problem was that coinciding pool game was at odds with the details durrant had provided from the roche house if theyd been as he described grey or green safe with a twisttumbler lock grandfather clock books along the righthand side because he couldnt have been both places that night playing pool and killing jessica roche everything hinged on what ayliss found out now and what the new owners the mortons might remember ten years now theyd been in the house roche had put it on the market straight after the trial but it had taken eleven months to finally find a buyer ayliss closed his eyes for a second to compose himself if this factfinding now went the wrong way in an hour he could be phoning ormdern to cancel the second session something along the lines those details durrant gave match what ive been able to find out from the house itself theres no other possible explanation he was there that night theres little point in us continuing nor in fact do i even feel inclined from a purely ethical point of view to put in more time trying to save an obviously guilty man a light wind outside ruffled the trees a timeless district like this early december probably wasnt that different to how it had been midfebruary twelve years ago ayliss wondered just how much of the house inside might have also remained in a time warp he noticed a curtain moving on a downstairs window the mortons checking out if it was their expected visitor with a resigned sigh ayliss got out the car and approached the house follow him see where he goes and who he might meet with roches predictable advice when he called back the next evening about ayliss nelm felt like ribbing and how exactly should i go about that you know after a month of doing fuck all else with mcelroy i might need some guidance not exactly that imaginative simply swap one mark for another but with the way those few words had been delivered slowly and purposefully between pained breaths as if they had real significance nelm could tell that roche was still in no mood for humour so all he said was okay ill get right on it then as if an afterthought or roche felt his instructions should be meted out separately in case nelm couldnt cope with more than one at a time oh and get onto his exwife in oregon too tell her that her past dearlybeloved is back in town and so she might want to take the opportunity to slap the rest of that old maintenance order back on his ass roche did actually manage a brief forced chuckle then but it lapsed into a small cough as it caught an incoming breath the wrong way should keep him on his toes and hopefully his eye off the ball with durrant with his wife hot on his tail again might even hitail it straight back to mexico if were lucky if were lucky a bit more of a plan but nelm played it lowkey didnt want to be too enthusiastic she might just say that that was all history she had no interest in chasing his sorry ass any more ill see if i can make contact with her the next morning nelm put a call through to bateson and asked him to make a note of darrell aylisss cartype and registration when he arrived at libreville that evening for the session with ormdern then he started making calls to track down melanie aylisss phone number in oregon batesons return call came at pm and thirtyfive minutes later nelm left his apartment and drove out to just before the start of the pontchartraine causeway made a hasty uturn in a gap in the traffic and stopped at the first pullin where he could watch cars coming off the causeway hed got there early just in case and had to wait over half an hour before aylisss steelblue dodge stratus went past him nelm let one more car pass then pulled out and followed earhart then louisiana lasalle as soon as ayliss took the turn onto washington avenue nelm suspected where he was heading confirmed as ayliss slowed the other side of st charles looking out for coliseum street nelm had spent little time in the area since that night in driven past it several times and through it on a few occasions out of necessity but never stayed for any time there he kept straight on as ayliss turned into coliseum street then took the next turn on chestnut and again on street effectively circling round the block and sure enough as he nosed his car out enough to get a partial view ayliss was closing his car door and heading up the path towards the roches old house for the first twenty minutes of waiting nelm stayed calm tried not to think too much about what ayliss might be doing in there but as the minutes ticked by his thoughts started to multiply maybe some vital clue from the session with durrant that ayliss was checking out or something ayliss had picked up on that nobody had before or perhaps he was just familiarizing himself with the crime scene standard practice the atmosphere of the street also began to close in on nelm then its quietness and isolation from the city close by the shadows heavier deeper from the large mansions and more abundant tree cover the reminders of that night drifting back jessica roches eyes staring back pleadingly just before that final shot the woman walking her dog holding his gaze for a second as hed looked back nelms pulse was still raised a notch his hands gently trembling on the steering wheel when almost an hour later ayliss left the house he pulled out again to follow him st charles jackson simon bolivar finally stopping at a hotel two blocks from the main train and greyhound bus terminals again nelm drifted past and then turned around and parked a block away where he had a clear sight of aylisss dodge in their side car park maybe ayliss would head out later for dinner or another meeting nelm considered but after an hour of waiting pm by then nelm began to think that ayliss might be there for the night had grabbed something to eat in the hotel he left it another twenty minutes then went into the hotel he approached the reception desk ive got a business colleague staying here darrell ayliss and i promised to drop off some papers for him tomorrow morning but i dont want to miss him before he heads off and he told me he was having an early night so i didnt want to disturb him now but i wondered what time he might have an alarm call or breakfast ordered might give me a clue as to when hell be heading out the desk clerks brow furrowed mr ayliss has already left sir but his rental cars still in the car park i know sir he left the keys here for the carrental company to pick up and got in a cab forty minutes ago nelm tried to recall the dozen or so cabs hed seen pull up in that time and the people hed seen get in them the only possibility had been a man shuffling in with a homburg hat pulled down but it hadnt looked like ayliss no hornrimmed glasses no dark lank hair in sight different jacket which nelm supposed had been the idea a muscle twitched sharply in nelms jaw thanks he said and as soon as he was outside the hotel he took out his cellphone perhaps ayliss was moving around because of his exwife or possibly coultaine had whispered in his ear that given what had happened to mcelroy it was advisable to remain shadowy and elusive nelm had phoned melanie aylisss number earlier and been told mom wont be back till late this evening shopping and then sociology evening class nelm hadnt planned to try her again until the next day but if this was going to be the name of the game with ayliss runaround city the sooner his exwife was chasing his ass the better with two of them trying to find him he wouldnt find it so easy to slip away darrell aylisss cab took him deeper into the city through the warehouse district cbd and french quarter to a smaller more intimate hotel with a quaint spanish courtyard and pool on the edge of faubourg marigny he glanced through the cabs back window a couple of times nobody following that he could tell but then he hadnt noticed anyone following earlier either just basic precautions change his hotel and his rental car every day keep on the move hed phoned to book the room under his name four hours back and as he checked in the desk clerk informed him that his guest had already arrived about half an hour ago the desk clerk handed him his key room twentynine first floor ayliss nodded with a tight smile and despite it being only one floor took the elevator he felt as awkward as hell moving around felt as if all that clammy heat and stale sweat from libreville was still trapped against his skin noises from the ensuite as he walked in running water hed knock the door in a minute but meanwhile he couldnt wait any longer to get everything off first his oversized jacket and shirt then the padding strapped around his shoulders and waist that made him look seventy pounds heavier he leant forward to shake and blink out the two brown contact lenses into his right palm then finally stripped to the waist standing in front of the dressingtable mirror he started peeling off the skincoloured prosthetic stuck tight to his cheeks and around his jaw the bathroom door opened and reflected in the mirror he saw alaysha reyner leaning against the door frame in burgundyred la perla panties and matching bra she smiled slyly my my mr mcelroy i swear i only recognize you with your clothes off he felt an ache of longing as he looked at her but as he remembered gerrys words ill bet you she hasnt told you one thing our dirty sordid little secret before he ran off into the night with her gun it dissolved into something else in his stomach something sourer more uncertain but equally as painful as jac had been about to phone john langfranc that night out by the great river road hed suddenly thought of morvaun jaspar hed stood frozen in the same position for a couple of minutes turning over in his mind whether the scenario that had just struck him might be at all possible yes it would be one way of disappearing for a while and yes he might be able to get into libreville with a good enough disguise but some of the practicalities and worrying gaps in the plan he wouldnt be able to fill until hed actually spoken with morvaun morvaun had seen the late news bulletin spect half of new orleans has by now and while his initial excitement over the idea outweighed his concerns he reserved full judgement until theyd talked it over some more first thing is tget you picked up then we can sit over some hot coffee an maybe somethin stronger while we thrash out if this is actually gonna work or is jus the worst damnfool plan since the presiden decided to go into iraq in the halfhour wait despite hanging in the shadow of some trees until he saw morvauns car turn the corner again jacs nerves bubbled as if being pressurecooked worried that the man on the terrace or someone else seeing him through a window might have matched him to the news bulletin and a squad car would get to him before morvaun though when he did show jac still had good reason to worry morvauns car a late fifties plymouth belvedere twotone pink and skyblue with grandiose tailfins that looked like they belonged on a buck rogers spacecraft couldnt have stood out more in the small community if morvaun had leant out a side window with a loud hailer shouting septegarian pimps convention or james browns back in town that would at least have halfexplained the cars presence to them as the car coughed and jerked its way back up to highway with the occasional backfire morvaun halfturned towards jac in the back seat now you keep down real low there jac outta sight don wanna bring no untoward attention to ourselves jac swallowed back a muted chuckle morvauns driving was atrocious jac lost count of the number of horns blared at them as morvaun pulled out when he shouldnt or drifted across lanes as a car at a crossstreet screeched and swerved around them a narrow miss as morvaun pulled out without apparently seeing them morvaun apologized sorry bout that jac havent been drivin this for a while jac looked around at the car what since nineteenfiftyeight morvaun chuckled you wanna save what humour you got left fo what the fuck i might make you look like later then he shrugged lamely nah eight months perhaps an before that jus weekends now and then cause my eyesight aint what it used tbe jac would never have guessed an sounds like it needs a bit of a service now too jac was convinced that between morvauns erratic driving the cars garish appearance and spluttering and gunshotloud backfiring they were bound to get stopped by a police car before they got back to morvauns place but somehow miraculously they made it and over coffee and kahlua morvaun didnt have brandy and whisky only a wide array of exotic caribbean and pacific island liquors they got down to the serious business of not just if and how it might work but most of all who jac was going to be jac quickly discounted implicating langfranc what with oldman beaton no doubt now looking hawkishly over his shoulder but mike coultaine was another matter longretired no remaining allegiances and a strong invested interest having been thwarted both at trial and appeal in saving durrants neck coultaine was understanding of jacs plight but was noncommittal at first saying hed phone back in an hour but when he called back he not only had a name darrell ayliss but within minutes had emailed a jpeg to morvauns computer coultaine had spent most of that hour making arrangements calling in old favours ayliss is ideal he explained because hes been off the scene for a while seven years and theres hardly anyone in new orleans thatll recognize him exwifes in oregon and the rest of his family in mississippi morvaun agreed ideal not only because of the lack of close friends and family in new orleans but the eight years since his last passport photo gives us a pile more leeway in how he might look now though to get the likeness as close as possible coultaine arranged the next day for ayliss to email morvaun directly along with scans of each page of his passport details of his appearance now hair colour length level of greyness eyecolour weight type of clothes and glasses coultaine had also covered their tracks by arranging for ayliss to go to cabo san lucas for a weeks flyfishing some old favours owed between us dont even ask the hows and whys all you need to be assured of is that if anyone checks on ayliss down in vallarta according to his staff hes simply away for the week where they dont know they werent told that evening morvaun went out to see alaysha at pinkies the only way they could think of safely getting a message to her jac surmised that there wasnt nearly enough for the nopd to hold her for any length of time let alone charge her with an accomplice to murder rap as she leant close in the middle of a dance morvaun whispered in one ear jac wants to see you i know where he is a beats pause then she resumed quickly in case security thought that ol man river had just made an inappropriate suggestion and in the next couple of leanins she got the rest of the details a rare treat for morvaun jac reflected hoping that is his heart held out part payment for helping out along with bucks jac gave him towards a car service and a new paintjob what yo dont like the pink and blue jac smiled dryly and shook his head not sure if morvaun was serious not sure of anything any more twotone more or less mirrored his life for the next week you should have told me i tried jac i tried when that same night gerry came knocking on my door while you were there jac shook his head incredulously what when the knock came oh that must be gerry i just remembered theres something i forgot to tell jac or when he shouted through the door about your sordid little secret together alayshas hands clenched in exasperation the struggle for clarity no jac before i tried believe me but you were too caught up in your own little story about that archie teale and your father dying as she saw him flinch realizing how trivial shed made it sound she reached out and gently touched his arm sorry jac i didnt mean it like that but i did try to tell you then just felt like the right time you know pouring hearts out to each other time probably the first time between us that it had felt right to she cast her eyes down for a second biting at her bottom lip to share a secret like that he nodded with a tightlipped grimace starting to understand she neednt have come here he reminded himself she could have just stayed away felt that it was just too awkward to explain left him wondering i know im sorry too though he had to pause then to think what for for being too hasty all shed said so far was that she and gerry had conspired to rob someone that they shouldnt and now it was coming back to haunt her and hed started putting her on the rack you said rob someone that you shouldnt have what some defenceless old lady or friend or relative maybe no alaysha shook her head i didnt mean shouldnt from a moral standpoint its because of the risk involved if we ever got found out how much our necks would be on the line alaysha looked down again briefly swallowing it was carmen malastra we robbed thats why we shouldnt have done it malastra new orleans biggest mostfeared mobster the name ran a shiver down most spines oh i see all he could think of saying immediately his head suddenly feeling hot and pressured seeing the shock on jacs face she smiled awkwardly shrugging from a moral point of view my slates completely clean in fact it was that that made me do it in a moment of weakness or madness or both my mothers illness she stroked absently at one thigh for a second and you see thats why it felt right to tell you at that moment when you were talking about your father jac just nodded closing his eyes for a second in understanding but didnt say anything he could see that this was difficult for her to talk about the right words elusive hanging by slim threads between them and if he spoke they might break the chain of thought lost and her perhaps not able to get it back in quite the same way again the shadows in her eyes shifted rapidly for a few seconds more before finally settling and focusing and she started to explain gerry had been telling her for a while about the baytrees manager george jouliern needing a courier for a scam he was planning but shed initially refused gerry had kept on about how much money it would mean to both of them thirty to fifty thousand dollars each depending how much of a skim jouliern was able to get away with but shed had no interest or particular need for the money then felt it was mainly to benefit gerry whod got himself in deep with a twentygrand debt to a local loan shark raoul ferrer gerry kept piling on the pressure i gotta do something about ferrer otherwise hes gonna break my legs but still i said no until that is i got news about my mother her mother had been suffering with diabetes for years but suddenly it had taken a chronic turn something called diabetic nepropathy suddenly it was lifethreatening she needed urgent regular dialysis the costs were skyhigh and she didnt have medical insurance and so despite the risks involved gerry maintained there were little or none jouliern had it all too wellplanned that thirty to fifty grand started to look like a godsend my only chance of saving my mothers life i finally agreed said id do it jouliern skimmed from people at the tables who wanted extra chips without going to the chipcashing booths it happens a lot apparently if theyre in the middle of a game or a roll and dont want the delay of cashing at the booths so theyd be cashed at the table and at the end of the night jouliern had the responsibility of taking all the cash from the tables and tallying with the chips provided at that point though hed pocket some of the cash and feed in chips from his own pocket there was control of cash in the club but not chips and then the extra cash would be left in an envelope under the bar with gerry the only problem remaining then was that as part of that cash control at the baytree each employee including jouliern was searched going in and out and was allowed no more than fifty bucks in their pockets so they needed a courier to get those money envelopes out which is where yours truly came in what you went every night the first question that jac had asked no three nights a week all i could manage and jouliern kept the skimming light too from the tables so that the fluctuations wouldnt show alaysha shrugged that nocashout policy also gave gerry some problems in paying ferrer often the only chance ferrer would get to collect cash off gerry was at night at the baytree so gerry would put ferrers money in an envelope with his name on and tell security that it was to give to ferrer later first couple of times security said okay well give it to him ourselves when he calls but then when ferrer complained about one of the payments being light they said that gerry could give it to him directly just as long as you know that if he doesnt call by for it it stays here with us when you leave hell have to pick it up later that was the golden rule no cash out of the baytree no matter the circumstances alaysha eased out a slow heavy breath as if glad shed finally shared some of the burden the whole thing went well no hitches and everyone was happy gerry paid off ferrer i saved my moms life and jouliern well he never shared with us why he was doing it she pouted thoughtfully which eased into a faint smile maybe half a million good reasons because thats what he ended up getting away with the shadows in her eyes deepened again then and the smile twisted as she forced a brief ironic chuckle bad choice of words because in the end it doesnt look like he got away with anything the shadows sunk deeper still hit something darker more troubling raw fear panic you see ten days or so ago i read in the paper about george jouliern disappearing and i thought malastras found out about the skimming and its only a matter of time before the knock comes on my own door and im next to go missing her neck pulsed as she swallowed hard she held one palm out thats why i got the gun from my moms not so much because of gerry but because i feared malastras men would be coming for me jac nodded slowly he understood now why shed done it probably too well if in those last months of his fathers life thered suddenly been a miracle cure and at the same time someone had laid on a plate a clean ingenious robbery to pay for it with high chances of getting away with it hed have gone for it no question he thought itd be hard to beat his own nightmare dilemma but hers possibly on a malastra hitlist was equally as crushing the mention of his father though reminded him look to the positive how long now since you read about jouliern disappearing ten days or so then another four or five days before hed have been officially reported as missing at least two weeks if that knock was going to come on your door it would have probably happened by now chances are jouliern didnt say anything about you they just dont know or theyre still putting all the pieces together he could see that his words did little to lift the crushing worry from her shoulders her eyes haunted looking for solutions that werent there her body trembling as she no doubt thought not just about her own neck but how little molly would possibly cope with her gone alayshas mother now with not many years left to be able to take care of her he reached one hand out and lightly touched her arm tried to lift her out of her dark mood hey come on you know what ive said makes a lot more sense than any other scenario her eyes lifting a bit a faint reluctant smile but you know if youre still worried just try and keep one step ahead stay at your moms as much as possible and when youre in town maybe stay at my place i know its only next door but you can look through the spyhole and see if anyone suspect is calling at your door gives you that extra minute or two to get out or phone for the police whatever thanks i appreciate it and ill probably take you up on that offer she forced a tame smile then let out a fresh breath but enough about me what about you the fugitive of the hour her expression became more solemn again how are you coping jac oh god jac lifted his eyes heavenward for a second where to even start he tried to keep his explanation just to filling in the gaps in what alaysha probably already knew from langfranc or news bulletins so that it wasnt too rambling he raised the first full smile from alaysha as he described walking through libreville earlier that day disguised as ayliss already sweating because he was nervous and with the unbearable heat of the prison and the extra padding and makeup it literally pouring off of him i feared the makeup would start running and half my face would come unstuck and start peeling off i had to call morvaun straight after emergency pitstop for face maintenance alaysha was by now openly laughing it was good to see her like that jac thought the problems hanging over them for a moment forgotten morvaun in fact has to follow me round from hotel to hotel giving me regular patchups he glanced at his watch next one is here tomorrow at seven am before i head out meanwhile youll have to answer the door if roomservice calls she nodded her smile fading as she became pensive again and how did it go with durrant he sighed heavily before explaining the images from just over an hour ago burning fresh through his mind the sergegreen safe with a twist lock just as it had been twelve years ago apparently it would have been too much upheaval to have it moved or changed the new owners seemed to remember the bookshelves being on the righthand side though the library now was just another bedroom and the grandfather clock would have obviously been moved along with roches other furniture and possessions they pointed out though at that moment they suddenly recalled the sales brochure roches realtor had done at the time which theyd kept and there it was proud in the corner on the hallway shot a fulllength walnutcased grandfather clock jac shook his head everything everything matched larrys descriptions from the session not a single thing wrong and it hit me in that moment alaysha harder than ever he had to have been there that night and all this crap with pool buddies and other places he might have been im wasting my time have been from day one jac grimaced awkwardly only i didnt know it until now jac bit at his bottom lip but this time as he went to shake his head it seemed to lock leave him transfixed staring into midspace and the thing is i cant blame or even get annoyed with larry for it because he simply cant remember doesnt know whether he was there and killed her or not it seems a shame to give up now just when youre so close only six days left jac let out a half laugh half defeated sigh thats the thing alaysha i should have given up long ago back when you told me to after almost drowning in the lake jac shrugged helplessly certainly before now on the run from a murder rap life in tatters not able to contact even my own family my only escape walking around like an overweight wax doll worried that half my face might melt off at any moment and people will start pointing its him its him this time jacs smile was forced pained alaysha knew that she wasnt meant to join in her eyes darted uncertainly for a second before she asked but i thought you had some guy with dance lessons for his kid that would have meant durrant was definitely playing pool that night jac nodded yeah bill saunders though problems there too larry remembered saunders being there which meant high chances that game was a thursday night but i called saunders just before heading here and he told me that once every month the dance teacher would change the day around then also a couple of times a year shed close the classes for her holidays one of which was always at carnival time in february jac grimaced like so much else with larry hardly have you grabbed hold of it the next moment its cruelly yanked away alaysha was thoughtful the shadows back in her eyes though from concern for him and durrant this time rather than herself but what if you find something that convinces you he was innocent after the six days when its too late youd never forgive yourself for giving up at the last moment especially with all youve been through i know what youre saying alaysha but im tired and i dont know what else there is to find out and theres the real worry that ive been doing all this to try and free a guilty man as jac exhaled it felt as if that breath was taking his last strength with it every time i get up off from the canvas hoping that with the next punch ill hit something to convince me that larry wasnt there that night and didnt do it another blow comes to tell me that he was knocks me back down again and this time alaysha i dont know if ive got the strength to get back up she reached out and gripped his arm then lightly shaking as if she might be able to inject some extra energy from herself into him but its only six days jac and then youll know for sure and if you still havent found anything and it looks as if larry was there that night at least then youll be able to tell yourself that you tried everything did all that you could jac nodded and closed his eyes for a second in acceptance he could see the sense in what alaysha was saying but the sudden turnaround made him question what makes now so different to before when you were urging me to giveup throw in the towel or is it just one of those perverse womenthings always take up an opposite stance alaysha could tell from jacs sly smile that he was ribbing but the effort of making it bore out what he was telling her he was tired defeated had no strength left because before jac you still had a long way to go now you dont now theres only six days left to hang on six days said that like it didnt sound long but with the way jac felt at that moment it seemed like a lifetime hed felt tired and worndown before the nightmare with gerry and the gun but running like a rabbit from the police and the role play with ayliss worried that at any minute a few words wrong or bumping into someone whod known ayliss the game would be up the bop hearing and walking back into libreville had been particularly nerveracking draining all of that had sapped his last reserves so that now he felt he had nothing left to give alaysha watched jac crumble before her saw his painfully conflicting emotions wanting desperately to continue but not sure any more how to or whether he had an ounce of energy or resolve left to be able to and that vulnerability as before made her realize how deeply she cared for him loved him made her suddenly want to soothe him comfort him protect him she leant in close then putting one arm around him and gently rocking oh jac jac starting to plant light kisses on his forehead and one cheek the softness and closeness of her made jac melt jac without knowing her thoughts thinking how vulnerable she looked still in her underwear crosslegged before him more concerned about his welfare than her own even though a threat to her life might hang just around the corner for her and in that moment he didnt think hed seen anyone so beautiful not just outside but inside too body and soul a couple of tentative kisses by his lips and then their tongues were touching teasing then suddenly the kisses became deeper more passionate and they were tearing the remaining clothes off each other jac remembered reading somewhere that in times of war people made love more frequently and fervently while the bombs dropped around them in airraid shelters or ditches or bedrooms that shook with nearby explosions they fucked soldiers visited whores the night before they went to the front line or lonely women took them in for the night because they seemed exciting or different or had a packet of cigarettes or some nylons to give them and much of that desperate lovemaking was not only because it might be their last chance but because in those few moments they were reaffirming that they were still alive still vital while so much around them was being robbed of life by bullets and bombs they were indulging in the one act that represented continuance of life what was happening now was probably little different jac thought though too urgent and feverish to be termed lovemaking they fucked they fucked on the floor on the bed up against the wall at one point alayshas gasps and screams so loud that jac thought the people in the next room would start banging and complaining they fucked with a heat and abandon theyd never known before as if it might be their very last time and perhaps like the countless wartorn souls before them that was because it might be a bullet around the next corner for alaysha and a longterm jail cell awaiting jac they fucked until all those dark shadows and worries finally lifted from them and there was nothing left in this world that was important except the two of them staring breathlessly at each other only inches apart them this moment okayokay youre there now larry youre there ormderns voice calming yet with a nervous edge to it as if he was afraid of losing the delicate thread of thought that had finally been established tell me what you see it had taken ormdern longer to get larry under than last time and longer still to get his thoughts focused back again on that vital pool game at the bayou brew twelve years ago jac was more conscious now of time fast ticking away against them and started to look anxiously at the clock as ormdern struggled in those opening moments only four days left now and the heat and pressure now far higher with the events of the last few days jac took the first sips of the coffee that had been brought in for him and pete folley in paper cups a minute ago bill bill saunders is there theyre all there that night as ormdern realized that larry was linking back to what hed covered last time he gently moved larry on okay larry theyre all there but i wondered if you could tell me what any of them are doing apart from playing pool anything that might tell you what day it is as larrys brow knitted ormdern added reading a newspaper for instance something with a headline or date on it larrys head gently shook after a second no not that i recall or maybe even talking about the shooting of jessica roche because that would then definitely place that pool game after she was killed longer pause this time larrys eyelids pulsing heavily no nobodys talking about anything like that the news had come through at midday from governor candarets office that larry durrants plea for clemency had been refused jac had phoned candarets office an hour later and laying on the smooth southern ayliss charm had tried his utmost to sway candaret but he was adamant immovable i hear what youre saying loud and clear mr ayliss about larry durrants state of mind and memory at the time and about his good character and development since but balanced against that weve got the fact that he did finally admit that he committed the crime that night and even if there were doubts raised about that recall we have the irrefutable dna evidence that puts him there at the time of jessica roches murder i appreciate the call though i really do though im sure you can equally appreciate that this remains a particularly brutal and heinous crime that i cannot look upon lightly with aaron harvey reoffending the odds had always been against candaret offering clemency but now it was official now jac knew with all certainty that this session whatever ormdern was able to drag out of larrys fractured shadowy memory from twelve years ago was probably his very last chance and the bar larry who was behind the bar that night lorraine lorraine gilliam and mack elliott anybody else was rob harlenson there that night no no dont see him there dont rather than didnt larry reliving being in the bar as he was twelve years ago looking around the room last chance all the more poignant meaningful now jac had taken alayshas advice to soldier on and had gone back over all the old durrant files and case notes for anything he might have missed spread them out on the floor of his new hotel room the next morning still switching hotel rooms and cars every day along with the old crime scene photos the first thing that leapt out at him had been a longshot of the library with jessicas roches body at the far end bookshelves along the righthand side and sergegreen safe on the wall at the end he went back to the case folders quickly rifling through all the photos and eighth print down there it was a shot of the hallway presumably to show the two footprints with faint bloodied edges heading from the library and at its end larger than life a fulllength grandfather clock thats how and why larry could have recalled those details in the last session with ormdern after the news from candaret hed arranged to get to the prison half an hour early for a facetoface with larry he slid the library photo across first asking larry if hed seen it before yeah at the time of police questioning and at the trial thought as much standard police procedure to show the suspect the victim gauge reaction but this one they might not have troubled with at the time jac slid across the hallway photo larry paused for only a second yeah that one too they asked me if i recognized that shoe pattern jac had resisted punching the air the sound was off between the interview and observation room but pete folley was already behind the glass looking on and what were the barstaff doing larry ormdern quizzed durrant now anything that was said or done that might pin down the day dont know about the actual day but but a couple of guys turned up in carnivaltype outfits one had a chicken outfit looked like he borrowed it from someone whod been advertising a chicken restaurant then just put it on for carnival the other had a sequined suit and whitedout face did you know them or had you seen them before didnt know them larry thought for a moment his brow knitting and cant remember seeing them before and lorraine gilliam or mack elliott did it look like they might have seen them before jac saw immediately where ormdern was heading if larry couldnt pin down the day maybe lorraine gilliam or mack elliott could surely it wasnt every day that someone walked in the bar in a chicken outfit no didnt seem like it mack was giving them this look you know one he often gave to strangers what the hell yo doing in my bar got lost or something and the outfits and the fact that they gotta bit rowdy didnt help in the bars around bourbon that time of year nobody would raise an eyebrow but the brew was a long way off the main carnival routes you said rowdy what was there a disturbance jac clenched his coffee cup took a quick sip something else that might help fix the day in elliott or gilliams mind though no doubt the best hope was with elliott when hed finally got hold of lorraine gilliam shed been vague about events back then the session setup was the same as last time except that now the sound feed was twoway if jac spoke into the mike his end it fed into ormderns earpiece in case he picked up on anything vital that ormdern missed this was their last chance so once the moment was gone it was gone for good not exactly a disturbance no real trouble just that the guys were getting noisy and a touch outta control and they started to annoy mack cause he was trying to concentrate on something on the tv larrys face eased into a slow smile i remember mack having told the guys once to keep it down and they were still kicking up warning the chicken guy to keep a lid on it if yo don wanna end up like a colonel sanders chicken whats that the guy asks larrys smile broadened mack gives him a quick flash of the billyclub he kept below the bar for troublemakers and says battered ormdern nodded and smiled briefly anything though to fix the day or date anything mentioned a carnival party they were heading to something at one of the nearby jazz clubs maybe which might then also explain why they were in the area jac leant forward a number of clubs held specific themed balls and party nights throughout carnival if one had been mentioned it would pinpoint the night a moments concentration larry mumbling incoherently at one point as if he was mentally sifting through their conversation before he shook his head no no club or party mentioned not that i can recall at least anything else happen that night unusual or otherwise anything that might pin down the day the edge the desperation in ormderns voice now evident larrys brow was knitted again and as it looked like his attempts at recall were trawling through fresh air ormdern added anything however small and inconsequential it might seem larrys expression slowly eased oh yeah nat nat hadley he was talking about his kid joining a little league baseball team real proud you know running him there watching the kid play larrys smile was back again though more wistful with a tinge of sorrow lost years dont know if it helps much or not but perhaps it stuck in my mind because i remember thinking at the time i got all that to come all that to come jac clenched a fist his other on the coffee cup trembling as he closed his eyes none of that for larry had been to come arrested only six months later hed seen nothing since but the inside of a jail cell had hardly seen his kid someone else different parttime fathers had cared for joshua watched him grow got his little hugs and kisses on the cheek taken him to little league and suddenly that thrumming was back in jacs body as it had been that last night with larry clinking brandy glasses together as the tears flowed his own heartbeat in time with the throb of the prison boilers last chance last chance the ticking of the clock on the wall joining that beat as he stared at it numbly trying to think desperately of what to do next if there was anything left to try the clipclop of his step from the many times hed paced librevilles endless corridors over the past six weeks the final accompaniment a rhythmic banging from the cells as he walked along as hed headed in earlier that night many of larrys supporters had banged the cell bars with whatever metal objects they could lay their hands on tin cups bedpans willing jac on save him save him were any days mentioned for the kids games or perhaps who they were playing clutching at straws it was becoming painful even to watch the increasing edge in ormderns voice the heavy pulsing behind larrys eyelids as he searched desperately for that one fragment of detail from twelve years ago that might save his life now finally no sorry cant remember anything being said about dates or times for the kids games just how proud nat was you know being there for the kid supporting him i know a concluding tone ormdern looking back through his notes and last sessions transcript for anything he might have missed asking about the bayou brew that night the silence suddenly heavy stifling only the sound of flicking pages through the speaker merging becoming one with the ticking of the clock and the pounding thunderous roar in jacs head last chance last chance save him save him jac leapt up as the coffee splashed against one thigh unconsciously hed gripped the paper cup too tight splitting it ormdern looked up briefly jacs sudden gasp through his earpiece obviously startling him he went back to his notes for another fifteen seconds or so though with the silence the pause seemed interminable before speaking again i want to move on now larry to when you first read or heard about jessicas roches murder and first of all try and pinpoint that time in relation to the night weve just been talking about when you were playing pool at the bayou brew ormdern left a heavy pause to let the thought and the shift in time settle with larry was it just the day after two days or maybe more jac was at the edge of his seat breath held probably their last chance to be able to pinpoint the day it took a long time for larry to focus his thoughts the pulsing behind his eyelids becoming more rapid frantic the clock ticking on the wall probably seeming deafening to everyone in the room not just jac in that forty second wait larry gently moistened his top lip with his tongue as he spoke his head lolling slightly i i dont know a day or two i think not long anyway please larry think think hard its important which is it just a day or two days jac clenched his hands anxiously as larry sank back into thought thered been an anxious moment too in his presession with larry when hed slid across the photos and shortly after had made a verbal slip on our second meeting together you mentioned quickly realizing and correcting i mean on your second meeting with jac mcelroy but it was too late larry had picked up on it staring at him intently in that moment eyes boring past aylisss brown contact lenses stripping away the prosthetic cheek and jaw bulking and the shoulder padding as he uttered with a hushed incredulous breath its you jac isnt it its you and jac not saying anything but giving his answer with a nervous look towards the glass screen and folley the sound link was off but he worried in that moment that larrys body language might give the game away or folley might be able to lipread but folley held the same nonchalant slightly bored expression hadnt picked up on anything as jac gently nodded his acquiescence and larry at the same time had quickly killed his sly disbelieving smile as he picked up on the signal not to give the game away to folley larry finally spoke i im sorry i dont know cant say with any certainty jac eased out a resigned breath ormdern had mentioned that even if the memory of the murder had been suggested or somehow overlaid its addition could create uncertainty in larrys mind about the time gap from his pool game but the end result was the same jac thought feeling his stomach sink last chance gone okayokay when you did actually hear or read about jessica roches murder exactly when or where was that morning or afternoon on the tv or in a newspaper tv larry answered almost immediately then paused longer for thought before continuing but there was no sound on i couldnt hear what was being said only saw her face on the newsflash why was that because i didnt want to id made sure to avoid all newspapers and early morning tv but there she was suddenly as i was passing a tv shop window jacs stomach fell again as if a second surprise trapdoor had suddenly opened a completely different story to the one hed got last time from larry ormdern too looked perplexed flicking back a page in his notes to doublecheck the earlier account are are you sure about that tv shop window rather than at home in the afternoon or early evening yeah sure larrys brow knitted briefly with another thought okay maybe early evening was the first time i actually heard it but i remember clearly standing by that shop window seeing it for the first time and what time of day was that mid late morning maybe jac stared back hard at larry was larry telling the truth now or in his earlier account to jac or was he clever enough to realize that his sub conscious had suddenly produced a different story so hed slipped in a caveat first time i actually heard it maybe with all of that reading he was cleverer than all of them knew and recalled perfectly well that hed killed jessica roche and now was just playing them all getting them searching desperately through the haystack of his past for needles that he knew had never been there maybe too larry had lied earlier about seeing those photos hed slid across realizing then that his subconscious had again given something away just when jac thought he knew larry was getting closer to him and the truth of what happened twelve years ago hed do another quick flip become a conundrum again a mystery yet if larry knew that his subconscious would give him away why subject himself to this now was it just that with only days left to live a random chance was better than no chance at all one last laugh up his sleeve at them all desperately fluffing around him trying to save his life the attention hed never got from his own family but why then had he wanted to die when jac first met him or was that the ultimate doubleplay the last person youd suspect of trying to fool you about their innocence was someone whod already given up on being saved perhaps as jac had suspected all along larry just didnt know the memory loss had stayed with him and he had no idea if hed done it or not and how did you feel larry when you first saw her face on that tv through that shop window though now the question seemed almost superfluous i i felt terrible you know sick inside like you wouldnt believe larry gently shook his head thats thats why i tried to avoid seeing it because i couldnt believe id done it and once id seen it on the news then it was suddenly real official i had done it and now jac would have to tell larry as hed promised to when the next day he got ormderns report sorry larry looks like you did do it at least one consolation when he was executed in a few days time in his last moments he wouldnt be left with that crushing sense of injustice that it was for something he hadnt done tv the thought suddenly flared from the back of jacs brain sitting there watching the last minutes of the session tick away that final thought about larrys guilt just hadnt sat comfortably and everything suddenly came flooding back gasping for air as he fought back up through the dark lake running from the lights of the police helicopter walking back into libreville disguised as ayliss surely all of that hadnt been for nothing surely could he possibly have read it all so wrong put his life on the line and and suddenly the thought had flashed like a supernova to the forefront tv if mack elliott had asked the chicken guy to pipe down because he couldnt hear what was on the tv then whatever was on must have been important jac leant over and shared the thought with ormdern through the mike ormdern nodded slowly larrys eyelids gently pulsing as his mind questioned what was happening why the sudden pause okay larry sorry i want to take you back again to the bayou brew and the pool game specifically that moment you mentioned when mack elliott told off the chicken guy because he couldnt concentrate on what was on the tv yeah yeah the pulsing slowly settling as larry got the memory back again now what was it mack elliott was watching why was it so important that he had to tell the chicken guy to shut up i im not sure the eyelidpulsing increasing again the tvs turned away from me i cant see what hes watching and did he tell you something important perhaps that he wanted to watch that night nono he didnt mention anything slow sigh from ormdern the disappointment evident in his voice okay from where you are what can you hear coming over the tv marked pause from larry as he applied more thought some cheering and clapping a commentators voice in between a few shouts and jeers at some points whats the commentator saying i i cant tell from where we are its too faint just a mumble the cheering clapping and shouting comes over stronger okay cheering and clapping some shouts any laughter no no just the cheering and clapping so obviously not a sitcom or even a variety or chat show jac thought they would normally have some laughter and how long did it go on for how long was mack elliott watching maybe twenty minutes or so halfhour max that ruled out a sporting fixture too and anything else you might recall about what mack was watching then anything you might have heard or he mentioned no thats it just remember some cheering and shouting and him telling off the chicken guy already two minutes over the session time nothing else that ormdern was going to find out but if larry couldnt remember what mack elliott was watching that night maybe mack himself could although it was twelve years ago they now had some strong guideposts cheering and shouting guy in a chicken suit that he threatened with a billyclub having thanked ormdern ill look forward to reading your final report tomorrow jac paced back through the endless corridors with that cauldron of conflicting thoughts from the session still burning through his head he opened his car window and breathed deeply of the outside night air trying to lose the heat and claustrophobia of the prison and the second he was clear of the final guardpost took out his cellphone and dialled mack elliotts number outside the prison gates the crowd had swelled to eighty strong one group with long hair and long white flowing robes as if they were a flock of angels or modernday messiahs held up a large placard stairway to heaven go larry go then you can get your own back on candaret dont let him in when he shows there though unlikely thats where hes headed the devil claimed his soul years ago to one side theyd set up large speakers blasting the song out the display no doubt inspired by larrys strong religious beliefs come on jac muttered impatiently as he sped away from the prison last chance last chance but as mack elliotts line continued ringing emptily in jacs ear all that reached him was robert plants voice sailing hauntingly on the night air singing about the feeling he got when he looked to the west his spirit crying for leaving have you heard from jac at all no not a thing catherine mcelroy said the truth but even if she had heard from her son the last person shed tell was her sister camille family allegiances would hold for no more than twentyfour hours before camilles citizens duty wrestled advantage and she phoned the police terrible business terrible camille aired though she was probably thinking more of the shock impact to her society set than to family catherine thought it would probably be a lot better if the police had found him at least then youd know where he was know that he was safe and be able to see him and talk to him find out what happened yes i suppose so some sense in that catherine supposed but still she remained guarded unsure whether camille was just fishing to see whether she might know more than she was letting on god knows what im going to say to tobias bromwell if i ever speak to the man again his number has come up twice now on my call minder but i just dont have the stomach to phone him back dont know what to say too embarrassed now they were getting to it catherine thought the condolences and niceties out of the way now they were getting to what really made camilles world turn i understand catherine said numbly thats practically all shed felt since hearing the news about jac numb and you had absolutely no inkling of what was going on what might be about to happen no of course not the first edge to catherines voice a ridiculous suggestion even by camilles normal thickskinned lamebrained standards mom im going out with a lapdancer and were planning to murder her exboyfriend so you didnt even know about this other girlfriend this this lapdancer catherine halfsmiled to herself at camilles difficulty in even saying the word no i didnt she said hoping that camille didnt read the halflie all she knew from alaysha directly while jac had been in the hospital was that she did some modelling perhaps alaysha didnt know what jac might have already said and theyd have both got around later to telling her more camille sighed heavily thats where it all starts to go wrong dont you see that initial deception twotiming poor jennifer like that and for reasons that now become obvious not telling anyone about this other girl what you think one might lead to the other normally catherine wouldnt have said anything but she could feel her blood boil as camille had continued her societycircle embarrassment over jacs twotiming and dating a lapdancer put before the fact that he was being hunted like a rabbit by the police might not even be still alive with herself and jeanmarie worried out of their minds like some sort of prelude date a lapdancer next step murder only a splitsecond pause but catherine could practically hear camilles flinch of surprise that she had dared to answer back no of course not but you can bet your bottom dollar that this girl had more than a little to do with putting jac up to it camille snorted derisively types like that like what camille maybe camille had been grating on her nerves for a while but now with everything with jac her patience levels were exhausted like you know i surely dont have to spell it out again that reluctance to even say it as if it would somehow soil her lips but one things for sure shes certainly an entirely different kettle of fish to a girl like jennifer bromwell she only takes her clothes off for money no doubt to put groceries on the table for her little girl theres no sin in that please spare me and do you really think the likes of oldman bromwell built up their fortunes by being squeaky clean i hear he was involved in some messy lowrent housing early on complaints about rats damp and unsanitary conditions and strongarm guys busting doors down and kicking whole families out in the dead of night when they complained too hard not exactly what hed like to be quizzed about at one of your little dinner soirees this time the surprise was clear at the other end an audible gasp sometimes catherine youre so so french catherine wasnt sure whether the comment was due to her laissezfaire attitude about people taking their clothes off for money or her socialistslanted dig at tobias bromwell but she decided to take it as a compliment thanks and while were on the subject of low rents dont forget whose house youre in camille hung up abruptly catherine took a fresh breath feeling strangely invigorated camille might soon put in the thin edge of the wedge about her and jeanmarie moving on finding their own place one more problem she didnt need now on top of all else but all she knew was that at that moment despite everything she suddenly felt better freer and as as i looked back there was this woman dont know even what made me look back at that point maybe the sense of her eyes on me but there she was suddenly this woman with her dog her eyes meeting mine for a second before i ran on how far away was she maybe eighty yards the other way from the roche house a hundred or so from where i was then jac stood twenty yards beyond the roche house where larry would have been that night twelve years ago and looked back to where hed have seen the woman still dark with just the first tinge of dawn light the light values wouldnt be far different to that night jac thought jac rewound on his handheld recorder and looked back towards the house there were no lights on at the front or the side which is where i broke in maybe if id gone round the back id have seen a light on or maybe shed gone to bed early and thered have been no light on there either so you broke in at the side yeah removed a glass pane and wired through on the frame so as not to break the alarm circuit two minutes and i was in took a quick tour to see where the best stuff was and found a safe in the library that i reckoned i could break by drilling the lock without too much trouble and i was just preparing for that when i heard something behind me and she she was suddenly there like like out of nowhere not there one minute then the next jac could see the side of the house from where he was and closed his eyes for a second to picture the library from his visit two days ago then shifted to how it would have been twelve years ago larry checking out the safe as jessica roche walked in behind him something he was missing something jac eased out his breath after a moment started to pace away i was there at the time he looked from side to side at the neighbouring houses and then along the street if someone else had been there that night then where where a neighbouring window or garden or further away far enough not to have been noticed by the murderer only three days left now jac shook his head he hadnt slept well that night he hadnt been able to get hold of mack elliott until almost pm two hours after hed checked into yet another hotel room the photos from the murder scene again spread around him word and sentence fragments from the session still bouncing through his head youre as bad as that jac mack commented the last guy handling everything for larry asking me to remember things from twelve years back i know it aint easy jac laid on the ayliss southern drawl but now therere a couple of notable things to hopefully remind you jac set the scene with the chicken guy and his friend in a sequinned suit pressing him to remember what might have been so important on the tv that mack would have asked him to shut up and at that moment as now staring emptily into the first dawn light of the street where twelve years ago the murder had taken place searching for answers everything seemed to freeze around jac hang suspended as he stood in the middle of a strange hotel room cellphone in hand breath held because he knew that probably larrys very last chance depended on macks next words but with a long tired exhalation mack elliott said that he just couldnt remember what he might have been watching cant bring anythin to mind clearly im sorry too long back will you keep thinking on it for me jac reluctant to let possibly the last door close call me if you finally remember anything not long left now only a few days i know jac wound forward again on the tape and where did you run to then larry back to where id parked my car a few blocks away on carondelet street jac looked around carondelet was to the north a block beyond st charles avenue which meant larry would have taken the next right on street to get there jac headed that way as the tape continued following the same route larry had twelve years ago as hed run in panic from the roche house and did you head straight home then not straight away my mind was spinning with so many things i wanted to go for a drink somewhere but i was afraid i might have some of her blood on me that people would notice so in the end i just drove around for a while maybe as long as fifty minutes before i finally headed home jac could almost hear the prison clock again in time with his footsteps breaking the quiet of the garden district dawn tictoc clipclop not long left now and did you have the gun still with you when i left the house yeah but i dumped it in a trash can somewhere out in metairie while i was driving around and i noticed then that my jacket was clean i kept that on click stop rewind play again i id checked for a few nights beforehand and there was no car either in the drive or lights on that i could see she she wasnt meant to be there and where was stop silence again only the sound of jacs continuing footsteps he thought about the mystery emailers words i couldnt give my name or come forward before because id have incriminated myself and that still stands now but i was there where where incriminated himself or perhaps it was just a hoax or a friend of larrys another curveball along with larrys differing accounts of when and where hed first seen the news on jessica roches murder clipclop clipclop did do it didnt do it jac stopped as st charles avenue came into view ahead more activity gentle thrum of some early traffic now a block and a half away nobody would have been able to see anyone leave the roche house beyond where he was now he walked back again and stood for a moment by the roche house looking around one last time as he tried to picture larry as he was that night having murdered for the first time breathless panicked and running like a rabbit the gun still with him the woman walking her dog locking eyes with him for a second and whether from the images spinning in his head lack of sleep or the exertion of walking about with all the heavy padding from his disguise jac suddenly felt dizzy the street and everything around him tilting into a lazy spin last hopes tilting slipping away jac snapped himself out of it took a fresh breath he got back into his car and grabbed a quick takeout coffee on his way back to his hotel he sipped at it as he walked into his room checking his watch ormderns report should arrive in an hour or so with so little time left now ormdern had promised to get it to him first thing jac decided to use the time to go back over the tapes of truelles earlier sessions with larry hed played most of them before purely to get a feel for the leadup to the crucial murderadmission session some segments now had more resonance particularly when larry started trying to remember old friends some of them from those key pool games but for the most part it was fairly mundane day to day recall truelles voice and larrys answers after a while becoming little more than a drone soporific the last thing jac needed after last nights fitful sleep and so when something did suddenly hit him so small that at first he almost missed it it snapped him sharply alert again made him sit up jac quickly rewound to make sure hed heard what he thought hed heard yes it was there no mistake then he started going back through the other tapes listening to the same sections on each and was halfway through the process when hotel reception rang through to his room to tell him that a package had been left for him by a mr ormdern yes thanks could you send it up to me click stop play click stop play click stop four tapes left to try by the time the knock came at the door and a bellboy handed him the envelope jac practically ripped it open his adrenalin now on fire with what hed just discovered flicking though quickly to the main summary points in ormderns report unfortunately the incidental detail surrounding larry durrants night at the roche house is inconclusive while there isnt a great depth of incidental detail which could then lean towards the memory somehow being suggested or implanted conversely the accuracy of what little he has recalled could then support that the memory was real and true also we have the problem i voiced when you first raised this issue of possible memory suggestion or implanting before these sessions with larry durrant to successfully do that a full hour session possibly more would have been required but from what you told me the tapes are all sequential and match every diary entry for that period and there were no extracurricular visits by durrant outside of those diarised jac looked back towards the tape recorder jac thought he knew how truelle had done it had got the sequence of tapes to match the session diary entries no gaps ormderns report concluded i think your best chance rests with hopefully getting corroborative alibis from the extra details unearthed surrounding larry durrants pool game that week two possible irons in the fire the first hed have to hit truelle with hard pray that he could somehow break him jac looked at his watch if he phoned truelle would probably do what hed done last time shuffle him off for a day or two no time left it was time for an unannounced visit joshua i want you to send an email to your father francine kept her gaze level and constant so that her son could be sure that she was serious and it wasnt some kind of trick in libreville its time probably in fact the last time youre gonna be able to do it say what you want to him i i thought that you said i know what i said joshua she sighed heavily this wasnt easy she forced a tame smile take this as an early lesson that parents can be fickle too and that time can change things but what about frank and the joshua fumbled while he thought about how to cover up that hed been continuing to send emails whether hed get found out whether to say anything the keyword and what should i say joshuas eyes lifted to meet his mothers the keyword i know frank told me what it was said that youd never guess it that is if youve been looking she raised a sharp eyebrow and smiled dryly as for what to say well i guess whatever youve been holdin back on saying for the past month or so will do for a start joshua was sure from her look that she suspected hed kept contact he looked away again nodding okay and and to tell your father that we want to see him tomorrow if possible after that they might not allow any visitors she watched her request hit joshua as if shed jabbed him with a cattle prod he didnt say anything simply lifted those big eyes again to look at her directly perhaps to ask again if she was sure or because he wasnt sure how hed handle a face to face with his father at this stage or because it raised again the earlier question that she hadnt yet answered she shook her head dont worry about frank ill square everything with him you making contact and us going there tomorrow if frank cant understand why you should see your father for what might be the last time then then she looked away chewing at her bottom lip an image of past happier times suddenly piercing her heart larry holding josh up as a baby and singing to him in a silly coocoo voice and josh looking back at him with those same big brown eyes so loving so trusting but in that instant the shadows crossing her eyes were probably read by her son as her being less sure about handling frank than shed made out which was also true you just leave frank to me she said trying to sound more confident assured she gave joshua the keyword and heard his tapping on the computer just before she went back through the kitchen door at the end of the hallway she was glad the kitchen counter was close otherwise she wouldnt have made it she gripped tight at the countertop as she felt her legs buckle a whitehot scythe of sorrow and painful nostalgia that seemed to rip her stomach away and take everything below with it racking sobs rising without warning from deep in her chest as if they were her very last gasps she hadnt shed many tears for larry over the years the last had been when his mother died six years ago and it struck her then that he was all alone nobody left to stand by him but she hadnt cried like this since larry had first been charged and locked in a police cell cried herself to sleep every night for a week and the same again when he was finally sentenced cried and cried until all the love and hope had gone and she thought there was nothing left inside but bitterness and anger that he could have done this to her and joshua deserted betrayed as last time after receiving batesons call nelm picked up on darrell aylisss tail as he came off the pontchartraine causeway after ormderns second session with durrant this time though ayliss didnt switch hotels that night was scheduled to book out the following day at midday according to reception when nelm phoned to check nelm didnt see the point in sleeping in his car through the night watching and waiting besides melanie ayliss wasnt scheduled to arrive until late morning the next day the main event that was seriously going to shake aylisss cage put him off his stride initially uncertain when nelm had told her that her ex was back in town maybe ive wasted enough time already on that loser shed then phoned back three hours later full of fire and pep and ready to go she was booked on an early morning flight from portland scheduled to arrive in new orleans at am nelm told her to call him again immediately she arrived and hed tell her precisely where her miserable scum of an ex was at that moment yet having set everything up nelm panicked when he arrived back at the hotel early the next morning aylisss car was gone from the hotel car park he phoned reception again but they said that mr ayliss hadnt checked out yet as far as we know his luggage is still in his room nelm waited an anxious fifty minutes before ayliss finally returned nelm slipping down low in his car seat as he watched ayliss pull back into the hotel car park then the long wait over two hours before ayliss headed out again nelm anxious again because he hadnt yet received melanie aylisss call more than enough time to have cleared checkout he thought ayliss would be heading to a fresh hotel but then felt his blood run cold as he followed him to royal street watched him park and walk towards truelles office each time nelm had spoken to bateson hed asked him whether he thought anything groundshaking had come out of the sessions neither bateson nor any of his clique of guards had been present in the interview observation room but hed made sure to be standing close by as they all came out observing expressions they looked thoughtful pensive rather than pleased with themselves for sure nobody was punching the air or rushing to haveling to tell him anything so my read on it is no they didnt hit on anything so maybe they were safe for now maybe but that could all quickly change if ayliss beat truelle over the head with whatever ormdern had unearthed at the sessions truelle his nerves already strungout tighter than pianowire wouldnt last long hed crack for fucks sake come on phone nelm hissed thumping his steering wheel and finally six minutes after ayliss had gone inside truelles office melanie aylisss call came through flight had been delayed twenty minutes nelm gave her the address and hurry i just dont know how long hell be there nelm gently closed his eyes as he hung up praying that truelle could hold out long enough for her to get there and put ayliss off his stroke which part of now and urgent is it that you dont quite comprehend im sorry mr ayliss but i buzzed through for you mr truelle is with a patient right now and i cant see any slots in his diary for at least two days i dont know what else itll be too late by then jac cut in as he suspected truelle was giving him the run around he glared towards the connecting door to truelles office and his secretary cynthia picked up late too late the decision he made in that instant she was a step behind him as he burst into truelles office swinging the door wide i im sorry mr truelle she stammered in the background i told him you were busy but he whats the meaning of this truelle exclaimed his best mock outrage what you mean like the meaning of life mr truelle jac didnt bother with an introduction cynthia had already told him on the intercom that a certain darrell ayliss wanted to see him says hes the new lawyer just taken over representation of lawrence durrant or the meaning of death as in what you did to larry durrant truelle looked towards his patient a bemused middleaged redhead then back at jac you cant just barge in here in the middle of a session he reached for the phone im calling the police sure sure go ahead and when they arrive i can tell them how you set up larry durrant truelles hand hovered uncertainly by the phone then he forced an equally uncertain smile towards his patient im sorry about this mrs venning i think the only fair thing to do would be to credit you for the twentyfive minutes weve had today and book you in again for a full session within the week truelle pushed the smile again so that you get the time weve had today free for the inconvenience mrs venning got up with a faint smile as if she was intrigued as to what might happen next and would have loved to hang around to hear it truelles gaze settled back icily on jac as cynthia ushered mrs venning out say what youve got to then get out of my office great bedside manner youve got there mr truelle but this little talk of ours today is going to run at my pace and dictate not yours jac sly smile quickly faded as he returned the gaze with the same iciness he watched truelles initial brash bravado quickly evaporate his mouth setting tightly anxiously theres no doubt continued contact between you and whoever put you up to this so you probably know already that i had a fresh psychiatrist see larry durrant these last few days i i dont know what youre talking about the truth nelm hadnt said anything though he could easily see why not fearful that the news might push him over the edge panic overload gregory ormdern you might remember him from the initial trial when he stood up for the defence yes i remember him truelle blinked slowly trying to remain calm swallowing back against the fireball of nerves brewing in his stomach but i fail to see what relevance mr ormdern now seeing durrant might have the relevance mr truelle is all contained in mr ormderns report on those two sessions with durrant jac patted the envelope from ormdern as he laid it on the desk truelle continued to blink slowly as if this was all tiresome and uninteresting but jac could read the terror behind his nonplussed facade jac might as well have laid a dagger there you see all along there were only two ways this cat could have been skinned either larry durrant was telling the truth and his memory of that night was real or if not it had to have somehow been suggested implanted i believe thats the trade expression jac paused and smiled tightly and the only person in a position to do that would have been yourself mr truelle thats ridiculous truelle said a hint of vehemence to lift it beyond stock defence jac rolled on as if truelle hadnt spoken and the main test as to whether that account might have been implanted is the amount of incidental detail recalled outside of the murder itself jac patted the file and smiled again and guess what greg ormdern discovered jac watched truelles face redden but it quickly transformed to bluster as i said ridiculous ridiculous truelle leant forward gesturing with one hand as if to throw the report back across the desk and i strongly resent your implication jac had fully expected truelles professional hackles to rise what else could he do and perhaps as jac hed have backed off and if hit with more of the same pretty soon packed up his tent and headed off but as ayliss a worldweary criminal lawyer he felt he could bluff it out in fact it was expected of him anything less wouldnt have been true to aylisss character just the other night hed commented to alaysha that that was one advantage of being ayliss to compensate for all the padding and discomfort he was like jacs alterego the heavyweight criminal lawyer that jac hoped to be in five or ten years time and so under the guise of ayliss he was able to get away with all the things he might not get away with as jac jac eased his best syrupy ayliss smile with southern drawl to match now come on mr truelle you and i both know the truth of whats going on here and if you dont now weve got mr ormderns report to tell us truelle looked at the envelope reluctantly as if unwilling to accept its existence he felt his stomach sinking deeper with every doubletime pulsebeat and wished the floor would open up detail hed embellished with quite a bit of detail he thought even covering elements after the event that he thought the police would question durrant about the first thing you saw about the murder was in atv shop window late the next dayyoud made sure to avoid all newspapers and early morning tv but then there she was suddenly that hadnt even come up in police questioning but it was there nevertheless embedded in durrants subconscious no hed added more than enough detail youre wrong or misguided or simply not telling the truth i implanted no false memory on mr durrant and i dont believe for a minute that mr ormderns report suggests that i did truelle briefly challenged aylisss smile as best he could with his own jac didnt flinch for a second his steady gaze boring straight through truelle unmoved unimpressed again he continued as if truelle hadnt spoken so weve covered incidental detail or rather lack of it he nodded towards the file but the part of the equation that was always missing was opportunity when might you have been able to implant all of this in durrants mind the esteemed mr ormdern reckons youd have needed at least an hourlong session maybe more for all that mental conditioning but the problem was that all of the sessions were sequential with diary entries to match no gaps truelle adopted again his best nonplussed poker face blinking slowly the writhing snakes of nerves in his stomach coiling tighter it was like watching an impending car crash knowing that you wouldnt like what you saw that it would turn your stomach but remaining transfixed all the same in case the cars miraculously missed each other at the last second or just to see how dramatic and gory it might be and then i discovered this jac took the cassette player from his pocket and pressed play truelles voice with the date and time of the session then two faint clicks straight after which jac ensured truelle heard by turning up the volume thats it right there you see those two faint clicks jac quickly slotted in another tape and ran the same segment with truelle announcing the date and time again turning the volume up for the two clicks and again there and the same on five other tapes and the background noises too are different to the session where larry describes the murder and on which theres only one click i i did the introductions afterwards rather than before on those it happens a lot jac twisted his mouth as if hed tasted something sour on its own that story might wash but combined with ormderns findings about lack of incidental detail it answers how you did it the sessions were mostly two a week and you used one of the later sessions in your diary just before larrys murder confession to mentally condition him then you shifted all the other session tapes forward to cover it by putting in new intro dates and times the gap was then shifted back five or six weeks before the month of tapes with diary entries to match requested at trial the gap wouldnt have shown youve got quite a vivid imagination there mr ayliss i must say truelle pushed a tame smile but inside the writhing tension in his stomach had wormed its way through every vein and nerveend he pressed his hand firmer on the desktop to kill any visible trembling but if you really felt you had something with all of this youd be at the das office right now with it not sitting here with me thats where im headed next i came here first to see what you had to say purely as a courtesy you see if you turn states evidence you could probably cut a deal that would keep you clean and clear or at least doing easy time six months a year tops jac held one hand out if not youre probably looking at five years five years truelle swallowed anxiously though that was nothing to what he faced from nelm thrown off a high building after a tango or if he was lucky quick and painless two bullets in a backstreet parkinglot like raoul ferrer jac watched intently every small tic and nuance of truelles expression everything in the balance the final gauntlet down the tension crackled like raw electricity between them jac knew that he didnt have enough to go to the da or candaret everything depended on how truelle responded to the bluff which way he jumped now truelle let out a sudden snort halflaughter halfderision do you really think id do something like this conspire to frame an innocent man truelle leant forward his voice firming with each word if so youre deluded mr ayliss because id never ever have agreed to something like that the second truth to pass between them he never would have gone along with the scheme if hed believed durrant had been innocent jac flinched fleetingly at the fresh conviction in truelles voice but hopefully covered well feeling in that instant as if they were two poker players bluffing the hell out of each other the game to see who crumbled and folded first he kept his stare level and even on truelle laying on thick the ayliss drawl yes i do believe thats exactly what you did because i believe this man actually committed the murder jac took from ormderns envelope one of the photos stratton had taken of nelson malley and slid it towards truelle do you know this man no no i dont truelle had hardly glanced at the photo are you sure jac pressed sensing a niche of uncertainty again yes im look mr ayliss truelles redfaced bluster resurfaced he pushed malleys photo back across the desktop forget this man and any others you might wish to put in the frame the dna evidence puts durrant at the murder scene he was there that night and he killed jessica roche get used to it truelle glared his words home hard clinging to his belief in them dna the final raft of moral justification hed held on to all along he was doing nothing wrong because in the end durrant had done it roche and nelm had been telling the truth all along he was guilty but with each word and accusation of aylisss hed found himself drifting further and further into a sea of doubt with that raft all that was left to cling to no no no no durrant did do it he killed her and if ayliss did finally prise his grip from that raft thered be nothing to hold on to sailing free into the night air as nelm let him loose from his dance grip i hear what youre saying jac said and even if truelle did finally break now candaret might say exactly the same when he laid it all before him this is all very well mr ayliss but the dna evidence puts durrant there theres no other possible explanation he killed jessica roche jac took a fresh breath but if they can set durrant up so perfectly with everything youve helped them with then im sure they also worked out how to set up the dna evidence only nobodys worked out how yet further adrift truelle clinging so hard his nails dug painfully into one thigh he stood up abruptly id like you to leave now mr ayliss i believe weve discussed everything we have to get ayliss clear of his office before he fell apart completely i know its hard to face jac grimaced tautly but deep down you know the truth of whats happened here mr truelle and youre probably the only person left now that might be able to save larry durrant last few fingers wrenched loose sailing free truelle didnt respond directly or even look at ayliss simply buzzed on his intercom mr ayliss is leaving now cynthia and put the hand quickly back on his desktop bracing as he felt himself sway slightly as if hed been drinking jac wrote down his ayliss cellphone number and slid it across and remember be careful where you call from with anything too juicy or incriminating your phones might well be bugged he slipped malleys photo into the envelope and looked back from the doorway as cynthia held the door open its not going to simply go away or be any easier to face in front of the da especially with five years hanging over your head jac smiled tightly and waved the envelope twentyfour hours again purely as a courtesy then i go to him with all this nelm had been tapping his fingers so incessantly against the steering wheel he could feel them starting to go numb where the fuck was she already twentyfive minutes ayliss had been in there and still no sign of her he had her number from her last call and called it back hi again melanie ayliss said i shouldnt really be talking on this now whys that you know while im driving i thought youd be jumping in a cab id already booked this from back in portland didnt take long to get the paperwork done nelm closed his eyes no wonder ayliss had fucking divorced her he felt like screaming i thought i told you it was urgent but no point in alienating her he took a fresh breath hes still here but maybe not for much longer where are you now on simon bolivar just crossed melpomene six or seven minutes thought nelm no more okay see you soon but just as it hit the six minute mark he saw ayliss head out of truelles office towards his car nelm phoned again a couple of rings before it answered ayliss already back at his car getting in hes just leaving nelms voice sharp with immediacy but im right there where on canal street just turning into royal what car have you got uuuh blue chevy metro ayliss starting up looking around pulling out and nelm spotted her then blue metro brownhaired woman at the wheel with a cellphone in her hand hes just pulled out nelm screamed grey buick century heading your way what where where the woman frantically scanning the road ahead as she assimilated the information aylisss car twentyfive yards away at that point starting to pick up speed and at only ten yards away she finally spotted him her eyes locking fully on the car and ayliss inside as they came alongside her eyes went wide for a second and then she did something foolish although nothing would have surprised nelm about her by that stage she braked hard the car behind a dodge dakota didnt have a chance crushing most of the back of the metro into a concertina nelm closed his eyes and cringed and when he opened them again it wasnt pretty though she still looked alive just ayliss had kept going might not have even noticed the conflagration twenty yards behind him quick decision to make head into truelles office and pull out fingernails until he found out what had happened or keep tailing ayliss the sound of a distant siren made his mind up thered be a scene here now police cars arriving at any second he could catch up with truelle later and besides hed need aylisss whereabouts for when his ex got out of the hospital nelm swung out to follow ayliss but at that moment the man driving ahead decided to stop to assist the accident victims his car blocking the road out the fucking way nelm screamed his head out the window you fucking numbbrained mor nelms voice trailed off as he saw a squad car ahead turn into the road nelm looked over his shoulder one arm across the passenger seat as he did a hasty threepoint turn praying that he was able to get around the block quick enough not to lose ayliss the perfect setup over a couple of shots of jim beam which rapidly became three four five and more leonard truelle pondered whether darrell aylisss claim might be right in the very beginning hed had strong doubts but hed had little choice then raoul ferrers hefty street debt one side which they offered to clear his drink problem and the threat of exposure and getting struck off the other then the final sweetener on top on one side crushing problems on the other all the decks cleared and a hefty chunk of cash on top but when theyd still sensed some reluctance from him theyd started piling it on about durrant being guilty in any case adelay roche had put feelers out on the criminal network and durrants name was the main one to come back as having killed his wife but the coma and selective memory situation had conveniently blotted it out the police couldnt even apply standard question and interrogation tactics in such a situation and in any case simply didnt have enough evidence to haul him in truelle had offered to get the information out of durrant conventionally but theyd said no too risky if hed blotted out the recall or his memory of it was sketchy the police still wouldnt have enough to nail him and with taped sessions they couldnt later go back and add or embellish then it would look suspicious as if the memory had been falsely embedded no all the details had to be there so there was no possible error or comeback thats what they were paying for over with ferrers debt he should have pulled out right then but the money and all his problems cleared at the same time was just too tempting and so hed gone along with it used the next session to condition durrant you went to a house that night on coliseum street lawrence large antebellum mansion in the garden district with grand white columns on its front portico you know the type it was a planned house robbery lawrence and you felt guilty about it because youd promised your wife not to commit any more robberies and unfortunately while you were there a woman was still in the house that you didnt know about and it all went wrong terribly wrong a masterful mix of what hed been fed from roche and nelm along with what he knew himself about durrants background he shifted the previous session tapes to cover and the next session dropped the right prompts to tease it all back out of durrants memory as the tape ran then two days later he phoned the police telling himself all along that he could pull back from the brink later when he had ferrer off his back and had worked out how to cover for his drink problem so that he didnt get struck off and and then as the police investigation gathered steam the dna evidence on durrant came in eighty per cent of that doubt and guilt suddenly lifted from his shoulders theyd been telling the truth all along durrant was guilty and thats pretty much how the years since had rolled on guilty about what hed done but consoling himself all along that the end justified the means though always with that twenty per cent of nagging doubt that percentage swung back and forth at times higher with the first news of durrants execution date thirty or forty per cent maybe even truelle suddenly jolted in his seat nelm he relaxed again as he managed to focus through the haze of the five jim beams swimming around in his head just a black man of similar height and build truelle knocked back the rest of his drink lifted a hand towards the barman for another a minute after ayliss had left his office thered been an almighty bang outside and as he looked down at the accident he saw the police car swing in and nelm backing up and doing a threepoint turn nelm had been watching outside as ayliss paid him a visit he told cynthia to cancel the rest of his days appointments he had something urgent to attend to and if anyone calls for me anyone you dont know where ive gone he hastily left the office past the policemen surveying the accident heading for a bar or anywhere that nelm might not find him for that reason he avoided bens or any of his regular haunts went deep into the cbd before he felt he was on safe enough ground a sprawling irishflavoured tavern on julia street thirty per cent forty per cent that doubt fluctuating wildly along with his own mood swings and shattered nerves reaching more for the bottle each time it raised a notch but now this smoothtongued southern lawyer ayliss had rocketed that doubt into the stratosphere he seemed to be right about everything else had pretty well worked it all out then why not the dna as well truelle noticed that his hand was still shaking as he raised his fresh glass six stiff ones and he was still shaking like jello in an earthquake he doubted that hed get calm and level this time no matter how much he drank some squeaky violin music scratched at the back of his brain while a good bar in which to hide away lots of dark corners and better still as it started to fill with an afteroffice crowd as it had become busier theyd also turned up the franticfiddler riverdance music but he still needed to kill more time okay hed sat it out beyond office hours but now that his office was closed nelm would probably be waiting at his apartment for him he wouldnt be able to go back there either stay here and be driven mad by frantic irish fiddlers or risk all out there with nelm thrown from a rooftop or a quick bullet through the brain with the aid of three more jim beams he managed to brave it out at the irish bar for almost another two hours smiling like an idiot and tapping his feet to the music at one point as the drink finally made his senses swim and sway then he went to a nearby restaurant picking at a chicken royale his stomach still too jumpy to swallow much though he did manage to wash down the five mouthfuls with a fullbodied bottle of cote de beaune he finished off the evening with four lingering nightcap brandies between two bars on maple street by which time spilling himself into a taxi at almost pm hopefully nelm would have given up waiting for him by then everything was drifting and sailing around him so wonderfully that he hardly cared if nelm put a bullet through his head hed hardly feel it and such a great moment to go out on the lights of the city spinning and sparkling all around him like hed never seen before everything so beeyootiful so fucking beeeyoootiful though he did snap to sharpen his senses a bit as the taxi approached his apartment if nelms car was anywhere nearby hed simply tell the driver to headon spend that night in a hotel but it was nowhere to be seen he eased out a breath of relief as he told the driver to stop paid leapt out and taking the stairs two and three at a time opened his door and slammed it behind him as quickly sliding back the three deadbolts then leant against the door for almost a full two minutes breathless eyes closed the city lights still spinning all around him he went to the window no sign of nelms car or anything else suspect but still he didnt put any lights on except for a small back bathroom light which wouldnt show through to the front he noticed the red light on his answerphone flashing as he went back into the lounge he played the message hi lenny chris here chris tullington you know i mentioned you coming up here one christmas well me and brenda and little giles or not so little any more were heading inland to vernon for christmas its the ideal christmas setting fir trees lots of snow and skiing and big log fires youd love it wed be real happy to see you if you could make it give us a call here in vancouver if you think youd be able to were heading off there on the eighteenth for ten days fir trees skiing warm christmas fires and old friends yeah hed love to be able to make it but it felt a million miles from where he was at that moment he looked anxiously towards the front door if the bell rang he simply wouldnt answer it just phone the police straight away say he had an intruder at the door surely nelm wouldnt be able to shoot or hack his way through all the deadbolts before the police arrived he wouldnt even risk looking through the spyhole if it rang in case nelm tried to shoot him through the door hed immediately shut and lock every connecting door and barricade himself in a back bedroom and thats where he lay as he finally put his head down to sleep though with all the connecting doors open so that he could listen out for even the slightest sound from the corridor outside and he was still in the same position over two hours later eyes darting rapidly as he listened out for those small sounds that hadnt yet come the barrage of nerves again gripping him as the effects of the drink started to wear off spinning city lights battling against dark demons until his conscious mind finally gave up caring and he fell asleep fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck when nelm got round the block ayliss was nowhere to be seen he trawled as far as ten blocks up and four or five each side before finally giving up with the thump of his palm against the steering wheel fuck twenty minutes already gone he went to a coffee bar and gripped a steaming cappuccino so hard that he thought the cup might shatter his eyes fixed steadily stonily ahead until hed killed a further halfhour and was sure all the police and ambulances would have cleared from in front of truelles building but when he got back there truelles secretary said that he wasnt in he barged through to truelles office in case she was lying then asked where he was and what time she expected him back dont know he didnt say for either faint ring of truth about it but it wouldnt get him anywhere pulling out her fingernails truelle wouldnt get back any quicker hed just have to sit it out another flathanded bash of the steering wheel as he got back into his car fuck two more as an hour rolled past and truelle still hadnt returned three each at the two and three hour marks and then finally as it got close to office closing time and truelle still wasnt back a machinegun roll of them as nelm felt his nerves finally snapping he darent even phone roche or answer his call if he rang if he told roche hed lost both ayliss and truelle and that aylisss wife had ended up in hospital the resultant incredulous gasping fit would send roche into seizure one good result from the afternoon perhaps but not the one he was after he waited another hour in case truelle was late getting back to his office left with another flathanded fuck one more as he arrived in front of truelles apartment building and saw no light on at his window and was halfway through another couple at the one hour mark with truelle still not back when his cellphone rang vic farrelia a slow smile crept across nelms face as farrelia related the call that had just come in on truelles line truelles second so far elusive insurance policy chris tullington wife brenda vancouver canada shouldnt be too hard to track down now they had them both full house nelm checked his watch both would have to be taken out at the same time no question and if possible that very night but which one did he take himself and which did he leave to tommy garrard whod so effectively taken care of dr thallerey vancouver or upstate new york not much to choose between them travellingtimewise he called roche to tell him the good news and see if he had any preferences leave him with that last bit of power and decisionmaking he so coveted every joint and muscle of melanie aylisss body seemed to scream and ache as she made her way up the steps of the eighth district station house and approached its front desk at just after pm i have a complaint to lodge oh really a brighteyed young sergeant called brennan quickly killed his faint smile and the surprise in his voice as he realized his sarcasm had been lost on the sourfaced woman before him rule fiftyeight of the police manual never joke with heavilybruised women in neckbraces he lowered his voice an octave feigned gravity and what would that be mam i had an accident earlier oh she looked at him sharply unsure whether he was still kidding or not and part of the reason for it was that id just been told that my exhusband who in fact i havent seen for the past seven years was on a certain street but when i looked at who i thought was my exhusband it wasnt him and this this caused the accident it was hard for brennan to keep the incredulous tone out of his voice but he kept his face serious slightly furrowed striving to understand yes yes because when i saw that it wasnt him i braked melanie ayliss was striving equally hard to emphasize make her point and the car behind went straight into me it was taking every bit of brennans willpower to keep a straight face any of the phrases rolling through his head at that moment fancy that or why on earth would they do a fool thing like that would have sent him into raptures of laughter rolling on the floor the main point im trying to make she said her voice getting testy for the first time is that someone is driving round impersonating my exhusband oh right i see brennan was glad shed extracted the main point from all of this it might have taken him a while so this man doesnt look like your exhusband but is nevertheless passing himself off as him no no it does look like him well a closeenough resemblance but it wasnt him brennan blinked slowly oh right you actually spoke to him no no i didnt testiness quickly verging into annoyance at this wetbehindtheears desk sergeant still grasping the wrong end of the stick or was he purposely being obstructive just that twosecond look before before the car behind went into me this was getting harder by the minute brennan ran one hand through his hair sighing and you havent seen him you say for seven years thats right she went to nod only then realizing that she couldnt with the neck brace yet youre sure it wasnt him even though you say it actually looked like him and you were only able to eyeball him for a couple of seconds yes yes a hundred per cent sure her voice practically a hiss her eyes narrowing having spent two hours unconscious and the rest of the day being scanned probed stitched strapped and jabbed with a succession of needles the last thing she needed was another prick believe you me when youve been married to someone for twelve years you know its not them in the first millisecond let alone two seconds even after seven years oh okay brennan wasnt about to argue with that her eyes flickered briefly to one side also there there was no recognition on his face when he saw me what he didnt suddenly slam on his brakes as well but from the glint in this womans eyes her patience worn brennan knew that hed be taking his life in his hands to show even the trace of a smile hed be joining her in wearing a neckbrace and any idea mam why this other person might be impersonating your husband brennan made sure too to keep any further doubt out of his voice his best formal procedural no uuuh not really one thing she hadnt thought about she smiled tightly hopefully thats something youll be able to tell me when youve caught up with him spinning city lights spinning all around floating the sensation pleasant but suddenly truelle sensed that something was wrong the lights were spinning rapidly towards him and now that horrible gutwrenching sensation of falling falling nelm had taken off his hood just before throwing him from the building falling falling truelles eyes snapped open and he sat bolt upright at the jolt of hitting the ground his breath short heart pounding like a jackhammer and there was a womans voice in the background coming from the lounge when you get this message lenny if you could call me leaving a message on his answerphone he jumped out of bed legs unsteady everything still spinning slightly around him ran towards it strangely enough when when alan spoke to you a couple of weeks back and got that letter of yours he talked about us all getting together again and hello maggie im here its lenny what is it he could tell from her voice that she was distraught almost as breathless as he was at that moment sniffling slightly then he felt his legs almost give way completely still falling as she related the horror of what had happened earlier that night alan shot dead her and the kids were out at the time shed gone to pick their son up from a scouts evening and had taken their daughter along for the ride the police putting it all together believe that the alarm on alans car in the driveway was set off to get him outside then he was taken inside by his assailant and some papers rifled through in his office before he was shot i i found him when i came back with the kids fresh breath to fight back the tears but the crazy thing is there doesnt seem to be anything of value taken falling oh maggie maggie im so sorry something like this its its unbelievable she forced an ironic snort through her shaky voice and sniffles thats why we moved upstate because we thought it would be safer i know i know falling the breath grunting out of him as his legs finally gave way sinking to his knees as he clung to the telephone table with his other hand i started my calls at six not long after the police left relatives friends and i called you lenny not only because youre a good old friend of mine and alans but because i wondered what you wanted done now with that envelope you sent if i can find where alan put it oh not daring to tell this mother of two this widow that it probably wasnt there any longer and that her husband had very likely been killed because of it truelle looked towards the clock for the first time am she forced an awkward tremulous chuckle i remember him smiling about it at the time because youd given instructions of what to do if anything happened to you but not what to do if anything happened to him well i i hadnt really thought about that he swallowed hard closed his eyes city lights still spinning in his head along with an image of alan being shot and maggie screaming and spilling tears over his prone body when she found him her two children shaking and fearful in the background and i i cant really think clearly about it now he took a fresh breath and you youve got other things to worry about right now i know sniffling the tears close again there theres no urgency ill give you a call in a few days time when ive thought about it and things have settled down more your end he sighed heavily and again maggie im sorry so sorry if theres anything i can do over these coming days anything dont hesitate to contact me but truelle found it difficult to stand up again after they signed off still gripping to the table as if it was that last raft or the edge of a high building oh god oh god but why now if theyd known of alans whereabouts all along then why not just after hed first sent the envelope or maybe it was just a terrible coincidence people got shot in upstate new york too or was it because of ayliss visiting him yesterday and him then going awol nelm fearing the worst and not able to catch up with him so truelle got up then in fact leapt back a full two paces from the phone as if it had given him a highvoltage shock staring back at it accusingly as he recalled the message that had come in the night before from chris tullington in vancouver be careful where you call from with anything too juicy or incriminating your phones might well be bugged mcelroy too had warned him earlier but hed already had his lines checked and cleared office and home hed also spoken to chris two weeks back when hed first sent the envelopes he racked his brain for what might have been said then shaking his head after a moment it hardly mattered now if for whatever reason everything was going down now chris was in danger and himself if his line was bugged theyd now know he was back at his apartment nelm could be on his way already he shrank back another pace from the phone then rushed over to the window looking out no nelm in sight nothing else that looked out of place or worrying he grabbed his keys a handful of coins from a sidedrawer and leapt breakneck down the apartment building steps he gave the street a furtive eachway scan then ran round the corner finally settling on a kiosk three blocks away in case nelm meanwhile pulled up by his place his hand shook wildly as he anxiously fed in the coins and dialled chriss number hello a womans voice but it didnt sound like chriss wife brenda is is chris there im afraid not the tone subdued grave im afraid somethings happened who is it calling truelles stomach plummeted somethings happened its len uuuh a friend whats happened im a rcmp liaison officer jackie melkin and im sorry to have to report that there was a serious incident earlier this morning involving mr tullington a homicide and his wifes not able to speak to anyone because she was injured too in the incident you say youre a friend of the tullingtons len was it could i have your full name please sir i have strict instructions to make a list of all callers i uuuh it it doesnt matter he hung up abruptly not sure where the conversation would head or if hed even be able to talk any more his writhing nerves had tightened around his chest and throat like a vice so that he could hardly breathe all that came out was a strangled breathless gasp as he clenched his eyes shut and banged one fist repeatedly against the kiosk glass no no no no no but you had your lines cleared of bugs you had them cleared he could no longer be sure of that until hed made one more call but he didnt have time now he had to get away as far away as possible he made a quick stop at a deli for a takeout coffee to clear the dust from his throat and his headthrob from last night sharpen his senses though fear and adrenalin seemed to have already done half of that job for him and running on that highoctane mix of fear adrenalin caffeine and nightbefore jim beams and brandies within seven minutes he had everything he needed from his apartment packed in a suitcase and was heading back down the stairs a final anxious scan of the road outside having already checked every other minute while packing then he scampered a block round the corner and hailed a cab to an internet cafe in metairie where hed make the rest of his travel arrangements cuba the remotestplaced friend he could think of probably the only one of his old friends who hadnt yet been shot not a million miles away but with us travel restrictions a nightmare to get to hed be travelling half the day with stopoffs at atlanta miami and nassau to get there then a six hour drive from havana the arrangements made he suddenly thought of something hed forgotten he couldnt leave it in his office yet he couldnt risk going back there either he checked his watch am he called cynthias cellphone hed need to tell her hed be away for a few days in any case and instructed her where to find what he needed and the po box in cuba to send it to dhl immediately you get to the office and dont for gods sake tell anyone where ive gone anyone she told him about nelms visit the day before big black guy eyes like a dead frogs seemed to be the day for people barging into your office him in particular dont tell but cynthia knew that something was seriously wrong probably from the breathless rapidstaccato way he spat everything out as if afraid a minute later it would be too late and as the questions started to come he cut her short i cant tell you cynthia i cant i might have set up an innocent man and everyone who gets near to knowing about it ends up dead the stale drink caffeine and sour bile was like a bubbling quagmire surging up through his lungs hard to breathe the throbbing in his head and bodys trembling was so heavy that it felt as if a limb might fall off at any second i just need to get away for a few days thats all just dhl that package straightaway and dont tell anyone where ive gone youll be okay and cynthia be especially careful what you say on the office line it might be bugged he hung up quickly before any more questions came and dialled straight out to his friend in cuba as he went outside and hailed a cab to the airport yeah yeah brent on my way right now be great to see you old buddy been a long time lot of catching up to do fourshot mojito session at least never any doubt but if he hadnt been able to stay with brent hed have simply booked a nearby hotel as his taxi headed towards the airport he made his last call the one that had troubled him more and more the past hour bell south truelle explained about the engineers visits hed booked three weeks back to clear suspected bugs from his home and office telephones brief flurry of keyboard taps yes ive got them here both booked at the same time on the fourteenth of last month truelles hopes raised then with a few more taps at her end quickly sank again as she looked at the next entry and then both cancelled again the following day thats thats not possible truelle spluttered i didnt cancel them and two different engineers called at the times arranged both wearing bell uniforms im sorry sir if those visits actually happened then we dont have any record of them here on our computer the last recorded entry we have is for the two cancellations and no new times set for alternative visits no point in arguing further with the girl he now knew the truth of what had happened how theyd done it thanks falling sinking deeper into the abyss his voice little more than a hollow detached echo rising up through it the two engineers had put the bugs in rather than taken them out from then on theyd listened in to every word and when chris had left the message with his details hed signed his own and alans deathwarrant truelle shut his eyes as he felt the first tears of the day sting them maybe ayliss was right if they were clever enough to set all of that up perhaps theyd set up the dna evidence as well and in two days time hed have durrants death also on his conscience truelle kept his eyes shut the tears rolling gently down his cheeks as the taxi sped to the airport but at least the battle inside his head was over there were no longer any spinning city lights only dark demons melanie aylisss enquiry landed on the desk of joe rayleigh a portly sixthree black detective with a constant scowl he glanced briefly at its opening page as it arrived he had a stack of murder rape missing persons and armed robbery files on his desk impersonation wasnt exactly a priority the only thing to give it a curious edge was that it concerned larry durrants new lawyer darrell ayliss rayleigh glanced at his watch not much he could do about it that night but at the next morning he called the two places where he thought he might get a contact number or the current whereabouts of darrell ayliss at libreville prison warden havelings secretary said that it was likely either warden haveling or his assistant mr folley had a number for mr ayliss but folley had been on night duty and wouldnt be in until midday and warden haveling was tied up in a meeting until am but ill get warden haveling to call you back the minute he comes out his meeting rayleigh left his number and made his second call to payne beaton and sawyer the law firm that previously represented durrant and was put through to a john langfranc no unfortunately i dont have mr aylisss number langfranc commented but i know someone who very likely has mike coultaine he used to work for us and apparently has kept in contact with darrell ayliss since in fact i understand that it was mike coultaine who recommended ayliss to the durrant case now the small bit of scuttlebutt hed found out when hed called rodriguez to find out how the bop hearing had gone rayleigh took coultaines number and dialled it the second he hung up on langfranc yeah i know how to get in touch with darrell ayliss coultaine said in fact i met up with him just a few days ago whats this all about something to do with the durrant case no no some query to do with his exwife rayleigh was thinking more about the first part of what coultaines had said you mentioned you met up with him what did he look like like like darrell ayliss it was obvious from coultaines tone that he found the question odd why rayleigh sensed that he was about to make a serious horses ass out of himself unless he explained a bit more he told coultaine about melanie aylisss brief encounter with someone shed expected to be her exhusband in a car the day before and although it was only for a couple of seconds and she hasnt seen her husband for seven years shes got it in her head that the man she saw wasnt him so i have to ask you sir do you know darrell ayliss well well enough when you met him a few days back to know whether it was him or not coultaine exhaled heavily i shared an office with darrell ayliss for three full years with him no more than a few yards from me and unlike his ex ive had the benefit of seeing him far more recently ive visited him in mexico twice now the last time just fourteen months back it was him theres no question about it right thanks for that sir rayleigh chuckled awkwardly you know we get these things in we gotta chase them up i understand fresh breath from coultaine but i think youll find this is more to do with melanie aylisss old maintenance battle with her exhusband shes trying craftily to make use of police resources to track him down yeah yeah could be sounded about right but he loved it when they were cleared up quickly thanks again the second he rang off he threw the folder onto the case closed pile and at coultaines end as soon as he hung up he called jac the phone was on its fourth ring before bob stratton finally picked up and jac worried for a moment that he wasnt there he put on the drawl and introduced himself as darrell ayliss said that hed seen strattons name in the file hed taken over from jac mcelroy hes noted here that youre good at finding people with an exclamation mark and thats exactly what im after i was there at the time id have incriminated myself the thought had struck jac in the early hours of the morning woke him sharply at am not that he was sleeping that well in any case different hotel beds every night and the turmoil of thoughts in his head another crime going down at the same time thats why he hadnt been able to come forward fear of selfincrimination maybe he was clutching at straws maybe it was just an old friend or hoaxer but with still no reply to his last email and only fortyeight hours now left that was all there was left to do squeeze every last drop out of the few remaining possibilities he explained his thinking to stratton probably not in the roche house itself too much of a coincidence or even immediate neighbours but somewhere within say fifty or a hundred yards close enough that this person would have got a reasonable look at the murderer leaving the roche house that night enough to say that it wasnt larry durrant and you say youve got some photos and a description of this mystery emailer yeah from a girl in the internet cafe i i see from mcelroys file having to be careful every second what he said though the photos dont give that much theyre only partial camshots with at most thirty per cent facial profile and the description black stocky fiveten maybe six foot late thirties early forties could fit ten or twenty per cent of the citys black population okay stratton was thoughtful for a second but if i get fresh photos of a few liveones in front of this girl something might strike a chord yeah possibility jac agreed except dont forget were looking for someone that was active twelve years ago if theyre not active now mugshots are going to be thin on the ground true stratton took a fresh breath but thats going to be stage two the first thingll be to find out if another crime did go down nearby twelve years ago then well have a start point to know if its even worth looking further and also what type of crime and connected mugshots were looking for nelm tried to grab some sleep on his twentyminutedelayed am flight from vancouver but the images still surging through his head were making it difficult if only everything his end of things had gone as smoothly as garrards if only hed spoken to tommy garrard two hours ago and it apparently had gone like clockwork car in the drive alarm set off twice husband comes out no other family there at the time into the house to get the envelope two quick shots and away again nobody saw me but just in case like you suggested i wore a mask at the time but with nelms target thered been no car in the driveway and hed had to bang a sidepassage dustbin to hopefully get the man of the house out to investigate three sharp bangs at twominute intervals nelm starting to worry that hed bring the neighbours out as well before a heavyset guy finally emerged wielding a baseball bat and moving surprisingly fast for his size perhaps not realizing nelm had a gun until it was too late nelm floored him with a leg shot then had to drag the stumbling bleeding body back through the house with his wife and son no more than eleven looking on swinging his gun towards the wife for a second as she made a move towards the phone to get the envelope from a bedroom drawer hed made sure to ask about the envelope while they were still outside out of earshot of his family then clamped a hand across his mouth as they moved inside knowing that if the man did mention it hed have to shoot them too but as he levelled his gun to finish the job halfway back down the hallway his wife screamed and lunged for him then only a splitsecond to turn his gun from the headshot to put one in her leg to take her down then he stood over them both for a second breath falling rapid and short as he pondered whether to finish her too hed also used a mask from a joke shop so what else would her and her son have seen other than a bit of dark skin and some saltandpepper curls either side of an ozzy osborne mask then at that moment she groaned heavily with pain from her leg wound made him worry that shed disturb neighbours but as he raised his gun he caught the look in her sons eyes questioning pleading what was he going to do shoot the kid as well as joe pesci once said you could be out there half the fucking night he waggled the gun at them threateningly as he backed away along the hallway and out the front door then turned and ran off into the night but now as he tried to sleep on the flight those boys eyes were with him again strangely haunting reminding him of that night twelve years ago with jessica roche that woman walking her dog staring at him only once before had he left a witness alive and look where that had led jac sat anxiously outside truelles office building his earlier telephone conversation with cynthia still rattling through his mind when do you expect him back i dont know he didnt say do you know where hes gone didnt tell me that either what about the patients he has today cynthia sighed tiredly that if you dont mind me saying is none of your business jac sensed he was getting the runaround that something was wrong but if he pushed harder and she revealed anything sensitive anyone listening in on truelles line would hear it at the same time and so hed signed off then ill try him again later deciding in that moment on another unannounced visit hed originally planned to wait outside and observe for thirty or forty minutes then barge in and let loose with all guns on truelle if he was there on steelblonde cynthia if he wasnt but then mike coultaines call about melanie ayliss had come through just as he was leaving his hotel and suddenly he felt vulnerable sitting in the open in the street it was bad enough posing as ayliss padded out like a weight watchers reject feeling as if he was in a constant pressurecooker worried that half his face might suddenly melt and slide off but now he had this crazy ex on his tail telling the police or anyone whod listen that the man running around town as darrell ayliss wasnt her husband after only fifteen minutes his nerves were worn spending as much time looking round at the street for anyone who might be looking at him as at truelles entrance and window still no sign of truelle only a couple of people he didnt recognize perhaps going to other offices in the building and a dhl messenger heading in and then out again two minutes later jac managed to last only another three minutes a short gasp from steely cynthia as he burst in then a cool imperious eyebrow raised what do you want i told you earlier hes not here and he still isnt save it jac snapped he went through to truelles office to check then glared back at her she held the same cool stare she was getting used to this by now he moved towards her desk leant on the edge of it so lets try again what time do you expect mr truelle back i dont know jac sighed tiredly a rerun of their telephone conversation forty minutes ago he asked where truelle had gone and she said she didnt know that either jac closed his eyes for a second the sigh heavier now severely pissed off he leant over a fraction more intimidating we could spend the next half hour with me asking variations on those same questions with you continuing to be uncooperative but the only problem with that is i dont have much time ive got a man on death row because of truelle and the clocks ticking fast against him thats why when i was here yesterday i gave mr truelle a deadline jac glanced at his watch now at that deadline only half an hour from now if truelle isnt in the das office ready and willing to talk then the da is going to have him arrested and if hes not here to arrest then hes going to have you arrested instead and charged with obstruction of justice a bluff but he doubted truelle had told her enough for her to know that hed probably simply instructed dont say anything she stared back at him hardly a flicker or flinch mrs coolsteelblonde and youll end up having to answer these same questions after a night in a jail cell and with a years sentence hanging over your head jac eased the syrupy ayliss smile only i dont have time to wait for you to languish in jail for a day i need the answer to those questions now he slapped one hand against the desk for emphasis in the quiet of the office it was like a rifleshot she didnt move or flinch all it raised from her was a slow blink defiant yourenot going to break me she returned the smile smugly jac reached for his backup ammunition took the photo of nelson malley out of his briefcase and slid it across her desk asking do you know this man no no i dont jac knew that she was lying the flinch in her eyes the first so far screamed yes and like truelle shed hardly looked at the photo as if afraid to fully confront it hes going to come round here too asking you the same questions but hes not going to be nearly as nice as me hes going to have his hands round your throat and a gun in your face sooner than you can blink another faint flinch her blinking a beat quicker and hes not going to think twice about pulling the trigger a faint swallow cynthia looking down rapidly not wishing jac to see that hed struck a chord and as jac looked down too he noticed the open appointment diary before her her arms on it guarding from upside down he thought he could make out the word rearranged and then another time written alongside on a few entries he grabbed for the book to turn it his way but she held on to it tight and he had to twist and wrench hard finally shoving her back with one forearm to wrestle it free he could now see more rearrangeds with fresh times alongside with some on the next page as he flicked over seven in all rearranged over the next three days and she was probably working on the rest as hed walked in so now at least we know how long hes going to be away at least the three remaining days of this week and with all those appointments rearranged for the end of next week and some the week after maybe as long as a week jac raised an inquisitive eyebrow but she just glared back at him redfaced and slightly breathless from the brief tussle so now all thats left to find out is where hes gone i dont know he he didnt tell me but jac could see that she was more hesitant less sure of her ground perhaps uncertain now after their brief tussle just how far hed go to get the information he gave the diary one more quick scan an entry to one side hitting his peripheral vision but not at that instant seeming relevant he laid the diary back in front of cynthia leaning over again at the same time come on cynthia i dont have time for any more of your fooling around three days larry would be dead by then i need to know where where she looked down awkwardly again not wanting jac to see what was in her eyes or perhaps in that instant seeing in jacs eyes everything hed been through almost drowning in the lake being framed for murder and hunted by the police representing a man who he was sure was innocent now only a day and a half away from execution dawning on her then that having gone through all of that he wasnt simply after a few trite foboffs going to walk away and as jac looked down again he noticed that cynthia seemed to be more concerned with covering that side entry thats what shed been covering before from where he was hed been able to see the rearranged appointments shielding them hadnt been as vital he yanked back at the appointment book shoved her arm away from covering the entry and read fully what before had only half registered apartado sancti spiritus cuba dhl cs jac stabbed the entry with one finger glaring back at cynthia thats where hes gone isnt it cynthia redfaced shook her head i i dont know jac slammed one hand on the desk again another rifleshot and this time cynthia did flinch yes you fucking do because i saw the dhl man come in and out just ten minutes before i came up here cynthia chewing at her bottom lip clinging by her fingertips to her last shred of resolve one last push and if my man on death row who i truly believe is innocent should die because of you then god help you ill push the da with everything ive got for the maximum for obstruction two years in the hardest possible womens prison and as tough as you think you are cynthia you wont make it jac leant closer still so close that hopefully shed feel the syrup from aylisss sly smile drip on her his voice lowering to a hiss you wont fucking make it cynthia chewing harder at her lip crumbling inch by inch before him jac tapped malleys photo and if this man catches up with your boss before me then god help him too because hell be dead long before my man on death row and all your efforts today will okay okay breathless exhalation as that last inch went her resolve finally snapped that is where hes gone she looked up at him anxiously she shook her head but i didnt tell you okay i promised i wouldnt do you have a street address or any other information nono she shook her head again thats it and i only had that because he asked me to send something there this time jac sensed she was telling the truth and what was that a cassette tape he told me where to find it in his office okay jac nodded thoughtfully tape perhaps the tape that had got bumped when truelle shifted all the sessions jac wrote down the cuba po box number and gave cynthia one last look at malleys photos before he slid it back into his case and do yourself a favour cynthia if this man calls asking for your boss and for sure he will make sure youre not here as i say he wont be nearly as nice as me and in the end i wasnt really nice at all carmen malastra visited the baytree casino floor once more to confirm everything that hed put together on screen from studying cam videos the past weeks filling in the final shades the envelopes passed from jouliern to strelloff him stashing them below the bar easily covered as part of the bar float until the final tally was done at the end of the evening and then strelloff in turn passing the envelopes on to the courier malastra walked the areas that hed seen on video looking back thoughtfully towards the cameras wondering how many more envelopes might have been passed that he hadnt picked up on the handover at times obscured by activity on the casino floor people milling about this time caccia didnt follow him round like an obedient puppy sensed after the first few paces that hed rather be alone ill leave you to it mr malastra if you need anything anything at all ill be at the end of the bar malastras steps retraced joulierns and strelloffs movements on those nights from the tables where jouliern took the money half of it pocketed and chips substituted to match before he passed everything on to the cashiers booth then an hour before closing passing all the skimmed money in an envelope to strelloff behind the bar and finally strelloff passing it to the courier at the end of the evening not every night though they were restricted by how often the courier could call two or three times a week by the looks of it and with the association not at all suspicious that they would be there that often malastra leant against the bar and looked back towards the two main cameras covering it he hadnt managed to pick up every envelope handover but enough to piece together the pattern with a curt nod to caccia malastra went back to his office and computer after forty minutes of checking angles again and running through the dozen or so sequences where the images were clearest he freezeframed and printed off what he thought were the best shots then picked up the phone and summoned byebye this is who were looking for he said as byebye approached passing across two photos thatll then end this whole jouliern saga i want it done quick and so smooth and clean itll be like an oyster sliding down pavarottis throat he looked up sharply at byebye understand byebye nodded studying the two photos yeah sure and be careful on this one dont get complacent with jouliern gone they might have guessed well be coming for them so they could well be looking out or have made some safeguards be prepared for that larry couldnt take his eyes off joshua not he liked to think because it was the last time hed see the boy but because he hadnt seen him now for eleven months and the boy had changed so much in that time he looked a good two inches taller his voice a shade deeper the look in his eye more thoughtful larry thought he could see the first shadow of the man that joshua would become kind thoughtful caring but hopefully nobodys fool and maybe much of that had come about that transformation starting so early because hed had to shoulder so much more than other boys of his age the taunts the different surrogate fathers careful what he said between and about his real father and them in case it looked like favouritism difficult if not impossible larry thought to get that balance right from what hed read in joshs emails or maybe that was all just wishful thinking larry projecting his thoughts because he knew now that he wouldnt actually see how josh turned out come here trying to project too every ounce of love hed missed giving the boy these past long years and now the years to come as he hugged him tight not wishing to smother josh or make him feel too awkward so letting him go sooner than hed have liked he could have stayed hugging josh all day francine looking on her eyes glassy with emotion her voice breaking slightly oh larry larry as she took joshs place and they embraced though this time it was more her hugging larry patting his back a couple of times as if he were the child that needed consoling then silence for a moment tense uneasy silence hed covered most of the daytoday regular stuff by email with josh over the past few months though franny wasnt to know that and he and franny hadnt spoken for so long now they hardly knew what to say to each other any more casual light stuff seemed too trivial given what he was facing and the heavier stuff which might remind him of that or worse still tackled it directly seemed just as bad so they just sat there for a moment in that silent gap in the middle theyd been allowed a cell near havelings office for their final meeting so that they werent forced to just clasp fingers through the holes in a glass screen and semiprivacy the back of a guards head was just visible through the doors open inspection hatch i appreciate you coming here today larry said finally i understand from joshs email it wasnt that easy you had to lay it on the line with frank she nodded yeah had to tell him straightout thats it were going no point in arguing it might be our she broke off then bit at her lip realizing the minefield this conversation was going to be but no other word that she could think of that wouldnt sound pathetic or contrived our last chance to see you her eyes glistening heavier she closed them for a second as if in apology for having said it thats okay larry reached out and touched her shoulder whatever the reasoning im just glad to see you both here now she nodded and after a second finally thought of a subject that was weighty and worthy enough for discussion joshuas schooling talking about how well he was doing straight as in most of his subject a couple of bs and nothing nothing below that we both got good reason to be proud of him there larry joshua beamed awkwardly flushing slightly larry nodded looking away from the boy back to francine yeah youve done a good job with him there franny even though often it hasnt been easy last chance for him to tell franny how proud he was of her keeping a stable home wrapped around joshua despite the odds larry talked directly with joshua for a moment about school asking him which subjects he preferred even though he already halfknew from their emails back and forth preferred english and history to maths and science liked languages too particularly french preferred tolkein to rowling though of recent hed turned more to some of the older classics dumas dickens lord of the flies and tom sawyer fantasy is okay but they tell me a bit more about how real life is or was thats good thats good larry nodded sagely practically retelling his own words when hed first recommended the books in emails months back joshs way of telling him that hed taken the advice and was reading them telling him before it was too late that trivia barrier broken without them hardly realizing it francine talked about her work in the shoe shop that if she could find another job with the same friendly hours that paid better shed take it like a shot larry appreciating that in fact it wasnt that trivial because the hours were linked to her being able to meet josh from school sacrifice larry deciding then to lighten things by telling her about roddys last crosby routine franny holding one hand by her mouth as she laughed as if she shouldnt be laughing in a place like this and especially not at this time an anxious glance towards the guard outside through the open viewing hatch worried what he would think but larry thinking it was so good to see her laughing so good hardly in fact able to remember the last time hed seen her smile or laugh brief fragmented flashes of their wedding day and joshua being born making the years since seem all the more lost wasted larry hastily pushed the thought away though i told roddy straight that it wasnt half as funny as seeing him struggle to save the day in front of that crabfaced woman at the bop hearing he was backpaddling faster than a duck facing ten chinese chefs until that ayliss guy turned up to save his neck or mine as it so happens larry shook his head grimacing if i miss anything from this place then itd be roddy and maybe the library a bit too ayliss saving neck but as much as theyd all desperately tiptoed around the subject talking about anything but suddenly it was back before them larrys death only thirtytwo hours away now the shadow of it hanging so close that it was stifling suffocating inescapable with the mention of ayliss frannys eyes darting rapidly as if unwilling to accept the inevitability of that shadow she leapt for what she saw as a possible escape route i heard that new lawyer of yours ayliss on a radio phonein a few days back after candaret turned down your pardon and he said he wasnt giving up yet not by a long shot said that he truly believed you were innocent and in fact had someone visiting the prison over the next few days that would hopefully once and for all prove it yeah larry nodded smiling dryly jac hamming it up as ayliss trying to get a doubt bandwagon rolling never say die a psychiatrist larry explained about ormderns two sessions and what theyd hoped to find either with his old pool game or lack of detail recalled about the roche house he shook his head as he finished but in the end they didnt hit on anything not enough anyway he shrugged though apparently ayliss is still out there chasing down from what he tells me some vital final leads uncovered from the sessions francine reached out and gently clasped one of his hands so theres still some hope left still someone out there fighting for you he clasped back at her hand realizing in that moment that like her smile and laugh shed touched him more in this past half hour than she had in eleven years he grimaced tightly franny i dont think its right to fool ourselves that hell suddenly pull a rabbit out the hat hes probably saying all that just to make me feel good keep my hopes up candaret said no and in the end those sessions didnt dig up anything i might just have to accept that thats it but surely larry if hes still out there trying then larry squeezed tighter at her hand its okay franny its okay ive accepted it because you know at he looked down awkwardly the right words suddenly elusive at some stage ive got to its just not right clinging on till the last moment with false hope when i should be trying to make peace with he was about to say my god but changed tack at the last second it depersonalized too much from fran and josh with myself in my own mind and that inner peace is real important to me right now so i can say the things to you and josh that need to be said he kept hold of her hand though more gently now i want to thank you first off for bringing josh up straight and true when like i said before god knows often it couldnt have been easy with me not there through all the years and i dont even have to ask you to promise me to keep doing that good job because i know you will and to say that that i always loved you even though i often had a strange way of showing it back then francine eyes glistening heavier with tears shaking her head as if to say no no you dont need to say this to me now or perhaps feeling awkward at hearing it not wishing it to be the last thing she heard from him remembered him by and him eager to get the words out before his resolve went say what he should have said years ago but never did because he was too blind or proud or foolish or stubborn knowing that if he didnt say it now he never would and i i probably never did stop loving you and to say that that but as hard as it had been to say everything so far this was by far the hardest im im sorry so sorry for having done what i did let you and josh down francine crumbled then the tears flowing freely down her cheeks joshuas eyes too were glassy both of them still clinging to that hope mentioned of ayliss still trying to save him not wanting to accept what was happening not wanting to hear from larry what sounded now like a goodbye speech their pleading eyes screaming at him you might have accepted whats happening found peace with yourself but we havent we havent and as much as one part of larry was glad that hed said what he had in fact what he should have said eleven or twelve years ago another part of him cursed ever having met jac mcelroy for filling him with hope caring again before that hed had it all pretty well worked out his family had all but given up on him so in turn him giving up on them and what little there was left in this life for him wasnt that difficult seemed almost the next natural progressive step as did turning to god though he did truly believe it wasnt just a second option a crutch because god was the only person left in this world who he felt hadnt deserted him but one effect it had though it hadnt dawned on him until later was that when he turned more to god and away from worldly life love and caring most of it already stripped from him in any case when he made that final turn away nobody really noticed as if he was already a shadow and so that final slipping away was barely visible and at that moment he also halfdied and the daily grind and horrors and isolation of libreville over the years steadily chipped away at that other half until there was practically nothing left at that final low moment the only consolation was that death the shadow of execution hanging over him no longer held any threat because there was so little of life left for him so little would be taken but then this jac mcelroy had come along talking about family and caring and hope about life and as he finally let himself be drawn into that started to care once more hed become afraid of death again because there was suddenly much more of life more that seemed worthwhile that would be taken away he wanted nothing more now than to see his son grow tall go to college get a girlfriend avoid all the mistakes hed made rather than just have to imagine it all happening but the last thing he wanted at this moment was his son to see that see his fear of dying the longing in his eyes and minutes later as they said their final tearful goodbyes and larry hugged them tighter than ever before while he felt his heart soar as they said they loved him too josh adding that hed never forget him youll always be my pa as if the others since had only half filled that role larry couldnt bear to see the pain and unwillingness to accept his death in their eyes and so part of him wished it had been like before him already halfforgotten just a shadow and then he could have just quietly slipped away without anyone hardly noticing not caused them any pain or trouble so there she is in this neck brace her face like shes gone five rounds with tyson and she says ive been in an accident really i say two vice detectives and another sergeant smiled as brennan started with the story in the eighth district canteen this sounded like it was going to be good but shes as sourfaced as a turkeys ass this one i got more chance of raising a smile from a funeral director the smiles lapsed into chuckles as brennan got to the reason for her accident slamming on her car brakes because shed just seen her exhusband of seven years and then convinced that it wasnt him and when i suggested to her that maybe with her only seeing him for two seconds she might have been mistaken she looks ready to kill starts giving me a lecture about when youve been married to someone for a while you recognize them in the first millisecond and anyway she says there was no recognition on his face when he saw me what he didnt slam on his brakes too im about to say more chuckling brennan in his element as he hammed up the story saying by that stage he was worried for his own safety if he showed even the trace of a smile starting to get lockjaw from holding it in check and at one point she goes to nod but cant with the neckbrace fullblown guffaws now brennan held out one palm then it started to get even more interesting because it turns out her ex is no less than darrell ayliss larry durrants new lawyer at the table behind them lieutenant pyrford had only been halflistening to the story as he sipped at a coffee he was waiting for robbery reports on four downtown stores for a suspect held over at the fifth district and had been told theyd be fifteen minutes or so but as darrell ayliss and durrant were mentioned he looked over and as the penny at the back of his brain dropped fully he leant across and interrupted the conversation excuse me you said that this exwife of aylisss claimed that the man she saw wasnt her husband thats right pretty close lookalike but not him yeah yeah brennan slightly bemused by pyrfords sudden interest thats about it that single penny becoming a jackpot cascade as the rest of it fell into place mcelroy morvaun jaspar ayliss do you know whos heading up the jac mcelroy investigation here lieutenant derminget one of the vice detectives answered do you have a number yeah the detective flipped open his cellphone scrolled down read it out pyrford dialled and drifted out of the canteen into the corridor as it answered background traffic noise and explained his thinking to derminget its just that with mcelroy having represented jaspar jaspars past strong form with disguises and now aylisss exwife claiming that it isnt him i might be putting two and two together and coming up with six but it would certainly explain why mcelroys suddenly disappeared off the face of the map yeah it certainly would no sightings or trace of mcelroy now for a full week broughlan had chewed his ass so hard he hardly had anything left to sit on and as ayliss derminget reflected mcelroy would have been able to continue representing durrant thanks for that do you want us to haul jaspar in again see what we can find out no not at this stage i dont want him alerted until ive worked out the best way to handle this ill call you back if i need some help there and again thanks by the time derminget got back to his car hed worked out how to play everything he didnt want to alert aylissmcelroy either hed made that mistake once already that ruled out politely asking ayliss in under some spurious guise related to durrant hed get suspicious or putting out tv or news bulletins if he saw them before the public pointed the finger hed go to ground again the other problem was that they didnt have a photo of the real ayliss and those available would probably be from seven years ago derminget started up but as he looked round to pull out the thought suddenly hit him he got librevilles number from then phoned them and asked whether they might have some good security cam shots of lawyer darrell ayliss whod recently visited them as close and clear as possible he gave them the eighth district email to send them to stressing the urgency then he phoned into central dispatch to put out an apb on ayliss photos should be with you shortly hopefully theyd get ayliss under arrest before he knew they were even looking for him before he knew what hit him then if theyd made a big mistake they could apologize later fuck fuck fuck nelm was back to bashing his steering wheel as he returned to his car having checked truelles office and discovered that nobody was there not even his secretary he drove over to truelles faubourg marigny apartment but truelle wasnt there either fuck fuck two more steering wheel bashes one leaving truelles apartment the other arriving back at his office still nobody there after the messy drama in vancouver hed been hoping for an easy ride with this one get truelle out of his office on some ruse two quick shots in a side alley and done finito years now hed been looking forward to putting a bullet through truelles head with impunity no possible comebacks and now that moment was finally here truelle was nowhere to be found sensing that everything was suddenly closing in on him truelle had no doubt decided to disappear until after durrants death truelles secretary obviously knew where he was thats why shed hitailed it too didnt want to stay frontline facing all the flak nelm took out his cellphone and called vic farrelia truelles secretary cynthia do you have anything on tape with her full name or the district she lives in so i could maybe track down her address i can do better than that farrelia said i picked up her full address somewhere im sure she gave it one day to a friend she hadnt seen for a while give me a minute or two ill try and find it twelve minutes after farrelias return call nelm was knocking on cynthias floor apartment door in bywater who is it she called out nelm didnt answer then hearing her move close to the door the other side probably looking through the spyhole he barged hard against it western another hard barge fucking union the lock gave way on the last barge obviously she didnt have truelles heavy deadbolts cynthia was wideeyed shrieking with each barge and backing a step away then turned to run as nelm finally burst through he slammed the door behind him and caught up with her at the end of her hallway clamping one hand over her mouth to stifle her shrieks breathless sweat beads popped on his forehead he listened out for a second for whether anyone had heard doors opening across the corridor footsteps coming along to investigate but there was nothing no movement half lifting cynthia her shrieks and groans heavily muffled by the hand across her mouth he bundled her into a back bedroom shut the door okay he said taking his gun out we can do this one of a few ways either you tell me straight out where your boss truelle has gone or after weve played breaking fingers or russian roulette she shook her head lips pressed stubbornly tight as she looked anxiously between him and the gun hoping praying that it was a bluff nelm reached out and grabbed one of her arms placing her hand in his her wrist gripped tight but his touch against her hands and fingers curiously light soothing he arched an eyebrow are you sure you wanna go through this be a lot easier just to tell me she shook her head again though less certainly this time she writhed and tried to wrench her hand from his grip but he was too firm too strong he gripped tighter and pushing hard back on her index finger snapped the bone as if it was a twig her howling scream was quickly muffled by his hand back over her mouth okay lets try again wheres truelle gone but again that wideeyed defiant stare tears rolling down her cheeks now from the pain and from fear he broke one more finger her still defiant nelm deciding then that she was making too much noise and it was hard for him to cover quickly with his hand over her mouth he tipped the bullets out of his gun holding one up as he put it back in then just before sliding the barrel into her mouth asked her again where truelle was still that wideeyed fuckyou stare though scrunching tight at the last second as the empty click came her whole body shuddering and to nelms amazement she managed to brave out one more empty click before her resolve finally snapped and with a breathless okay okay she agreed to tell him shed brought the appointment book with her in case someone broke into the office to read it he shuffled her through to the lounge one arm clamped tight around her as she got the book and pointed out the cuba mail box address nelm wrote it down and thats all you have yeah thats it the truth he sensed and have you given this to anyone else she started to shake her head but as his eyes narrowed reading her hesitance untruth he moved his gun towards her again she changed to a hasty nod yeah yeah a lawyer ayliss i believe that was his name how long ago she shrugged four maybe five hours nelm nodded thoughtfully absently sliding the bullets back into his gun cuba four or five hours jump on him cynthias eyes were fixed on his gun her breath catching slightly there there werent any bullets in your gun all along i know i palmed it nelm smiled slyly as he slid in the last two bullets when you were a little girl didnt you just love surprises yanking her hair back nelm put the gun barrel back in her mouth and pulled the trigger yep i managed to dig up something stratton said mercedes sl lifted from a driveway on street just two houses in from coliseum while a couple were away on holiday they apparently already had a jaguar and a caddy in the garage thats why the car was out sounds promising jac had decided to use his time waiting for flightboarding to make his followup calls hed tried mack elliotts number to see if hed recalled anything yet no answer then hed called stratton and it happened the same night as jessica roches murder thats the thing that cant be said for sure the couple the lapointes were away for ten days and from the police report the neighbours were vague on when the car went missing closest it can be nailed down to is two days before the night of the murder or three days after but theres at least a chance it went down that same night stratton sucked in his breath thing is thats the only recorded crime close by that could have been that night its either that or nothing street from jacs pacing the district a few nights back thats where hed worked out the murderer would have probably cut through to get back to his car yeah okay certainly its close enough for someone there to have seen the murderer leaving the roches house anything else yet on it jac looked up as his flight was called echoing pa clamour of other voices swirling around hed checked in for his flight as late as possible was nervous being too long among crowds knowing that melanie ayliss was on the prowl for him still waiting on a list of possible mo matches from that time then fastforwarding to those still active now before i can get some mugshots in front of the staff at that internet cafe yeah right jac got up and headed towards the gate echoing footsteps among the voices walking through libreville legs shaky nerves biting as he viewed the passport officers ahead first time aylisss passport had been put to the test and timing that clockhand ticking hourbyhour heavier in his head only thirty hours left and half of that would now be eaten up getting to truelle in cuba hopefully ill get everything i want before the days out and if that internet cafes still open get the photos in front of them tonight but if not its going to have to wait till first light tomorrow morning okay six people ahead in the queue jacs stomach doing a quick turn as one of the passport officers ahead surveying who was approaching eyed him for the first time melanie aylisss eyes locking on him a rock had sunk through his stomach as coultaine had told him about her notifying the police coultaine said he was sure that hed put their minds to rest on that front but what if he hadnt ill be planehopping pretty much till the early hours anyway but i might get a chance to contact you between connections late tonight sure if you can where are you going nassau bahamas because of us travel restrictions jac had been warned not to mention his destination was cuba until he was actually in nassau the officers ahead were close enough to hear him now the queue down to three passing quickly through two nice wish it was like everything else right now another lastditch shot at saving larry durrants life that officer ahead locking eyes on him again jac worried that with all the ayliss padding he was sweating more than he should looked more nervous than he should or perhaps part of his face had finally melted something in the officers eyes something jac swallowed hard forged passport melanie aylisss police alert travelling to cuba when you shouldnt face melting off take your pick on what might be wrong one id id better go now yeah speak to you later good luck thanks you too the usual offhand reciprocation but as jac handed over his passport and saw again that look in the officers eyes and he was then asked to step to one side as his passport was passed to a colleague behind to check on his computer he was in little doubt which one of them needed luck the most at that moment torvald engelson tor or tdo to the other libreville guards and inmates liked to think of himself as a good and caring death custodian since the changeover from the electric chair to lethal injection in the final lethal dose was given by expert medical practitioners from outside different ones each time administered in a separate adjoining room to where it would finally feed through to larry durrant strapped down to a gurney and even with those six straps holding him down each one would be secured by a different guard from the execution team at each stage responsibility for durrants death was shifted as much as possible away from any single person in that same spirit throughout the whole process torvald himself would never touch larry directly except perhaps to lay a comforting hand on his shoulder the night before and say goodbye but it was torvalds responsibility to make all the preparations make sure everything ran without hitch arrange the practitioners a medical examination of durrant two hours before that select the execution team checklist of those who wished to be present in the viewing room timing to go through to the nightbefore cell priest last meal torvald had all of that turning through his head as he paced clipboard and folder in hand towards larrys cell at a striking rather than conventionally goodlooking man with a shock of dark blond hair and green eyes inherited from a norwegian father who forty years back had decided to fish in the warmer waters of the gulf of mexico and pale mahogany skintone from an africanamerican mother when hed asked inmates why the nickname tdo the dark one theyd answered that he had the darkest skin you could imagine for a blondhaired man but torvald suspected it was because of his work not only as death custodian but also as one of the main guards in the prison hospice they thought he had a fascination with death not true torvald knew in his heart in fact quite the opposite he did it because he cared at times probably too much horror stories abounded of the old electric chair malfunctioning and halffrying prisoners before they finally died and with injections prisoners with so many track marks that the iv for the poison feed couldnt be inserted properly or the necessary medical checks werent made and they reacted badly their body contorting so wildly they had to be sat on by two or three guards not on his watch prisoners had been stripped of all dignity in life he was going to ensure it was at least there for them in death and with that same philosophy his work in the hospice had become a natural followon but the problem with all of that caring was that in the final hours by necessity torvald would find himself drawn closer to the prisoners then so quickly theyd be gone torvald had never quite got used to that wrench and the void it left though hed never complained to the prison psychiatrist at the biannual counselling sessions established to ensure prison guards continuing stability always feared that if he said anything that duty might be taken away from him to him the prisoners mental wellbeing in those final hours was more important than his own the guard on duty warrell let torvald through the last gate to durrants cellrow the clock on the wall behind read pm warrell then accompanied him for the final fifteen paces closeness caring the only problem with larry durrant was that over the past few years hed become something of a favourite of torvalds he held a soft spot for him aside from the extra closeness that by necessity the death process would bring it had only happened a couple of times before when hed allowed himself to get that close and both times it had ripped his heart out torvald closed his eyes for a second solemn acceptance as he nodded for warrell to open durrants cell door this wasnt going to be easy four or five hours ahead you reckon yeah but if ayliss got the flight i think he did we might have shaved some back he had a longer wait than me for the next flight there at the other end of the line the steady cadence of roches breathing measuring options though for once nelm found it strangely soothing like the gentle fall of surf he could easily drift off to it he hadnt slept much on the flight from vancouver and no doubt more fitful hours lay ahead he checked his watch thirtyfive minutes till boarding and getting a gun there no problem dollars talk loud down there within a halfhour ill have found a guy in a havana back street to sell me one along with his sister thrown in as part of the deal okay the breathing settling accepting but we might have to face that if this ayliss gets to truelle first he could break him before you even get there it might be time to put our contingency plans into play suppose so if they didnt play those cards now they never would which means you and i have each got a call to make dermingets apb announcement had gone out almost three hours after jac went through the checkout at new orleans airport the passport officer there paul styman had found his eye drawn to ayliss because of his crumpled cream suit and perspiring anxious appearance but hed have nevertheless quickly waved him through until that is he looked at his passport and flight destination seven years in mexico now heading to nassau styman decided to have his colleague check him against a list of suspected drug runners just in case nothing came up he waved ayliss through and an hour after that he handed over his shift but when he returned eight hours later within fifteen minutes he spotted the apb alert on screen when he leant over to check something else this is the guy we checked out early afternoon he said to his colleague still on from the earlier shift how long has this been through his partner shrugged five hours or so and didnt you recognize him his partner shrugged again he wasnt sure hed even looked at the man or the passport photo had probably just tapped in the name for a match and hed done eighteen or twenty name checks since styman looked at the contact details lieutenant derminget eighth district he called the number and explained what had happened nassau derminget confirmed eight or nine hours ago you say yeah but i remember it was a pretty roundabout route on the ticket stopoffs in atlanta and miami he might not have arrived yet thanks derminget called out to one of his team to get through to miami international while he phoned nassau both airports said that theyd get back directly with information derminget tapped his fingers anxiously against one thigh as he paced up and down a tight fouryard run waiting as the hours of the day had ticked by without anything happening no news or sightings of ayliss hed feared he was in for another long haul mcelroy somehow alerted and gone to ground again miami phoned back after nine minutes nassau after fourteen but with miami informing them that aylisss flight to nassau had left over three hours ago they knew that hed have probably long since passed through nassau customs they werent holding their breath when nassaus call came through yeah yeah derminget said almost disinterestedly pretty much what wed already guessed from the call we just had from miami derminget checked his watch not that large an island hed just have to get the bahamian police to try and track ayliss down but then we have him catching a later flight to havana with cubana airlines left not that long ago by the looks of it how long ago how long derminget realizing that he was practically shouting as half the squad room looked over the past week of mcelroy giving him the runaround with broughlan snapping at his heels had worn his nerves thin just over forty minutes ago and whats the flight time from nassau to cuba uuuh sound of keyboard tapping an hour and a half thanks fucking yes yes it looked like they were still in time to have ayliss stopped at havana customs derminget called across the squad room for someone who might have good spanish priest yeah as long as its father kennard and not that asshole chaplain foster i think that stephen king line the important thing is whether god believes in you went straight over his head torvald smiled as he got back to the rest of his checklist haveling holding his hand at the last minute no larry could get to god on his own thanks didnt need havelings help last meal beef poboy reminded him of his childhood and good ol days in the ninth family and friends to be present at the execution observing no none thats why my family came today fran and josh had trouble enough accepting his death let alone watching it and roddy and sal and the rest here ill say my goodbyes to tonight okay but before ten larry because thats when you have to go through to the nightbefore cell and if you want a shower last chance is tonight too theres a sink in tomorrows cell but no access back to the showers or anything else this side larry nodded pensively it was almost as if as soon as he went through that last gate at the end hed already died no access back to the rest of the world but perhaps that was just a natural continuance of his life for the past eleven years gradually diminishing as he was shuffled from one box to another access denied to family and friends love and life until there was only one box left torvald felt his chest tighten as he watched the emotions on larrys face another part of his duty as death custodian observe how the prisoner was coping with the situation last hours counsellor hed started the meeting with a shrug and an apology sorry about this larry few things to go through some of them maybe seeming stupid they knew each other too well to try and hide behind bullshit or formality but you know its gotta be done thats okay tor glad its you rather than some of those other oafs out there oafs torvald shared with larry the guards hed nominated for the execution team larry appreciative that hed been careful to avoid any of batesons clique thanks but from then on torvald had gone through the rest of his checklist mechanically to help shield his emotions and he noticed too that larry answered quickly offhand even when talking about his family visiting who he hadnt seen for a while and he wondered whether larry too was trying to distance himself from what was happening and was treating him coolly because despite their past closeness larry now saw torvald as part of the machinery of his death but it wasnt that it wasnt that at all because as much as larry knew how the life had been crushed out of him these past long years so that now there was only a faint vestige left hed also seen it crushing his wife and son that day the years for it to take its toll on him hed seen oppressing them in only a few minutes as they faced what was happening to him the next day that terrible weight slumping their shoulders and at the last second as they realized he might see the last hope dying in their eyes they made sure to avert them wouldnt look at him directly and he could see it happening now too with torvald engelson this guard who hed exchanged more thoughts with than any other guard over the years had recommended books on norse and viking history and beowulf when hed wanted to learn about his norwegian roots and fifteen months back had shared with him how hed coped with his mother dying when torvald lost his father could hardly look him in the eye any more his shoulders slumped too with what was about to happen to larry even though as death custodian that process should have long ago stopped fazing him but larry didnt couldnt blame them he blamed the system the deathpenalty machinery that crushed relentlessly all in its path in murder cases premeditation was a vital factor larry should know more than most because it was one thing argued as missing in his own case to try and spare him the death penalty the final element that transformed random violence to callous calculation if a murderer admitted in court that theyd told their victim they were going to kill them at a specific time on a certain day then left them in a cell to contemplate their impending death the jury would consider it one of the most chilling calculating murder accounts theyd ever heard and the victim unwilling to accept their fate would scream and claw at the cell walls the family too if told of that impending fate would wail and scream and protest but prisoners on deathrow didnt their shoulders simply slumped the light of hope faded from their eyes and they accepted because it was the system the weight of it pressing inch by inch down on them accept accept accept until they caved in totally in defeat no hope left for them to cling to and as ten minutes later torvald finished his briefing and the cell door slammed back behind him larry had never felt so cold and alone the impact jarring icily through him making him shiver his eyes filled a single tear rolling out that too feeling lonely and cold as it trickled down one cheek alone at the last minute torvald had reached out and touched larrys arm if theres anything you need over these next hours larry just ask and at that second he did finally meet larrys eye and larry saw what hed suspected that last light of hope had gone from them because as much as at times hed given up on himself thered always been that light and hope and warmth from others he could see it in their eyes and now that was finally gone there was nothing left no hope nothing left to save him within three hours bob stratton had a list of likely mo mugshots for the street grandauto theft of twelve years ago and an hour and a half after that had received an update with current mugshots of those still active now sixteen photos but only five looked like they might have a chance of matching the partial camshots and the description ayliss had given him stratton looked at his watch pm if he was quick and downtown traffic was kind he just might be able to get them in front of the staff at the internet cafe before they closed at pm he got there with four minutes to spare but there was some calling out as to who might have been working the day in question before a light bulb of recognition came on in the eyes of a blondewithagreenstripe wiping down the espresso machine tracy yeah yeah i remember tracy said lawyer guy that phoned in a panic and ran in a couple of weeks back just missed the guy gave him a camvideo to take away thats the one stratton had decided to show her all sixteen mugshots in sets of four at a time and laid the cam photos to one side as a reminder now out of these anyone that looks like the guy that was here that day one photo in set two though she couldnt be sure but then she twisted her mouth in the same way over another photo in set three uuuh again i cant be a hundred per cent sure stratton put the two photos side by side strongest bet if you were forced to choose she pointed to one but then seconds later became unsure and her finger wavered over the other im sorry on this one his hair just isnt right too wild too much of an afro but the rest hmmm maybe his hairs changed since this photo tracy tilted her head as if to get a better angle if they were both smiling id know for sure whys that hes got a big gap between his front teeth stratton could just imagine how that advice would go down with police departments ensuring theres no smiling on mugshots might make perps look more severe and menacing more like criminals but you miss out on valuable dental recognition stratton nodded with a noteeth smile in the end not enough to choose between them hed just have to chase up both thanks and as soon as stratton got back in his car he called his contact again jack harris of fourth district and got addresses for both names last known for roland cole is midcity and steve thelwood along the coast at long beach stratton wrote down the addresses great thanks jack then he tried aylisss number to bring him up to date but it didnt answer still planehopping no doubt when he got to the address in midcity roland cole wasnt there and the new apartment tenant didnt know of his whereabouts i been here seven months now and youre not the first person called askin for him a biggiesmall lookalike in jogging pants and a vest informed him easy to see now why he left no forwardin stratton headed along the coast to long beach there were times when headguard glenn bateson liked to stamp his authority on libreville that sense of power over the life and death of its inmates would hit him strongly make his head almost swim with it and hed in turn mark his presence by making his bootstep heavier more purposeful along its corridors he could practically feel that step shuddering through prisoners from thirty or forty paces away getting more intense with each stride so that when he finally came alongside their cells they could barely look at him a scant fearful glance that said im not really here you didnt see me he felt that way now that sense of power over life and death stronger than he could remember in a long while as he paced towards the cell of tally shavell but his step wasnt heavy now in fact it was far lighter than normal because he didnt want to bring attention to where he was heading no scant or uneasy look as shavell greeted him those cold soulless dark eyes stayed on him steadily unwavering equal ground equal control over life and death at libreville the only emotion shavell showed was the faint lifting of one eyebrow as bateson explained what he wanted i know bateson thought he hadnt heard right at first and had asked nelm to repeat himself above the background activity and voices somewhere busy hit me as strange too given the timing shavell kept the eyebrow raised and for doin this good deed thirty grand in cash to a named account or translated into disposable goods in here bateson smiled crookedly he was on the same and theyd probably each make another thirty big ones from the pills or powder sold on if you know what i mean shavells eyes shifted from bateson as he started planning things out in his mind with no acknowledgement as bateson left his cell when the call came through to havanas jose marti airport it was taken first of all by a young officer named ruiz quickly realizing that he was out of his depth he handed over to his captain sebastian moragues whod started looking over inquisitively as hed repeated segments for clarification new orleans suspected false identity cubana flight from nassau moragues inquisitive frown deepened as the request was repeated so let me get this clear this mr ayliss arriving soon you suspect that it might be someone else posing as him false identity yes thats right and do you have an official arrest warrant your end for that brief pause conferring the other end no no we dont its just a suspicion at this stage though a very strong one and based just on this suspicion you want us to stop and detain him moragues was old school castro and for them the unwritten rule book was clear no favours for americans because theyve done none for us the past forty years so unless it posed a threat to cuban national security or involved drugtrafficking which cuba was keen to keep itself free of moragues was going to take a lot of convincing and with not even the right paperwork in place their end madre de putas heavier conferring at the other end moragues shaking his head with a wry smile towards ruiz americanos in new orleans derminget had become increasingly frustrated with the threeway conversation a young sergeant tony salva had stepped up to the plate for the call his family had left puerto rico when he was fifteen and his spanish hed explained to derminget was still seventy per cent there you tell that stiffhead in cuba derminget barked at salva one hand stabbing for emphasis that the guy we believe is posing as ayliss is actually wanted for murder and that we do have a fucking warrant for i see murder that is more serious moragues commented as the translation came over his smile still there from hearing dermingets agitation in the background but this suspected connection between these two men have you taken that before a judge with some sort of proof to get an arrest warrant heavier background shouting from the other end almost screaming at one point moragues held the receiver a few inches away from his ear shrugging towards ruiz before he brought it back again for the translation no we havent got that particular warrant yet then i would kindly suggest that when you do have that that would be the time to be troubling us here in havana otherwise we could both find ourselves in an unfortunate mess if it turns out to be a false detention not good for tourism complaints about foreign nationals being unnecessarily detained at havana airport the background commotion hit fever pitch this time with a fair few expletives the only words in fact that moragues understood his smile widened he couldnt wait for the translation my my boss hears what you say but hes still insistent that you stop mr ayliss when he arrives at havana airport in half an hours time in fact as one recognized police authority to another he demands it he does now does he moragues gently licked his top lip well you tell your jefe from me that he can take his demand and along with the trade embargoes of the past forty years and the exploding cigar the cia sent to our dear fidel stick it in his culo at the other end dermingets nerves had all but snapped and as he saw salvas face redden as he listened to something more lengthy he started screaming whats he saying whats he fucking saying salva looked up finally as he reached to put the phone down he says he doesnt think he can help last shower last time hed feel water against his body it felt strange unreal the same as it did accepting that seeing fran and josh earlier that day had been for the last time and tomorrow last meal last time food would touch his lips then even though hed had eleven long years to get used to it happening now the time was finally here it felt odd surreal and so now the only way he could accept it was to numb himself to it switch off a part of himself like one of those machines or computers on sleepmode brain halfswitched off body soul but as part of him switched off another suddenly became more attuned he could hear things in the prison he hadnt heard before beyond the steady background thrum of its boilers a faint clicking as pipes contracted distant voices through the ceiling grill echoing along the ventilation shaft from guards or prisoners talking and earlier that night a steady breeze rustling through the trees outside and as it drifted a certain way some music carrying on it hed been told that the protestors beyond the gates were playing music but hadnt heard it until that moment and now as he felt the water running down his skin memories that he thought had long ago faded bathing joshua as a baby feeling the water slide like velvet against his soft skin joshs eyes bright and dancing as he looked back up at him giggling fran and himself on the beach one day when theyd gone along the coast to gulfport the year before josh was born fran splashing him as she ran in the shallows and he splashing her back her looking so brighteyed and beautiful so beautiful the images now so real that he fancied he could still taste the salt in the water as some of it splashed on his face before realizing that it was his own tears as theyd touched his lips i was only dreaming hed faded out the foreground there was just the background left maybe what he should have done all along in libreville faded out the heavy clump of the guards boots along the walkways their shouts and taunts the nighttime weeping of other prisoners the cacophony of voices now in the showers faded it all out until there was nothing left but him and fran and josh together again smiling and hugging each other as if the eleven years in between hadnt really happened just a dream larry jolted sharply as if he had suddenly awoken cacophony of voices they had faded it wasnt just in his head it was suddenly quieter in the showers roddy larry leapt out and looked towards roddy since the attack three weeks back hed made sure to shower at the same time as roddy every night hed said his last goodbyes to sal roddy bc and theo just before then had headed to the showers with roddy last night of protection bc saying hed cover roddys back as best he could after larry was gone and so larry was slightly confused as he saw tally shavell emerge through the steam with jayt moving in a few paces behind himself and silass to one side why didnt they just wait a day when roddy would be more vulnerable then as he saw the focus and intent in their eyes and their angle of movement he realized that they were moving in on himself though it didnt compute quickly enough given the odd timing jayt taking the last two steps to grip him from behind as the shiv appeared in tallys hand and he lunged for larry larry swung back in reflex with an elbow at jayt twisting his body away at the same time he managed to shift his abdomen eight inches but still the shiv caught him on one side slicing through the soft flesh just above his hipbone tally pulled back and thrust swiftly again for midstomach but larrys second elbow swing caught jayt directly in the windpipe and he managed to jerk free and completely sidestep tallys second lunge as jayt fell away choking tally went then for a scything sweep larry jumping back clear of it and shifting round so that silass couldnt get to him easily would have had to move through tallys path roddy had sidled around the back of them and now seeing that larry was more in control darted off to alert the guards tallys eyes gleamed wildly his breath falling short larry had the measure of him now and he could see from tallys eyes that a part of him knew it too though still fighting against it through a fireball mist of adrenalin and hatred and as tally lunged again larry sidestepped easily and gripped his knifearm snapping it at the joint against his thigh larry snatched the shiv and had tally twisted around in a forearm neck grip the shiv blade tight at his throat before silass could move in he backed away a step and pressed the blade hard against tallys skin drawing a teardrop of blood silass and jayt glared back challengingly but held back flurry of bootsteps in the background warrell and another two guards appearing roddy just behind them warrell held one hand up towards him dont do it larry why not im dying tomorrow ive got fuckall to lose the alarm bell started jangling then more guards starting to appear behind warrell because warrell was lost for a second for an answer because whats the point larry glared back defiantly the point is getting rid of this slimy fuck once and for all after ive gone tomorrow how long do you think roddys going to last with tally still alive he jabbed the shiv tighter against tallys neck drawing another teardrop of blood id be doing not only roddy a favour but everyone else around here one last good deed before i go with that busted arm hes not going to be able to do much for a while in any case warrell said hes still got one good arm and impulse reaction larry jammed the shiv into tallys good arm by his biceps grinding it around and feeling it tear through muscle tally roaring with the pain then as silass and one of the guards moved half a step closer he pulled it out and put it tight again to tallys throat at that moment he could think of nothing better than slitting tallys throat rid libreville of him once and for all but then as if reading his thoughts a voice came from the back of the circle of guards this aint you larry dont do it youre not a killer torvald engelson larrys eyes fixed on torvald as he came to the forefront to stand by warrell dont pride yourself tor you dont know me that well and thats not what the state of louisiana and the judge said torvald closed his eyes for a second in submission i didnt know you then larry so i cant say what happened but i think i know you well enough now youre not a killer and if you do this now you might not get where you want to tomorrow torvald closed his eyes again fleetingly hating himself for playing the religious card now on larry but not knowing what else to do like you said to me the other day a question of whether god believes in you larry whether hes going to accept and understand if you do this now larry felt himself split like never before in that instant between what his gut and instinct told him was right and his heart and conscience said was wrong larry felt himself start shaking his eyes filling as he thought again of the warm reverie of only minutes ago and him standing here now cold and shivering blood streaming down him as he held a shiv to another mans throat i dont know what to think any more tor long ago given up on whats right and wrong in here i but his body language said then what his words were unable to finish his grip weakened on tallys neck sensing his indecision the guards moved in and as the last of larrys resolve went and the shiv slipped from his grasp and fell to the floor they grabbed him and carried him away larry nodding towards torvald with tightlipped acceptance larry not even sure whether it was in thanks or simply acknowledgement that torvald knew him better than most killer not killer twelve long years larry had been asking himself that same question along with a few other people that had got to know him along the way and still now in his final hours the question was being asked alaysha found that whenever she was back at her own apartment or jacs next door every small sound on the corridor outside made the hairs stand up on the back of her neck for that reason shed spent as much time as she could at her mothers place and when she did need to be back home would grab what she needed from her own apartment then go quickly next door to jacs with molly some nights without when she was working and needed an hour or so to get ready at her own place molly already dropped off with alayshas mom the first night shed done that shed spent half an hour sorting out her clothes and putting on makeup at her own place but then a sound outside on the corridor had made her skin bristle when she looked through the spyhole it was nothing visitors to another apartment three doors down but it suddenly made her more aware of what would have happened if it had been something she moved her main clothes and her makeup bag permanently next door to jacs secrets she hadnt told her mother about robbing malastra didnt want her to shoulder any burden or guilt over what the money had been for it was for your dialysis and treatment mom i know it might have been foolish but were talking about your life here the only person that knew was jac and he wasnt here for her to talk to any more tell him that with each passing hour her nerves were mounting jumping out of her skin at the smallest sound outside shed been hoping to see him the next night but there was a message on her answerphone when shed grabbed a couple of things before coming to his place to do her makeup for work alaysha adam here i cant make our meeting tomorrow night im afraid ive had to leave the country unexpectedly in fact im on my way right now something to do with that big deal i mentioned ill call you as soon as i get back adam the name hed chosen his fathers in case the police were listening in on her line jac changing his accent yet again from his own or aylisss big deal durrant a lot of echoing and noise in the background sounded as if he was actually phoning from the airport theyd arranged to meet at nine oclock three hours after durrants scheduled execution it would all be over by then jac would have been able to share with her how everything had gone one way or the other tears on her shoulder or cracking a bottle of champagne together alaysha focused in the mirror as she started applying her eyeliner some life they were living her boyfriend like a chameleon on the run for murder and her sneaking around from one place to another anywhere but her nerves suddenly leapt her eyeliner pencil doglegging off a quarterinch as she heard her doorbell ring next door she hadnt even heard anyone come along the corridor she padded silently in her stockingfeet to the door looking to the side through the spyhole a messenger fedex complete with buff uniform he rang the bell again and at that moment mrs orwins door opened behind him he pointed to alayshas door saying something about special delivery though alaysha couldnt see a package in his hand and then her heart froze as mrs orwins bony finger lifted and pointed to jacs apartment shed noticed mrs orwin peering out a couple of times the night before as shed gone between one apartment and the other perhaps eager to alert the police in case that killer mcelroy returned and obviously shed done the same tonight the messenger nodded his thanks and approached jacs door alaysha shrinking back a step as the doorbell rang her heart beating hard and fast memories of that black kid with a message gerry at her door a second later the gunshot jac running through the night from the police she swallowed hard but that was a street boy this is a recognized messenger in a uniform get a grip he rang the bell again then four seconds later knocked alaysha moved forward again risking another glance through the spyhole the messenger looking down at his feet for a second mrs orwin still behind him frowning slightly an im sure she was there expression on her face then finally deciding hed waited long enough he wrote something on a card and slipped it through the letter box and as alaysha saw it come through saw the official fedex logo on its top she thought it must be real maybe even an urgent message from jac and what could possibly happen with mrs orwin still looking on she quickly slid back the latch and opened the door caught the messenger as he was only a pace away he turned back and smiled mrs reyner yes alaysha watched mrs orwin pull back behind her door close it again and of all the times shed found her neighbours spying annoying now she felt like screaming no no stay here looking until at least this messenger has gone be as nosy as you fucking like alaysha reyner yes i have something for you and as the messenger reached his hand toward her and she saw what he held her breath caught in her throat and she knew then that shed made a mistake opening the door a big mistake as larry durrants death approached its tentacles reached out like an octopus thered been a steady build up over the past weeks but now in the last twentyfour hours those tentacles carrying news of his fate spread deeper and wider than ever before the nightbefore vigil was on every news channel there were evening debates pro and con deathpenalty more again on breakfast tv durrants last meal how hed spend his last minutes medical details of how hed be executed background to the recentlyfailed clemency plea to the governor details of the murder twelve years ago drama with his last lawyer his new lawyer darrell ayliss apparently no longer available for comment louisiana and half the states beyond who knew little about larry durrants life got to know every last detail of his impending death as if they were a modernday roman amphitheatre crowd bloodlust hungry for it those tentacles reached people they never had before and some felt deeply touched and saddened by larry durrants plight became more antideathpenalty while others simply munched their popcorn faster come on get on with it give it to the fucker but those tentacles gripped tightest around those who knew larry durrant francine durrant changed channels or turned off the tv every time it came on couldnt watch it any more mike coultaine found himself tapping his fingers anxiously on tables and counter tops increasingly looking towards the phone praying that jac had managed to run the gauntlet through customs and would be in cuba by now that any minute the phone would ring with good news and mack elliott stared absently out of the window at hennys on to a bright winters day street bustling with life as he bit into a debris poboy and tried desperately to remember what hed seen on tv twelve years ago and as those news broadcasts talked more and more about time time of last meal time for the final medical examination time durrant would walk to the death chamber time of execution those tentacles pulled everyones eyes repeatedly to the clock half the state two million people or more watching the hours and minutes tick down to his death roland cole was no exception over the past two hours his eyes had lifted twenty times or more to the clock in the algiers fish warehouse where he and a colleague were busily shifting that days shipments onto the right pallets whats wrong wit you the colleague said yo got a hot date tonight or somethin cant wait to leave today no its not that coles hand went to his stomach where his mounting anxiety had settled like a bucket of eels writhing in acid somethin i ate last night its half killing me with a meek smile he rushed to the washroom at the back again his fourth visit that morning you timin to make sure you don shit yoself his friend shouted after him chuckling cole closed his eyes and shuddered as he sat on the toilet stealing away the time alone was the main thing time alone with his own thoughts but most of all away from tv news broadcasts and clocks durrants face had been on news broadcasts twice the night before but even though cole had made sure not to turn on breakfast news and had rushed past every newsstand on the way in that image was still with him practically everywhere he looked around the warehouse at his friend at the clock not me not me not me im not the man you saw that night a thousand times hed replayed that night in his head hotwiring the mercedes in the driveway as he saw a man run round the corner from coliseum street sixfoot stocky skincolour and tone not much different to his own breathless and jaded as he stared back momentarily cole sunk down even lower beneath the dashboard praying that he hadnt been seen and four minutes later when he was sure the guy was longgone he started up the mercedes and drove off then when durrant was first arrested he saw from the news that it wasnt the man hed seen that night he read as much as he could about the background to the case but there was no possible doubt the other eyewitness had only seen one man leaving the scene and the timing matched exactly with the guy hed seen run past it wasnt durrant but the problem was he couldnt see a way of coming forward without also holding his hands up to the grandtheft auto five to seven years maybe more if they linked the mo back to other luxury autothefts over the past few years cole managed finally to push it to the back of his mind but then when durrants execution date was set it was back at the forefront with a vengeance and so he sent the emails as far as he felt he could go without putting his own head in the noose cole shook his head a shiver running through him as he felt his stomach cramp and tighten again surely they couldnt go through with killing durrant hed told them in those emails that it wasnt him what the fuck more did they want five to seven years of his own life atlanta customs miami nassau havana a rerun each time of jacs ordeal going through the passport check at new orleans perspiring his stomach doing somersaults praying that they didnt notice his hand shaking as he handed over his passport but it was worse after the call from mike coultaine far worse jac had landed at atlanta an hour and fifty minutes beforehand had just twenty minutes before boarding for the next leg to miami when coultaines call came through bad news jac bad news coultaine explained that while he believed hed successfully quelled the suspicions of the officer that had called he thought it worth keeping an eye on just in case and so hed called an old police contact who owed him a few favours said that hed just had a strange call from a certain joe rayleigh of eighth district regarding darrell ayliss an old lawyer buddy of his probably nothing but could he contact him on the qt if anything came up on police radar about it and he just called a few minutes ago jac theres an apb been put out for ayliss carrying false identity false impersonation and fraud oh jesus jac closed his eyes momentarily glad that he was sitting when the news came but whats odd is the approach with caution note bit extreme for the crimes mentioned until that is my friend told me the contact name on the apb lieutenant derminget and it all suddenly fell into place and made sense jac only halfheard coultaine go on to say that it looked like derminget had somehow worked it all out mcelroy ayliss the disguise dont know how but he obviously has the echoing terminal activity and pounding pulse in jacs head halfdrowned it out that pounding heavier still legs shaky and uncertain as fifteen minutes later he rose to go through passport control and then that same ordeal at miami nassau and finally havana not knowing how he managed to face each one feeling almost physically sick after passing through each time his nerves mounting again in flight as he steeled himself to face the next one so by the time he went through the last checkout at havana he was exhausted emotionally drained part of him felt like jumping in the air or doing a quick fandango in relief and excitement but his body had hardly the strength left to put one foot in front of the other his step heavy laboured eyes bleary and unfocused from lack of sleep as he headed away from customs before the guards no doubt with their eyes still on his back changed their minds and sought the carrental desks closed jac shuffled over to the cafe area at the end one of the few things open and on the second try found a waiter with good enough english they open at seven oclock senor jac looked at the clock on the cafe wall am his friendly waiter said there wouldnt be other carrental companies open yet in the city most in fact wouldnt open until am and the train to sancti spiritus took eight and a half hours with already fourteen hours eaten up getting to cuba jac hated to lose even one more minute of what little time durrant had left but with little other option he ordered a coffee and waited meanwhile checking his phone messages hed switched his cellphone off immediately after coultaines call and hadnt used it since worried that with the apb out the police might be able to zonetrack where he was he risked turning it on now briefly only one call bob stratton new orleans was one hour behind am hed call him back in a couple of hours jac finished his coffee and ordered another his body suddenly craving more caffeine to combat his overtiredness kick some life back into it realizing as he finally got on the road at am squinting at roadsigns as he sped across a dawnlit havana that hed have risked falling asleep on the drive without the caffeine and having chosen the carrental companys most powerful option an audi a hoping that he could make up the time the caffeine didnt help his already wiretaut nerves his stomach jittery and his hands trembling on the steering wheel but at least he was alert cienfuegos trinidad sancti spiritus jacs route was by now indelibly implanted on his mind as jac swung on to highway a and he saw the first sign for cienfuegos he put his foot down hard six and a half hours driving time they said maybe he could cut that to six or even five and a half hours the carrental companies were already open when nelm landed but he lost time through having to buy a gun in havanas old town an old browning mm before he could get on the road again he was just under four hours behind ayliss as he hit the start of the a highway towards cienfuegos with the call from glenn bateson while he was at miami international waiting for his flight to nassau it didnt work my guy only managed to injure him and not that seriously everything hinged more than ever on catching up with truelle as soon as possible if batesons man had been successful it would have stopped ayliss dead in his tracks hed have probably just slumped his head on his steering wheel in the middle of cuba as soon as he heard the news with durrant already dead what would have been the point in continuing but right now truelle was like a powderkeg and if ayliss had enough time to light the right match nelm had little doubt that hed explode and tell all and if so nelm doubted that roches one remaining contingency plan could contain that explosion he glanced at the gun on his passenger seat as so often had happened in his long association with roche while roche troubled himself with fringe details the core of every problem was left for him to deal with just as with roches wife twelve years ago that had started it all nothing had really changed mack elliott had drifted out of the ninth ward into bywater because there was a bar on north rampart that had one of the largest screens around always tuned to sports usually football hed missed the big saints game the night before but there was an early afternoon highlights rerun that he knew theyd have on and thats where he was cold becks in hand watching the over sized screen among a lively throng shouting support or derision with the ebb and flow of the saints performance when the thought suddenly hit him highlights thats what hed been watching that night it hadnt been a full game because the saints had been playing away in philadelphia and there was some charity telethon on but hed been keen to watch the condensed highlights when theyd come on later thats why hed told the chicken guy to pipedown mack left his halffinished beer on the counter went out the back to a payphone got the number of the timespicayune from and asked to be put through do you have a sporting archives section perhaps weve got a general archives section sir which would include sport they should be able to help the girl that looked up the information used a keyword search on the timespicayune databank but she could just as easily have found it on the internet here it is saints v philadelphia eagles game eighteenth of february thanks mack banged a fist on the wall by the phone closing his eyes for a second it was that same night larry couldnt have been at the roche house he took the piece of paper from his pocket darrell aylisss number and dialled but it rang unobtainable a service provider message telling him to try again later he tried again just in case but it did the same he started to panic beads of sweat popping on his forehead as he checked the time less than four hours left he had to get the message through somehow he got hold of again and asked to be put through to libreville prison but the woman that answered said that warden haveling wasnt available because of final preparations that day with lawrence durrant and his assistant mr folley is right now handling a media conference call regarding the same but i its actually about larry durrant that im phonin now yes sir and i i have someone that i believe can still help some topdog guard or other mack didnt catch the name but when after the transfer his voice answered mack ran too quickly at first had to calm himself to get the information across clearly mack elliott bayou brew bar of twelve years ago with larry durrant sessions with darrell ayliss and greg ormdern to try and find out what happened that night but i wasnt able to remember what i was watchin until just now and i just checked it out a minute ago with the timespicayune that game was the same night that larry durrant was meana be at the roche house he couldnt have been there it wasnt him i understand sir and im glad youve come through to us now with this information you gotta stop the execution larry didnt do it get hold of the warden or governor or whatever it takes to stop it mack realized he was speaking too excitably again almost garbling he took a fresh breath to calm himself his voice lower more purposeful youll make sure tdo that get hold of the powers that be to stop this now wit larry dont worry as soon as i get off the phone ill pass your message directly to warden haveling get him to phone the governor or whatever he needs to do to action it thanks and thank god too that i remembered before it was too late yeah thank god you did and as soon as he hung up his end glenn bateson screwed up the piece of paper hed written on and threw it in the bin a yard away good to speak to you governor candaret been a while you too mr roche always good to speak to the more illustrious among my constituents especially if they still support and vote for me oh i do governor candaret i do more than you can imagine thats good to hear both of them were old hats at this thought candaret both of them knowing that these smooth introductory gambits often meant almost the opposite of what was said from the heart roche would have been more likely to say youre a slimy jumpedup toad whose station in life has risen far above your godgiven ability and in truth candaret would probably have said much the same about roche but that would have got neither of them what they wanted from this conversation now which brought candaret sharply back to wondering what roche did want by calling him now the very day of larry durrants execution he kept prodding with the niceties as if he was keeping a rattlesnake at bay with a long stick good indeed to hear and what pray might i be able to do for you today mr roche or is this just a social call the latter mostly though if id called earlier it might have seemed otherwise roche swallowed getting his breathing even getting the right words in place you see if id called you before you made your recent clemency decision it might have looked as if i was trying to pressure you to do the right thing regarding the murderer of my dear wife but now that youve actually made that decision i felt it only right to thank you for what i consider to be a good and true decision and not shirking from your duty making this call now when theres no longer danger of it being misread it can finally be taken in the spirit its intended no more no less than an honest thank you i i appreciate the sentiment and thank you too for not earlier bringing any undue pressure to bear that was very thoughtful still prodding though more gently now maybe roche wasnt as bad as he thought maybe a heart did actually beat beneath that stonedwarf shell and indeed theres another reason partly tied into that why i didnt call until now oh i wondered if the names amberley cleveton rossville and leighgrove strike a bell with you yes i i seem to remember a couple of them from my campaign fund list candaret felt the first nervous twinge in his stomach at where this might be heading hed recognized the names far more than hed made out four corporations that between them comprised almost half his presidential campaign fund for the following year obviously ive had to go to some lengths to shield my name from being behind those corporations for two reasons firstly the regulatory issues and awkward questions raised by too much funding coming from one source and secondly because of what ive already mentioned you might have felt i was putting inadvertent pressure on you to make the right decision regarding my wifes murderer i i understand though candaret wasnt sure any more that he did he felt that twinge in his stomach bite deeper as he thought about what would happen if a journalist or senate committee now uncovered the source of his funding but again if roche was now raising it as some sort of background threat or pressure why hadnt he done that earlier and thats also why i didnt tell you about my involvement in that funding until now so that you wouldnt misread it and see it as somehow connected with durrant feel unduly pressured you could accept it with the good and honest grace with which it is intended you have a good friend out there who would like nothing more than to see you in the white house why why thank you i i dont know what to say the first truth to pass candarets lips since theyd started talking he didnt his thoughts were still in turmoil with roches revelation in particular the timing and after a minute more of mutual fawning and treacly niceties as they said their goodbyes in contrast to candarets still bemused expression as he hung up roche beamed broadly hed got exactly what he wanted from the conversation even if ayliss did manage to crack truelle and phoned at the eleventh hour it was going to take a hell of a lot now to convince candaret kiss goodbye to the white house and a truckload of regulatory problems one side an elaborate hardtobelieve story the other no contest dont pick up any hitchhikers watch out for potholes streetlighting is poor or nonexistent and theres a lack of signposts particularly beyond havana it was the same road all the way but at a couple of angled junctions where the continuation was ambiguous carrental cautions one and four became at odds because as soon as jac stopped to clarify directions he was asked for a lift with only one in thirty owning a car and infrequent buses it seemed that half of cuba was waiting at streetcorners and junctions for the next passing car to catch a lift pardone no possible problema urgente one hand lifted apologetically as he sped away and at the one stop he made thirty kilometres before cienfuegos to use the toilet and for a hastily grabbed coffee coke and ham roll two dusty workmen looking for a lift took a step back when he had to be more insistent shouting at them that a man could die unless he hurried his bastardized spanish scream of muerte muerte making them worry for a second that he was threatening to kill them when hed earlier tried bob stratton twice at ten minute intervals and there was no signal or dialling tone on his cellphone he realized that there were patches of poor reception on the open road he finally got hold of him as he approached cienfuegos but it was mixed news while stratton had managed to get the internet cafe girl to pick out two possibles one wasnt at his last known address and the other as soon as he opened his door in long beach stratton knew wasnt the same man as on the internet cam so the only option left is to try and track down the first guy gone awol from his last known roland cole if i can find a credit card linked to coles last address then trace it to a new address i might get lucky but you know with only the few hours we got left now i know crystal clear tall order dont hold your breath phone me if you get a break or ill phone you im suffering some connectivity problems here palms sugarcane towering tobacco plants with fronds as high as twostorey houses the scenery was spectacular but most of it sped by in a patchwork blur as jacs speedo needle crept over kph on every clear flat stretch where he could get away with it one eye peeled for traffic police but as the miles rolled by jac felt the waves of tiredness come back as if the caffeine could only keep him going for so long his hands shaking increasingly on the steering wheel combined with the highspeed vibrations of the car on the often rough road surface starting to set off tremors through his entire body that shaking along with the wild adrenalin rush of the past days and hours all that was keeping him going and when that feverpitch hit overload and he finally burnt out the rest would come crashing back in the tension the lack of sleep the emotional drain the dogtired exhaustion mental and physical the feeling at times that he could hardly make it another yard let alone hundreds of miles and as the caffeine and his bodys nervous tension lost its last grip hed fall asleep the snap of a finger blink of an eye as he sped along twice already hed pulled himself sharply back awake a shudder running through him as he realized that sleep had grabbed him for a second maybe two and as it mugged him for a third time fortyfive kilometres before trinidad he was suddenly reminded of caution two potholes with a bang as jacs eyes snapped sharply open he thought for a second that hed swerved into a ditch or sideshoulder but then he saw the truck coming straight towards him the pothole had jolted him into the oncoming lane jac swung sharply back again braking the truck also braking then and missing him by only a couple of yards its horn blaring hard as it swept past jac kept going the truck had slowed to almost a stop as jac looked in his mirror and a mile further on when it was safely out of sight he pulled over closing his eyes as he waited for his wild trembling to settle madness madness but it was hardly any better after almost two minutes of slow deep breaths and jac feared that if he kept his eyes closed any longer he might fall asleep and so he pulled out again turned the radio up loud so that hopefully perez prado and benny more could keep him awake grabbed a coffee at the first stop seven kilometres up the road then stopped again k beyond trinidad for another to keep him going fuelled by that mix of caffeine mamborhythms and adrenalinstaved exhaustion his eyes redrimmed nerves ragged he finally ran up the steps of the sancti spiritus post office at pm the man he approached at the counter ahead had limited english but when jac showed him the mailbox number he pointed to a side counter amparo she do correos apartados thankfully amparos english was far better but as jac explained what he wanted she started to frown im sorry senor im not allowed to give out the addresses of people holding boxes apartados its against regulations but please this is very important im an american lawyer jac slid aylisss card across the counter and a mans life depends on this information its vital that i locate the holder of this mailbox urgently i understand senor but it really is difficult impossible for me to give that information amparo inclined her head in apology as she said it a striking woman in her late forties with soft brown eyes and the first tinge of salt in her black hair jac could imagine that twenty years ago shed been stunning plan two but as jac turned his palm on the counter to reveal two fiftydollar bills he knew instantly it was a mistake her eyes hardened again she looked genuinely offended that that wont do any good the regulations are very strict this time as she said it her eyes glanced to one side as if unseen eyes might be watching them jac closed his eyes for a second oh god for it all to end here with softeyed hardeyed amparo there is one thing i could suggest amparo said a more hopeful tone as she flicked a page in a leatherbound register to one side i notice theres a package arrived for that apartado today which means the postman will put a notification through their door tomorrow if you want to leave a message here i can make sure they get it when they pick up the package in a day or two thatll be too late jac said with a heavy sigh his eyes closing fleetingly again plan three he could still feel all the bubbling tension of the long drive and his hand shook heavily as he unfolded the newspaper clipping from his pocket and spread it before her you see this man here larry durrant hes going to die tonight at six oclock unless i can speak first to the man who has this mailbox jac prodded the article with one finger his voice rising you see the day for him dying here la fecha its today and that thats me mentioned there darrell ayliss jac took aylisss passport out and turned it towards her as if her doubting him might be part of the problem you see now why its vital i contact this man and why i i dont have much time left because after six oclock tonight itll be be too the emotions suddenly rose in jacs throat choked off the rest of his words he hadnt planned this part of it even though as the tears welled in his eyes and started running down his cheeks his breaking down had softened amparo more than anything else so far she looked close to relenting as hed mentioned time and looked towards the clock hed suddenly had an image of larry looking at the clock by the death chamber at that moment wondering what had happened to him whether jac was just another in a long line of people to desert him let him down until now in his dying hours there was finally nobody left forty hours since hed last spoken to larry when hed told him he was chasing down some final vital leads and now im sorry senor so sorry amparo reached one hand across the counter to touch his arm if i could help i truly would and looking back at amparo at that moment her eyes glistening with emotion he believed her she would if she could thats okay i i understand and embarrassed by his tears and worried that if he stayed a second longer hed break down completely jac turned and walked away his step echoing emptily on the marble floor of the correos footsteps through libreville larrys last steps towards the death chamber with now nothing left to stop him dying he should have turned his back and walked away on day one left larry as he was then at peace and ready to go to his god instead of filling his head with false hope and empty promises the tears streamed down jacs face as he walked away his shoulders slumping more with each step all over all over apart from strattons snowball in hell more false hope nothing left to do jac wiped at his tears with the back of one hand and the catharsis already half spent as he reached the steps of the sanctispiritus correos and took a fresh breath of the air outside all that was left was to take a leaf out of his fathers book look to the bright side consoling himself that hed done everything he could everything far far more than anyone else would have and now at least hed be able to sleep no doubt for three days solid find a small local hotel and the touch against his arm made him jump amparo she handed him a piece of paper still glancing around for those unseen eyes this is the holder of that apartado on the coast near tunas de zaza jac looked at it brent calbrey villa delarcos how far forty fortyfive minutes drive six kilometres from punto ladrillo heading to san pedro you cant miss it big white villa with four or five holiday casitas in its grounds what had changed amparos mind the tears and his deflated slump as hed walked away or being able to give him the message away from prying eyes jac didnt know and at that moment he didnt care he leant over giving her a big hug amparo youre beautiful guapa guapa amparo smiled awkwardly a couple of people approaching the correos also smiling probably thinking they were two long lost lovers with the embrace and both their eyes glassy but as they parted amparos eyes had shifted from soft to thoughtful faintly troubled she touched his arm and senor good luck suerte when nelm approached the sancti spiritus correos counter almost four hours later amparo wasnt as helpful nelm suspected that ayliss might well have played the deathrow card so he kept to a similar story saying that he was connected with the das office seeking urgent information before the execution that night but amparo just kept repeating something about regulations didnt budge despite him at one point showing her in his cupped palm one consolation nelm thought it looked doubtful that ayliss would have got anything either but when hed asked amparo if anyone had called earlier asking for the same information shed shook her head no despite the flicker of recognition in her face he thought hed seen when hed first mentioned durrant and deathrow as nelm headed down the steps of the sancti spiritus correos he had much the same feeling nothing left to do that jac had had in that same spot four hours earlier but then that nagging doubt pinched again and he looked back thoughtfully he wondered whether however much hed tried to shield it amparo had sensed how frantic he was certainly thats how he felt the nightmare in vancouver the runaround with truelle and the long flight to cuba now the breakneck drive to sancti spiritus the threeday flykill holiday from hell but aware of that he thought hed covered with his best warm and gracious smile the cool and collected da official trying to get information rather than the patiencelonggone bubblingacidnerves hitman nelms eyes shifted to a bar across the road one way he might get to know a deadandalive town sancti spirituss ramshackle buildings looked like theyd been slowly crumbling since the s with a hotchpotch of blue and pink shutters that tried but failed to offer some relief apart from the post office the bars blue shutters appeared to be the only ones in the street to have received a recent lick of paint over a beer nelm talked to the barman and after a lot of fingerpointing and juggling between the barmans basic english and the few spanish words that nelm was able to translate he got some idea of whod visited the post office earlier that day americanos nuevo coches nelm quickly picked up were the key words hed noticed that there were very few new cars on the road apart from his own the barman explained that nearly all new cars were rental cars for tourists or taxis the rest of cuba either didnt have a car or relied on old relics most of them left over from the batista days nelm nodded and sipped at his beer that explained the buddy holly timewarp when it came to cars but that also meant as with his own bmw series now parked in front aylisss car would have been one of the few new ones to have pulled up outside the post office earlier nelm stood up from his bar stool as he described ayliss big man quite fat gordo black hair oiled back nelm swept one hand over his own hair he didnt know the spanish for cream suit so tugged at his own lightgrey jacket and said blanco white suit new car nuevo coche four hours ago cuatro horas and finally there was a gleam of recognition in the barmans eyes si si car like yours muy similar he pointed to nelms car outside then frowned as he tried to remember the make he took a beer mat and drew a few interlocking circles audi that would at least narrow it down nelm thought but as the barman continued with something about the man in the white suit hugging a woman nelm began to think that maybe it wasnt ayliss after all as he looked towards where the barman was gesticulating nelm suddenly jolted his expression as if hed seen a ghost he held one hand up towards the barman no need for further explanation nelm squinted sharper as a man across the road took the last step and entered the post office truelle nelm kept the same hand held in the air as he moved closer to the window as if he was a conductor holding an orchestra in silence a pregnant expectant pause as they waited for it to come down again for the crescendo finale and a minute later as he saw truelle emerge holding a padded buff envelope walk thirty yards down the road and get in a white classic corvette that hand did finally come down as with an old friend amigo he rushed out to his car to follow when jac arrived at the door of villa delarcos at just before pm brent calbrey a tall gaunt man in his early sixties with a heavy tan and wavy grey hair informed him that hed just missed lenny by about half an hour hes headed into town sancti spiritus yeah few things he wanted to pick up things he likes that i didnt already have in the fridge oh and he said he was also going to the post office oh right post office jac looked back down the road i i probably passed him on my way up whats he driving my car calbrey smiled tightly white corvette classic jac couldnt remember if hed passed one or not there were a lot of old american cars on the roads do you know when hell be back a couple of hours he said calbrey raised an eyebrow can i give him a message no its okay ill try and catch him later jac didnt want to leave a name possibly frighten truelle off he turned away old friend yeah old friend jac said over his shoulder smiling wanly and as he was a few paces away calbrey called after him explaining that lenny might return direct to the casita rather than the main house itself its entrance is forty yards along jac looked towards where calbrey pointed and the white moorishstyle bungalow a smaller version of the main house on a small promontory with panoramic views over the sea lapping fifteen yards its other side everything was white jac thought the villa and casitas calbreys bermudas and cheesecloth top the corvette jac nodded his thanks and as he got back into his car looked anxiously at his watch he couldnt just sit there for two hours knowing that meanwhile larrys life was ticking away he started up heading back to sancti spiritus but halfway there his foot suddenly eased from the pedal two hours hardly would he have arrived there before truelle was heading back out to the villa and if truelle heard that meanwhile someone had called for him he might rush off again go to ground no the only safe thing was to wait there and watch at the next side road he did a hasty threepoint turn headed back and eighty yards along from the bungalow with a clear view of it and the main house he parked and waited watching hawkishly every car that approached and passed though there werent many seven in the past hour but as an hour became an hour and a half two hours he found himself looking repeatedly at his watch tapping his fingers anxiously on the steering wheel in rhythm with his pulse and mounting tension the constant tremor in his body becoming heavier waves of tiredness were again swilling over him as he watched the unchanging scene ahead punctuated by the occasional car three times hed shook himself back awake as he felt himself close to the brink he put the radio on again as a precaution though hed have thought that with the tension running through him and his constant fingertapping that alone would have kept him awake but that rhythm after a while formed its own soporific monotony along with the long spells of static vista the occasional passing car the hum and click of cicadas the surf lapping gently fifty yards away and as that rhythm finally combined with the music from the radio became one medley it dragged him gently towards what for the past twentyfour hours hed been staving off with raw tension and adrenalin caffeine mambo and salsa a deep satisfying sleep last meal lockdowns one two breakfast lunch supper exercise hour final lockdown life at libreville except it had been no life just various regimented stages towards death larry now realized and now there were only a few stages left medical examination last eighteen paces to the deathchamber strapdown and final injection hed already had an extracurricular examination from the infirmary medic whod put fourteen stitches in his shiv wound the night before flesh wound nothing internal damaged but torvald had asked the medic down to check it again two hours ago just to be sure larry only ate half of his last meal not only because he didnt feel like it but because in the end it didnt bring back old days in the ninth it just reminded him all the more that he was here at libreville with cooks who didnt have the slightest idea how to make a good pboy libreville had steadily eroded most of his good memories over the years he didnt want to spoil more with his last meal the night before when hed said his last goodbyes roddy had started to tell him a joke but had broken down halfway through and as theyd hugged larry had muttered in his ear you know that ayliss its actually jac thinking as he gave a quick hushed explanation and saw roddys incredulous expression that all the years roddy had told him jokes the last surprise and punchline had been his has he called yet roddy had asked no not yet hes apparently still chasing down some last minute things larry shrugged you know what hes like never say die he will call i know it maybe larry shrugged again his eyes shifting uncomfortably to one side but you know its not right for me to keep clinging on to hope till the last hour when rodriguez clasped one of his hands in both of his shaking gently i meant either way larry either way and at that moment roddy was one of the few people left who could still look him in the eye the guards called out dead man walking as they escorted him along but their eyes had already said it youre already dead i can hardly bear to look at you torvald fran and josh the day before the two guards outside his openbar lastnight cell in case he attempted suicide the guard that had brought him his last meal none of them could meet his eye the only other person who had been able to had been father kennard that morning when after having prayed with him asked do you want to deal at all with what you did all those years ago larry ask gods forgiveness and it was larry then who was looking away uneasily unable to meet kennards eye i i dont think i can father when even now i cant rightly say whether i killed her or not i understand father kennard nodded thoughtfully pursing his lips but i had to ask larry either way larry wondered if that was why jac hadnt yet called because as with everyone else who could no longer look him in the eye he couldnt bear to give him bad news larry had tried to avoid looking at the clock too frequently expectantly that morning but after his last meal he began to look at the clock increasingly two oclock twothirty three by the time it got to pm and torvald came to his cell to tell him that it was time for his final medical examination larry knew then that jac wouldnt call jac couldnt face telling him what larry could already see in everyones eyes he was already a dead man bob stratton finally got the breakthrough hed been frantically chasing for half the day at pm roland cole had ditched his two credit cards shortly after he left his last address both of them left hanging with big bills and no forwarding address no possible linkn cole had covered his tracks well but stratton decided to check new credit card applications over the past ten months when cole might have applied for a new one and out of eight r coles processed in that period in louisiana he hit gold with an exact birthdate match roland t cole verret street algiers stratton leapt into his car twentyfive minutes drive he made it in nineteen firstfloor apartment of a rundown chippedpaint threestorey block with its front doors accessed by outside planked walkways stratton rang the bell then knocked after five seconds no answer he rang and knocked again still nothing and was about to try a third time when the neighbours door opened i don think youll find him there a blearyeyed man in a tshirt squinting as if hed just awoken from an afternoon nap he left half an hour back carrying a holdall lot of banging of drawers an that before he went the man scratched his chest absently thats why i looked out when his door slammed thought for a minute he might have been ransacked oh right do you know where he works yeah three blocks away he pointed with a hooked finger a slight shrug as if he didnt see the importance opelousas packing no idea where he might have gone i suppose no none at all and coles work colleague at opelousas had no idea either hed left work an hour ago complaining of a bad stomach an sfar as i know he was headin for home and bed and stayin there as stratton got back in his car his nerves still racing from the rush he took out his cellphone to call ayliss at pm roland cole jumped on a greyhound bus bound for miami via pensacola tallahassee and tampa durrants face everywhere he couldnt stand it any more warehouse walls work colleagues a man in the local cafe at lunchtime who reminded him of durrant the clock there too didnt help a film of sweat breaking out on coles forehead and when the cafe owner flipped channels on the corner tv from a daytime soap to the news cole stood up sharply as durrants face loomed out at him man i cant take any more o this he said to his friend he rubbed at his stomach and looked with disdain at the barelyeaten burger on his plate i gotta get home before i die tell max for me would ya the greyhound bus was ideal no tv no newspapers no clock and as the miles rolled by no new orleans either out of sight out of mind the continued thrum of its wheels on the road would hopefully finally push the images of durrant from his mind so he tucked himself away at the back of the greyhound where nobody would notice him and more importantly he wouldnt notice them more faces that might remind him of durrant and waited for that moment to come like rizzo in the last scene of midnight cowboy he thought as he closed his eyes and after a while curled up at the back of the bus as if in support of that image he found that he was trembling although unlike rizzo in his case it was from the tension still writhing in his stomach and the shame of what hed done rather than pneumonia truelle called a halt after three brandies cuban measures were generous a third of a balloon and the road to the villa was new to him he didnt want to risk wrapping brents prize corvette round a lamppost hed phoned cynthia for the dhl reference number soon after shed sent the package then when hed phoned to track its progress that morning was told that it was scheduled to be delivered to the sancti spiritus correos before midday he didnt want to leave the package there any length of time and while brents casita fridge was generously stocked there were a few essential favourites he wanted to pick up earl grey tea anchovystuffed olives and salted almonds he decided to pick them up first then head to the post office he didnt want to risk leaving the package in his car the earl grey tea proved impossible to get he gave up after the third store visited and the place where he bought the salted almonds told him of a shop halfway across town where they might have the olives when truelle got there half of it was a deli with shelves jammed ceiling high with produce from spain and latin america the other half a cafe where he ordered a coffee and brandy while he perused what else they had ending up also buying some salami and spicy chorizo as he knocked back the last of his brandy he tried his office number again still no answer then cynthias home number the same hed tried both numbers earlier to find out if anyone had called by the office after hed left but with the same result maybe with little for cynthia to be there for shed decided to take a break at the same time too when hed first arrived at brents after the long journey brent had given him an anxious sideways glance as he opened up the casita for him you okay buddy something troubling you no fine fine just overwork burning the midnight oil on too many patient histories he no doubt looked at that moment how he felt a total wreck but he hadnt got half his own mind around what had happened let alone to explain it to someone else i did something with a patient twelve years ago that i shouldnt have and as i became worried about the people id done it for i took out a couple of insurance policies but when i phoned the other day both of those policy holders had been killed and now truelle ordered another brandy he couldnt get maggie steiners voice out of his head cracking pitifully as she told him that alan was dead then that vancouver policewoman telling him about chris and brenda that put the phone down shut it out of your head have another drink push it away push it away push it away he knocked back the brandy in three quick slugs raised his hand for another the shop keeper eyed him with concern as he poured are you okay senor again fine fine bueno muy bueno just dont get too close to me thats all everyone who gets close to me gets killed half the world asking if he was okay the stewardess too on his last leg from nassau to havana for the first legs of the flight hed kept to soft drinks his stomach still churning from a volatile acidbile mix of last nights drinks and wireedge tension but by the time he came to the last leg his hands were shaking so heavily that he felt he just had to have a drink to get them steady and try to dull the nightmare images burning hour by hour stronger through his head push them away push them away he knocked back a quick malt whisky at nassau airport ordered another as soon as he was airborne and as he took his third inflight whisky from the stewardess his eyes bleary and redrimmed hand shaking on the glass she asked if he was okay fine fine and even if people didnt ask it was there in their eyes that look of concern on the faces of the people as he now stepped outside the shop squinting and swaying slightly as the bright sunshine again hit him on the face of the woman at the post office as he handed across the note from brent and collected his package a young couple heading into the correos as he went back down its steps unsure whether to sidestep him or help him down truelle closed his eyes as he got back into brents car taking slow deep breaths to try and get his nerves calm and as he opened them again and started up he checked his watch four more hours then perhaps finally it would all be over the nightmare of the past twelve years ended maybe then at last it would all be fine fine bueno bueno jac was sitting with larry having a brandy both of them looking anxiously at the clock as jac passed across larrys glass larry said tell my mother jac tell her it wasnt me before its too late but i cant see her larry jac looking over larrys shoulder suddenly realizing that this time they were in the courtroom he couldnt see anything in fact it was just mist and shadow beyond larry vague shapes none of them clear but shes there jac i know it i can feel her eyes boring into the back of my right shoulder tell her jac please please before its too late i i cant see anything any more larry jac perplexed why it had all suddenly become misty theres nothing there but hazy shadows ive ive become like you larry cant see anything clearly any more please jac dont do this tears streaming down his face as he clasped jacs hand please dont let me die without her knowing that it wasnt me ringing in his pocket the tears welling too in jacs eyes as he clasped back but now that i cant see anything clearly larry what do i even tell her if youd been able to see things clearly youd have been able to tell her yourself long before now before telephone as the dream fell away jac shuddered awake and answered the call bob strattons voice competing against justo betancourt on the radio jac reached out and turned it down blinking heavily fading afternoon light approaching dusk as jac looked at his watch pm he jolted to suddenly fearing in that second thats why stratton was calling only an hour till durrants execution then he remembered the onehour time difference his caught breath and his pulse settling back as stratton told him about his efforts with roland cole close very close but in the end no cigar and dont look like hes planning to return any time soon not in the next few hours at least thats it yeah looks like it soft resigned exhalation thanks you tried your best thats it jac surveying again the white villa casita and road ahead now knowing with certainty that his very last chance rested with truelle almost two hours asleep still no sign of a white corvette but what if truelle had returned in the meantime and headed off again if hed seen the audi up the road and had come close enough to see him inside asleep no doubt the first thing hed have done the sleep had taken some of the edge off jacs jaded nerves but as the minutes dragged with the last of the days light fast dying they started to intensify again jacs fingers tapping steadily once more on the steeringwheel where was truelle maybe he should give calbrey another knock even if calbrey lied he might see something telltale in his face some clue as to car approaching two hundred yards away sidelights on and as it came thirty yards closer jac could see it clearly white corvette his fingertapping changed to an anxious clutch and for a moment no more than a fleeting shadow jac thought he could see another car a hundred yards behind it but as he squinted harder he could no longer see it either it had pulled in somewhere been swallowed up with the fastfading light or it was just a trick of his eyes jac watched truelle park the corvette and get out carrying a briefcase and a shopping bag calbrey came to greet him and they talked for a couple of minutes truelle looked around anxiously at one point then with a tight smile and halfwave truelle headed across the lawn to the casita jac watched the lights come on inside and outside the casita illuminating a terrace area with table and umbrella on the promontory as much as jac couldnt wait to pounce on truelle and get his hands verbal and proverbial around his neck he could see calbrey watering some potted plants at the casitaside of the main villa confronting truelle would without doubt be better without any interference but fuck it if calbrey didnt head in soon jacs fingertapping increased almost doubletime to his pulse and the cicadas and crickets and he managed to hold out only another ninety seconds before his hand was reaching for the door handle and wait calbrey seemed to be putting away his hose and calling out something towards the casita jac watched their brief exchange calbrey going inside the main villa as truelle headed briefcase in one hand drink in the other towards the table on the end of the promontory jac waited only twenty seconds for truelle to get settled at the table then checking his watch pm got out of his car grab him by the throat and scream at him hit him speak gently and appeal to his better nature shout and threaten and appeal to his worst all the different ways of handling truelle had spun wildly through jacs head over the past hours so much too much depending on it now as he walked across the casita lawn towards the promontory they were still spinning nothing decided words and fragments of sentences jumbling around until finally they all merged together and became little more than a buzz a buzz that progressively became stronger with the bloodrush to his head competing with the hum and click of cicadas as he got closer to the table and truelle the promontory was no more than twenty feet above the sea but it was enough to give a panorama clear sea one side a string of islands and cays a mile offshore the other truelle had taken a seat at the table then angled his chair to face the sunset view he didnt become aware of jac still in his ayliss disguise until he was only a few yards away truelle jolted with a sharp breath his eyes darting anxiously to one side and past jac as if for a second escape might be an option before realizing the futility rugbytackled after a few yards and his eyes settled back or perhaps he was hoping that calbrey might come out and save him how how did you find me cynthia and a friendly woman at the sancti spiritus post office jac shrugged but dont blame cynthia she only told me because i convinced her that if i didnt get to you then malley would and hed kill you with all the ayliss padding jac was hot from the rapid walk from his car his breath falling short the buzzing was subsiding only his rapid pulsebeat beneath ticking down the seconds left for larry jac smiled tightly in the end she had your best interests at heart i i phoned her home and office there was no answer i was beginning to when i left her jac held one hand up placating i told her not to hang around the office waiting for malley to turn up there she obviously took my advice truelle nodded thoughtfully but then his eyes clouded again looked unsettled as jac took a seat and placed the small cassette tape recorder from his pocket on the table between them jac took a fresh breath now we could sit here for the next half hour with me piling on the pressure about the da and how if you let durrant die im going to make sure he adds on an accomplice to murder rap ten to fifteen of the hardest time you can imagine but you know the problem is i dont have the time any more i got to call governor candaret right away and get him to phone libreville prison and stop durrants execution jacs ayliss drawl heavy he leant over menacingly and laid one hand on truelles thigh feeling the jerk of discomfort and the underlying tremble as jac clenched hard against it he could feel the pulse at his own temples the buzzing in his head stronger again for a moment and having flown for half a day and driven across half of fucking cuba i dont have the patience left either jac glared hard at truelle and giving his thigh one last warning grip lifted his hand towards the recorder truelles eyes fixed on it as if it was a loaded gun so im just going to press record here while you tell me chapter and verse everything that happened twelve years ago i i cant truelle shook his head staying jacs finger an inch above the button he closed his eyes as if in submission as a small shudder ran through him opening them again he smiled meekly like you said before hell kill me malley yeah nelm as hes known hes killed two others that i know of both good friends truelle closed his eyes fleetingly again shutting out the images and then looked to one side as if consulting someone unseen as to whether to finally say anything he took a fresh breath not long after this all started twelve years ago i began to get concerned and so took out a couple of insurance policies jacs hand went to press record but truelle held a hand up staying it again clear indication that if jac did hed immediately clam up they they were accounts of what happened with durrant twelve years ago left in sealed envelopes with a couple of friends only to be opened in the event of something happening to me i changed those policy holders not long ago but then found out early yesterday that that truelle closed his eyes again catharsis what hed always advised patients to do unburden share the weight that was too much to carry alone but hed never imagined that it would be to this sly and gushing southern lawyer that hed just met and now not even able to say the word that would help him start accepting it healing dead dead dead both of them one i spoke to his wife and she told me the other a police officer answered truelle swallowed exhaled gently thats why i jumped on the first plane here to cuba thought you might be next observing truelles doleful nod his eyes redrimmed and fearful that thinking made perfect sense but as jac considered it more deeply an incredulous leer rose what you think that if you just sit it out here in cuba for a few hours until durrants dead after that everythings going to be fine truelle shook his head he didnt know he didnt know anything any more jac saw truelle start to crack rode it afterwards its going to be just as bad probably even worse jac leant over and held one hand towards truelle a few inches short of a direct prod after durrants gone youll be the only one left to know what theyve done you think for one minute theyre going to leave you alive another headshake truelle scrunching his eyes shut push it away push it away in fact if you asked me to put money on it id say that not only is malley going to kill you after durrants gone but hes going to do it quick real quick jac grimaced tautly everything done and dusted at the same time i i dont know the words shuddered out on truelles fractured breath but maybe a part of him had known all along that gap between what the subconscious knew and conscious mind wouldnt accept basic jungian theory and hed tried to bridge that gap by either shutting it out of his mind or with drink but had never really succeeded and what now more bottles stacked under his sink more bodies of close friends maybe nelm putting a quick bullet through his head would be for the best quick release the thoughts raged inside him along with his strungout nerves and acidbile stomach the ghostly images of his dead friends now stabbing his brain finally spilling over with a spluttering exhalation i would never ever have gone along with it if i thought truelle broke off then suddenly realizing hed let the genie out of the bottle but looking at it strangely as if someone else had done it without asking his permission thought for a minute that durrant was innocent what you went along with it only because you believed he was guilty when truelle had said it the other day in his office jac thought it had been just a ruse a foboff yeah roche and nelm though i never actually saw roche over the whole thing nelm was always the gobetween they claimed that from word on the street durrant was the main name to come back as his wifes murderer but his accident and coma had conveniently blotted it all out the police couldnt even apply basic questioning and interrogation wasnt even worth hauling him in truelle shrugged and when the dna evidence came in i was convinced they were telling the truth jac nodded pensively the buzzing had faded again only his steady pulsebeat now in rhythm with the cicadas he checked his watch just over two and a half hours left to get the call in to candaret and at which stage did you become not so convinced i dont know truelles eyes shifted sifting through the past ive always had some doubts i suppose and those have become stronger recently though im still far from sure either way truelle shut his eyes again for a second final closure then looked across directly its important though that you understand i wouldnt have done this if id truly thought durrant was innocent jac wasnt sure what truelle wanted absolution or simply understanding jac nodded i understand jac was quick to reassure that with him now cooperating hed push the da for the lightest possible sentence and also get him to offer a good wpp if you think youll need it truelle nodded but as jac went to press record truelle stopped him again with a gentle grip on his arm one last thing what i say now is no doubt going to save durrants neck get him off but what if that dnas right and he is guilty jac looked thoughtfully ahead for a moment the last of the sun was dipping into the sea crimsonblue dappling every wave i do strongly believe that durrant is innocent though in the end as with you i cant be a hundred per cent sure dna the one factor that had made jac doubt more than a few times over the past weeks but that cant be your concern right now youve got to say what happened finally do the right thing and clear your own conscience and whatever larry durrant has done is then between him and his conscience and governor candaret the second that nelm saw aylisss audi he knew that hed have to move quickly couldnt risk leaving him together with truelle for any length of time as soon as he saw ayliss get out of his car and head across he pulled his own car out from behind a tree where hed tucked it when hed first spotted the audi and edged a hundred yards closer then got out deciding to do the rest on foot he gripped the browning in one pocket as he went the small plastic water bottle hed picked up at cienfuegos now empty makeshift silencer was in the other the two figures by a table at the end of a promontory as he got closer ayliss taking a seat a lot of talking gesticulating and headshaking nelm concerned how long he could risk leaving it but nervous about moving in yet it was still light enough for them to see him approach and as they did one of them would probably rush to the main villa to alert truelles friend with him then on the phone to the police a nightmare before hed started if he waited just eight or ten minutes more it would be completely dark he could move in without either of them seeing him until it was too late nelm waited on the setting sun most of the details came back out from durrant pretty much how id fed them to him some were weaker some stronger or even embellished with how from his own psyche he thought hed have reacted and some small details never did come out unless maybe it was in police questioning that wasnt shown at trial jac nodded pensively maybe that explained some of the extra details and reactions from larry in ormderns sessions maybe halfway through jac had taken out his cellphone and put it next to the taperecorder in preparation to call candaret eleven minutes it had taken truelle to pour out his soul tell all eleven minutes to end twelve years of hell for larry durrant the sun setting the last light fading over the coastline of cuba as the first light of hope finally hit larry durrant jac thought ruefully another minute for truelle to wrap up the background incidental details and hed call candaret as truelle saw his eyes go to the phone he lifted a hand up as if hed suddenly remembered something oh and when you phone apart from what youve now got on tape truelle took a step to one side reaching for his briefcase theres something else that will truelle froze then as if hed been struck with an arrow as hed stood up part of his field of vision had swung wider and he stood transfixed looking past jacs shoulder jac swung round sharply and stood up the faint tread of footsteps reaching him in that same instant malley nelm nelm smiled tautly as he moved closer his gun at waist level trained on them my this is cosy very cosy indeed he moved a step closer bringing their awkward triangle in tight to only three yards between them so what have you been telling him lenny truelle didnt answer jac saw him swallow and was sure it was quiet enough to hear it if it wasnt for the buzzing back in his head nelms eyes shifted to the recorder on the table cassette still turning looks like i got here just in time would you nelm indicated with his gun but as jac reached towards the recorder nelm took a plastic bottle from his pocket and with a on second thoughts let me do that for you shot through it inches from his fingertips jac watched the recorder shatter pieces flying as it spun off the table jacs heart dived eyes squeezing tight last chance gone to save larry nelms figure bleary through salt tears as he opened them again tilting gently or maybe jac was swaying his legs suddenly uncertain as he took a step towards nelm nelm prodded the air with his gun took half a step back to maintain the distance between them now lets not try and be brave then silence their triangle tenser now eyes darting measuring options what few were left jacs pulsebeat was suddenly heavier at his temples the thrum of the cicadas louder jac noticed truelles eyes shift for a halfsecond towards the main villa perhaps hoping that calbrey might have heard the shot and come out but it had been little more than a dull thud and as jac checked fleetingly too calbrey was still inside french windows closed nelm followed their gaze for an instant it was obviously something hed thought of too he wasnt going to hang around out here long something jac thought desperately surely something he could do if he could get truelle out of this then he could get him to speak to candaret directly and then as if answering his last two thoughts nelm suddenly shot truelle in the stomach bringing him to his knees no nono jacs screams rose from deep within impromptu the buzzing in his head now so loud that he could barely hear them nelms gun moved briefly towards him as if he was unsure for a second who to kill first he who makes the most noise gets it but then as the gun shifted quickly back to truelle levelling at his head in that final second all jac could think of was that last head shot in the police report jessica roches sprawled body in the photos meeting larry for the first time sharing a brandy with him that night and larry now looking at the deathchamber clock waiting for him to call with a grunting wheeze as if the last air was being pushed out of him jac suddenly propelled himself towards nelm nelm distracted fleetingly by the sudden movement and noise squeezed off the shot anyway but in the beats pause truelle started to move the shot hitting him in the shoulder then nelms gun was swinging swiftly towards jac jac hit nelm full in the chest before the gun had completed its arc the breath shunting out of him heavily as they stumbled back nelms gun was swinging back towards him again jac gripping his arm before the barrel could point at him wrestling still falling back and then suddenly the ground seemed to fall away beneath jacs legs them both spinning tumbling through a small bush and then into the air falling in that final blindfury second jac hadnt paid any attention to how close to the promontory edge they were or how far his momentum with all the ayliss padding would carry them they hit the water quickly no more than two seconds the breath bursting out of jac as something hit hard against his right shoulder rock or coral a few feet beneath then they were spluttering back up through the water still grappling jac struggling to focus again on nelm faint moonlight finally picked nelm out dapples swilling back and forth nelms features twisted distorted through the few inches of water between them as he tried to push jac deeper under gun jac choking spluttering trying desperately to see whether nelm still had it in his hand writhing hard pushing back jac managed to gasp two seconds of air before nelm thrust him back under grappling at his neck and face then suddenly nelm froze gasping faintly his face wideeyed as it swam in and out of focus in the water between them jac realizing in that instant that aylisss facial prosthetics had come away in nelms hands and jac mcelroy was suddenly staring up at him from beneath but jac was still desperately trying to focus on nelms gun hand see if he still had it and as he saw the wavering shadow of nelms right arm move towards him and heard the shot then another quickly after saw and felt the warmth of his own blood swilling all around him in the water he knew that nelm had and in those final seconds as jac saw nelms face slowly fade as the water between them became deeper darker suddenly he was back in the lake again sinking down through its dark depths though this time he knew there was nothing to save him its time now larry i know larry nodded dolefully the cell bolt slid back the door opened and larry got up and joined torvald and the six guards outside they walked three each side of him torvald slightly ahead as they went along their footsteps echoing starkly emptily gone from their eyes in the end to be able to cope in the final moments larry had taken a leaf out of their book if hed already gone from their eyes then all that remained was to shed the last vestiges of himself in his own mind hed already considered it a good idea not to think about josh and fran so that he didnt end up a quivering blubbering wreck at the last moment and so having rid himself of every good and warm past memory of fran and josh all that remained was to cast off the rest holding his hands up high after his first big boxing win the pride in his mothers face still there even when he fell into bad ways her refusing to accept it roddys sly smile as he told a joke or funny story sal in the library bc in the muscle yard passages from his favourite books sharing a brandy with jac mcelroy that night it didnt take long wasnt too difficult because there werent that many good memories left libreville had eroded most of them already over the years footsteps echoing emptily and as he took the last few steps towards the death chamber of all the years that hed heard his own footsteps echoing like a ghosts through libreville only now was it finally in step with fully mirroring how he felt empty devoid of all memories all feelings all emotions hands gently guiding him laying him on the gurney hands of strong guards that could have pushed but sensed in that moment that they didnt need to larry looked through the glass towards the observation room as he was strapped down warden haveling father kennard the prison psychiatrist one of the medic team a timespicayune journalist whod visited him the day before and larry had agreed to have there and as the last strap was secured larry smiled gently towards his audience they probably thought that hed finally snapped gone mad or that hed made some sort of inner peace in his mind and was looking forward to going to god ascension day but the thought that had hit larry in that moment was how hed robbed them cheated them theyd put on this big event this circus governors final thumbs down scores of protestors and media trucks outside the prison gates on every news channel with analysis and crossanalysis pro and con deathpenalty debates to kill larry durrant but hed robbed them of that privilege without them knowing it the past long years at libreville had already taken half the life out of him and in the past hours hed managed to strip and erode what was left in the end they werent killing larry durrant at all they were killing just a shell black everything black but gradually some grey started to wash through as if a gentle light was trying to seep in soften the edges make the darkness not so absolute while the grey was softer there was also some pain attached to it and so the black felt warmer more welcoming he wanted to go back to it where hed been a minute ago no pain a steady beep beep beep now too as more of the blackness swilled away and became grey like an alarm going off prompting him gently incessantly wake up wake up wake up but jac thought im dead and surely thats the one advantage of being dead not having to wake up to annoying alarms any more when you dont want to beep beep beep beep as the grey too started to swill away get whited out jac opened his eyes and focused a monitoring machine at his side steadily beeping a nurse by the end of his bed checking a clipboard chart looking up at him as his eyes flickered open ah you are with us again jac looked down at himself blinking still trying to make sense of everything but but i was shot the nurse shook her head no senor not you you have a cracked shoulder joint which was also dislocated and a lot of water had to be drained from your lungs it was the other man with you el hombre negre he was shot twice from behind the blood warm and swilling all around him maybe even too the last impetus of the bullets hitting jac as theyd come straight through nelm but it not computing in that instant that it could possibly have been nelm shot nobody there to shoot him who who shot him the nurse shrugged the police dont know they are still investigating but then the rest hit jac what hed been there for in those final minutes and he tried to sit up larry his eyes shifted to the clock on the wall pm pm in new orleans the tears welling stinging his eyes almost five hours since larry had been executed and this time his fathers diehard tenet look to the bright side didnt couldnt help no bright side possible the tears flowed freely the nurse looking at him with concern you shouldnt cry senor youre alive you made it i know jac said wiping at the tears with the back of one hand but thats half the problem dont you see he wanted to scream at her i feel ashamed to be alive getting the proof to save durrant and still letting him die made it all the more painful unbearable its its not me jac explained its my friend the nurse lifted her eyes hopefully but your friend hes made it too senor he was hurt much worse than you with a stomach wound muy malo but theyve already operated and the surgeon thinks hell pull through jac could see from a nametag that her name was carmita terra he shook his head as he realized she was talking about truelle no not him another friend in new orleans oh she looked blank for a second then seeing how distraught he was tears once again welling she gave a tightlipped grimace her eyes softening i am sorry to hear about your other friend senor so sorry in those last minutes larry had stopped looking at the clock but everyone else started watching it all the more then and as the final minute approached their eyes were riveted to it they could hardly shift them for one second to look at anything else none more so than warden haveling as he watched the second hand start on its final second sweep and everything suddenly fell deathly silent not only in the observation room looking onto the death chamber but in the prison beyond inmates looking up from their bunks with heavy expectant eyes the protestors outside having stopped playing their music twenty minutes ago even the mutter of their voices at that instant died as they looked on at the prison gates breath vapours pluming gently on the cool night air and half of new orleans too hands halted midair with coffee cups or beers as live newscasts took them to reporters outside the prison gates in those final seconds though two more people didnt look at the clock then josh durrant bedroom door shut face down on his bed as he started sobbing and francine tv off refusing to acknowledge the time tried to distract herself by preparing dinner but her hands felt like lead hardly able to move or pick up the right things until in the end she wasnt able to move at all her eyes gently closing as they filled feeling those final seconds tick inside her with her laden heartbeat all of that silent expectation weighed heavily on warden havelings shoulders as he watched the second hand make that final sweep the silence so heavy that you could actually hear the clock ticking making the seconds seem to pass more agonizingly before finally the last few seconds ticking down with the slow deliberation of fullswing axeblows haveling gave a small solemn nod towards torvald engelson engelson acknowledged with equal solemnity halfclosing his eyes for a second and then he lifted one hand towards the two medics they started feeding through the sodium thiopental carmitas eyebrows furrowed at something jac had said the moment before new orleo senor there have been some calls from there for you mickel something she looked towards the corridor outside your other friend in white brought your phone with him in case you needed to call anyone mike coultaine calbrey jac nodded yes i i might need to make some calls but he was thinking more of calling alaysha telling her that he was all right and pouring out his soul before hearing all the bad news from coultaine he wasnt sure he could face that news right now but when carmita returned with his phone a minute later and he tried alayshas number there was no answer he scrolled down and looked at the time of coultaines calls one forty minutes before durrants execution no doubt to press for what was happening his end not much time left now then two more since one twenty minutes after and the other just over an hour ago to find out what had happened though coultaine probably already half knew if hed spoken to the hospital staff or calbrey with a tired sigh jac pressed to dial coultaine back it answered after the first ring mike its ayliss uh jac jac jac thank god youre back in the land of the living yeah yeah jacs voice subdued not really wanting to share coultaines exuberance at him still being alive at that moment he exhaled heavily im sorry mike i tried and the damnest thing is i had the proof right there in my hand at the last moment truelle had jac jac stop thats why ive been calling theres still time what jac sat up sharply sudden lance of pain in his shoulder what do you mean still time durrant got an injury the night before which was stitched but as the first of the knockout feed came through and he strained against the straps one of the stitches burst and the wound started bleeding head of the execution team guy called engelson stopped it right there it was restitched medics then had to check and recheck him the media here meanwhile having a fieldday and finally it was rescheduled when dizzy from sitting up so sharply the room swam in and out of focus for a second midnight just over an hour from now jacs eyes darted frantically the tape had been shattered ruined his eyes fixed back on the nurse truelle gotta go now mike got some fast shuffling to do and the second he hungup he asked the nurse my friend shot in the stomach where is he and how long before he comes round i uh momentarily flustered as to which question to answer first just around the corner next vestibulo not far and a while she held one palm out though i cant say exactly how long only his doctor can answer that youll need to give me a hand with these i have to get up senor youre not meant to por favor but with jac already halfup seeing that he was going to rip all the tubes off in any case she quickly attended detached the monitor links and iv and saline feeds youll have to show me where he said over his shoulder already breaking into a run carmita struggling to keep up a few steps behind jac felt the pain knifing through his shoulder sharper with each stride the corridor tilting and shifting at one point jac bracing with a hand against one wall afraid that he might be passing out again his operation was only completed twenty minutes ago dr delgado truelles surgeon informed jac when carmita located him a minute later so at least another five or six hours before he comes round jacs stomach dived any possibility of sooner delgado shrugged three and a half four hours perhaps but youd be lucky to get more than a few words out of him then hed still be very groggy jac cradled his head in one hand rubbing at his temples the buzzing back suddenly the corridor swaying again and tilting away for a moment all options sliding away with it and towards its end he could see brent calbrey sitting elbows on knees hands steepled thoughtfully against his chin friends insurance policies truelle said that hed left details of the whole thing in envelopes with them jac went towards calbrey and asked him left with close friends apparently any idea who they might be calbrey shrugged no sorry he didnt mention anything i didnt know many of his friends stateside both killed recently jac prompted but calbreys expression remained vague are you sure he didnt say anything anything the clinging desperation in jacs voice echoing off the corridor walls as calbrey shook his head jac felt himself swaying uncertainly the grey edges threatening to drag him back under and in that moment it struck him that maybe it was better if they did or if he hadnt woken up in the first place to get two shots at saving durrant and still fail the cruellest fate of all he asked calbrey the time am fiftythree minutes left now but it hardly mattered there was nothing left to briefcase as calbrey checked his watch jac recognized it from truelle reaching for it earlier apart from what youve now got on tape theres something else that will jac confirmed with calbrey that it was truelles briefcase yes i i brought it with me because its got his papers including his blood group on a donor card but calbrey became hesitant when jac pressed that there was probably something in it he needed urgently and jacs patience snapped look i dont have the time to fucking argue with you ive got a mans life to save you can sort it out with truelle later whether or not you were meant to let me have it calbrey handed the briefcase over with a palms out hey im not the enemy it was me who fished you out the sea for christs sake jac opened the briefcase saw the buff envelope addressed to truelle at the sancti spiritus apartado ripped it open with trembling hands cassette tape nothing else inside as jac tipped the envelope up anthony redmort written on one side of the tape no other wording jac began to worry that it was nothing to do with durrant just another patients history jac asked carmita if there was a taperecorder somewhere in the hospital and within three minutes shed got one from another floor as jac pressed play truelles voice from twelve years ago conditioning durrant with all the details of the robbery and murder of jessica roche echoed eerily along the corridors of the sancti spiritus hospital jacs voice crashing in after the first few sentences as he punched the air yes yes oh fucking yes pain rocketed through his shoulder even though hed used his good arm but he hardly cared at that moment he dialled candarets number straight away governor candaret jaadarrell ayliss larry durrants attorney earlier today i received a full confession from leonard truelle larry durrants psychiatrist of twelve years ago that he falsely conditioned durrant in regard to the murder of jessica roche all of this a conspiracy led by mr roche with a certain nelson malley doing his bidding who in fact was probably the real murderer and now a tape which categorically supports this which i think youd want to hear jac played almost a full minute of the tape over the phone before bringing the receiver back to his ear ive got the entire tape right here governor but i think thats probably enough there to have given you the flavour i dont know mr ayliss candaret sighed roches call still fresh in his mind white house drifting out of reach you call me now at the eleventh hour with a completely fresh account of the murder supported by some tape from years ago played to me over the phone its not exactly conclusive the tape ive got here jacs voice strained breath staccato with exasperation goes on for almost an hour truelle giving every possible detail of jessica roches murder for durrant to repeat at his next session you cant get more conclusive than that i hear what youre saying mr ayliss but the problem i have with that is one of governor candaret jac cut in exhaling tiredly i dont have the time now to fool around and more to the point nor does larry durrant jacs patience was gone long gone from hit men almost being drowned twice police hunting him like a rabbit on a false murder rap if you dont phone libreville prison right away and stop larry durrants execution then when i get back to new orleans im going to make sure to get on every tv and radio show i can and play this tape and when i do im going to make it clear crystal clear that i played this same tape to you now in front of two good witnesses jac nodded at his end smiling tightly towards carmita and calbrey and you still let durrants execution go ahead candarets sigh was heavier this time almost a groan it looked like the white house was sliding out of reach now either way but it would do so a lot quicker dragged through the media over durrant than by roche meddling in the background he clarified a few details about the setup between roche truelle and malley then asked and tell me mr ayliss did mr roche know earlier today that something on this front might be happening yes he did in fact he sent malley to try to kill truelle before he could talk i see now candaret understood that earlier call from roche there were a few things he hated and being manipulated was one of them he was a politician that was his job as as soon as i get off the phone now jac said ive got to call the nopd to pick up roche not only for this now with durrant and the attempt on truelle but two other murders that i know of thats okay mr ayliss his sigh now calmer more satisfied thats actually a call id like to have the pleasure of making myself after ive called warden haveling to stop larry durrants execution byebye waited until hed reached cienfuegos before he made the call its all done clean no hitches some small lastminute complications but i got aroun them nobody saw me thats good to hear see you soon give my regards to fidel small complications one thing you learned working for malastra over the years play everything down so as not to raise the old lizards blood pressure too high as soon as hed phoned malastra from new orleans airport to tell him that nelm was booked on a flight to nassau everything had been a mad rush a suitcase dropped off for him complete with clothes passport and a plastic glock that would pass undetected through airport xrays then hed had to call again from nassau airport hes heading on to cuba i told you i told you malastra convinced that nelm somehow knew that they were on to him and was fleeing keep with him finish it thered been a brief opportunity when nelm had been sitting in his car looking on at the villa with the white corvette but then somebody came out of a house two up from where byebye was parked to put out the garbage and the moment gone he decided to wait until it was dark not long to go nobody would see him then but as soon as it got dark nelm was on the move byebye followed and watched the tableau of figures on the promontory hoping to get nelm as he came back his way but when nelm tumbled over the edge with the other man byebye ran in the third man was on the ground looked like hed blacked out or was already dead from his two shots byebye hoped for a minute that nelm might have got mangled on rocks or had drowned save him the trouble but looking down at them he saw that nelm seemed to be on top of the other man pushing him deeper under he squeezed off two quick shots and ran back to his car in his office carmen malastra smiled ruefully as he started deleting the whole sorry saga from his computer the last to go the cam photos of gerry strelloff handing the envelopes to raoul ferrer they thought theyd worked it all out so well jouliern skimming off the tables handing the money to strelloff then strelloff handing to ferrer the rule was only casino employees checked but even if there had been a spot check of ferrer one night he was a street loanshark hed be expected to be carrying a lot of cash but malastra didnt believe in coincidences and thats where theyd slipped up made their big mistake the hit on ferrer with nelm even having the barefaced cheek to call and apologize with some feeble excuse about ferrer rippingoff roche and a sweetener payoff to boot thats malastra thrown off the scent nelm no doubt thought then gerry strelloff killed as well too much of a coincidence with someone else in the frame so that it didnt link back directly to nelm from that moment malastra was on to it and as he looked back through the videocam footage of the casino floor and saw the envelopes being passed between strelloff and ferrer he knew he knew without any remaining shadow of doubt nelm had been in on it with jouliern from the start he should have guessed earlier that it was a bit rich for joulierns blood to plan on his own and nelms part of it had been to get rid of the couriers in the middle so that there was no possible trace back but in the end thats exactly what had alerted him theyd tried to be too thorough too clever divine justice malastra thought as he made the last delete keytap when alaysha had seen george joulierns name on the back of the envelope that the messenger held out her heart leapt into her throat a note from the grave they know they know it all and theyre coming to get you or maybe the messenger would now hand her a second note from malastra we found this letter addressed to you from george jouliern just go quietly with the messenger no fuss into the car parked outside but the messenger simply smiled as he took her signature for george joulierns letter and walked away her hands still trembled faintly now as she read the letter again how many readthroughs for it to finally sink home that it was all over she was safe if youre reading this then it means im no longer around and malastra has probably put together the pieces of our little scam but with you trying to save your mother out of all of us you were probably the only one to have noble unselfish reasons for doing what you did and that touched me i knew too that you were only roped into all of this by gerry all in all i thought it would be unfair if malastras hammer came down on you as well so i took the precaution of erasing all the videocam shots where youre passed the envelopes hopefully ive been successful in burying everything good luck with your mom alayshas eyes filled and she closed them as a faint shudder ran through her hopefully finally shaking off the last of the nightmare jac too would be so pleased so relieved to hear but at that moment it looked like he had more than enough on his plate the ups and downs and lastminute dramas of the durrant case had filled every news channel throughout the day and when she did finally speak to jac close to midnight and he told her breathlessly i made it thats it its official theyve stopped the execution it was as if the last of his nightmare was falling away from him too falling away with each excitable faltering breath he was quick to reassure that he was fine just minor injuries then hardly pausing for breath he told her the rest the sancti spiritus post office truelle and nelm the hospital the delayed execution the tape from truelles briefcase that finally saved the day and then when i get hold of candaret with just forty minutes to spare he starts arguing the toss i think thats the first time ive told a state governor exactly what i thought of them oh jac jac thats great fantastic you must be ecstatic not to mention exhausted yeah yeah but at that moment as jac finally paused for breath realizing that hed talked nonstop for almost twenty minutes or perhaps suddenly remembering that he still had one nightmare to sort out his own false murderrap and he asked how she was alaysha didnt mention anything simply said she was okay fine everything just fine here with me and molly this was his day thered be time enough for her to tell jac when they were together face to face hopefully a lot of time two christmases it took eight days to clear up jacs own problems with his false murder rap the first breakthrough came when nelms rentalcar was seen on a cam around the corner on st joseph street a minute after the murder then the timing of the calls on his cellphone to strelloff and finally when the police searched nelms apartment they found a jacket with bloodspots that matched strelloffs and fibres from the same jacket on the hallway outside alayshas apartment the charges against jac were dropped by then it was december and jac was told that it might take yet another five days to sort out the immigration issues both ends of him flying into cuba falsely as darrell ayliss and flying out again as jac mcelroy diplomatic machinations between the usa and cuba were slow so jac phoned alaysha and asked if her and molly would like to spend christmas in cuba theres this great beach near havana playa paraiso pure white sand crystal clear caribbean waters alaysha arrived with molly four days later and between playing on the beach with molly in the day and sipping rum punches candlelight lobster dinners dancing the samba and making love at night theyd get occasional calls from mike coultaine with updates on roche about right jac thought wistfully their heaven while hearing about roches hell the first main detail to come out was about the dna evidence roche apparently almost gloating over the ingenuity of the setup after his wifes death hed contacted dr thallerey and asked him to send back her blood and ovary samples something to remember her by ive even kept a lock of her hair but he did so after lieutenant coyne had questioned thallerey so no suspicions were raised then nelm broke into durrants apartment and placed some spots of jessica roches blood on one of his jackets thats why dr thallerey was killed coultaine explained when they heard over your tapped line that you were planning to visit thallerey roche feared that that detail might come out and youd put all the pieces together the motive though behind killing his wife roche was more reluctant to talk about and took another five days of police questioning to finally come out jessica roche had suddenly become a keen green and ecologist and discovered a false report hed had made by a marine survey company regarding water quality by one of his plants shed pushed him to become more green and make the necessary changes at the plant and when he dug in his heel she threatened to blow the whistle roche said that he could have bitten the bullet over that one plant and made the changes but hed apparently been doing the same thing for the past eight years with false waterreporting at all his plants and thats what he feared coming out far from the noblest of motives jac thought but as coultaine went on to explain the resultant shares collapse from the news would have ruined roche not to mention the fiveyear jail term for fraud larry spent that first christmas out of libreville with mack elliott though he had a full day with franny and joshua at a top downtown hotel the royal sonesta on boxing day turkey and all the trimmings champagne and the best cigars all courtesy of governor candarets office gracious gesture but also a great photoopportunity with strong media points scored for candarets next year presidential bid jac thought he was becoming cynical it was a trait he found useful handling larrys compensation claim against the state of louisiana over the following months was offered million was demanded and theyd probably settle somewhere inbetween on the courtroom steps the durrant case was big news the biggest criminologists and legal experts had started busily debating the ingenuity of the setup against durrant and no doubt would for many years to come and with talk from the police about roche hyperventilating so hard under questioning that he almost collapsed a couple of times the timespicayune came out with a story headline that had half of new orleans smiling a breathless setup by a breathless man torvald engelson had played up the dramatics of saving durrant at the first execution attempt describing that lastsecond blooddrop as like an angels teardrop which combined with larrys heavy religious leanings became another headline angels teardrop saves the man that planned to go to heaven and with all the hoopla jac was suddenly in demand beaton was keen to have him back and there were offers too from three other firms when mike coultaine called with a proposition he admitted that hed only retired early because he found oldman beaton such a painintheass but he would love nothing more than to return and keep his hand in say three days a week and it just so happens that dale keller one of the best lawyers its ever been my privilege to know apart from darrell ayliss of course is also looking to hang up his own shingle jac liked the idea it turned out that john langfranc was also keen to jump ship probably his only chance of ever becoming a full partner taking far more loyal clients with him than beaton had anticipated or was happy about two months after christmas keller mcelroy coultaine amp langfranc was founded larry durrants compensation claim was one of their first main cases durrants case also opened the floodgates for other possibly false or questionable imprisonments in the months that followed they took on four more cases from librevilles deathrow one of which was that of hector roddy rodriguez jac launched a fresh appeal arguing that while the days delay before rodriguez visited his victim looked like premeditation it was not to murder since rodriguez had only gone there to warn the man off it was his victims violent reaction to that visit that led to the murder jac was seeking a reduction to manslaughter and a timeserved sentence chances were high thered also been some reshuffling at libreville haveling was still there but bateson and two more of his clique had been suspended pending enquiries while tally shavell had been transferred to wetumpka penitentiary in alabama where apparently they had an even harderassed prison fixer the bets were that if shavell didnt keep his head down low there he wouldnt last more than six months alaysha stopped lapdancing five months later when having turned more of her attention to interior decoration her client list finally started to grow she also started to become franker about telling people that she used to lapdance stopped trying to cover up or being embarrassed by it and now theyd ask the same except now its just for an audience of one a saucy glance at jac as she joked jacs mother had also broken out more on her own finally getting her work visa and with her past art expertise landing a job at a gallery on chartres street two days a week which within three months became fulltime she and jeanmarie moved out of aunt camilles place in hammond and into their own place in bywater only a mile from jac and alaysha with jac busy with the new company he and alaysha had stayed as neighbours constantly in and out of each others apartments and while theyd talked about getting a place together they didnt finally start househunting until late summer just as katrina hit the hurricane completely transformed the city some districts like the ninth ward were totally flattened and when they were rebuilt would never be the same again the most vital criterion for new orleans househunters would forever now be find a place on high ground everything from the new firm was shifted in box files to a make shift office in baton rouge and when they finally returned six weeks later the city still looking like a warzone and the smell of damp seeping through their newlypainted walls coultaine commented oh well just think of all the compensation and rebuilding claims jac shook his head and smiled wryly as bad as his father always look to the bright side larrys compensation was finally settled soon after they moved back into new orleans larry had been seeing joshua regularly every other weekend and some weekdays too and whether from that pressure or other problems between francine and frank apparently things had become increasingly tense between them they finally split up just a month before katrina hit larry and francine started seeing each other tentatively again then occasional dinners out or often shed cook dinner for them all when larry came round to see joshua when the compensation paperwork was being completed larry remarked to jac how scared he was by the whole process so afraid of making the same mistakes as last time its its like starting out all over again you and the city jac thought but when he told alaysha she thought it was cute touching almost like theyre teenagers on their first dates all over again jac and alaysha started looking at houses again in late november and finally found a place on the west bank at algiers point a period bungalow with great river views from its front terrace to move into just a week before christmas their first christmas with family jeanmarie his mother and alayshas since the nightmare of a year ago it was a mad rush they were still unpacking boxes from their apartments as they put the last decorations on the christmas tree and as jac opened one of their christmas cards he suddenly paused his eyes starting to fill it was from larry jac thanks for everything josh told me that hed never seen snow before so i thought it was a good idea to bring him and fran up here to aspen merry christmas but it was the small polaroid inside that had brought a lump to jacs throat larry with an arm around fran and josh each side the three of them by a snowladen fir tree as they smiled at the camera hands trembling as the emotions gripped him jac passed the photo to alaysha isnt that that picture worth a thousand alaysha hearing the tremor in his voice simply touched one finger against his lips seeing in his eyes in that moment all the softness and vulnerability that had first drawn her to him and as she looked at the photo and felt the tears softly sting her eyes too she started planting gentle kisses where a second ago her finger had been yes it is jac yes it is and jac feeling those kisses was reminded of all the times in the dead of night when hed suddenly find himself back in the dark water struggling to make it to the surface breathe again and alaysha would lay the same kisses on one cheek as she shook him gently back awake are you okay jac are you okay the dreams were less frequent now the stark chilling memories fading with each passing month until finally hopefully theyd be like larry durrants memory of being at the roche house that night all those years ago someone elses memory not even his
