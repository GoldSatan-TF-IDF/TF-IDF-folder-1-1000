john irving in one person a novel for sheila heffernon and david rowland and in memory of tony richardson thus play i in one person many people and none contented william shakespeare richard ii chapter an unsuccessful casting call im going to begin by telling you about miss frost while i say to everyone that i became a writer because i read a certain novel by charles dickens at the formative age of fifteen the truth is i was younger than that when i first met miss frost and imagined having sex with her and this moment of my sexual awakening also marked the fitful birth of my imagination we are formed by what we desire in less than a minute of excited secretive longing i desired to become a writer and to have sex with miss frostnot necessarily in that order i met miss frost in a library i like libraries though i have difficulty pronouncing the wordboth the plural and the singular it seems there are certain words i have considerable trouble pronouncing nouns for the most partpeople places and things that have caused me preternatural excitement irresolvable conflict or utter panic well that is the opinion of various voice teachers and speech therapists and psychiatrists whove treated mealas without success in elementary school i was held back a grade due to severe speech impairmentsan overstatement im now in my late sixties almost seventy ive ceased to be interested in the cause of my mispronunciations not to put too fine a point on it but fuck the etiology i dont even try to say the etiology word but i can manage to struggle through a comprehensible mispronunciation of library or librariesthe botched word emerging as an unknown fruit liberry or liberries i saythe way children do its all the more ironic that my first library was undistinguished this was the public library in the small town of first sister vermonta compact redbrick building on the same street where my grandparents lived i lived in their house on river streetuntil i was fifteen when my mom remarried my mother met my stepfather in a play the towns amateur theatrical society was called the first sister players for as far back as i can remember i saw all the plays in our towns little theater my mom was the prompterif you forgot your lines she told you what to say it being an amateur theater there were a lot of forgotten lines for years i thought the prompter was one of the actorssomeone mysteriously offstage and not in costume but a necessary contributor to the dialogue my stepfather was a new actor in the first sister players when my mother met him he had come to town to teach at favorite river academythe almostprestigious private school which was then all boys for much of my young life most certainly by the time i was ten or eleven i must have known that eventually when i was old enough i would go to the academy there was a more modern and betterlit library at the prep school but the public library in the town of first sister was my first library and the librarian there was my first librarian incidentally ive never had any trouble saying the librarian word needless to say miss frost was a more memorable experience than the library inexcusably it was long after meeting her that i learned her first name everyone called her miss frost and she seemed to me to be my moms ageor a little youngerwhen i belatedly got my first library card and met her my aunt a most imperious person had told me that miss frost used to be very goodlooking but it was impossible for me to imagine that miss frost could ever have been betterlooking than she was when i met hernotwithstanding that even as a kid all i did was imagine things my aunt claimed that the available men in the town used to fall all over themselves when they met miss frost when one of them got up the nerve to introduce himselfto actually tell miss frost his namethe thenbeautiful librarian would look at him coldly and icily say my name is miss frost never been married never want to be with that attitude miss frost was still unmarried when i met her inconceivably to me the available men in the town of first sister had long stopped introducing themselves to her the crucial dickens novelthe one that made me want to be a writer or so im always sayingwas great expectations im sure i was fifteen both when i first read it and when i first reread it i know this was before i began to attend the academy because i got the book from the first sister town librarytwice i wont forget the day i showed up at the library to take that book out a second time id never wanted to reread an entire novel before miss frost gave me a penetrating look at the time i doubt i was as tall as her shoulders miss frost was once what they call statuesque my aunt had told me as if even miss frosts height and shape existed only in the past she was forever statuesque to me miss frost was a woman with an erect posture and broad shoulders though it was chiefly her small but pretty breasts that got my attention in seeming contrast to her mannish size and obvious physical strength miss frosts breasts had a newly developed appearancethe improbable but budding look of a young girls i couldnt understand how it was possible for an older woman to have achieved this look but surely her breasts had seized the imagination of every teenage boy whod encountered her or so i believed when i met herwhen was itin furthermore you must understand that miss frost never dressed suggestively at least not in the imposed silence of the forlorn first sister public library day or night no matter the hour there was scarcely anyone there i had overheard my imperious aunt say to my mother miss frost is past an age where training bras suffice at thirteen id taken this to mean thatin my judgmental aunts opinionmiss frosts bras were all wrong for her breasts or vice versa i thought not and the entire time i was internally agonizing over my and my aunts different fixations with miss frosts breasts the daunting librarian went on giving me the aforementioned penetrating look id met her at thirteen at this intimidating moment i was fifteen but given the invasiveness of miss frosts long lingering stare it felt like a twoyear penetrating look to me finally she said in regard to my wanting to read great expectations again youve already read this one william yes i loved it i told herthis in lieu of blurting out as i almost did that i loved her she was austerely formalthe first person to unfailingly address me as william i was always called bill or billy by my family and friends i wanted to see miss frost wearing only her bra which in my interfering aunts view offered insufficient restraint yet in lieu of blurting out such an indiscretion as that i said i want to reread great expectations not a word about my premonition that miss frost had made an impression on me that would be no less devastating than the one that estella makes on poor pip so soon miss frost asked you read great expectations only a month ago i cant wait to reread it i said there are a lot of books by charles dickens miss frost told me you should try a different one william oh i will i assured her but first i want to reread this one miss frosts second reference to me as william had given me an instant erectionthough at fifteen i had a small penis and a laughably disappointing hardon suffice it to say miss frost was in no danger of noticing that i had an erection my allknowing aunt had told my mother i was underdeveloped for my age naturally my aunt had meant underdeveloped in other or in all ways to my knowledge shed not seen my penis since id been an infantif then im sure ill have more to say about the penis word for now its enough that you know i have extreme difficulty pronouncing penis which in my tortured utterance emergeswhen i can manage to give voice to it at allas penith this rhymes with zenith if youre wondering i go to great lengths to avoid the plural in any case miss frost knew nothing of my sexual anguish while i was attempting to check out great expectations a second time in fact miss frost gave me the impression that with so many books in the library it was an immoral waste of time to reread any of them whats so special about great expectations she asked me she was the first person i told that i wanted to be a writer because of great expectations but it was really because of her you want to be a writer miss frost exclaimed she didnt sound happy about it years later i would wonder if miss frost might have expressed indignation at the sodomizer word had i suggested that as a profession yes a writeri think so i said to her you cant possibly know that youre going to be a writer miss frost said its not a career choice she was certainly right about that but i didnt know it at the time and i wasnt pleading with her only so she would let me reread great expectations my pleas were especially ardent in part because the more exasperated miss frost became with me the more i appreciated the sudden intake of her breathnot to mention the resultant rise and fall of her surprisingly girlish breasts at fifteen i was as smitten and undone by her as id been two years earlier no i must revise that i was altogether more captivated by her at fifteen than i was at thirteen when id been merely fantasizing about having sex with her and becoming a writerwhereas at fifteen the imagined sex was more developed there were more concrete details and i had already written a few sentences i admired both the sex with miss frost and actually being a writer were unlikely of coursebut were they remotely possible curiously i had enough hubris to believe so as for where such an exaggerated pride or unearned selfconfidence came fromwell i could only guess that genes had something to do with it i dont mean my mothers i saw no hubris in her backstage role of the prompter after all i spent most of my evenings with my mom in that safe haven for those variously talented and untalented members of our towns amateur theatrical society that little playhouse was not a uniformly prideful or brimmingwithconfidence kind of placehence the prompter if my hubris was genetic it surely came from my biological father i was told id never met him i knew him only by his reputation which didnt sound great the codeboy as my grandfather referred to himor less often the sergeant my mom had left college because of the sergeant my grandmother said she preferred sergeant which she always said disparagingly to codeboy whether william francis dean was the contributing cause of my mom leaving college i didnt really know shed gone to secretarial school instead but not before hed gotten her pregnant with me consequently my mother would leave secretarial school too my mom told me that shed married my dad in atlantic city new jersey in april a little late for a shotgun wedding because id been born in first sister vermont back in march of i was already a year old when she married him and the wedding it was a townclerk or justiceofthepeace deal had been chiefly my grandmothers ideaor so my aunt muriel said it was implied to me that william francis dean hadnt entered into the marriage all that willingly we were divorced before you were two my mom had told me id seen the marriage certificate which was why i remembered the seemingly exotic and farfromvermont location of atlantic city new jersey my father had been in basic training there no one had shown me the divorce records the sergeant wasnt interested in marriage or children my grandmother had told me with no small amount of superiority even as a child i could see that my aunts loftiness had come from my grandmother but because of what happened in atlantic city new jerseyno matter at whose insistencethat certificate of marriage legitimized me albeit belatedly i was named william francis dean jr i had his name if not his presence and i must have had some measure of his codeboy genesthe sergeants derringdo in my moms estimation what was he like id asked my mother maybe a hundred times she used to be so nice about it oh he was very handsomelike youre going to be she would always answer with a smile and he had oodles of derringdo my mom was very affectionate to me before i began to grow up i dont know if all preteen boys and boys in their early teens are as inattentive to linear time as i was but it never occurred to me to examine the sequence of events my father must have knocked up my mother in late may or early june of when he was finishing his freshman year at harvard yet there was never any mention of himnot even in a sarcastic comment from aunt murielas the harvardboy he was always called the codeboy or the sergeant though my mom was clearly proud of his harvard connection imagine starting harvard when youre just fifteen id heard her say more than once but if my derringdo dad had been fifteen at the start of his freshman year at harvard in september he had to be younger than my mother whose birthday was in april she was already twenty in april of she was just a month short of twentytwo when i was born in march of did they not get married when she learned she was pregnant because my dad was not yet eighteen hed turned eighteen in october as my mom told me obligingly the draft age was lowered to that level i would only later think that the obligingly word was not a common one in my mothers vocabulary maybe that had been the harvardboy talking your father believed he might better control his military destiny by volunteering for advanced induction which he did in january my mom told me the military destiny didnt sound like her vocabulary either the harvardboy was written all over it my dad traveled by bus to fort devens massachusettsthe beginning of his military servicein march at the time the air force was part of the army he was assigned a specialty that of cryptographic technician for basic training the air force had taken over atlantic city and the surrounding sand dunes my father and his fellow inductees were bivouacked in the luxury hotels which the trainees would ruin according to my grandfather no one ever checked ids in the bars on weekends girlsmostly government workers from washington dcflocked to town it was very jolly im surethe firin of all sorts of weapons on the sand dunes notwithstandin my mom said that she visited my dad in atlantic cityonce or twice when they were still not married and i would have been a oneyearold it was together with my grandfather that my mother must have traveled to atlantic city for that april wedding this would have been shortly before my dad was sent to air force cryptographic school in pawling new yorkwhere he was taught the use of codebooks and strip ciphers from there in the late summer of my father was sent to chanute field in rantoul illinois in illinois he learned the nuts and bolts of cryptography my mother said so they were still in touch seventeen months after id been born nuts and bolts was never big in my moms vocabulary at chanute field your dad was introduced to the primary military cipher machineessentially a teletype with an electronic set of cipher wheels attached to it my grandfather told me he might as well have been speaking in latin quite possibly not even my missing father could have made the functions of a cipher machine comprehensible to me my grandfather never used codeboy or sergeant disparagingly and he enjoyed reciting to me my dads war story it must have been as an amateur actor in the first sister players that my grandfather had developed the capacity for memorization necessary for him to recall such specific and difficult details grandpa was able to reiterate to me exactly what had happened to my dadnot that the wartime work of a cryptographer the coding and decoding of secret messages was entirely uninteresting the us fifteenth army air force was headquartered in bari italy the th bomb squadron of which my father was a member was stationed at the spinazzola army air baseon farmland south of the town following the allied invasion of italy the fifteenth army air force was engaged in bombing southern germany austria and the balkans from november till september more than a thousand b heavy bombers were lost in this combat but cryptographers didnt fly my dad would rarely have left the code room at the base in spinazzola he spent the remaining two years of the war with his codebooks and the incomprehensible encryption device while the bombers attacked the nazi factory complexes in austria and the oil fields in romania my dad ventured no farther than barimainly for the purpose of selling his cigarettes on the black market sergeant william francis dean didnt smoke my mother had assured me but he sold enough cigarettes in bari to buy a car when he got back to bostona chevrolet coupe my dads demobilization was relatively swift he spent the spring of in naples which he described as enchanting and buoyant and awash in beer described to whom if hed divorced my mom before i was twodivorced her howwhy was he still writing to her when i was already three maybe he was writing to my grandfather instead it was grandpa who told me that my dad had boarded a navy transport ship in naples after a short stay in trinidad he was flown on a c to a base in natal brazil where my father said the coffee was very good from brazil another cthis one was described as agingflew him to miami a troop train north dispersed the returning soldiers to their points of discharge hence my dad found himself back in fort devens massachusetts october was too late for him to return to harvard in that same academic year he bought the chevy with his blackmarket money and got a temporary job in the toy department of jordan marsh bostons largest store he would go back to harvard in the fall of his field of concentration would be romance studies which my grandfather explained to me meant the languages and literary traditions of france spain italy and portugal or at least two or three of em grandpa said your father was a whiz at foreign languages my mom had told mehence a whiz at cryptography maybe but why would my mother or my grandpa have cared about my runaway dads field of concentration at harvard why were these details even known to them why had they been informed there was a photograph of my fatherfor years the only picture i saw of him in the photograph he looks very young and very thin this was late spring or early summer hes eating ice cream on that navy transport ship the photo was taken somewhere between the coast of southern italy and the caribbean before they docked in trinidad im guessing that the black panther on my fathers flight jacket captured all or most of my childish imagination that angrylooking panther was the symbol of the th bomb group cryptography was strictly a groundcrew enterpriseeven so cryptographers were issued flight jackets my allobscuring fixation was that i had something of the war hero in me though the details of my dads wartime exploits were not very heroicsoundingnot even to a child but my grandfather was one of those world war ii buffsyou know the kind who finds every detail intriguingand he was always telling me i see a future hero in you my grandmother had next to nothing positive to say about william francis dean and my mother began and for the most part finished her evaluation with very handsome and oodles of derringdo no thats not entirely true when i asked her why it hadnt worked out between them my mom told me that shed seen my dad kissing someone i saw him kiss someone else was all she said as perfunctorily as she might have prompted an actor whod forgotten the else word i could only conclude that shed observed this kiss after she was pregnant with mepossibly even after id been bornand that she saw enough of the mashedlips encounter to know that it wasnt an innocent sort of kiss it must have been a frenchy a tonguedownthethroat job my elder cousin once confided to mea crude girl the daughter of that imperious aunt i keep mentioning but who was my dad kissing i wondered if shed been one of those weekend girls who flocked to atlantic city one of those government workers from washington dc why else had my grandfather mentioned them to me at the time this was all i knew it was not a lot to know it was more than enough however to make me mistrust myselfeven dislike myselfbecause i had a tendency to attribute all my faults to my biological father i blamed him for every bad habit for each mean and secretive thing essentially i believed that all my demons were hereditary every aspect of myself that i doubted or feared surely had to be one of sergeant deans traits hadnt my mom said i was going to be goodlooking wasnt that a curse too as for the derringdowell hadnt i presumed at age thirteen that i could become a writer hadnt i already imagined having sex with miss frost believe me i didnt want to be my runaway dads offspring his geneticpackage progenyknocking up young women and abandoning them left and right for that was sergeant deans modus operandi wasnt it i didnt want his name either i hated being william francis dean jrthe codeboys almostabastard son if there was ever a kid who wanted a stepfather who wished that his mother at least had a serious boyfriend i was that kid which leads me to where i once considered beginning this first chapter because i could have begun by telling you about richard abbott my soontobe stepfather set the story of my future life in motion in fact if my mom hadnt fallen in love with richard i might never have met miss frost before richard abbott joined the first sister players there was what my domineering aunt referred to as a dearth of leadingman material in our towns amateur theatrical society there were no truly terrifying villains and no young males with the romantic capability to make the younger and the older ladies in the audience swoon richard was not only tall dark and handsomehe was the embodiment of the cliché he was also thin richard was so thin that he bore in my eyes a remarkable likeness to my codeboy father who in the only picture i possessed of him was permanently thinand forever eating ice cream somewhere between the coast of southern italy and the caribbean naturally i would wonder if my mother was aware of the resemblance before richard abbott became an actor with the first sister players the males in our towns little theater were either incoherent mumblers with downcast eyes and furtive glances or the equally predictable overbearing hams who shouted their lines and made eyes at the easily offended matronly patrons a notable exception in the talent departmentfor he was a most talented actor if not in richard abbotts leaguewas my world war ii buff grandfather harold marshall whom everyone save my grandmother called harry he was the biggest employer in first sister vermont harry marshall had more employees than favorite river academy though the private school was surely the second biggest employer in our small town grandpa harry was the owner of the first sister sawmill and lumberyard harrys business partnera gloomy norwegian whom you will meet momentarilywas the forester the norwegian oversaw the logging operations but harry managed the sawmill and the lumberyard grandpa harry also signed all the checks and the green trucks that hauled the logs and the lumber were inscribed in small yellow capitals with the name marshall given my grandfathers elevated status in our town it was perhaps surprising that the first sister players always cast him in female roles my grandpa was a terrific female impersonator in our towns little playhouse harry marshall had many some would say most of the leading womens roles i actually remember my grandfather better as a woman than as a man he was more vibrant and engaged in his onstage female roles than i ever saw him be in his monotonous reallife role as a mill manager and lumberman alas it was a source of some family friction that grandpa harrys only competition for the most demanding and rewarding female roles was his elder daughter murielmy mothers married sister my oftmentioned aunt aunt muriel was only two years older than my mother yet shed done everything before my mom had thought of doing it and muriel had done it properly and in her estimation to perfection shed allegedly read world literature at wellesley and had married my wonderful uncle bobher first and only beau as aunt muriel called him at least i thought uncle bob was wonderful he was always wonderful to me but as i later learned bob drank and his drinking was a burden and an embarrassment to aunt muriel my grandmother from whom muriel had obtained her imperiousness would often remark that bobs behavior was beneath murielwhatever that meant for all her snobbishness my grandmothers language was riddled with proverbial expressions and clichés and in spite of her highly prized education aunt muriel seemed to have inherited or she merely mimicked the ordinariness of her mothers uninspired speech i think that muriels love and need for the theater was driven by her desire to find something original for her loftysounding voice to say muriel was goodlookinga slender brunette with an opera singers noteworthy bosom and booming voicebut she had an absolutely vacuous mind like my grandmother aunt muriel managed to be both arrogant and judgmental without saying anything that was either verifiable or interesting in this respect both my grandmother and my aunt struck me as superiorsounding bores in aunt muriels case her impeccable enunciation made her entirely credible onstage she was a perfect parrot but a robotic and humorless one and she was simply as sympathetic or unsympathetic as the character she played muriels language was elevated but her own character was lacking she was just a chronic complainer in my grandmothers case she was of an unyielding age and shed had a conservative upbringing these constraints led her to believe that the theater was essentially immoralor to be more forgiving amoraland that women should play no part in it victoria winthrop the winthrop was my grandmothers maiden name believed that all the womens roles in any dramatic performance should be played by boys and men while she confessed to finding my grandfathers many onstage triumphs as various women embarrassing she also believed this was the way drama should be enactedstrictly by male actors my grandmotheri called her nana victoriafound it tiresome that muriel was inconsolable for days when she lost a plum part to grandpa harry in contrast harry was a good sport whenever the soughtafter role went to his daughter they must have wanted a goodlookin girl murielyou have me beat in that category hands down im not so sure my grandfather was smallboned and had a pretty face he was light on his feet and effortless at girlish laughter and at sobbing his heart out he could be convincing as a scheming woman or as a wronged one and he was more convincing with the onstage kisses he gave to various miscast men than my aunt muriel ever managed to be muriel cringed at onstage kissing though uncle bob didnt mind bob seemed to enjoy seeing his wife and his fatherinlaw bestowing kisses onstagea good thing too since they had the leading female roles in most of the productions now that im older i have more appreciation for uncle bob who seemed to enjoy many people and things and who managed to convey to me an unexpressed but sincere commiseration i believe that bob understood where the winthrop side of the family was coming from those winthrop women were long accustomed or genetically inclined to looking down their noses at the rest of us bob took pity on me because he knew that nana victoria and aunt muriel and even my mother were watching me warily for telltale signs that i wasas they all feared as i feared myselfmy nogood fathers son i was being judged for the genes of a man i didnt know and uncle bob perhaps because he drank and was considered beneath muriel knew what it felt like to be judged by the winthrop side of the family uncle bob was the admissions man at favorite river academy that the schools standards for admission were lax did not necessarily make my uncle personally accountable for favorite rivers failures yet bob was judged by the winthrop side of the family he was called overly permissiveanother reason i thought he was wonderful though i remember hearing about bobs drinking from a variety of sources i never saw him drunkwell except for one spectacular occasion in fact in the years i was growing up in first sister vermont i believed that bobs drinking problem was exaggerated those winthrop women were known for their overstatements in the morally outraged category righteous indignation was a winthrop trait it was during the summer of when i was traveling with tom that it somehow came up that bob was my uncle i knowi havent told you about tom youll have to be patient with me its hard for me to get to tom for tom and me this was that allegedly allimportant summer between our graduation from prep school and the start of our freshman year in college toms family and mine had granted us a reprieve from our usual summer jobs so that we could travel we were probably expected to be satisfied with spending no more than a single summer in that doubtful pursuit of finding ourselves but for tom and me the gift of this summer didnt seem as allimportant as that time in your life is supposed to be for one thing we had no money and the sheer foreignness of european travel frightened us for another wed already found ourselves and there was no making peace with who we werenot publicly indeed there were aspects of ourselves that poor tom and i found every bit as foreign and as frightening as what we managed to see in our halfassed way of europe i dont even remember the reason uncle bobs name came up and tom already knew i was related to old letemin bob as tom called him were not related by blood id started to explain notwithstanding uncle bobs bloodalcohol level at any given time there wasnt a drop of winthrop blood in him youre not at all alike tom had exclaimed bob is just so nice and so uncomplicated granted tom and i had been arguing a lot that summer wed taken one of the queen ships student class from new york to southampton wed crossed to the continent landing in ostend and the first town in europe wed stayed overnight in was the medieval city of bruges bruges was beautiful but i was more infatuated with a girl who worked at the pension where we stayed than i was with the belfry atop the old market hall i suppose you were intending to ask her if she had a friend for me tom said we just walked all over townwe just talked and talked i told him we barely kissed oh is that all tom saidso when he later remarked that uncle bob was just so nice and so uncomplicated i took it that tom meant i wasnt nice i just meant that youre complicated bill tom told me youre not as easygoing as admissions man bob are you i cant believe youre pissed off about that girl in bruges i told him you should have seen how you stared at her titsthey didnt amount to much you know billgirls know when youre staring at their tits tom told me but the girl in bruges was of no importance to me it was only that her small breasts had reminded me of the rise and fall of miss frosts surprisingly girlish breasts and id not gotten over miss frost oh the winds of change they do not blow gently into the small towns of northern new england the first casting call that brought richard abbott to our towns little theater would even change how the womens roles were cast for it was evident from the start that those parts calling for dashing young men and evil or plainly bourgeois husbands and treacherous lovers were all within richard abbotts grasp hence the women chosen to play opposite richard would have to match up to him this posed a problem for grandpa harry who would soon be richards fatherinlawgrandpa harry was too much the older woman to be romantically involved with a handsome young man like richard in the first place there would be no onstage kissing for richard abbott and grandpa harry and befitting her superiorsounding voice but emptyminded character this posed a greater problem for my aunt muriel richard abbott was too much leadingman material for her his appearance at that very first casting call reduced muriel to psychosexual babble and dithering my devastated aunt said later that she could tell my mom and richard were moonstruck by each other from the start it was altogether too much for muriel to imagine being romantically involved with her future brotherinlaweven onstage and with my mother prompting them no less at thirteen i detected little of my aunt muriels consternation at encountering for the first time what leadingman material was like nor did i recognize that my mom and richard abbott were moonstruck by each other from the start grandpa harry was charming and entirely welcoming to the graceful young man who was brandnew to the faculty at favorite river academy were always lookin for new actin talent grandpa said warmly to richard did you say it was shakespeare youre teachin teaching and putting onstage richard answered my grandfather there are theatrical disadvantages at an allboys school of coursebut the best way for young boys or girls to understand shakespeare is for them to put on the plays you mean by disadvantages i would guess that the boys have to play the womens roles grandpa harry said slyly richard abbott upon first meeting the mill manager harry marshall could not have known about the lumbermans success as an onstage crossdresser most boys havent the vaguest idea how to be a womanits a mortal distraction from the play richard said ah grandpa harry said then how will you manage it im thinking of asking the younger faculty wives to audition for roles richard abbott replied and the older faculty daughters maybe ah grandpa harry said again there might be townspeople who are also qualified my grandfather suggested hed always wanted to play regan or goneril lears loathsome daughters as grandpa alliteratively spoke of them not to mention how he longed to play lady macbeth im considering open auditions richard abbott said but i hope the older women wont be intimidating to the boys at an allboys school ah welltheres always that grandpa harry said with a knowing smile as an older woman hed been intimidating countless times harry marshall had merely to look at his wife and elder daughter to know how female intimidation worked but at thirteen i was unaware of my grandfathers jockeying for more womens roles the conversation between grandpa harry and the new leading man seemed entirely friendly and natural to me what i noticed on that fall friday nightcasting calls were always on friday nightswas how the dynamic between our theaters dictatorial director and our variously talented and untalented wouldbe cast was changed by richard abbotts knowledge of the theater as much as by richards gifts as an actor the stern director of the first sister players had never been challenged as a dramaturge before our little theaters director who said he had no interest in merely acting was no amateur in the area of dramaturgy and he was a selfappointed expert on ibsen whom he worshipped to excess our heretoforeunchallenged director nils borkmanthe aforementioned norwegian who was also grandpa harrys business partner and as such a forester and logger and dramaturgewas the very picture of scandinavian depression and melancholic forebodings logging was nils borkmans businessor at least his day jobbut dramaturgy was his passion it further contributed to the norwegians everblackening pessimism that the unsophisticated theatergoers in first sister vermont were unschooled in serious drama a steady diet of agatha christie was expected even nauseatingly welcome in our culturally deprived town nils borkman visibly suffered through the ceaseless adaptations of lowbrow potboilers like murder at the vicarage a miss marple mystery my superiorsounding aunt muriel had many times played miss marple but the denizens of first sister preferred grandpa harry in that shrewd but ohsofeminine role harry seemed more believable at divining other peoples secretsnot to mention at miss marples age more feminine at one rehearsal harry had whimsically saidas miss marple herself might havemy word but who would want colonel protheroe dead to which my mom ever the prompter had remarked daddy that line isnt even in the script i know maryi was just foolin around grandpa said my mother mary marshallmary dean for those unlucky fourteen years before she married richard abbottalways called my grandpa daddy harry was unfailingly addressed as father by my loftysounding aunt muriel in the same blacktiedinner tone of voice that nana victoria unstintingly hailed her husband as haroldnever harry nils borkman directed agatha christies crowdpleasers as he mockingly referred to them as if he were doomed to be watching death on the nile or peril at end house on the night of his deathas if his indelible memory of ten little indians might be the one he would take to his grave agatha christie was borkmans curse which the norwegian bore less than stoicallyhe hated her and he complained about her bitterlybut because he filled the house with agatha christie and similarly shallow entertainments of the time the morbid norwegian was permitted to direct something serious as the fall play every year something serious to coincide with that time of year when the leafs are dying borkman saidthe leafs word indicating that his command of english was usually clear but imperfect that was nils in a nutshellusually clear but imperfect on that friday casting call when richard abbott would change many futures nils announced that this falls something serious would again be his beloved ibsen and nils had narrowed the choice of which ibsen to a mere three which three the young and talented richard abbott asked the problem three nils answeredhe presumed definitively i take it you mean hedda gabler and a dolls house richard rightly guessed and would the third be the wild duck by borkmans uncharacteristic speechlessness we all saw that indeed the dreaded wild duck was the dour norwegians third choice in that case richard abbott ventured after the telltale silence who among us can possibly play the doomed hedvigthat poor child there were no fourteenyearold girls at the friday night casting callno one at all suitable for the innocent duckloving and daddyloving hedvig weve had difficulties with the hedvig part before nils grandpa harry ventured oh myhad we ever thered been tragicomic fourteenyearold girls who were such abysmal actors that when the time came for them to shoot themselves the audience had cheered thered been fourteenyearold girls who were so winningly naïve and innocent that when they shot themselves the audience was outraged and then theres gregers richard abbott interjected that miserable moralizer i could play gregers but only as a meddlesome foola selfrighteous and selfpitying clown nils borkman often referred to his fellow norwegians who were suicidal as fjordjumpers apparently the abundance of fjords in norway provided many opportunities for convenient and unmessy suicides nils must have noticed to his further gloom that there were no fjords in vermonta landlocked state nils now looked at richard abbott in such a scary wayit was as if our depressed director wanted this upstart newcomer to find the nearest fjord but gregers is an idealist borkman began if the wild duck is a tragedy then gregers is a fool and a clownand hjalmar is nothing more than a jealous husband of the pathetic beforeshemetme kind richard continued if on the other hand you play the wild duck as a comedy then theyre all fools and clowns but how can the play be a comedy when a child dies because of adult moralizing you need a heartbreaking hedvig who must be an utterly innocent and naïve fourteenyearold and not only gregers but hjalmar and gina and even mrs sørby and old ekdal and the villainous werle must be brilliant actors even then the play is flawednot the easiest amateur production of ibsen that comes to mind flawed nils borkman cried as if he and his wild duck had been shot i was mrs sørby in the most recent manifestation my grandfather told richard of course when i was younger i got to play ginaalbeit only once or twice i had thoughts of young laura gordon as hedvig nils said laura was the youngest gordon girl jim gordon was on the faculty at favorite river academy he and his wife ellen had been actors for the first sister players in the past and two older gordon daughters had previously shot themselves as poor hedvig excuse me nils my aunt muriel interposed but laura gordon has highly visible breasts i saw i was not alone in noticing the fourteenyearolds astonishing development laura was barely a year older than i was but her breasts were way beyond what an innocent and naïve hedvig should have nils borkman sighed he said with nearsuicidal resignation to richard and what would the young mr abbott consider an easier ibsen for us mortally mere amateurs to perform nils meant merely mortal of course ah grandpa harry began then he stopped himself my grandfather was enjoying this he had the utmost respect and affection for nils borkman as a business partner butwithout exceptionevery keenly devoted and most casual member of the first sister players knew nils to be an absolute tyrant as a director and we were almost as sick of henrik ibsen and borkmans idea of serious drama as we were of agatha christie well richard abbott began there was a thoughtful pause if its going to be ibsenand we are after all only amateursit should be either hedda gabler or a dolls house no children at all in the former and the children are of no importance as actors in the latter of course there is the need for a very strong and complicated womanin either playand for the usual weak or unlikable men or both weak or unlikable or both nils borkman asked in disbelief heddas husband george is ineffectual and conventionalan awful combination of weaknesses but an utterly common condition in men richard abbott continued eilert løvborg is an insecure weakling whereas judge bracklike his nameis despicable doesnt hedda shoot herself because of her foreseeable future with both her ineffectual husband and the despicable brack are norwegians always shooting themselves nils my grandfather asked in a mischievous way harry knew how to push borkmans buttons this time however nils resisted a fjordjumping storyhe ignored his old friend and crossdressing business partner grandpa harry had played hedda many times hed been nora in a dolls house toobut at his age he was no longer suitable for either of these female leads and what weaknesses and other unlikable traits do the male characters in a dolls house present us withif i may ask the young mr abbott borkman sputtered wringing his hands husbands are not ibsens favorite people richard abbott began there was no pausing to think nowhe had all the confidence of youth and a brandnew education torvald helmer noras husbandwell hes not unlike heddas husband hes both boring and conventionalthe marriage is stifling krogstad is a wounded man and a corrupted one hes not without some redeeming decency but the weakness word also comes to mind in krogstads case and dr rank borkman asked dr rank is of no real importance we need a nora or a hedda richard abbott said in heddas case a woman who prizes her freedom enough to kill herself in order not to lose it her suicide is not a weakness but a demonstration of her sexual strength unfortunatelyor fortunately depending on your point of viewrichard took this moment to glance at aunt muriel her good looks and opera singers swaggering bosom notwithstanding muriel was not a tower of sexual strength she fainted murielno histrionics please grandpa harry cried but muriel consciously or unconsciously had foreseen that she did not match up well with the confident young newcomer the sudden shining star of leadingman material muriel had physically taken herself out of the running for hedda and in the case of nora nils said to richard abbott barely pausing to survey my mothers ministrations to her older domineering but now fainted sister muriel suddenly sat up with a dazed expression her bosom dramatically heaving breathe in through your nose muriel and out through your mouth my mother prompted her sister i know maryi know muriel said with exasperation but youre doing it the other wayyou know in through your mouth and out through your nose my mother said well richard abbott started to say then he stopped even i saw how he looked at my mom richard whod lost the toes of his left foot to a lawnmower accident which disqualified him from military service had come to teach at favorite river academy directly upon receiving a masters degree in the history of theater and drama richard had been born and grew up in western massachusetts he had fond memories of family ski vacations in vermont when hed been a child a job for which he was overqualified in first sister vermont had attracted him for sentimental reasons richard abbott was only four years older than my codeboy father had been in that photographwhen the sergeant was en route to trinidad in richard was twentyfivemy mom was thirtyfive richard was a whopping ten years younger than my mother mom must have liked younger men shed certainly liked me better when i was younger and do you act miss richard began again but my mom knew he was speaking to her and she cut him off no im just the prompter she told him i dont act ah but mary grandpa harry began i dont daddy my mother said you and muriel are the actresses she said with no uncertain emphasis on the actresses word im always the prompter about nora nils borkman asked richard you were something saying nora is more about freedom than hedda richard abbott confidently said she not only has the strength to leave her husband she leaves her children too there is such an untamable freedom in these womeni say let your actor who will be hedda or nora choose these women own these plays as he spoke richard abbott was surveying our amateur theatrical society for possible heddas or noras but his eyes kept coming back to my mother who i knew was obdurately forever the prompter richard would not make a hedda or a nora out of my followthescript mom ah well grandpa harry said he was reconsidering the part either nora or hedda his age notwithstanding no harrynot you again nils said his old dictatorial self emerging young mr abbott is right there must be a certain lawlessnessboth an uncontainable freedom and a sexual strength we need a younger more sexual activity woman than you richard abbott was regarding my grandfather with growing respect richard saw how grandpa harry had established himself as a woman to be reckoned with among the first sister playersif not as a sexual activity woman wont you consider it muriel borkman asked my superiorsounding aunt yes will you richard abbott who was more than a decade younger than muriel asked you have an unquestionable sexual presence he started to say alas that was as far as young mr abbott gotthe presence word modified by sexualbefore muriel fainted again i think thats a no if i had to guess my mom told the dazzling young newcomer i already had a bit of a crush on richard abbott but i hadnt yet met miss frost in two years time when i sat as a fifteenyearold freshman in my first morning meeting at favorite river academy i would hear the school physician dr harlow invite us boys to treat the most common afflictions of our tender age aggressively i am certain that he used the word afflictions im not making this up as for what these most common afflictions were dr harlow explained that he meant acne and an unwelcome sexual attraction to other boys or men for our pimples dr harlow assured us there was a variety of remedies in regard to those early indications of homosexual yearningswell either dr harlow or the school psychiatrist dr grau would be happy to talk to us there is a cure for these afflictions dr harlow told us boys there was a doctors customary authority in his voice which was at once scientific and cajolingeven the cajoling part was delivered in a confident mantoman way and the gist of dr harlows morningmeeting speech was perfectly clear even to the greenest freshmennamely we had only to present ourselves and ask to be treated what was also painfully apparent was that we had only ourselves to blame if we didnt ask to be cured i would wonder later if it might have made a differencethat is if id been exposed to dr harlows or dr graus buffoonery at the time i first met richard abbott instead of two years after meeting him given what i know now i sincerely doubt that my crush on richard abbott was curable though the likes of dr harlow and dr grauthe available authorities in the medical sciences of that timeemphatically believed that my crush on richard was in the category of a treatable affliction two years after that lifechanging casting call it would be too late for a cure on the road ahead a world of crushes would open before me that friday night casting call was my introduction to richard abbott to everyone presentnot least to aunt muriel who fainted twiceit was obvious that richard had taken charge of us all it seems that we need a nora or a hedda if were going to do ibsen at all richard said to nils but the leafs they are already colorchanging they will keep falling borkman said it is the dying time of the year he was not the easiest man to understand except that borkmans beloved ibsen and fjordjumping were somehow connected to the serious drama which was always our fall playand to no less the socalled dying time of the year when the leafs were unstoppably falling looking back of course it seems such an innocent timeboth the dying time of the year and that relatively uncomplicated time in my life chapter crushes on the wrong people how long was it after that unsuccessful casting call before my mom and young richard abbott were dating knowing mary ill bet they were doing it immediately id overheard aunt muriel say only once had my mother ventured away from home shed gone off to college no one ever said where and she had dropped out shed managed only to get pregnant she didnt even finish secretarial school moreover to add to her moral and educational failure for fourteen years my mother and her almostabastard son had borne the dean namefor the sake of conventional legitimacy i suppose mary marshall dean did not dare to leave home again the world had wounded her too gravely she lived with my scornful clichéencumbered grandmother who was as critical of her blacksheep daughter as my superiorsounding aunt muriel was only grandpa harry had kind and encouraging words for his baby girl as he called her from the way he said this i got the impression that he thought my mom had suffered some lasting damage grandpa harry was ever my champion toohe lifted my spirits when i was down as he repeatedly tried to bolster my mothers everfailing selfconfidence in addition to her duties as prompter for the first sister players my mom worked as a secretary in the sawmill and lumberyard as the owner and mill manager grandpa harry chose to overlook the fact that my mother had failed to finish secretarial schoolher typing sufficed for him there must have been remarks made about my motheri mean among the sawmill men the things they said were not about her typing and ill bet theyd heard them first from their wives or girlfriends the sawmill men would have noticed that my mom was pretty but im sure the women in their lives were the origin of the remarks made about mary marshall dean around the lumberyardor more dangerously in the logging camps i say more dangerously because nils borkman supervised the logging camps men were always getting injured there but were they sometimes injured because of their remarks about my mom one guy or another was always getting hurt at the lumberyard toooccasionally ill bet it was a guy who was repeating what hed heard his wife or girlfriend say about my mother her socalled husband hadnt been in any hurry to marry her hed never lived with her married or not and that boy had no fatherthose were the remarks made about my mom i imagine grandpa harry wasnt a fighting man im guessing that nils borkman stuck up for his beloved business partner and for my mother he cant work for six weeksnot with a busted collarbone nils id heard grandpa harry say every time you straighten out someone as you put it were stuck payin the workers compensation we can afford the workers compensation harryhell watch what he says the time next wont he nils would say the next time nils grandpa harry would gently correct his old friend in my eyes my mom was not only a couple of years younger than her mean sister muriel my mother was by far the prettier of the two marshall girls it didnt matter that my mom lacked muriels operatic bosom and booming voice mary marshall dean was altogether betterproportioned she was almost asianlooking to menot only because she was petite but because of her almondshaped face and how strikingly wide open and far apart her eyes were not to mention the acute smallness of her mouth a jewel richard abbott had dubbed her when they were first dating it became what richard called hernot mary just jewel the name stuck and how long was it after they were dating before richard abbott discovered that i didnt have my own library card not long it was still early in the fall because the leaves had just begun to change color my mom had revealed to richard that i wasnt much of a reader and this led to richards discovery that my mother and grandmother were bringing books home from our town library for me to reador not to read which was usually the case the other books that were brought into my life were handmedowns from my meddlesome aunt muriel these were mostly romance novels the ones my crude elder cousin had read and rejected occasionally cousin geraldine had expressed her contempt for these romances or for the main characters in the margins of the books gerryonly aunt muriel and my grandmother ever called her geraldinewas three years older than i was in that same fall when richard abbott was dating my mom i was thirteen and gerry sixteen since gerry was a girl she wasnt allowed to attend favorite river academy she was vehemently angry about the allboys factor at the private school because she was bused every school day to ezra fallsthe nearest public high school to first sister some of gerrys hatred of boys found its way into the marginalia she contributed to the handmedown romance novels some of her disdain for boycrazy girls was also vented in the margins of those pages whenever i was given a handmedown romance novel courtesy of aunt muriel i read gerrys comments in the margins immediately the novels themselves were stultifyingly boring but to the tiresome description of the heroines first kiss gerry wrote in the margin kiss me ill make your gums bleed ill make you piss yourself the heroine was a selfcongratulatory prig who would never let her boyfriend touch her breastsgerry responded in the margin with i would rub your tits raw just try to stop me as for the books my mother and grandmother brought home from the first sister public library they were at best adventure novels seafaring stories usually with pirates or zane grey westerns worst of all were the highly unlikely sciencefiction novels or the equally implausible futuristic tales couldnt my mom and nana victoria see for themselves that i was both mystified and frightened by life on earth i had no need of stimulation from distant galaxies and unknown planets and the present gripped me with sufficient incomprehension not to mention the daily terror of being misunderstood even to contemplate the future was nightmarishly unwelcome but why doesnt bill choose what books he likes for himself richard abbott asked my mother bill youre thirteen right what are you interested in except for grandpa harry and my everfriendly uncle bob the accused drinker no one had asked me this question before all i liked to read were the plays that were in rehearsal at the first sister players i imagined that i could learn these scripts as wordforword as my mother always learned them one day if my mom were sick or in an automobile accidentthere were car crashes galore in vermonti imagined i might be able to replace her as the prompter billy my mother said laughing in that seemingly innocent way she had tell richard what youre interested in im interested in me i said what books are there about someone like me i asked richard abbott oh you would be surprised bill richard told me the subject of childhood giving way to early adolescencewell there are many marvelous novels that have explored this pivotal comingofage territory come onlets go have a look at this hour have a look where my grandmother said with alarm this was after an early schoolnight supperit was not quite dark outside but it soon would be we were still sitting at the diningroom table surely richard can take bill to our towns little library vicky grandpa harry said nana looked as if shed been slapped she was so very much a victoria if only in her own mind that no one but my grandpa ever called her vicky and when he did she reacted with resentment every time im bettin that miss frost keeps the library open till nine most nights harry added miss frost my grandmother declared with evident distaste now nowtolerance vicky tolerance my grandfather said come on richard abbott said again to me lets go get you your own library cardthats a start the books will come later if i had to guess the books will soon flow flow my mom cried happily but with no small measure of disbelief you dont know billy richardhes just not much of a reader well see jewel richard said to her but he winked at me i had a growingly incurable crush on him if my mother was already falling in love with richard abbott she wasnt alone i remember that captivating nighteven such a commonplace thing as walking on the river street sidewalk with the enthralling richard abbott seemed romantic it was muggy like a summer night with a faroff thunderstorm brewing all the neighborhood children and dogs were at play in the river street backyards and the bell in the clock tower of favorite river academy tolled the hour it was only seven on a september school night and my childhood as richard had said was giving way to early adolescence exactly what about you are you interested in bill richard abbott asked me i wonder why i have sudden unexplainable crushes i said to him oh crushesyoull soon have many more of them richard said encouragingly crushes are common and to be expectedto be enjoyed he added sometimes the crushes are on the wrong people i tried to tell him but there are no wrong people to have crushes on bill richard assured me you cannot will yourself to have or not to have a crush on someone oh i said at thirteen this must have meant to me that a crush was more dire than id first thought its so funny to think that only six years later when i took that summerlong trip with tomthat trip to europe which got off to a bit of a bad start in brugesthe very idea of falling in love seemed no longer likely it even seemed impossible that summer i was only nineteen but i was already convinced that i would never fall in love again im not entirely sure what expectations poor tom had for that summer but i was still so inexperienced that i imagined id seen the last of a crush that was dire enough to hurt me in fact i was so woefully naïveso was tomthat i further imagined i had the rest of my life to recover from whatever slight damage i had done to myself in the throes of my love for miss frost id not been in enough relationships to realize the lasting effect that miss frost would have on me the damage wasnt slight as for tom i simply thought i had to be more circumspect in the looks i gave to the younger chambermaids or to those other smallbreasted girls and young women tom and i encountered in our travels i was aware that tom was insecure i knew how sensitive he was about being marginalized as he called ithe was always feeling overlooked or taken for granted or flatout ignored i thought i was being careful not to let my eyes linger on anyone else for too long but one nightwe were in rometom said to me i wish you would just stare at the prostitutes they like to be looked at bill and its frankly excruciating how i know youre thinking about themespecially that very tall one with the faint trace of a mustachebut you wont even look another nighti dont remember where we were but wed gone to bed and i thought tom was asleephe said in the dark its as if youve been shot in the heart bill but youre unaware of the hole or the loss of blood i doubt you even heard the shot but im getting ahead of myself alas its what a writer who knows the end of the story tends to do id better be getting back to richard abbott and that charming mans quest to get me my first library cardnot to mention richards valiant efforts to assure me a thirteenyearold that there were no wrong people to have crushes on there was almost no one in the library that september evening as i would later learn there rarely was most remarkably there were never any children in that library it would take me years to realize why two elderly women were reading on an uncomfortablelooking couch an old man had surrounded himself with stacks of books at one end of a long table but he seemed less determined to read all the books than he was driven to barricade himself from the two old ladies there were also two despondentlooking girls of high school age they and cousin gerry were fellow sufferers at the public high school in ezra falls the high school girls were probably doing what gerry had described to me as their forever minimal homework the dust long accumulated in the countless book bindings made me sneeze not allergic to books i hope someone saidthese were miss frosts first words to me and when i turned around and saw her i couldnt speak this boy would like a library card richard abbott said and just who would this boy be miss frost asked him not looking at me this is billy deanim sure you know mary marshall dean richard explained well bill is marys boy oh myyes miss frost exclaimed so this is that boy the thing about a small town like first sister vermont was that everyone knew the circumstances of my mother having mewith one of those husbands innameonly i had the feeling that everybody knew the history of my codeboy dad william francis dean was the disappearing kind of husband and father and all that remained of the sergeant in first sister vermont was his namewith a junior tacked on at the end of it miss frost may not have officially met me until this september night in but she surely knew all about me and you i presume are not mr deanyoure not this boys father are you miss frost asked richard oh no richard started to say i thought not said miss frost you are then she waited she had no intention of finishing that halted sentence richard abbott richard announced the new teacher miss frost declared hired with the fervent hope that someone at favorite river academy should be able to teach those boys shakespeare yes richard said surprised that the public librarian would know the details of the private schools mission in hiring himnot only to teach english but to get the boys to read and understand shakespeare i was marginally more surprised than richard while id heard him tell my grandfather about his interest in shakespeare this was the first id heard of his shakespearean mission it seemed that richard abbott had been hired to beat the boys silly with shakespeare well good luck miss frost told him ill believe it when i see it she added smiling at me and are you going to put on any of shakespeares plays she asked richard i believe thats the only way to make the boys read and understand shakespeare richard told her theyve got to see the plays performedbetter yet theyve got to perform them all those boys playing girls and women miss frost speculated shaking her head talk about willing suspension of disbelief and all the other stuff that coleridge said miss frost remarked still smiling at me i normally disliked it when someone ruffled my hair but when miss frost did it i just beamed back at her that was coleridge wasnt it she asked richard yes it was he said he was quite taken with her i could tell and if he hadnt so recently fallen in love with my motherwell who knows miss frost was a knockout in my unseasoned opinion not the hand that ruffled my hair but her other hand now rested on the table next to richard abbotts hands yet when miss frost saw me looking at their hands she took her hand off the table i felt her fingers lightly touch my shoulder and what might you be interested in reading william she asked it is william isnt it yes i answered her thrilled william sounded so grown up i was embarrassed to have developed a crush on my mothers boyfriend it seemed much more permissible to be developing an even bigger crush on the statuesque miss frost her hands i had noticed were both broader in the palms and longer in the fingers than richard abbotts hands andstanding as they were beside each otheri saw that miss frosts upper arms were more substantial than richards and her shoulders were broader she was taller than richard too there was one similarity richard was so very youthfullookinghe seemed to be almost as young as a favorite river academy student he might have needed to shave only once or twice a week and miss frost despite the broad shoulders and her stronglooking upper arms and i only now noticed the conspicuous breadth of her chest had these small breasts miss frost had young barely emerging breastsor so they seemed to me though at thirteen i was a relatively recent noticer of breasts my cousin gerry had bigger ones even fourteenyearold laura gordon who was too bosomy to play hedvig in the wild duck had more highly visible breasts as my breastconscious aunt muriel had observed than the otherwise imposing miss frost i was too smitten to utter a wordi couldnt answer herbut miss frost very patiently asked me her question again william youre interested in reading i presume but could you tell me if you like fiction or nonfictionand what subject in particular you prefer miss frost asked ive seen this boy at our little theater she said suddenly to richard ive spotted you backstage williamyou seem very observant yes i am i scarcely managed to say indeed id been so observant of miss frost that i could have masturbated on the spot but instead i summoned the strength to say do you know any novels about young people who have dangerous crushes miss frost stared at me unflinchingly dangerous crushes she repeated explain whats dangerous about a crush a crush on the wrong person i told her i said in effect theres no such thing richard abbott interjected there are no wrong people were free to have crushes on anyone we want there are no wrong people to have crushes onare you kidding miss frost asked richard on the contrary william there is some notable literature on the subject of crushes on the wrong people she said to me well thats what bill is into richard told miss frost crushes on the wrong people thats quite a category miss frost said she was all the while smiling beautifully at me im going to start you out slowlytrust me on this one william you cant rush into crushes on the wrong people just what do you have in mind richard abbott asked her are we talking romeo and juliet here the problems between the montagues and the capulets were not romeos and juliets problems miss frost said romeo and juliet were the right people for each other it was their families that were fucked up i see richard saidthe fucked up remark shocked him and me it seemed so unlike a librarian two sisters come to mind miss frost said quickly moving on both richard abbott and i misunderstood her we were thinking that she meant to say something clever about my mother and aunt muriel id once imagined that the town of first sister had been named for muriel she exuded sufficient selfimportance to have had a whole town albeit a small one named for her but grandpa harry had set me straight about the origins of our towns name favorite river was a tributary of the connecticut river when the first woodsmen were logging the connecticut river valley they renamed some of the rivers from which they ran logs into and down the connecticutfrom both the new hampshire and vermont sides of the big river maybe they hadnt liked all the indian names those early river drivers named favorite riverwhat they called a straight shot into the connecticut with few bends that could cause log jams as for naming our town first sister that was because of the millpond which was created by the dam on the favorite river with our sawmill and the lumberyard we became a first sister to those other bigger mill towns on the connecticut river i found grandpa harrys explanation of first sisters origins to be less exciting than my earliest assumption that our small town had been named for my mothers older bullying sister but both richard abbott and i were thinking about those two marshall girls when miss frost made her remarktwo sisters come to mind miss frost must have noticed that i appeared puzzled and richard had lost his leadingman aura he seemed confused even unsure of himself miss frost then said i mean the brontë sisters obviously obviously richard cried he looked relieved emily brontë wrote wuthering heights miss frost explained to me and charlotte brontë wrote jane eyre never trust a man with a lunatic wife in an attic richard told me and anyone named heathcliff should make you suspicious those are some crushes miss frost said meaningfully but arent they womens crushes richard asked the librarian bill might have a young mans crush or crushes more in mind crushes are crushes miss frost said without hesitation its the writing that matters youre not suggesting that wuthering heights and jane eyre are novels for women only are you certainly not of course its the writing that matters richard abbott exclaimed i just meant that a more masculine adventure more masculine miss frost repeated well i suppose theres fielding she added oh yes richard cried do you mean tom jones i do miss frost replied with a sigh if one can count sexual escapades as one result of crushes why not richard abbott quickly said youre how old miss frost asked me once again her long fingers touched my shoulder i recalled how aunt muriel had fainted twice and briefly feared i would soon lose consciousness im thirteen i told her three novels are enough of a beginning at thirteen she said to richard it wouldnt be wise to overload him with crushes at too young an age lets just see where these three novels lead him shall we once more miss frost smiled at me begin with the fielding she advised me its arguably the most primitive youll find that the brontë sisters are more emotionalmore psychological theyre more grownup novelists miss frost richard abbott said have you ever been onstagehave you ever acted only in my mind she answered him almost flirtatiously when i was youngerall the time richard gave me a conspiratorial look i knew perfectly well what the talented young newcomer to the first sister players was thinking a tower of sexual strength stood before us to richard and me miss frost was a woman with an untamable freedoma certain lawlessness definitely accompanied her to a younger man richard abbott and to mei was a thirteenyearold daydreamer who suddenly desired to write the story of my crushes on the wrong people and to have sex with a librarian in her thirtiesmiss frost was an unquestionable sexual presence theres a part for you miss frost richard abbott ventured while we followed her through the stacks where she was gathering my first three literary novels actually one of two possible parts i pointed out yes you have to choose richard quickly added its either hedda in hedda gabler or nora in a dolls house do you know ibsen these are often called problem plays thats some choice miss frost said smiling at me either i get to shoot myself in the temple or i get to be the kind of woman who abandons her three young children i think its a positive decision in both cases richard abbott tried to reassure her oh how very positive miss frost said laughingwith a wave of her longfingered hand when she laughed there was something hoarse and low in her voice which almost immediately jumped to a higher clearer register nils borkman is the director i warned miss frost i was feeling protective of her already and wed only just met my dear boy miss frost said to me as if theres a soul in first sister who doesnt know that a neurosesridden norwegianno neophyte to serious dramais our little theaters director she said suddenly to richard i would be interested to knowif a dolls house is the ibsen that we choose and i am to be the muchmisunderstood norahow you will be cast mr richard abbott before richard could answer her miss frost went on my guess is that you would be torvald helmer noras dull and uncomprehending husbandhe whose life nora saves but he cant save hers i would guess that is how i will be cast richard ventured cautiously of course im not the director you must tell me richard abbott if you intend to flirt with mei dont mean in our onstage roles miss frost said nonot at all richard cried im seriously flirting with bills mom very well thenthats the right answer she told himonce more ruffling my hair but she kept talking to richard and if its hedda gabler that we do and im heddawell the decision regarding your role is a more complicated one isnt it yes i suppose it is richard said thoughtfully i hope in the case of hedda gabler i am not the dull uncomprehending husbandi would hate to be george richard said who wouldnt hate to be george miss frost asked him theres the writer hedda destroys richard speculated i dont put it past nils to cast me as eilert løvborg you would be wrong for the part miss frost declared that leaves judge brack richard abbott surmised that might be fun miss frost told him i shoot myself to escape your clutches i could well imagine being destroyed by that richard abbott said most graciously they were acting even nowi could telland they were not amateurs my mother wouldnt need to be doing much prompting in their cases i didnt imagine that richard abbott or miss frost would ever forget a line or misspeak a single word i shall think about it and get back to you miss frost told richard there was a tall narrow dimly lit mirror in the foyer of the library where a long row of coat hooks revealed a solitary raincoatprobably miss frosts she glanced at her hair in the mirror ive been considering longer hair she said as if to her double i imagine hedda with somewhat longer hair richard said do you miss frost asked but she was smiling at me again just look at you william she said suddenly talk about coming of agejust look at this boy i must have blushed or looked awayclutching those three comingofage novels to my heart miss frost chose well i would read tom jones wuthering heights and jane eyrein that orderthus becoming to my moms surprise a reader and what those novels taught me was that adventure was not confined to seafaring with or without pirates one could find considerable excitement by not escaping to science fiction or futuristic fantasies it wasnt necessary to read a western or a romance novel in order to transport oneself in reading as in writing all one neededthat is in order to have an utterly absorbing journeywas a believable but formidable relationship what else after all did crushesespecially crushes on the wrong peoplelead to well bill lets get you home so you can start reading richard abbott said that warm september evening andturning to miss frost in the foyer of the libraryhe said in a voice not his own the last thing judge brack says to hedda in act we shall get on capitally together we two there would be two months of rehearsals for hedda gabler that fall so i would become most familiar with that linenot to mention the last lines hedda says in response she has already exited the stage butspeaking offstage loud and clear as the stage directions saymiss frost as hedda responds yes dont you flatter yourself we will judge brack now that you are the one cock in the basket a shot is heard within the stage directions then say do i sincerely love that play or did i adore it because richard abbott and miss frost brought it to life for me grandpa harry was outstanding in a small rolethat of georges aunt juliana miss tesmanand my aunt muriel was the needy comrade of eilert løvborg mrs elvsted well that was some performance richard abbott said to me as we strolled along the river street sidewalk on that warm september evening it was dark now and a distant thunder was in the air but the neighborhood backyards were quiet children and dogs had been brought indoors and richard was walking me home what performance i asked him i mean miss frost richard exclaimed i mean her performance the books you should read all that stuff about crushes and her elaborate dance about whether she would play nora or hedda you mean she was always acting i asked him once again i felt protective of her without knowing why i take it that you liked her richard said i loved her i blurted out understandable he said nodding his head didnt you like her i asked him oh yes i didi do like herand i think shell be a perfect hedda richard said if shell do it i cautioned him oh shell do itof course shes going to do it richard declared she was just toying with me toying i repeated not sure if he was criticizing miss frost i was not at all certain that richard had liked her sufficiently listen to me bill richard said let the librarian be your new best friend if you like what shes given you to read trust her the library the theater a passion for novels and playswell bill this could be the door to your future at your age i lived in a library now novels and plays are my life this was all so overwhelming it was staggering to imagine that there were novels about crusheseven perhaps especially crushes on the wrong people furthermore our towns amateur theatrical society would be performing ibsens hedda gabler with a brandnew leading man and with a tower of sexual strength and untamable freedom in the leading female role and not only did my wounded mother have a beau as aunt muriel and nana victoria referred to richard abbott but my uncomfortable crush on richard had been supplanted i was now in love with a librarian who was old enough to be my mother my seemingly unnatural attraction to richard abbott notwithstanding i felt a new and unknown lust for miss frostnot to mention that i suddenly had all this serious reading to do no wonder that when richard and i came in the house from our excursion to the library my grandmother felt my foreheadi must have looked flushed as if i had a fever too much excitement for a school night billy nana victoria said nonsense grandpa harry said show me the books you have bill miss frost chose them for me i told him handing him the novels miss frost my grandmother again declared her contempt rising vicky vicky grandpa harry cautioned her like little backtoback slaps mommy please dont my mother said theyre great novels my grandfather announced in fact theyre classics i daresay miss frost knows what novels a young boy should read i daresay nana repeated haughtily there then followed some difficulttounderstand nastiness from my grandmother concerning miss frosts actual age i dont mean her professed age nana victoria cried i offered that i thought miss frost was my moms age or a little younger but grandpa harry and my mother looked at each other next came what i was familiar with from the theatera pause no miss frost is closer to muriels age my grandpa said that woman is older than muriel my grandmother snapped actually theyre about the same age my mother very quietly said at the time all this meant to me was that miss frost was youngerlooking than muriel in truth i gave the matter little thought nana victoria evidently didnt like miss frost and muriel had issues with miss frosts breasts or her brasor both it would be lateri dont remember when exactly but it was several months later after i was regularly in the habit of getting novels from miss frost in our towns public librarywhen i overheard my mean aunt muriel talking about miss frost to my mother in that same tone of voice my grandmother had used and i suppose that she has not progressed from the ridiculous training bra to which my mom merely shook her head i would ask richard abbott about it albeit indirectly what are training bras richard i asked him seemingly out of the blue something youre reading about bill richard asked no i just wondered i told him well bill training bras arent something i know a great deal about richard began but i believe they are designed to be a young girls first bra why training i asked well bill richard continued i guess the training part of the bra works like this a girl whose breasts are newly forming wears a training bra so that her breasts begin to get the idea of what a bra is all about oh i said i was completely baffled i couldnt imagine why miss frosts breasts needed to be trained at all and the concept that breasts have ideas was also new and troubling to me yet my infatuation with miss frost had certainly shown me that my penis had ideas that seemed entirely separate from my own thoughts and if penises could have ideas it was not such a stretch for a thirteenyearold to imagine that breasts could also think for themselves in the literature miss frost was presenting me with at an ever increasing rate id not yet encountered a novel from a peniss point of view or one where the ideas that a womans breasts have are somehow disturbing to the woman herselfor to her family and friends yet such novels seemed possible if only in the way that my ever having sex with miss frost also seemed albeit remotely possible was it prescient of miss frost to make me wait for dickensto work up to him as it were and the first dickens she allowed me was not what ive called the crucial one she made me wait for great expectations too i began as many a dickens reader has with oliver twist that young and gothic novelthe hangmans noose at newgate casts its macabre shadow over several of the novels most memorable characters one thing dickens and hardy have in common is the fatalistic belief that particularly in the case of the young and innocent the character with a good heart and unbudging integrity is at the greatest risk in a menacing world miss frost had the good sense to make me wait for hardy too thomas hardy is not thirteenyearold material in the case of oliver i readily identified with the resilient orphans progress the criminal ratinfested alleys of dickenss london were excitingly far far away from first sister vermont and i was more forgiving than miss frost who criticized the early novels creaky plot mechanism as she called it dickenss inexperience as a novelist shows miss frost pointed out to me at thirteen going on fourteen i wasnt critical of inexperience to me fagin was a lovable monster bill sikes was purely terrifyingeven his dog bullseye was evil i was seduced actually kissed by the artful dodger in my dreamsno more winning or fluid a pickpocket ever existed i cried when sikes murdered the goodhearted nancy but i also cried when sikess loyal bullseye leaps from the parapet for the dead mans shoulders bullseye misses his mark the dog falls to the street below dashing out his brains melodramatic dont you think miss frost asked me and oliver cries too much he is more of a cipher for dickenss abundant passion for damaged children than he is ever a fully fleshedout character she told me that dickens would write better of these themes and of such children in his more mature novelsmost notably in david copperfield the next dickens she gave me and great expectations for which i was made to wait when mr brownlow takes oliver to those dreadful walls of newgate which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguishwhere fagin is waiting to be hangedi cried for poor fagin too its a good sign when a boy cries reading a novel miss frost assured me a good sign i asked her it means you have more of a heart than most boys have was all she would say about my crying when i was reading with what miss frost described as the reckless desperation of a burglar ravishing a mansion she one day said to me slow down william savor dont gorge and when you love a book commit one glorious sentence of itperhaps your favorite sentenceto memory that way you wont forget the language of the story that moved you to tears if miss frost thought oliver cried too much i wondered what she really thought of me in the case of oliver twist alas i forget which sentence i chose to memorize after david copperfield miss frost gave me my first taste of thomas hardy was i then fourteen going on fifteen yes i think so richard abbott happened to be teaching the same hardy novel to the boys at favorite river academy but they were prepschool seniors and i was still in the lowly eighth grade im sure i remember looking with some uncertainty at the titletess of the durbervillesand asking miss frost with apparent disappointment its about a girl yes williama most unlucky girl miss frost quickly said butmore important for your benefit as a young manits also about the men she meets may you never be one of the men tess meets william oh i said i would know soon enough what she meant about the men tess meets indeed i would never want to be one of them of angel clare miss frost said simply what a wet noodle he is and when i looked uncomprehending she added overcooked spaghetti williamthink limp think weak oh i raced home from school to read i raced when i read unable to heed miss frosts command to slow down i raced to the first sister public library after every schoolnight supper i modeled myself on what richard abbott had told me of his childhoodi lived in the library especially on the weekends miss frost was always making me move to a chair or a couch or a table where there was better light dont ruin your eyes william youll need your eyes for the rest of your life if youre going to be a reader suddenly i was fifteen it was great expectations timealso it was the first time i wanted to reread a noveland miss frost and i had that awkward conversation about my desire to become a writer it was not my only desire as you know but miss frost and i didnt discuss that other desirenot then it was suddenly time for me to attend favorite river academy too fittinglysince she would be so instrumental in my overall educationit was miss frost who pointed out to me what a favor my mother and richard abbott had done for me because they got married in the summer of more to the point because richard abbott legally adopted memy name was changed from william francis dean jr to william marshall abbott i would begin my prepschool years with a brandnew nameone i liked richard had a faculty apartment in one of the dormitories of the boarding school which he and my mom shared in their new life together and i had my own bedroom there it was not a long walk on river street to my grandparents house where id grown up and i was a frequent visitor there as little as i liked my grandmother i was very fond of grandpa harry of course i would continue to see my grandfather onstage as a woman but once i became a student at favorite river i would no longer be a backstage regular at the rehearsals of the first sister players i had much more homework at the academy than id ever seen in middle or elementary school and richard abbott was in charge of the drama club as it was called at the prep school richards shakespearean ambitions would draw me more to the drama club and away from all but the finished performances at the first sister players the drama clubs stage the academys theater was both bigger and more sophisticated than our towns quaint little playhouse the quaint word was a new one for me i became a bit of a snob in my years at favorite river or so miss frost would one day inform me and if my inappropriate crush on richard abbott had been supplanted as ive said by my lust and ardent longing for miss frost so had two gifted amateurs grandpa harry and aunt muriel been replaced by two vastly more talented actors richard abbott and miss frost were soon superstars on the stage of the first sister players not only was miss frost cast as the neurotic hedda to richards hideously controlling judge brack in the fall of she played nora in a dolls house richard as hed guessed was cast as her dull uncomprehending husband torvald helmer an uncharacteristically subdued aunt muriel did not speak to her own father for almost a month because grandpa harry not muriel was cast as mrs linde and richard abbott and miss frost managed to persuade nils borkman to play the unfortunate krogstad which the grim norwegian brought off with a creepy combination of doom and righteousness more important than what this mixed bag of amateurs made of ibsen a new faculty family had arrived at favorite river academy at the start of the academic year of and a couple named hadley they had an only childa gawkylooking daughter elaine mr hadley was a new history teacher mrs hadley who played the piano gave voice and singing lessons she directed the schools several choruses and conducted the academy choir the hadleys became friends with richard and my mom and so elaine and i often found ourselves thrust together i was a year older whichat the timemade me feel a lot older than elaine who lagged far behind in the breastdevelopment department nor would elaine ever have any breasts i imagined for id also noticed that mrs hadley was virtually flatchestedeven when she sang elaine was extremely nearsighted in those days there was no remedy for this save those superthick lenses that magnified your eyes and made them appear as if they were exploding out of your head but her mother had taught her to sing and elaine also had a vibrant wellenunciated speaking voice when she spoke it was almost as if she were singingyou could hear every word elaine really knows how to project was how mrs hadley put it her name was martha she was not pretty but she was very nice and she was the first person to notice with some accuracy that there were certain words i couldnt pronounce properly she told my mother that there were vocal exercises i could try or that singing might be of some benefit to me but that fall of i was still in middle school and i was consumed by reading i wanted nothing to do with vocal exercises or singing all these significant changes in my life came together and moved forward with an unexpected momentum in the fall of i was a student at favorite river academy i was still rereading great expectations and as you know id let it slip to miss frost that i wanted to be a writer i was fifteen and elaine hadley was a nearsighted flatchested clarionvoiced fourteenyearold one night that september there came a knocking on the door of richards faculty apartment but it was study hours in the dormitoryno boy came to our apartment door then unless he was sick i opened the door expecting to see a sick student standing anxiously in the dorm hall but there was nils borkman the distraught director he looked as if hed seen a ghost possibly some previous fjordjumper he had known ive seen her ive heard her speak she would be a perfect hedvig nils borkman cried poor elaine hadley it was her bad luck to be half blindand breastless and shrill in the wild duck a big deal is made of what is wrong with hedvigs eyes elaine that sexless but crystalclear child would be cast as the wretched hedvig and once more borkman would unleash the dreaded wild duck on the aghast citizens of first sister fresh from his surprising success as krogstad in a dolls house nils would cast himself as gregers that miserable moralizer richard abbott had called gregers determined as he was to personify the idealist in gregers nils borkman would play the clownish aspect of the character to unwitting perfection no one least of all the suicidal norwegian could explain to the fourteenyearold elaine hadley whether hedvig means to shoot the wild duck and accidentally shoots herself or ifas dr relling sayshedvig intends to kill herself nevertheless elaine was a terrific hedvigor at least a loud and clear hedvig it was sadly funny when the doctor says of the bullet that has gone through hedvigs heart the ball has entered her breast poor elaine had no breasts startling the audience the fourteenyearold hedvig cries out the wild duck this is just before hedvig exits the stage the stage directions say she steals over and takes the pistolwell not quite elaine hadley actually brandished the weapon and stomped offstage what bothered elaine most about the play was that no one says a word about what will become of the wild duck the poor thing elaine lamented its wounded it tries to drown itself but the horrid dog brings it up from the bottom of the sea and the duck is confined in a garret what kind of life can a wild duck have in a garret and after hedvig offs herself whos to say that the crazy old military manor even hjalmar whos such a wimp who feels so sorry for himselfwont just shoot it its simply awful how that duck is treated i know now of course it was not sympathy for the duck that henrik ibsen so arduously sought or that nils borkman attempted to elicit from the unsophisticated audience in first sister vermont but elaine hadley would be marked for life by her tooyoung altogether tooinnocent immersion in what a mindless melodrama borkman made of the wild duck to this day ive not seen a professional production of the play to see it done right or at least as right as it could be done might be unbearable but elaine hadley would become my good friend and i will not be disloyal to elaine by disputing her interpretation of the play gina miss frost was by far the most sympathetic human being onstage but it was the wild duck itselfwe never see the stupid birdthat garnered the lions share of elaines sympathy the unanswered or unanswerable questionwhat happens to the duckis what resonates with me this has even become one of the ways elaine and i greet each other all children learn to speak in codes grandpa harry didnt want a part in the wild duck he would have feigned laryngitis to get free from that play also grandpa harry had grown tired of being directed by his longstanding business partner nils borkman richard abbott was having his way with the staid allboys academy not only was he teaching shakespeare to those boringly singlesex boys at favorite riverrichard was putting shakespeare onstage and the female roles would be played by girls and women or by an expert female impersonator such as harry marshall who could at least teach those prepschool boys how to act like girls and women richard abbott hadnt only married my abandoned mother and given me a crush on him he had found a kindred soul in grandpa harry who especially as a woman much preferred having richard as his director than the melancholic norwegian there was a moment in those first two years richard abbott was performing for the first sister playersand he was teaching and directing shakespeare at favorite river academywhen grandpa harry would yield to a familiar temptation in the seemingly endless list of agatha christie plays that were waiting to be performed there was more than one hercule poirot mystery the fat belgian was an acknowledged master at getting murderers to betray themselves both aunt muriel and grandpa harry had played miss marple countless times but there was what muriel would have called a dearth of castworthy fat belgians in first sister vermont richard abbott didnt do fat and he refused to perform agatha christie at all we simply had no hercule poirot and borkman was fjordjumping morose about it an idea fairly leaps to mind nils grandpa harry told the troubled norwegian one day why must it be hercule poirot would you consider instead a hermione thus was black coffee performed by the first sister players with grandpa harry in the role of a sleek and agile almost balletic belgian woman hermione poirot a formula for a new explosive is stolen from a safe a character named sir claud is poisoned and so on it was no more memorable than agatha christie ever is but harry marshall brought the house down as hermione agatha christie is rolling in her grave father was all my disapproving aunt muriel could say i daresay she is harold my grandmother joined in agatha christie isnt dead yet vicky grandpa harry told nana victoria winking at me agatha christie is very much alive muriel oh how i loved himespecially as a her yet in those same two years when richard abbott was new in our town he could not persuade miss frost to make a guest appearance in a single one of the shakespeare plays that he directed for the drama club at favorite river academy i dont think so richard miss frost told him im not at all sure it would be good for those boys to have me put myself out there so to speakby which i mean they are all boys they are all young and they are all impressionable but shakespeare can be fun miss frost richard argued with her we can do a play that is strictly fun i dont think so richard she repeated and that appeared to be the end of the discussion miss frost didnt do shakespeare or she wouldntnot for those ohsoimpressionable boys i didnt know what to make of her refusal seeing her onstage was thrilling to me not that i needed an added incentive to love and desire her but once i started being a student a mere freshman at favorite river there were all these older boys around they werent especially friendly to me and some of them were distractions i developed a distant infatuation with a strikinglooking boy on the wrestling team it wasnt only that he had a beautiful body i say distant because initially i did my best to keep my distance from himto keep as far away from him as i could get talk about a crush on the wrong person and it was not my imagination that every other word out of many of the older boys mouths was homo or fag or queer these purposely hurtful words seemed to me to be the worst things you could say about another boy at the prep school were these distractions my crushes on the wrong people part of the genetic package i had inherited from my codeboy father curiously i doubted it i thought these particular crushes were all my fault for hadnt the sergeant been a notorious womanizer hadnt my combative cousin gerry labeled him with the womanizer word gerry may have heard it or she got that impression from my uncle bob or my aunt muriel didnt womanizer sound like a word muriel might have used i suppose i should have talked to richard abbott about it but i didnt i didnt dare mention it to miss frost either i kept these new unhappy crushes entirely to myself the wayso oftenchildren do i began to stay away from the first sister public library i must have felt that miss frost was smart enough to sense that i was being unfaithful to herif only in my imagination in fact my first two years as a favorite river student were spent almost entirely in my imagination and the new library in my life was the more modern and betterlit one at the academy i did all my homework there and what amounted to my earliest attempts at writing was i the only boy at the allboys school who found that the wrestling matches gave me a homoerotic charge i doubt it but boys like me kept their heads down i went from having these unmentionable crushes on this or that boy to masturbating with the dubious aid of one of my mothers mailorder clothing catalogs the advertisements for bras and girdles got my attention the models for the girdles were mostly older women for me it was an early exercise in creative writingat least i managed some clever cutting and pasting i took the faces of these older women and moved them to the younggirl models for the training bras thus did miss frost come to life for me albeit like most other things only in my imagination girls my own age didnt usually interest me while she was flatchested and not pretty as ive said i took a preternatural interest in mrs hadleyi suppose because she was around a lot and she took a sincere interest in me or in my mounting number of speech impediments anyway what words are the hardest for you to pronounce billy she asked me once when she and mr hadley and the trombonevoiced elaine were having dinner with my mother and richard and me he has trouble with the library word elaine spoke uploudly and clearly as always i had absolutely zero sexual interest in elaine but she was growing on me in other ways she never teased me about my mispronunciations she seemed as genuinely interested in helping me to say a word the right way as her mother was i was asking billy elaine mrs hadley said i think elaine knows better than i do which words give me the most trouble i said billy makes a mess of the last two syllables in ominousness every time elaine went on i say penith i ventured i see martha hadley said dont ask him to say the plural elaine told her mother if favorite river academy had admitted girls in those days elaine hadley and i would probably have become best friends sooner than we did but i didnt get to go to school with elaine i managed to see as much of her as i did only because the hadleys so frequently socialized with my mom and richardthey were becoming such good friends thus occasionally it was the homely and flatchested mrs hadley i imagined in those training brasi thought of martha hadleys small breasts when i perused the younggirl models in my moms mailorder catalogs in the academy library where i was becoming a writeror more accurately dreaming of becoming onei especially liked the room with the vast collection of favorite river yearbooks other students seemed to take no interest in that reading room the occasional faculty member could be found there either reading or grading papers and blue books favorite river academy was old it had been founded in the nineteenth century i liked looking at the old yearbooks perhaps all the past held secrets i knew my past did if i kept at it i imagined i might eventually catch up to the yearbook of my own graduating classbut not before the spring of my senior year in the fall of my junior year i was still looking through yearbooks from and world war i was going on those favorite river boys must have been frightened i looked closely at the faces of the graduating seniors and at their college choices and career ambitions many of the seniors were undecided about both almost all the seniors had nicknames even back then i looked very closely at the wrestlingteam photographs and somewhat less closely at the drama club photos in the latter case there were many boys in makeup and dressed as girls it seemed that thered always been a wrestling team and a drama club at favorite river you must remember that this particular yearbook searching was in the fall of the muchadmired traditions in singlesex boarding schools were vigorously upheld through the fifties and into the sixties i suppose i liked that reading room with all the yearbooks and with the occasional faculty member because there were never any other students thereno bullies in other words and no distracting crushes how lucky was i to have had my own room in my mom and richards faculty apartment all the boarders at the academy had roommates i cannot imagine what abuse or what more subtle form of cruelty i might have suffered from a roommate and what would i have done with my mothers mailorder clothing catalogs the very thought of not being able to masturbate was abusive enoughi mean just imagining it at seventeen which i was in the fall of i had no reason to go back to the first sister public librarythat is no reason i would have dared to express id found a haven to get my homework done the yearbook room in the academy library was a place to write or just to imagine but i must have missed miss frost she was not onstage enough to satisfy me and now that i skipped the rehearsals at the first sister players i saw her only when she was in an actual performance these were too few and far between as my clichéspouting grandmother might have said i could have talked to grandpa harry about it he would have understood i could have told him about missing miss frost about my crush on her and on those older boyseven about my earliest inappropriate crush on my stepfather richard abbott but i didnt talk to grandpa harry about any of itnot then was harry marshall an actual transvestite was grandpa harry more than the occasional crossdresser today would we call my grandpa a closeted gay man who only acted as a woman under the most permissible circumstances of his time i honestly dont know if my generation was repressed and we certainly were i can only imagine that my grandfathers generationwhether or not grandpa harry truly was a homosexualflew well under the existing radar thus it seemed to me at the time that there was no remedy for missing miss frostexcept making up a reason to see her if i was going to be a writer after all i should be able to make up a believable reason for my frequenting the first sister public library again and so i settled upon a storynamely that the only place i could work on my writing was the public library where my academy friends wouldnt keep interrupting me maybe miss frost wouldnt know that i didnt have many friends and what few friends i had at favorite river kept their heads down and were as timid as i was they wouldnt have dared to interrupt anyone since id told miss frost that i wanted to become a writer she might accept that the first sister town library was where i wanted to try my hand at it in the evening i knew there were mostly elderly people there and few of them there might also be scant representation of those sullen high school girls condemned to further their education in ezra falls there was no one who would interrupt me in our towns forlorn library no children especially i was afraid that miss frost wouldnt recognize me i had started to shave and i thought i was somehow alteredi was so much more grown up in my estimation i knew that miss frost knew my name had changed and that she must have seen mealbeit only occasionally in the last two years either backstage or in the audience at the first sister players little theater she certainly knew i was the prompters soni was that boy on the night i presented myself at the public librarynot to take out a book or even read one but to actually work on my own writingmiss frost stared at me for the longest time i assumed she was having trouble remembering me and my heart was breaking but she remembered far more than id imagined dont tell meits william abbott miss frost suddenly said i suppose you want to read great expectations a recordbreaking third time i confessed to her that i hadnt come to the library to read i told miss frost that i was trying to get away from my friendsso that i could write youve come here to the library to write she repeated i remembered that miss frost had a habit of repeating what you said nana victoria said that miss frost must have enjoyed the repetition because by repeating what you said to her she could keep the conversation going a little longer aunt muriel had claimed that no one liked to talk to miss frost yes i do i told miss frost i want to write but why here why this place miss frost demanded i couldnt think of what to say a word and then another word just popped into my head and miss frost made me so nervous that i spontaneously said the first word which was quickly followed by the second nostalgia i said maybe im nostalgic nostalgia miss frost cried youre nostalgic she repeated just how old are you william she asked seventeen i told her seventeen miss frost cried as if shed been stabbed well william deanforgive me i mean william abbottif youre nostalgic at seventeen maybe you are going to be a writer she was the first one who said sofor a while she was the only one who knew what i wanted to beand i believed her at the time miss frost struck me as the most genuine person i knew chapter masquerade the wrestler with the most beautiful body was named kittredge he had a hairless chest with absurdly welldefined pectoral muscles those muscles were of an exaggerated comicbook clarity a thin line of darkbrown almostblack hair ran from his navel to his pubes and he had one of those cute penisesi have such a dread of that plural his penis was inclined to curl against his right thigh or it appeared to be preternaturally pointed to the right there was no one i could ask concerning what the rightward inclination of kittredges penis signified in the showers at the gym i lowered my eyes for the most part i wouldnt look at him above his strong hairy legs kittredge had a heavy beard but he had perfect skin and was generally cleanshaven i found him at his most devastatingly handsome with two or three days stubble when he looked older than the other students and even some of the favorite river facultyincluding richard abbott and mr hadley kittredge played soccer in the fall and lacrosse in the spring but wrestling was the foremost showcase for his beautiful body and the wrestling seemed well suited to his innate cruelty while i rarely saw him bully anyonethat is physicallyhe was aggressive and intimidating and his sarcasm was of a cuttingedge kind in that allboys boardingschool world kittredge was honored as an athlete but i remember him best for how effectively abusive he was kittredge was brilliant at inflicting verbal pain and he had the body to back up what he said no one stood up to him if you despised him you kept quiet about it i both despised and adored him alas the despisinghim part did little to lessen my crush on him my attraction to him was a burden i bore through my junior year when kittredge was a seniorwhen i believed i had only one year of agony remaining i foresaw a day just around the corner when my longing for him would cease to torment me it would be a blow and an additional burden to discover that kittredge had failed to pass the foreignlanguage requirement he would stay at the school for a fifth year we would be seniors together by then kittredge not only looked older than the other favorite river studentshe truly was older if only at the beginning of those seemingly endless years of our incarceration together i misheard the nuance in the pronunciation of kittredges first namejock i thought everyone called him it fit surely i thought jock was a nicknameanyone who was as cool as kittredge had one but his first name his actual name was jacques zhak we called kittredge in my infatuation with him i must have imagined that my fellow students found him as beautiful as i didthat wed instinctively frenchified the jock word because of kittredges good looks he was born and grew up in new york city where his father had something to do with international bankingor maybe it was international law kittredges mother was french she was a jacquelinein french the feminine of jacques my mom who i dont believe really is my mom is very vain kittredge said repeatedlyas if he werent vain i wondered if it was a measure of jacqueline kittredges vanity that she had named her sonhe was an only childafter herself i saw her only onceat a wrestling match i admired her clothes she certainly was beautiful though i thought her boy was betterlooking mrs kittredge had a masculine kind of attractiveness she looked chiseledshe even had her sons prominent jaw how could kittredge have believed she wasnt his mom they looked so much alike she looks like kittredge with breasts elaine hadley said to mewith her typical clarionvoiced authority how could she not be his mother elaine asked me unless shes his mucholder sister come on billyif they were the same age she could be his twin at the wrestling match elaine and i had stared at kittredges mother she seemed unfazed by it with her striking bones her jutting breasts her perfectly fitted and most flattering clothes mrs kittredge was surely used to being stared at i wonder if she waxes her face i said to elaine why would she have to elaine asked me i can imagine her with a mustache i said yeah but with no hair on her chest like him elaine replied i suppose that kittredges mom was riveting to us because we could see kittredge in her but mrs kittredge was also riveting in her own disturbing way she was the first older woman who made me feel i was too young and inexperienced to understand her i remember thinking that it must have been intimidating to have her as a mothereven for kittredge i knew that elaine had a crush on kittredge because shed told me embarrassingly wed both memorized kittredges chest that fall of when i was seventeen i hadnt been honest with elaine about my crushes id not yet been brave enough to tell her that both miss frost and jacques kittredge turned me on and how could i have told elaine about my confounding lust for her mom occasionally i was still masturbating to the homely and flatchested martha hadleythat tall bigboned woman with a wide thinlipped mouth whose long face i imagined on those young girls who were the trainingbra models in my moms mailorder catalogs it might have comforted elaine to know that i shared her misery over kittredge who at the outset was as scathing or indifferent or both to her as he was to me though he had been treating us slightly better latelysince richard abbott had cast the three of us in the tempest it was wise of richard to have cast himself as prospero because there was no mere boy among the favorite river students who could have properly played the true duke of milan as shakespeare calls him and mirandas loving father his twelve years of island life have honed prosperos magical powers and there are few prepschool boys who can make such powers evident onstage okaymaybe kittredge could have done it he was well cast as a ravishingly sexy ferdinand kittredge was convincing in his love for miranda though this caused elaine hadley who was cast as miranda no end of suffering i would not wish any companion in the world but you miranda tells ferdinand and ferdinand says to miranda i beyond all limit of what else i the world do love prize honor you how hard it must have been for elaine to hear thatin one rehearsal after anotheronly to be ignored or belittled by kittredge whenever she encountered him offstage that he was treating us slightly better since the start of rehearsals for the tempest didnt mean that kittredge couldnt still be awful richard had cast me as ariel in the dramatis personae for the play shakespeare calls ariel an airy spirit no i dont believe that richard was being particularly prescient in regard to my emerging and confusing sexual orientation he told the cast that ariels gender was polymorphousmore a matter of habiliment than anything organic from the first enter ariel moment act scene ariel says to prospero to thy strong bidding task ariel and all his quality richard had called the casts attentionespecially my attentionto the male pronoun in the same scene the stage direction for ariel reads he demonstrates it was unfortunate for me that prospero commands ariel go make thyself like a nymph o th sea be subject to no sight but thine and mineinvisible to every eyeball else alas i would not be invisible to the audience the enter ariel as a water nymph always got a big laugheven before i was in costume with makeup that stage direction was what led kittredge to start calling me nymph i remember exactly how richard had put it keeping the character of ariel in the male gender is simpler than tricking out one more choirboy in womens garb but womens garbwell at least the wigwas how i would be tricked out nor was it lost on kittredge when richard said its possible that shakespeare saw a continuum from caliban through prospero to ariela kind of spiritual evolution caliban is all earth and water brute force and guile prospero is human control and insighthes the ultimate alchemist and ariel richard said smiling at meno smile was ever lost on kittredgeariel is a spirit of air and fire freed from mortal concerns perhaps shakespeare felt that presenting ariel as explicitly female might detract from this notion of a continuum i believe that ariels gender is mutable directors choice in other words kittredge asked richard our director and teacher regarded kittredge cautiously before answering him the sex of angels is also mutable richard said yes kittredgedirectors choice but what will the socalled water nymph look like kittredge asked like a girl right probably richard said more cautiously i was trying to imagine how i would be costumed and made up as an invisible water nymph i could never have foreseen the algaegreen wig i wore nor the crimson wrestling tights crimson and silvergraydeathgray grandpa harry had called itwere the favorite river academy colors so billys gender is mutable kittredge said smiling not billysariels richard said but kittredge had made his point the cast of the tempest would not forget the mutable word nymph kittredges nickname for me would stick i had two years to go at favorite river academy a nymph i would be it doesnt matter what costume and makeup do to you nymph kittredge said to me privately youll never be as hot as your mother i was aware that my mom was pretty andat seventeeni was increasingly conscious of how the other students at an allboys academy like favorite river regarded her but no other boy had told me that my mom was hot as i often found myself with kittredge i was at a loss for words im sure that the hot word was not yet in usenot the way kittredge had used it but kittredge definitely meant hot in that way when kittredge spoke of his own mother which he rarely did he usually raised the issue of there being a possible mixup maybe my real mom died in childbirth kittredge said my father found some unwed mother in the same hospitalan unfortunate woman her child was stillborn but the woman never knew a woman who looked like my mother there was a switch my dad would be capable of such a deception im not saying the woman knows shes my stepmother she may even believe my dad is my stepfather at the time she might have been taking a lot of drugsshe must have been depressed maybe suicidal i have no doubt that she believes shes my momshe just doesnt always act like a mother shes done some contradictory thingscontradictory to motherhood all im saying is that my dad has never been answerable for his behavior with womenwith any woman my dad just makes deals this woman may look like me but shes not my momshes not anyones mother kittredge is in denialbig time elaine had told me that woman looks like his mother and his father when i told elaine hadley what kittredge had said about my mom elaine suggested that i tell kittredge our opinion of his motherbased on our shameless staring at her at one of his wrestling matches tell him his mom looks like him with tits elaine said you tell him i told her we both knew i wouldnt elaine wouldnt talk to kittredge about his mom either initially elaine was almost as afraid of kittredge as i wasnor would she ever have used the tits word in his company she was very conscious of having inherited her moms flat chest elaine was nowhere near as homely as her mother elaine was thin and gawky and she had no boobs but she had a pretty faceand unlike her mom elaine would never be bigboned elaine was delicatelooking which made her trombone of a voice all the more surprising yet at first she was so intimidated in kittredges presence that she often croaked or mumbled at times she was incoherent elaine was so afraid of sounding too loud around him kittredge fogs up my glasses was the way she put it their first meeting onstageas ferdinand and mirandawas dazzlingly clear one never saw two souls so unmistakably drawn to each other upon seeing miranda ferdinand calls her a wonder he asks if you be maid or no no wonder sir but certainly a maid elaine as miranda replies in a vibrant gonglike voice but offstage kittredge had managed to make elaine selfconscious about her booming voice after all she was only sixteen kittredge was eighteen going on thirty elaine and i were walking back to the dorm after rehearsal one nightthe hadleys had a faculty apartment in the same dorm where i lived with richard abbott and my momwhen kittredge magically materialized beside us kittredge was always doing that you two are quite a couple he told us were not a couple elaine blurted out much louder than shed meant to kittredge pretended to stagger as if from an unseen blow he held his ears i must warn you nymphyoure in danger of losing your hearing kittredge said to me when this little lady has her first orgasm you better be wearing earplugs and i wouldnt do it in the dormitory if i were you kittredge warned me the whole dorm would hear her he then drifted away from us down a different darker path kittredge lived in the jock dorm the one nearest the gym it was too dark to see if elaine hadley had blushed i touched her face lightly just enough to ascertain if she was crying she wasnt but her cheek was hot and she brushed my hand away no ones giving me an orgasm anytime soon elaine cried after kittredge we were in a quadrangle of dormitories in the distance there were lights in the surrounding dorm windows and a chorus of voices whooped and cheeredas if a hundred unseen boys had heard her but elaine was very agitated when she cried out i doubted that kittredge or anyone but me had understood her i was wrong though what elaine had cried with policesiren shrillness sounded like no nuns liver goes into spasm for a raccoon or nonsense of a similar incomprehensible kind but kittredge had grasped elaines meaning his sweetly sarcastic voice reached us from somewhere in the dark quadrangle cruelly it was as the sexy ferdinand that kittredge called out of the darkness to my friend elaine who was at that moment not feeling much like miranda o if a virgin and your affection not gone forth ill make you the queen of naples ferdinand swears to mirandaand so kittredge amorously called the quad of dorms was eerily quiet when those favorite river boys heard kittredge speak they were silenced by their own awe and stupefaction good night nymph i heard kittredge call good night naples thus elaine hadley and i had our nicknames when kittredge named you it may have been a dubious honor but the designation was both lasting and traumatic shit elaine said it could be worsekittredge could be calling me maid or virgin elaine i said youre my one true friend abhorrèd slave she said to me this was uttered as sharply as a bark there was a doglike echo in the quadrangle of dorms we both knew it is what miranda says to calibana savage and deformed slave shakespeare calls him but caliban is an unfinished monster prospero berates caliban thou didst seek to violate the honor of my child caliban doesnt deny it caliban hates prospero and his daughter toads beetles bats light on you though the monster once lusted after miranda and wishes he had peopled the island with little calibans caliban is evidently male but its uncertain how human he is when trinculo the jester first notices caliban trinculo says what have we here a man or a fish dead or alive i knew that elaine hadley had been kiddingspeaking to me as miranda speaks to caliban elaine was just fooling aroundbut as we drew near to our dormitory the lights from the windows illuminated her tearstreaked face in only a minute or two kittredges mockery of ferdinand and mirandas romance had taken effect elaine was crying youre my only friend she blubbered to me i felt sorry for her and put my arm around her shoulders this provoked more whoops and cheers from those unseen boys whod whooped and cheered before did i know that this night was the beginning of my masquerade was i conscious of giving those favorite river boys the impression that elaine hadley was my girlfriend was i acting even then consciously or not i was making elaine hadley my disguise for a while i would fool richard abbott and grandpa harrynot to mention mr hadley and his homely wife martha and if not for long and to a lesser extent my mother yes i was aware that my mom was changing shed been so nice to me when i was little i used to wonder when i was a teenager what had become of the small boy shed once loved i even began an early novel with this tortured and overlong sentence according to my mother i was a fiction writer before id written any fiction by which she meant not only that i invented things or made things up but that i preferred this kind of fantasizing or pure imagining to what other people generally likedshe meant reality of course my moms assessment of pure imagining was not flattering fiction was frivolous to her no it was worse than frivolous one christmasi believe it was the first christmas id come home to vermont for a visit in several yearsi was scribbling away in a notebook and my mother asked me what are you writing now billy a novel i told her well that should make you happy she suddenly said to grandpa harry whod begun to lose his hearingsawmill damage i suppose me why should it make me happy that bill is writing another novel not that i didnt love the last one bill because i sureasshit did love it grandpa harry quickly assured me of course you loved it my mother told him novels are just another kind of crossdressing arent they ah well grandpa harry had started to say but then stopped as harry got older he stopped himself from saying what he was going to saymore and more i know the feeling when i was a teenager when i began to sense that my mom wasnt as nice to me as shed been before i got in the habit of stopping myself from saying what i wanted to say not anymore many years later long after id left favorite river academy at the height of my interest in shemalesi mean dating them not being onei was having dinner with donna one night and i told her about grandpa harrys onstage life as a female impersonator was it only onstage donna asked as far as i know i answered her but you couldnt lie to her one of a couple of uncomfortable things about donna was that she always knew when you were holding out on her nana victoria had been dead for more than a year when i first heard from richard that no one could persuade grandpa harry to part with my late grandmothers clothes at the sawmill of course harry marshall was sureasshit still dressing like a lumberman eventually i would come clean to donna about grandpa harry spending his evenings in his late wifes attireif only in the privacy of his river street home i would leave out the part about harrys crossdressing adventures after he was moved to that assistedliving facility he and nils borkman had years before generously built for the elderly in first sister the other residents had complained about harry repeatedly surprising them in drag as grandpa harry would one day tell me i think youve noticed that rigidly conventional or ignorant people have no sense of humor about crossdressers fortunately when richard abbott told me what had happened at the assistedliving facility grandpa harrys river street home had not yet been sold it was still on the market richard and i quickly moved harry back into the familiar surroundings of the house hed lived in with nana victoria for so many years nana victorias clothes were moved back into the river street house with him and the nurse richard and i hired for grandpa harrys roundtheclock care made no objection to harrys apparently permanent transformation as a woman the nurse fondly remembered harry marshalls many female impersonations onstage did the crossdressing bug ever bite you billy donna asked me one night not really id answered her my attraction to transsexuals was pretty specific im sorry but we didnt use to say transgendernot till the eighties transvestites never did it for me and the transsexuals had to be what they call passableone of few adjectives i still have trouble with in the pronunciation department furthermore their breasts had to be naturalhormones were okay but no surgical implantsand not surprisingly i preferred small breasts how feminine she was mattered a lot to donna she was tall but thineven her upper arms were slenderand she was flawlessly smoothskinned ive known many women who were hairier she was always having her hair done she was very stylish donna was selfconscious about her hands though they were not as noticeably big and stronglooking as miss frosts donna didnt like to hold hands with me because my hands were smaller she came from chicago and she tried living in new yorkafter we broke up i heard shed moved to torontobut donna believed that europe was the place for someone like her i used to take her with me on publishing trips when my novels were translated into various european languages donna said that europe was more accepting of transsexualseurope was more sexually accepting and sophisticated generallybut donna was insecure about learning another language shed dropped out of college because her college years coincided with what she called her sexualidentity crisis and she had little confidence in herself intellectually this was crazy because she read all the timeshe was very smartbut there are those years when were supposed to feed and grow our minds and donna felt that shed lost those years to her difficult decision to live as a woman especially when we were in germany where i could speak the language donna was at her happiestthat is when we were together on those germanlanguage translation trips not only in germany but also in austria and germanspeaking switzerland donna loved zurich i know it struck her as zurich does everyone as a very welltodo city she loved vienna toofrom my student days in vienna i still knew my way around a little most of all donna was delighted with hamburgto her i think hamburg was the most elegantseeming german city in hamburg my german publishers always put me up at the vier jahreszeiten it was such an elegant hotel i think it gave donna most of her delight with hamburg but then there was that awful evening after which donna could never be happy in hamburgor perhaps with meagain it began innocently enough a journalist whod interviewed me invited us to a nightclub on the reeperbahn i didnt know the reeperbahn or what kind of club it was but this journalist and his wife or girlfriend invited donna and me to go out with them and see a show klaus with a k and claudia with a c were their names we took a taxi together to the club i should have known what kind of place it was when i saw those skinny boys at the bar on our way in a transvestitencabareta transvestite show im guessing the skinny boys at the bar were the performers boyfriends because it wasnt a pickup place and the boys at the bar excepted there wasnt a visible gay presence it was a show for sex touristsguys in drag entertaining straight couples the allmale groups were young men there for the laughs the allwomen groups were there to see the penises the performers were comedians they were very aware of themselves as men they were not half as passable as my dear donna they were the oldfashioned transvestites who werent really trying to pass as female they were meticulously made up and elaborately costumed they were very goodlooking but they were goodlooking men dressed as women in their dresses and wigs they were very femininelooking men but they werent fooling anybodythey werent even trying to klaus and claudia clearly had no idea that donna was one of them though she was much more convincing and infinitely more committed i didnt know i told donna i really didnt im sorry donna couldnt speak it had not occurred to herthis was the seventiesthat one of the more sophisticated and accepting things about europe when it came to difficult decisions regarding sexual identity was that the europeans were so used to sexual differences that they had already begun to make fun of them that the performers were making fun of themselves must have been terribly painful for donna whod had to work so hard to take herself seriously as a woman there was one skit with a very tall tranny driving a makebelieve car while her datea frightenedlooking smaller manis attempting to go down on her what frightens the small man is how big the trannys cock is and how his inexpert attentions to this monster cock are interfering with the trannys driving of course donna couldnt understand the german the tranny was talking nonstop offering breathless criticism of what a bad blow job she was getting well i had to laugh and i dont think donna ever forgave me klaus and claudia clearly thought i had a typical american girlfriend they thought donna was not enjoying the show because she was a sexually uptight prude there was no way to explain anything to themnot there when we left donna was so distraught that she jumped when one of the waitresses spoke to her the waitress was a tall transvestite she could have passed for one of the performers she said to donna in german you are looking really fine it was a compliment but i knew that the tranny knew donna was a transsexual almost no one could tell not at that time donna didnt advertise it her entire effort went into being a woman not getting away as one what did she say donna kept asking me as we left the club in the seventies the reeperbahn wasnt the tourist trap that it is today there were the sex tourists of course but the street itself was seedier thenthe way times square used to be seedier too and not so overrun with gawkers she was complimenting youshe thought you looked really fine she meant you were beautiful i told donna she meant for a man rightisnt that what she meant donna asked me she was crying klaus and claudia still didnt get it im not some twobit crossdresser donna cried were sorry if this was a bad idea klaus said rather stiffly its meant to be funnyits not intended to be offensive i just kept shaking my head there was no way to save the night i knew look palive got a bigger dick than the tranny driving that nonexistent car donna said to klaus you want to see it donna asked claudia dont i said to heri knew donna was no prude far from it tell them she told me naturally i had already written a couple of novels about sexual differencesabout challenging and at times confusing sexual identities klaus had read my novels hed interviewed me for christs sakehe and his wife or girlfriend should have known that my girlfriend wasnt a prude donna definitely has a bigger dick than the tranny driving the makebelieve car i said to klaus and claudia please dont ask her to show it to younot here not here donna screamed i truly dont know why i said that the stream of traffic both cars and pedestrians along the reeperbahn must have made me anxious about donna whipping out her penis there i certainly didnt meanas i told donna repeatedly back at our hotelthat donna would or should show them her penis at another time or in another place it just came out that way im not an amateur crossdresser donna was sobbing im not im not of course youre not i was telling her when i saw klaus and claudia slipping away donna had put her hands on my shoulders she was shaking me and i suppose that klaus and claudia got a good look at donnas big hands she did have a bigger dick than the tranny gagging the guy who was giving her a bad blow job in that makebelieve car that night back at the vier jahreszeiten donna was still crying when she washed her face before going to bed we left the light on in the walkin closet with the closet door ajar it served as a nightlight a way to find the bathroom in the dark i lay awake looking at donna who was asleep in the halflight and with no makeup on donnas face bore a hint of something masculine maybe it was because she wasnt trying to be a woman when she slept perhaps it was something in the contours of her jaw and cheekbonessomething chiseled that night looking at donna asleep i was reminded of mrs kittredge thered been something masculine in her attractiveness toosomething of kittredge himself about her something allmale but if a woman is aggressive she can look maleeven in her sleep i fell asleep and when i woke up the door to the walkin closet was closedi knew wed left it ajar donna was not in bed beside me in the light that was coming from the walkin closet from under the door i could see the shadows of her moving feet she was naked looking at herself in the fulllength mirror in the walkin closet i knew this routine your breasts are perfect i told her most men like them bigger donna said youre not like most men i know billy you even like actual women for christs sake dont hurt your beautiful breastsplease dont do anything to them i told her whats it matter that i have a big dick youre strictly a top billythat wont ever change right she asked me i love your big dick i said donna shrugged her small breasts were the target you know the difference between an amateur crossdresser and someone like me donna asked i knew the answerit was always her answer yes i knowyoure committed to changing your body im not an amateur donna repeated i knowjust dont change your breasts theyre perfect i told her and went back to bed you know whats the matter with you billy donna asked me i was already in bed with my back turned to the light coming from under the door of the walkin closet i knew her answer to this question too but i didnt say anything youre not like anyone else billythats whats the matter with you donna said as for crossdressing donna could never interest me in trying on her clothes she would talk from time to time about the seemingly remote possibility of surgerynot just the breast implants which were tempting to many transsexuals but the bigger deal the sexchange surgery technically speaking donnaand every other transsexual who ever attracted mewas what they call a preop i know only a few postop transsexuals the ones i know are very courageous its daunting to be around them they know themselves so well imagine knowing yourself that well imagine being that sure about who you are donna would say i suppose you were never curiousi mean to be like me thats right i told her truthfully i suppose all your life youve wanted to keep your penisyou probably really like it she said i like yours too i told heralso truthfully i know you do she said sighing i just dont always like it so much myself but i always like yours donna quickly added poor tom would have found donna too complicated i think but i thought she was very brave i found it intimidating that donna was so certain about who she was but that was also one of the things i loved about herthat and the cute rightward inclination of her penis which reminded me of youknowwho as it would turn out my only exposure to kittredges penis was what i managed to glimpse of himalways furtivelyin the showers at the favorite river gym i had much more exposure to donnas penis i saw as much of her as i wanted thoughin the beginningi had such an insatiable hunger for her and for other transsexuals albeit only the ones who were like her that i couldnt imagine ever seeing or having enough of donna in the end i didnt move on because i was tired of her or because she ever doubted or had second thoughts about who she was in the end it was me she doubted it was donna who moved on and her distrust of me made me doubt myself when i stopped seeing donna more accurately when she stopped seeing me i became more cautious with transsexualsnot because i no longer desired them and i still find them extraordinarily brave but because transsexuals donna especially forced me to acknowledge the most confusing aspects of my bisexuality every fucking day donna was exhausting i usually like straight guys she would constantly remind me i also like other transsexualsnot just the ones like me you know i know donna i would assure her and i can deal with straight guys who also like womenafter all im trying to live my life all the time as a woman im just a woman with a penis she would say her voice rising i know i know i would tell her but you also like other guysjust guysand you like women billy yes i dosome women i would admit to her and cute guysnot all cute guys i would remind her yeah wellfuck what all means billy donna would say what gets to me is that i dont know what you like about me and what it is about me that you dont like theres nothing about you i dont like donna i like all of you i promised her yeah wellif youre going to leave me for a woman like a straight guy one day would i get it or if youre going to go back to guys like a gay guy one day wouldwell i get that too donna said but the thing about you billyand i dont get this at allis that i dont know who or what youre going to leave me for i dont know either i would tell her truthfully yeah wellthats why im leaving you billy donna said im going to miss you like crazy i told her this was also true im already getting over you billy was all she said but until that night in hamburg i believed that donna and i had a chance together i used to believe my mom and i had a chance together too i mean more than the chance of staying friends i mean that i used to think nothing could ever drive us apart my mother once worried about my most minor injuriesshe imagined my life was in danger at the first cough or sneeze there was something childlike about her fears for me my nightmares gave her nightmares my mom once said my mother told me that as a child i had fever dreams if so they persisted into my teenage years whatever they were they seemed more real than dreams if there was any reality to the most recurrent of these dreams it eluded me for the longest time but one night when id been sicki was actually recuperating from scarlet feverit seemed that richard abbott was telling me a war story yet richards only war story was the lawnmower accident that had disqualified him from military service this wasnt richard abbotts story it was my fathers war story or one of them and richard couldnt possibly have told it to me the story or the dream began in hampton virginiahampton roads port of embarkation was where my codeboy father boarded a transport ship for italy the transports were liberty ships the ground cadre of the th bomb squadron left virginia on a dark and threatening january day within the sheltered harbor the soldiers had their first meal at seapork chops i was told or dreamed when my dads convoy hit the open seas the liberty ships encountered an atlantic winter storm the enlisted personnel occupied the fore and aft holds each man had his helmet hung by his bunkthe helmets would soon become vomit basins for seasick soldiers but the sergeant didnt get seasick my mom had told me that hed grown up on cape cod as a boy hed been a sailorhe was immune to seasickness consequently my codeboy dad did his dutyhe emptied the seasick soldiers helmets amidships at deck levela laborious climb from the bunks below the deckwas a huge head even in the dream i had to interrupt the story and ask what a head was the person i thought was richard but it couldnt have been richard told me that the head was a huge latrinethe toilets stretched across the entire ship during one of many helmetemptying ordeals my father stopped to sit down on one of the toilets there was no point in trying to pee while standing up the ship was pitching and rollingyou had to sit down my dad sat on the toilet with both his hands gripping the seat seawater sloshed around his ankles soaking his shoes and pants at the farthest end of the long row of toilets another soldier sat holding the seat but this soldiers grip was precarious my dad saw that the other soldier was also immune to seasickness he was actually reading holding on to the toilet seat with only one hand when the ship suddenly pitched more steeply the bookworm lost his grip he came skipping over the toilet seatshis ass made a slapping sounduntil he collided with my father at the opposite end of the row of toilets sorryi just had to keep reading he said then the ship rolled in the other direction and the soldier sallied forth skipping over the seats again when hed slid all the way to the last toilet he either lost control of the book or he let it go gripping the toilet seat with both hands the book floated away in the seawater what were you reading the codeboy called madame bovary the soldier shouted in the storm i can tell you what happens the sergeant said please dont the bookworm answered i want to read it for myself in the dream or in the story someone who was not richard abbott was telling me my father never saw this soldier for the rest of the voyage past a barely visible gibraltar i remember the dream or someone saying the convoy slipped into the mediterranean one night off the coast of sicily the soldiers belowdecks were awakened by crashing noises and the sounds of cannon fire the convoy was under aerial attack by the luftwaffe subsequently my dad heard that an adjacent liberty ship had been hit and sunk with all hands as for the soldier whod been reading madame bovary in the storm he failed to introduce himself to my dad before the convoy made landfall at taranto the codeboys war story would continue and conclude without my disappearing dad ever encountering the toilettraveling man years later said the dream or the storyteller my father was finishing up at harvard he was riding on the boston subway the mta hed got on at the charles street station and was on his way back to harvard square a man who got on at kendall square began to stare at him the sergeant was discomfited by the strange mans interest in him it felt like an unnatural interesta foreboding of something violent or at least unpleasant it was the language of the story that made this recurrent dream seem more real to me than other dreams it was a dream with a firstperson narratora dream with a voice the man on the subway started changing seats he kept moving closer to my dad when they were almost in physical contact with each other and the subway was slowing down for the next stop the stranger turned to my father and said hi im bovary remember me then the subway stopped at central square where the bookworm got off and the sergeant was once more on his way to harvard square i was told that the fever part of scarlet fever abates within a weekusually within three to five days im pretty sure that i was over the fever part when i asked richard abbott if hed ever told me this storyperhaps at the onset of the rash or during the sorethroat part which began a couple of days before the rash my tongue had been the color of a strawberry but when i first spoke to richard about this most vivid and recurrent dream my tongue was a beefy dark redmore of a raspberry colorand the rash was starting to go away i dont know this story bill richard told me this is the first time ive heard it oh it sounds like a grandpa harry story to me richard said but when i asked my grandfather if hed told me the madame bovary story grandpa harry started his ah well routine hemming and hawing his way in circles around the question no he definitely didnt tell me the story my grandfather said yes harry had heard the storya secondhand version if i recall correctlybut he conveniently couldnt remember whod told him it was uncle bob maybeperhaps it was bob who told you bill then my grandfather felt my forehead and mumbled words to the effect that my fever seemed to be gone when he peered into my mouth he announced thats still a pretty uglylookin tongue though i would say the rash is disappearin a bit it was too real to be a dreamat least to begin with i told grandpa harry ah wellif youre good at imaginin things which i believe you are pretty good at bill i would say that some dreams can seem very real my grandfather hemmed and hawed ill ask uncle bob i said bob was always putting squash balls in my pockets or in my shoesor under my pillow it was a game when i found the balls i gave them back oh ive been looking for that squash ball all over billy bob would say im so glad you found it whats madame bovary about i asked uncle bob hed come to see how i was recuperating from the scarlet fever and id given him the squash ball i had found in the glass for my toothbrushin the bathroom i shared with grandpa harry nana victoria would rather die than share a bathroom with him harry had told me but i liked sharing a bathroom with my grandfather truth be told i havent actually read madame bovary billy uncle bob told me he peered into the hallway outside my bedroom checking to be sure that my mom or my grandmother or aunt muriel wasnt within listening distance even though the coast was clear bob lowered his voice i believe its about adultery billyan unfaithful wife i must have looked baffled utterly uncomprehending because uncle bob quickly said you should ask richard what madame bovary is aboutliterature you know is richards department its a novel i asked i dont think its a true story uncle bob answered but richard would know or i could ask miss frost i suggested uhhuh you couldjust dont say it was my idea uncle bob said i know a story i started to say maybe you told me you mean the one about the guy reading madame bovary on a hundred toilets at the same time bob cried i absolutely love that story me too i said its very funny hilarious uncle bob declared no i never told you that story billyat least i dont remember telling you that story he said quickly oh maybe your mom told you uncle bob asked i must have given him an incredulous look because bob suddenly said probably not its a dream i keep having but someone must have told me first i said dinnerparty conversation perhapsone of those stories children overhear when the adults think theyve gone to bed or they cant possibly be listening uncle bob said while this was more credible than my mother being the source of the toiletseat story neither bob nor i looked very convinced not all mysteries are meant to be solved billy he said to me with more conviction it was shortly after hed left when i discovered another squash ball or the same squash ball under my covers i knew perfectly well that my mother hadnt told me the madame bovary multipletoiletseats story but of course i asked her i never thought that story was the least bit funny she said i wouldnt have had anything to do with telling you that story billy oh maybe daddy told youi asked him not to my mother said no grandpa definitely didnt tell me i said ill bet uncle bob did my mom said uncle bob says he doesnt remember telling me i replied bob drinkshe doesnt remember everything my mother told me and youve had a fever recently she reminded me you know the dreams a fever can give you billy i thought it was a funny story anywayhow the mans ass made a slapping sound as he was skipping over the toilet seats i said its not the least bit funny to me billy oh it was after id completely recovered from the scarlet fever that i asked richard abbott his opinion of madame bovary i think you would appreciate it more when youre older bill richard told me how much older i asked him i would have been fourteenim guessing id not yet read and reread great expectations but miss frost had already started me on my life as a readeri know that i could ask miss frost how old she thinks i should be i suggested i would wait a while before you ask her bill richard said how long a while i asked him richard abbott who i thought knew everything answered i dont know exactly i dont know exactly when my mom became the prompter for richard abbotts theatrical productions in the drama club at favorite river academy but i was very much aware of her being the prompter for the tempest there were the occasional scheduling conflicts because my mother was still prompting for the first sister players but prompters could miss rehearsals now and then and the performancesthe actual shows put on by our towns amateur theatrical society and favorite rivers drama clubnever overlapped in rehearsals kittredge would pretend to botch a line just to have my mom prompt him o most dear maid ferdinand misspoke to miranda in one of our rehearsals when we were newly offscript no jacques my mother said that would be o most dear mistress not maid but kittredge was actinghe was only pretending to flub the line so that he could engage my mother in conversation im so sorry mrs abbottit wont happen again he said to her then he blew the very next dialogue assigned him no precious creature ferdinand is supposed to say to miranda but kittredge said no precious mistress not this time jacques my mom told him its no precious creaturenot mistress i think im trying too hard to please youi want you to like me but im afraid you dont mrs abbott kittredge said to my mother he was flirting with her and she blushed i was embarrassed by how often i thought of my mom as easily seduced it was almost as if i believed she was somewhat retarded or so sexually naïve that anyone who flattered her could win her over i do like you jacquesi certainly dont not like you my mom blurted out while elaine as miranda stood there seething elaine knew that kittredge had used the hot word for my mom i get so nervous around you kittredge told my mother though he didnt look nervous he seemed increasingly confident what a lot of bullshit elaine hadley croaked kittredge cringed at the sound of her voice and my mother flinched as if shed been slapped elaine mind your language my mom said can we just get on with the play elaine asked oh naplesyoure so impatient kittredge said with a most disarming smile first to elaine and then to my mother elaine cant wait to get to the handholding part kittredge told my mom indeed the scene they were rehearsingact scene ends with ferdinand and miranda holding hands it was elaines turn to blush but kittredge who was in complete control of the moment had fixed his most earnest gaze on my mother i have a question mrs abbott he began as if elaine and miranda didnt existas if theyd never existed when ferdinand says full many a lady i have eyed with best regard and many a time the harmony of their tongues hath into bondage brought my too diligent earyou know that linei wonder if that means i have been with a lot of women and if i shouldnt somehow imply that i am you know sexually experienced my mom blushed more deeply than before oh god elaine hadley cried and iwhere was i i was arielan airy spirit i was waiting for ferdinand and miranda to exeuntseparately like the stage direction said i was standing by with caliban stephano a drunken butler shakespeare calls him and trinculo we were all in the next scene in which i was invisible with my mother blushing at kittredges clever manipulations i felt invisibleor i wanted to be im just the prompter my mother said hastily to kittredge thats a question for the directoryou should ask mr abbott she said my moms agitation was obvious and i suddenly saw her as she must have looked years ago when she was either pregnant with me or already my motherwhen shed seen my womanizing father kissing someone else i remembered how shed said the else word when she told me about it in the same perfunctory way she had corrected kittredges purposeful flubs once we were in performances of the tempest kittredge wouldnt muff a linenot a single word i realize that i havent acknowledged this but kittredge was very good onstage it was painful for me to see how easily undone my mom wasby the slightest sexual suggestion from a teenager i hated myself because i saw that i was ashamed of my own mother and i knew that whatever shame i felt for her had been formed by muriels constant condescension and her chiding gossip naturally i hated kittredge for how effortlessly he had rattled my damaged momfor how smoothly he was able to rattle elaine and me tooand then my mother called for help richard she called jacques has a question about his character oh god elaine said againthis time under her breath she was barely audible but kittredge had heard her patience dear naples kittredge said to her taking her hand he grasped her hand exactly as ferdinand takes mirandas handbefore they part at the end of act scene but elaine yanked her hand away from him what is it about your character ferdinand richard abbott asked kittredge this is more bullshit elaine said your language elaine my mother said some fresh air would be good for miranda richard said to elaine just a couple of deep breaths and perhaps a needed expulsion of whatever words spontaneously come to mind take a break elaineyou should take a break too bill richard told me we want our miranda and our ariel in character i guess richard could see that i was agitated too there was a loading dock off the carpentry shop to the rear of the backstage area and elaine and i stepped out on the dock in the cool night air i tried to take her hand at first she pulled her hand away from me though not as violently as shed jerked it away from kittredge then with the door to the loading dock still open elaine gave me back her hand she rested her head against my shoulder theyre a cute couple arent they we heard kittredge say to someone or to them all before the door closed motherfucker elaine hadley yelled penisbreath she shouted then she gulped the cold air until her breathing had returned to almost normal and we went back inside the theater where elaines glasses instantly fogged up ferdinand is not saying to miranda that he is sexually experienced richard was telling kittredge ferdinand is saying how attentive he has been to women and how often women have made an impression on him all he means is that no one has impressed him as forcefully as miranda its a speech about impressions kittredge elaine managed to say its not a speech about sex enter ariel invisiblethat was the stage direction to my upcoming scene act scene but i was already truly invisible i had somehow succeeded in giving them all the impression that elaine hadley was my love interest for elaines part she seemed to be going along with itmaybe for selfprotective reasons of her own but kittredge was smiling at usin that sneering superior way he had i do not think the impressions word ever meant very much to kittredge i believe that everything was always about sexabout actual sexto him and if the present company was convinced that elaine and i were interested in each other in a sexual way possibly kittredge alone remained unconvincedat least this was the impression that his sneer gave elaine and me maybe this was why elaine suddenly turned from him and kissed me she barely brushed her lips against mine but there was actual if fleeting contact i suppose i even appeared to kiss her back albeit briefly that was all it wasnt much of a kiss it didnt even fog up her glasses i doubt that elaine had an iota of sexual interest in me and i believe she knew from the beginning that i was only pretending to be interested in her in that way we were the most amateur actorsher innocent miranda and my largely invisible arielbut we were acting and there was an unspoken complicity in our deception after all we both had something to hide chapter elaines bra to this day i dont know what to make of the wretched calibanthe monster whose attempted rape of miranda earns prosperos unforgiving condemnation prospero seems to take minimal responsibility for calibanthis thing of darkness i acknowledge mine for someone as selfcentered as kittredge of course the tempest was all about ferdinand its a love story in which ferdinand woos and wins miranda but richard abbott called the play a tragicomedy and for those two almost three months in the fall of when elaine hadley and i were in rehearsals for the play we felt that our closeenoughtotouch proximity to kittredge was our tragicomedynotwithstanding that the tempest has a happy ending for miranda and ariel my mother who always maintained she was just the prompter had the curiously mathematical habit of timing each actor she used a cheap stove timer and in the margins of her copy of the play she noted the approximate percent of the characters actual time onstage the value of my moms calculations seemed questionable to me though both elaine and i enjoyed the fact that ferdinand was onstage for only percent of the play what about miranda elaine made a point of asking my mom within kittredges keenly competitive hearing twentyseven percent my mother replied what about me i asked my mom ariel is onstage thirtyone percent of the time she told me kittredge scoffed at this degrading news and prospero our peerless directorhe of the muchballyhooed magical powers kittredge inquired sarcastically muchballyhooed elaine hadley thunderously echoed prospero is onstage approximately fiftytwo percent of the time my mother told kittredge approximately kittredge repeated sneering richard had told us that the tempest was shakespeares farewell play that the bard was knowingly saying goodbye to the theater but i didnt understand the necessity for act especially the tackedon epilogue spoken by prospero perhaps it was a small measure of my becoming a writer though never for the stage that i believed the tempest should have ended with prosperos speech to ferdinand and mirandathe our revels now are ended speech in act scene and surely prospero should have ended that speech and the play with the wonderful we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep why does prospero need to say more maybe he does feel responsible for caliban but when i expressed these thoughts to richard he said well billif youre rewriting shakespeare at seventeen i expect great things of you richard wasnt given to satire at my expense and i was hurt by it kittredge was quick to pick up on someone elses pain hey rewriter kittredge called to me across the quadrangle of dorms alas that nickname didnt stick kittredge never said it again preferring nymph i would have preferred rewriter at least it was true to the kind of writer i would one day become but ive strayed from the caliban character i have digressed which is also the kind of writer i would become caliban is onstage percent of the time my mothers approximations never took into account the lines spoken only the onstage time of the characters this was my very first experience with the tempest but as many times as ive seen the play performed i always find caliban a deeply disturbing character as a writer i would call him an unresolved character by how harshly prospero treats him we know how unforgivingly prospero thinks of caliban but i wonder what shakespeare wanted us to feel about the monster sympathy maybesome guilt perhaps that fall of i wasnt at all sure what richard abbott made of caliban that richard had cast grandpa harry as the monster sent a mixed message harry had never been onstage as a male anything that caliban was less than human was further unresolved by grandpa harrys steadfastly female impersonation caliban may indeed have lusted after mirandawe know the monster has tried to rape herbut harry marshall even when he was cast as a villain was almost never unsympathetic onstage nor was he ever entirely male perhaps richard had acknowledged that caliban was a confusing monster and richard knew that grandpa harry would find a way to add to the confusion your grandfather is weird was how kittredge unambiguously put it to me queen lear kittredge called him even i believe that harry outweirded himself in calibans case grandpa harry gave a sexually ambiguous performancehe played caliban as an androgynous hag the wig grandpa harry was bald would have worked for either sex the costume was something an eccentric urban bag lady might have wornfloppy sweatpants with an oversize sweatshirt both as workoutgray as the wig to complete the genderunknown image harry had whorishly painted the toenails of his bare feet there was a mannishly chunky rhinestone earring attached to the lobe of one earmore appealing to a pirate or a professional wrestler than a hookerand a fakepearl necklace the cheapest costume jewelry over the sweatshirt what is caliban exactly kittredge would ask richard abbott earth and water kittredgebrute force and guile richard had repeated but what sex is the guile supposed to be kittredge asked is caliban a lesbian monster is it a she or a he who tried to rape miranda sex sex sex elaine hadley screamed all you think about is sex dont forget those earplugs nymph kittredge said smiling at me elaine and i couldnt look at him without seeing his mother with her legs so perfectly crossed on those uncomfortable bleacher seats at kittredges wrestling match mrs kittredge had seemed to watch her sons systematic mauling of his overmatched opponent as if it were a pornographic film but with the detached confidence of an experienced woman who knew she could do it better your mother is a man with breasts i wanted to say to kittredge but of course i didnt dare i could only guess how kittredge might have responded do you mean my stepmother he would have asked before breaking my arms and legs i spoke to my mom and richard in the privacy of our dormitory apartment what is it about grandpa harry i asked them i know that ariels gender is polymorphousmore a matter of habiliment than anything organic as you say i said to richard okay so my trappings my equipmentthe wig the tightssuggest that ariels gender is mutable but isnt caliban a male monster isnt grandpa harry playing caliban like some kind of i paused i refused to call my grandfather queen lear because that was kittredges nickname for him like some kind of dyke was how i put it the dyke word was in vogue at favorite riveramong those students like kittredge who never tired of homo fag and queer which they used viciously daddy isnt a dyke my mother snapped snapping had once seemed so unlike her now increasingly when she snapped she snapped at me well bill richard abbott started to say then he stopped dont get upset jewel he said to my mom whose agitation had distracted richard what i really think bill richard began again is that gender mattered a whole lot less to shakespeare than it seems to matter to us a lame response i thought but i didnt say so was i growing disappointed in richard or was i just growing up i guess that wasnt an answer to your question was it elaine hadley asked me later when i confessed to her that the sexual identity of grandpa harry as caliban was confusing to me it was funny how when elaine and i were alone we didnt usually hold hands or anything like that but when we were out in public we spontaneously reached for each others hands and we would maintain contact for only as long as we had an audience it was another kind of code between us like the way we would ask each other what happens to the duck yet on our initial visit together to the first sister public library elaine and i didnt hold hands it was my impression that miss frost wouldnt be fooled into thinking that elaine and i were romantically involvednot for a minute elaine and i were just seeking a possible place where we could run our lines for the tempest our dormitory apartments were claustrophobic and very publicunless we ran our lines in her bedroom or mine with the door closed wed been too successful in masquerading as boyfriend and girlfriend my mom and richard or the hadleys would have had a cow if wed closed our bedroom doors when we were together as for the yearbook room in the academy library there was the occasional faculty member at work there and it wasnt a room with a door you could close our voices would have been heard elsewhere in the building elaine and i feared we could be heard throughout the much smaller first sister public library we wondered if there might be a more private room here i explained to miss frost more private the librarian repeated where we wouldnt be heard elaine said in her sonicboom voice we want to run our lines for the tempest but we dont want to bother anyone elaine hastily addedlest miss frost think we were seeking some soundproof asylum for elaines aforementioned first orgasm miss frost looked at me you want to run lines in a library she said as if this were a wellfitted piece to the puzzle of my earlier wanting to write in a library but miss frost didnt betray my intentionsnamely becoming a writer i had not yet been candid with my good friend elaine on the writing subject my desire to be a writer and my other desires were still kept secret from elaine we can try to run our lines quietly elaine said in an abnormally soft voicefor her no no dearyou must feel free to run lines as they should be said onstage miss frost told elaine patting my friends hand with her much bigger hand i think i know a place where you could scream and no one would hear you as it turned out the concept that there was a contained space in the first sister public library where one could scream unheard was not as much of a miracle as the room itself miss frost led elaine and me down the basement stairs to what at first glance appeared to be the furnace room of the old library it was a redbrick building of the georgian period and the buildings first furnace had been coal the blackened remains of the coal chute were still hanging from a transom window but the hulking coal burner had been toppled on its side and dragged to an unused corner of the basement its replacement was a more modern oil furnace quite a newlooking propane hotwater heater stood near the oilburning furnace and a separate room with a door had been assembled in the vicinity of the transom window a rectangular notch near the basement ceiling had been cut in one wall of the roomwhere the remnants of the coal chute dangled from the lone window at one time the coal chute had run from the transom window into the roomformerly the coal bin it was now a furnished bedroom and bathroom there was an oldfashioned brass bed with a headboard of brass rails as sturdylooking as prison bars to which a reading lamp had been affixed there was a small sink and mirror in one corner of the room and in another corner unconcealed stood a solitary sentinelnot an actual guard but a toilet with a wooden seat there was a night table by the bed where i saw an orderly stack of books and a squat scented candle it smelled like cinnamon in the room i guessed that the candle concealed the smell of oil fumes from the nearby furnace there was also an open wardrobe closet where elaine and i could see some shelves and hangerswith what appeared to be a most minimal assortment of miss frosts clothes what was unquestionably the centerpiece of the small roommy converted coal bin miss frost called itwas a bathtub of victorian opulence with very visible plumbing the floor of the room was unfinished plywood and the wiring was very visible too when theres a snowstorm and i dont feel like driving or walking home miss frost saidas if this explained everything that was at once cozy but rudimentary about the basement room neither elaine nor i knew where miss frost lived but we gathered it must have been within walking distance of the town library elaine stared at the bathtub it had lion paws for feet and lion heads for faucets i was i confess fixated on the brass bed with the prisonbars headboard unfortunately theres nowhere to sit but the bed miss frost said unless you want to run lines in the tub she seemed not in the least concerned that elaine and i might ever do anything on the bed or take a bath together miss frost was about to leave us alone to actually close the door on usin her makeshift bedroom her expedient homeawayfromhomewhen elaine hadley exclaimed the room is perfect thank you for helping us miss frost youre very welcome elaine miss frost said i assure you that you and william can scream your heads off in here and no one will hear you but before closing the door miss frost looked at me and smiled if you need any help running linesif theres a question of emphasis or a pronunciation problemwell you know where to find me i didnt know that miss frost had noticed my pronunciation problems id actually spoken very little in her company i was too embarrassed to speak but elaine didnt hesitate now that you mention it miss frost billy has encountered only one difficulty in ariels vocabulary and were working on it elaine said what difficulty is that william miss frost asked me with her most penetrating look thank god there were no penises in ariels vocabulary when caliban calls prospero a tyrant ariel invisible says thou liest since ariel is invisible caliban thinks trinculo has called him a liar in the same scene ariel says thou liest to stephano who thinks trinculo has called him a liarstephano hits trinculo i have to say thou liest twice i told miss frost being careful to say the liest word correctlywith two syllables sometimes he says leastone syllable rhymes with yeast elaine told miss frost oh my the librarian said briefly closing her eyes at the horror of it look at me william miss frost said i did as she told me for once i didnt need to sneak a look at her say finest to me william she said this was not hard to do miss frost was the finest of my allovertheplace infatuations finest i said to her still looking right at her well williamjust remember that liest rhymes with finest miss frost said go on say it elaine told me thou liest i said as the invisible ariel is supposed to say i made a perfect twosyllable match for the finest word may all your difficulties be so easy to fix william miss frost said i love running lines she told elaine as she closed the door i was impressed that miss frost even knew what running lines meant when richard had asked her if shed ever acted miss frost had quickly answered him only in my mind when i was youngerall the time yet shed certainly made a name for herself as a standout in the first sister players miss frost is an ibsen woman nils had said to richard but shed not had many rolesnot beyond those of the severely tested women in hedda gabler a dolls house and the wild fucking duck it suffices to say for someone whod heretofore acted only in her mind but who seemed a natural at portraying ibsens women miss frost was clearly familiar with all that running lines entailedand she couldnt have been more supportive of elaine hadley and me it was awkward at firsthow elaine and i arranged ourselves on miss frosts bed it was only a queensize mattress but the brass bed frame was rather high when elaine and i sat somewhat primly side by side our feet didnt reach the floor but when we stretched out on our stomachs we had to contort ourselves to look at each other it was only when we propped the pillows up against the headboard those brass rails like prison bars that we could lie on our sides facing each other and run our linesour copies of the play held between us for reference were like an old married couple elaine said i was already thinking the same thing our first evening in miss frosts snowstorm room elaine fell asleep i knew she had to get up earlier than i did due to the bus ride to ezra falls she was always tired when miss frost knocked on the door elaine was startled she threw her arms around my neck and she was still holding tight when miss frost came inside the small room notwithstanding these amorouslooking circumstances i dont believe that miss frost assumed wed been making out elaine and i certainly didnt look as if wed been necking and miss frost merely said its almost time for me to close the library even shakespeare has to go home and get some sleep as everyone whos ever been part of a theatrical production knows after all the stressful rehearsals and the interminable memorizationi mean when your lines are truly runeven shakespeare comes to an end we put on four shows of the tempest i managed to make liest rhyme with finest in every performance though on opening night i almost said finest breasts when i thought i saw kittredges wonderfully dressed mother in the audienceonly to learn from kittredge during the intermission that i was mistaken the woman wasnt his mom the woman you think is my mom is in paris kittredge dismissively said oh you must have seen some other middleaged woman who spends too much money on her clothes kittredge said your mother is very beautiful i told him i genuinely meant this in the nicest possible way your mom is hotter kittredge told me matteroffactly there was no hint of sarcasm nor anything the slightest suggestive in his remark he spoke in the same empirical way in which hed said his mother or the woman who wasnt his mother was in paris soon the hot word the way kittredge meant it would be the rage at favorite river later elaine would say to me what are you doing billytrying to be his friend elaine was an excellent miranda though opening night was not her best performance shed needed prompting it was probably my fault good wombs have borne bad sons miranda says to her fatherin reference to antonio prosperos brother id talked to elaine about the goodwombs idea possibly too much id told elaine my own ideas about my biological fatherhow whatever seemed bad in me i had ascribed to the codeboy to the sergeants genes not my moms at the time i still counted my mother among the good wombs in the world she may have been embarrassingly seduciblethe very word i used to describe my mom to elainebut mary marshall dean or abbott was essentially innocent of any wrongdoing maybe my mother was gullible occasionally backwardi said this to elaine in lieu of the retarded wordbut never bad admittedly it was funny how i couldnt pronounce the wombs wordnot even the singular both elaine and i had laughed about how hard i came down on the letter b its a silent b billy elaine had cried you dont say the b it was comical even to me what need did i have of the womb or wombs word but im sure this was why elaine had moms on her mind on opening nightgood moms have borne bad sons elaine as miranda almost said elaine must have heard the moms word coming she stopped herself short after good there was then what every actor fears an incriminating silence wombs my mother whispered she had a prompters perfect whisperit was almost inaudible wombs elaine hadley had shouted richard as prospero had jumped good wombs have borne bad sons miranda back in character too emphatically said it didnt happen again naturally kittredge would say something to elaine about itafter our openingnight performance you need to work on the wombs word naples he told her its probably a word that causes you some nervous excitement you should try saying to yourself every woman has a wombeven i have a womb wombs are no big deal we can work on saying this togetherif it helps you know i say womb you say wombs are no big deal or i say wombs and you say ive got onethat kind of thing thanks kittredge elaine said how very thoughtful she was biting her lower lip which i knew she did only when she was pining for him and hating herself for it i was accustomed to the feeling then suddenly after months of such histrionic closeness our contact with kittredge was over elaine and i were despondent richard tried to talk to us about the postpartum depression that occasionally descends on actors following a play we didnt give birth to the tempest elaine said impatiently shakespeare did speaking strictly for myself i missed running lines on miss frosts brass bed too but when i confessed this to elaine she said why its not like we ever fooled around or anything i was increasingly fond of elaine if not in that way but you have to be careful what you say to your friends when youre trying too hard to make them feel better well it wasnt because i didnt want to fool around with you i told her we were in elaines bedroomwith the door openon a saturday night at the start of winter term this would have been the new year though our ages hadnt changed i was still seventeen and elaine was sixteen it was movie night at favorite river academy and from elaines bedroom window we could see the flickering light of the movie projector in the new onionshaped gym which was attached to the old gymwhere on winter weekends elaine and i often watched kittredge wrestle not this weekend the wrestlers were away competing somewhere to the south of usat mount hermon maybe or at loomis when the team buses returned elaine and i would see them from her fifthfloor bedroom window even in the january cold with all the windows closed the sound of shouting boys reverberated in the quadrangle of dormitories the wrestlers and the other athletes would carry their gear from the buses to the new gym where the lockers and the showers were if the movie was still playing some of the jocks would stay in the gym to see the end but they were showing a western on this saturday night only morons watched the end of a western without seeing the beginning of the moviethe endings were all the same there would be a shootout a predictable comeuppance elaine and i had been betting on whether or not kittredge would stay in the gym to see the end of the westernthat is if the wrestlingteam bus returned before the movie was over kittredge isnt stupid elaine had said he wont hang around the gym to watch the final fifteen minutes of a horse opera elaine had a low opinion of westerns which she called horse operas only when she was being kind she more often called them male propaganda kittredge is a jockhell hang around the gym with the other jocks i had said it doesnt matter what the movie is the jocks who did not hang around the gym after their road trips didnt have far to go the jock dorm which was called tilley was a fivestory brick rectangle next to the gym for whatever mindless reason the jocks always whooped it up in the quad of dorms when they walked or ran to tilley from the gym mr hadley and his homely wife martha were out theyd gone off with richard and my momas they often did together especially when there was a foreign film playing in ezra falls the marquee at the movie house in ezra falls capitalized it when a film had subtitles this wasnt just a warning to those local vermonters who were disinclined or unable to read subtitles this amounted to a caveat of a different kindnamely that a foreign film was likely to have more sexual content than many vermonters were used to when my mom and richard and the hadleys went to ezra falls to see those films with subtitles elaine and i werent usually invited therefore while our parents were out watching sex movies elaine and i were aloneeither in her bedroom or in mine always with the door open elaine did not attend movie night in the favorite river gymnot even when they werent showing a western the atmosphere in the academy gym on movie nights was too allboys for elaines liking faculty daughters of a certain age did not feel comfortable in that youngmale environment there was intentional farting and far worse signs of loutish behavior elaine hypothesized that if they showed the foreign sex films in the academy gym on movie nights some of the boys would beat off on the basketball court generally when we were left alone elaine and i preferred her bedroom to mine the hadleys fifthfloor dormitory apartment had more of an overview of the quad richard and my moms apartment and my bedroom were on the third floor of the dorm our dormitory was called bancroft and there was a bust of old bancroft a longdead professor emeritus at favorite river in the groundfloor common roomthe butt room it was called bancroft or at least his bust was bald and he had bushy eyebrows i was in the process of acquainting myself with favorite river academys past i had encountered photographs of the actual professor bancroft hed been a young faculty member once and id seen his photoswhen he had a full head of hairin those longago yearbooks in the academy library you shouldnt guess about someones past if you dont see any evidence of it a persons past remains unknown to you when elaine went with me to the yearbook room she demonstrated little interest in the older yearbooks that fascinated me i had barely inched my way through the first world war but elaine hadley had begun with the contemporary yearbooks she liked looking at the photographs of boys who were still at the school or whod only recently graduated at the rate we were going elaine and i estimated that we might arrive at the same yearbook in the early years of world war iior just before that war maybe well hes goodlooking elaine would say when she fancied this or that boy in the yearbook photos show me i would sayever her loyal friend but not yet giving myself away to her we had somewhat similar taste in young men its a wonder i dared to suggest that id wanted to fool around with elaine while this was a wellmeaning lie i may also have been trying to throw her off the track i might have been worried that elaine somehow sensed i was given to those homosexual yearnings dr harlow and dr grau sought to treat aggressively at first elaine didnt believe me you just said what she asked me we had been flopping around on her bedcertainly not in a sexual way we were bored listening to a rocknroll station on elaines radio while keeping an eye out her fifthfloor window the return of the team buses meant little to us though this nonevent would mean that kittredge was once again at large in the quad there was a reading lamp with a darkblue shade on elaines windowsill the lamp shade was made of glass as thick as a coke bottle kittredge knew that the darkblue light in the fifthfloor window of bancroft was coming from elaines bedroom ever since wed been in the tempest together kittredge would occasionally serenade that blue light in elaines bedroom which he could see from anywhere in the quadrangle of dormitorieseven from tilley the jock dorm i had not spotted professor tilley in my search of the faculty photographs in the yearbook room if tilley was a professor emeritus at favorite river he must have taught at the school in more modern times than those school days of yorethe ones old bancroft had once whinnied in i didnt realize how much kittredges infrequent serenades meant to elaine they were of course mocking in toneshakespearean patois as elaine described it yet i knew that elaine often fell asleep with that darkblue lamp onand that when kittredge didnt serenade her she was unhappy about it it was into this rocknrollradio atmosphere of idle waiting in the loneliness of elaine hadleys darkblue bedroom where i introduced the idea of my wanting to fool around with her it wasnt that this was such a bad idea it just wasnt true its not surprising that elaines initial response was one of disbelief you just said what my friend elaine asked i dont want to do or say anything that would endanger our friendship i told her you want to fool around with me elaine asked yes i doa little i said no penetration is that what you mean she asked no yes thats what i mean i said elaine knew that i had a little trouble with the penetration word it was one of those nouns that could cause a pronunciation problem for me but i would soon get over it say it billy elaine said no going all the way i told her but what kind of fooling around exactly she asked i lay facedown on her bed and covered my head with one of her pillows this must have been unacceptable to her because she straddled my hips and sat on my lower back i could feel her breathing on the back of my neck she nuzzled my ear kissing she whispered touching yes i said in a muffled voice elaine pulled the pillow off my head touching what she asked i dont know i said not everything elaine said no certainly not i said you can touch my breasts she said i dont have any breasts anyway yes you do i told her she had something there and i admit that i wanted to touch her breasts i confess to wanting to touch all kinds of breasts especially small ones elaine lay next to me on the bed and i turned on my side to look at her do i give you a hardon she asked me yes i lied oh my godits always so hot in this room she suddenly cried sitting up the colder the weather was outside the hotter it was in those old dormitoriesand the higher the floor you were on the hotter it got at bedtime or after lightsout the students were always opening their windows albeit only a crack to let a little cold air in but the ancient radiators would keep cranking up the heat elaine was wearing a boys dress shirtwhite with a buttondown collar though she never buttoned the collar and she always left the top two buttons unbuttoned now she untucked the shirt from her jeans she pinched the shirt between her thumb and index finger and holding it away from her stickthin body she blew on her chest to cool herself off do you have a hardon now she asked me shed opened the window a crack before lying down on the bed beside me noi must be too nervous i told her dont be nervous were just kissing and touching right elaine asked me right i said i could feel a razorsharp draft of cold air from the crackedopen window when elaine kissed me a chaste little peck on the lips which must have been as disappointing to her as it was to mebecause she said tongues are okay french kissing is allowed the next kiss was much more interestingtongues change everything there is a gathering momentum to french kissing elaine and i were unfamiliar with what to do about it perhaps to distract myself i thought of my mother overseeing my wayward father kissing someone else theres a waywardness to french kissing i remember thinking elaine must have needed to distract herself too she broke free from our kiss and breathlessly said not the everly brothers again id been unaware of what was playing on the rocknroll station but elaine rolled away from me reaching for her night table she turned the radio off i want to be able to hear us breathing elaine said rolling into my arms again yes i thoughtbreathing is very different when youre french kissing someone i lifted her untucked shirt and tentatively touched her bare stomach she slid my hand up to her breastwell to her bra anywaywhich was soft and small and fit easily in the palm of my hand is this a training bra i asked her its a padded bra elaine said i dont know about the training part it feels nice i told her i wasnt lying the training word had triggered something though i wasnt sure exactly what i held in the palm of my hand i mean how much of what i felt was her breastor was it mostly the bra elaine as if heralding what our future relationship would become must have read my mind for she saidas always loud and cleartheres more padding than breast if you want to know the truth billy here ill show you she said she sat up and unbuttoned the white shirt slipping it off her shoulders it was a pretty bra more pearlgray than white and when she reached behind her back to unfasten it her bra seemed to expand i had only a glimpse of her small pointy breasts before she put her shirt back on her nipples were bigger than any boys and those darkercolored rings around the nipplesthe areolae another unpronounceable pluralwere almost as big as her breasts but while elaine was buttoning her shirt it was her branow on the bed between usthat captured my attention i picked it up the soft breastshaped pads were sewn into the silky fabric to my surprise i instantly wanted to try it oni wanted to know what it felt like to wear a bra but i was no more honest about this feeling than id been about those other desires i had withheld from my friend elaine it was only the slightest deviation from the norm that signaled to me a fallen boundary in our emerging relationship as always elaine had left the top two buttons of her boys dress shirt unbuttoned but this time shed also left the bottommost button unbuttoned my hand slipped more easily under her untucked shirt it was the real thing what little there was of it that fit so perfectly in my palm i dont know about you billy elaine said as we lay facetoface on one of her pillows but i had always imagined a boy touching my breasts for the first time as messier than it actually is messier i repeated i must have been stalling i was remembering dr harlows annual morningmeeting talk to us boys concerning our treatable afflictions i was recalling that an unwelcome sexual attraction to other boys and men fell into this dubiously curable category i must have repressed the annual morningmeeting presentation of dr grauherr doktor grau as we boys called favorite rivers school psychiatrist dr grau gave us the same lunatic spiel every yearhow we were all of an age of arrested development frozen the herr doktor said like bugs in amber by our frightened expressions we boys could tell that not all of us had seen bugs in amberor even knew what they were you are in the polymorphousperverse phase dr grau assured us it is only natural at this phase that you exhibit infantile sexual tendencies in which the genitals are not yet identified as the sole or principal sexual organs but how could we fail to recognize such an obvious thing about our genitals we boys thought with alarm at this phase herr doktor grau continued coitus is not necessarily the recognizable goal of erotic activity then why did we think about coitus nonstop we boys wondered with dread you are experiencing pregenital libidinal fixations old grau told us as if this were somehow reassuring he also taught german at the academy in the same unintelligible fashion you must come talk to me about these fixations the old austrian always concluded no boy i knew at favorite river admitted to having such fixations no one i knew ever talked to dr grau about anything richard abbott told me and the cast of the tempest that ariels gender was polymorphousmore a matter of habiliment than anything organic this later led richard to conclude that the gender of the character i played was mutable and i was further confused regarding my and ariels sexual orientation yet when i asked richard if he meant anything at all resembling the polymorphousperverse phase of the bugs in amber bullshit dr grau had gone on and on about in morning meeting richard adamantly denied there was any connection no one listens to old grau bill richard had told me dont you listen to him either wise advicebut while it was possible not to heed what dr grau said we boys were forced to hear him and lying next to elaine with my hand on her bare breast and our tongues once more entangled in a way that made us imagine what the next most erotic thing to do with each other was i became aware of my growing erection with our mouths still pressed together elaine managed to ask are you getting a hardon yet yes i was and id noted elaines impatience in her overloud utterance of the yet word but my confusion was such that i was unsure what had initiated my erection yes the french kissing was exciting and to this day the touch of a womans bare breasts is not something i am indifferent to yet i believe my hardon began when i imagined wearing elaines padded bra at that moment wasnt i exhibiting the infantile sexual tendencies dr grau had warned us boys about but all i said to elaine in the midst of our darting tongues was a strangledsounding yes this time when elaine broke free from me she bit my lower lip in the hurriedup process you actually have a boner elaine said to me seriously yes i actually do i admitted i felt my lower lip to be sure i wasnt bleeding i was looking all around for her bra oh godi dont want to see it elaine cried this was sexually confusing to me too i hadnt suggested showing my hardon to her i didnt want her to see it in fact i would have been embarrassed for her to see it i thought it would probably disappoint her or make her laugh or throw up maybe i could just touch it elaine considered more thoughtfully i dont mean your bare boner she quickly added maybe i could just feel iti mean through your clothes surewhy not i said as casually as i could though i would wonder for years if anyone else ever went through a sexual initiation of such a highly negotiated kind the boys at favorite river academy were not permitted to wear jeans dungarees as we called them then were not allowed in class or in the dining hall where we were obliged to wear coats and ties most boys wore khakis orin the winter monthsflannel trousers or corduroys i was wearing a baggy pair of corduroys on this january saturday night it was a comfortable pair of pants to have a boner in but i was also wearing jockey briefs and they were increasingly uncomfortable maybe it was the only mens underwear you could buy in vermont in white jockey briefs i dont know at the time my mom still bought all my clothes id seen kittredges underwear at the gymblue cotton boxers the color of a blue dress shirt maybe his french mother had bought them in paris or in new york that woman has to be his mother elaine had said she could be kittredge if she didnt have those breaststhat woman would know where to buy boxers like that and kittredges blue boxers were pressed this wasnt an affectation of kittredges because the school laundry pressed everythingnot just your trousers and dress shirts but even your underwear and your stupid socks this was talked about with a derision almost equal to that assigned to the advice of dr harlow and dr grau notwithstanding this social history my first erection inspired by elaine hadley or by her bra was stiffening in a tightfitting pair of jockey briefs which were threatening to cut off circulation to my inspired hardon elainewith an aggressiveness i was unprepared forsuddenly put her hand on those very genitals that dr grau had told us wed not yet identified as our own goddamn sexual organs there was no question in my mind concerning what and where my sole or principal sexual organs were and when elaine grabbed hold of them i flinched oh my god elaine cried momentarily deafening the nearer of my ears i cant imagine what having one of those is like this was sexually confusing too did elaine mean that she couldnt imagine what having a penis inside her was like or did elaine mean that she couldnt imagine being a boy and having her own penis i didnt ask i was relieved that shed released my balls from her not inconsiderable grasp but elaine held fast to my penis and i continued to fondle her breasts had we resumed the french kissing where wed left off theres no telling what the aforementioned gathering momentum might have led to but in fact wed just begun to kiss againtentatively at first with only the tips of our tongues making contact i watched elaine close her eyes and i closed mine thus i discovered that it was possible to be holding elaine hadleys breast while i imagined i was fondling an equally permissive miss frost miss frosts breasts would only be slightly bigger than elaines i had long imagined with my eyes closed i could even conceive that the fierce grip of elaines small hand on my penis was in truth miss frosts far bigger handin which case miss frost must have been restraining herself and as the french kissing quickenedboth elaine and i were soon breathlessi fantasized that it was miss frosts long tongue thrusting against mine and that we were entwined on the brass bed in her basement hideaway in the first sister public library when the diesel fumes from the first of the returning team buses reached the crackedopen window of elaines fifthfloor room i managed to think i was smelling the oilburning furnace next to miss frosts former coal bin of a bedroom when i opened my eyes i half expected to be facetoface with miss frost but there instead was my friend elaine hadley with her eyes tightly closed all the time id been imagining miss frost it had not occurred to me that elaine might have been imagining too not surprisingly the name on her lips which she somehow managed to say in my mouth was kittredge elaine had correctly identified the diesel fumes from the returning team bus she was wondering if it was the wrestlingteam bus because shed been imagining kittredge while i was imagining miss frost elaines eyes were wide open now i must have looked as guilty as she did there was a pulse in my penis if i could feel it throbbing i knew that elaine could feel it too your hearts beating billy she said thats not my heart i told her yes it isyour heart is beating in your penis elaine said do all boys hearts beat there i cant speak for other boys i answered but shed let go of my penis and had rolled away from me there was more than one parked bus at the gym with its diesel engine running the flickering light from the movie projector was still blinking from the basketball court and the meaningless shouts and whoops of the returning jocks echoed in the dormitory quadranglethe wrestlers were among them maybe or maybe not elaine now lay on the bed with her forehead almost touching the windowsill where the draft of cold air from the crackedopen window was the coldest when i was kissing you and holding your penis and you were touching my breasts i was thinking of kittredgethat bastard elaine told me i knowits okay i said to her i knew what a good and truthful friend she was buteven soi couldnt tell her that id been thinking of miss frost no its not okay elaine said she was crying elaine was lying on her side at the foot of her bed facing the window and i stretched out behind her with my chest flush to her back i could kiss the back of her neck that way and with one hand i could manage to touch her breasts under her untucked shirt the heartbeat in my penis was still pounding away through her jeans through my corduroy pants i doubted that elaine could detect the pulse in my penis though i had pressed myself against her and shed thrust her small bum into me elaine had a boys nonexistent bottom and no hips to speak of she was wearing a pair of boys dungarees to go with her boys shirt and i suddenly thought as i kissed her neck and her damp hair that elaine actually smelled like a boy too after all shed been sweating she wore no perfume no makeup of any kind not even lipstick and here i was rubbing myself against her boyish bum you still have a hardon dont you she asked me yes i said i was embarrassed that i couldnt stop rubbing against her but elaine was moving her hips she was rubbing against me too its okaywhat youre doing elaine told me no its not okay i said but i lacked the conviction id heard in elaines voicewhen only a moment ago shed said the same thing to me what i meant of course was that i was thinking of kittredge too miss frost was a big woman she was broadshouldered and her hips were wide miss frost did not have a young boys bum by no stretch of my imagination was i thinking of miss frost while i rubbed myself against elaine hadley who was quietly crying no really its okayi like it too elaine was saying softly when we both heard kittredge calling from the quad my sweet naplesis that your blue light burning kittredge called i felt elaines body stiffen there were other boys voices in the quadranglein the area of tilley the jock dormbut only kittredges voice stood out distinctly i told you he wouldnt watch the end of a westernthat bastard elaine whispered to me oh naplesis your blue light a beacon for me kittredge called are you still a maid naples or a maid no more he called out i would realize one day that kittredge was mockshakespeareana kind of faux shakespeareto his core elaine was sobbing when she reached to turn off her lamp with the darkblue shade when she thrust herself back into me her sobs were louder she was grunting as she rubbed against me her sobs and grunts were strangely commingled not unlike the yelps a dog makes when its dreaming dont let him get to you elainehes such an asshole i whispered in her ear shhh she hushed me no actual talking she said breathlessly between her halfstrangled cries is that you naples kittredge called to her lights out so soon to bed alone alas my dress shirt had come untucked from my corduroys it must have been the incessant rubbing the shirt was bluethe same color as kittredges boxers i was thinking elaine began to moan keep doing it do it harder she moaned yes like thatgod dont stop she cried loudly i could see her breath in that cold razor of air from the open window i was grinding against her for what seemed the longest time before i realized what i was saying like that i kept asking her like that no actual talking as elaine had requested but our voices were being broadcast to the quadrangle of dormsall the way to tilley and the gym where the returning team buses were still unloading the flickering light from the movie projector had stopped the windows of the basketball court were in darkness the western was over the gun smoke from the shootout had drifted awaylike the favorite river boys drifting back to their dormitories but not kittredge cut it out naples kittredge called are you there too nymph he called to me elaine had begun a prolonged orgasmic scream she would say later more like childbirth than orgasm or so i imagineim never having any children have you seen the size of babies heads she asked me her caterwauling may have sounded like an orgasm to kittredge elaine and i were still straightening out the bedcovers when we heard the knock on the door from the dormitory hall god wheres my bra elaine asked she couldnt find it in the bedcovers but she wouldnt have had time to put it on anyway she had to answer the door its him i warned her of course it is she said she went into the living room of the apartment she looked at herself in the long mirror in the foyer before opening the door i found her bra on the bed it had been lost in the crazy patterns of the rumpled quilt but i quickly stuffed it into my jockey briefs my erection had completely subsided there was more room for elaines little bra in my briefs than there had been for my hardon i wanted to be sure you were all right i heard kittredge saying to elaine i was afraid there was a fire or something there was a fire all right but im fine elaine told him i came out of elaines bedroom shed not invited kittredge into the apartment he stood in the doorway to the dorm some of the bancroft boys scurried by in the hall peering into the foyer so youre here too nymph kittredge said to me i saw that he had a fresh mat burn on one cheek but the mat burn made him no less cocksure than before i suppose you won your match i said to him thats right nymph he said but he kept looking at elaine because her shirt was white you could see her nipples through the fabric and the darker rings around her nipplesthose unpronounceable areolaelooked like wine stains on her fair skin this doesnt look good naples wheres your bra kittredge asked her elaine smiled at me did you find it she asked me i didnt really look all that hard for it i lied you should think about your reputation naples kittredge told her this was a new tack for him it caught both elaine and me offguard theres nothing wrong with my reputation elaine said defensively you should think about her reputation too nymph kittredge told me a girl cant get her reputation backif you know what i mean i didnt know you were such a prude elaine said to him but i could tell that the reputation wordor everything kittredge had insinuated about ittruly upset her im not a prude naples he said smiling at her it was a smile you give a girl when youre alone with her i could see that shed allowed him to get to her i was just faking it kittredge she yelled at him i was just actingwe both were she shouted it didnt sound like actingnot entirely he said to her you have to be careful who you pretend to be nymph kittredge said to me but he kept looking at elaine as if he were alone with her well if youll excuse me kittredge i should find my bra and put it on before my parents come homeyou should go too billy elaine said to me but she never took her eyes off kittredge neither of them looked at me it was not yet eleven oclock when kittredge and i stepped into the fifthfloor hall of the dorm the bancroft boys who were loitering in the hall or gawking at kittredge from the open doorways of their rooms were clearly shocked to see him did you win again some kid asked him kittredge just nodded i heard the wrestling team lost another boy said im not the team kittredge told him i can only win my weightclass we went down the stairwell to the third floor where i said good night to him dorm checkineven for seniors on a saturday nightwas at eleven i suppose richard and your mom are out with the hadleys kittredge said matteroffactly yes theres a foreign film in ezra falls i told him humping in french italian or swedish kittredge said i laughed but he wasnt trying to be funny you know nymphyoure not in france italy or sweden youve got to be more careful with that girl youre humping or not humping at the moment i wondered if kittredge might be genuinely concerned for elaines reputation as hed referred to it but you could never tell with kittredge you often didnt see where he was going with what he said i would never do anything to hurt elaine i told him listen nymph he said you can hurt people by having sex with them and by not having sex with them i guess thats true i said cautiously does your mom sleep naked or does she wear something kittredge asked me as if he hadnt suddenly changed the subject she wears something i told him well thats mothers for you he said most mothers anyway he added its almost eleven i warned him you dont want to be late for checkin does elaine sleep naked kittredge asked me of course what i should have told him was that my desire never to do anything to hurt elaine prevented me from telling the likes of kittredge whether she slept naked or not but in truth i didnt know if elaine slept naked i thought it would be perfectly mysterious to say to kittredge which i did when elaines with me shes not asleep to which kittredge simply said youre a mystery arent you nymph i just dont know about you but ill figure you out one dayi really will youre going to be late for checkin i told him im going to the infirmaryim going to get this mat burn checked out he said pointing to his cheek it wasnt much of a mat burn in my opinion but kittredge said i like the weekend nurse at the infirmarythe mat burns just an excuse to see her saturday night is a good night to stay in the infirmary he told me on that provocative note he left methat was kittredge if he was still figuring me out i hadnt yet figured him out was there really a weekend nurse at the favorite river infirmary did kittredge have an olderwoman thing going or was he acting as elaine and i had been was he just faking it i hadnt been back in our dormitory apartment for very long not more than a couple of minutes before my mom and richard came home from the movie id barely had time to take elaines padded bra from my jockey briefs id no sooner put the bra under my pillow when elaine phoned me you have my bra dont you she asked me what happens to the duck i asked her but she wasnt in the mood for it do you have my bra billy yes i said it was a spurofthemoment thing thats okay she said i want you to have it i didnt tell her that kittredge had asked me if she slept naked then richard and my mom came home and i asked them about the foreign film it was disgusting my mother said i didnt know you were such a prude i said to her take it easy bill richard said im not a prude my mom told me she seemed unreasonably upset i had been kidding it was just something id heard elaine say to kittredge i didnt know what the movie was about jewel richard said to her im sorry look at you my mom said to me you look more wrinkled than an unmade bed i think you should have that conversation with billy richard my mom went into their bedroom and closed the door what conversation i asked richard its about being careful with elaine bill richard said shes younger than you areits about being sure youre protecting her richard told me are you talking to me about rubbers i asked him because you can only get them in ezra falls and that asshole pharmacist wont give condoms to kids dont say asshole bill richard said at least not around your mom you want rubbers ill get you rubbers theres no danger with elaine i told him did i see kittredge leaving bancroft as we were coming home richard asked i dont know i said did you youre at a pivotal age bill richard told me we just want you to be careful with elaine i am careful with her i told him youd better keep kittredge away from her richard said just how do i do that i asked him well bill richard had started to say when my mother came out of their bedroom i remember thinking that kittredge would have been disappointed by what she was wearingflannel pajamas not at all sexy youre still talking about sex arent you my mom asked richard and me she was angry i know thats what you were talking about well its not funny we werent laughing jewel richard tried to tell her but she wouldnt let him continue you keep your pecker in your pants billy my mom told me you go slowly with elaine and you tell her to watch out for jacques kittredgeshe better watch out for him that kittredge is a boy who doesnt just want to seduce womenhe wants women to submit to him my mother said jewel jewellet it rest richard abbott was saying you dont know everything richard my mother told him no i dont richard admitted i know boys like kittredge my mom said she said it to me not to richardeven so she blushed it occurred to me that when my mother was angry at me it was because she saw something of my womanizing father in meperhaps increasingly i looked like him as if i could help that i thought of elaines bra which was waiting for me under my pillowmore a matter of habiliment than anything organic as richard had said about ariels gender if that small padded bra didnt fit the habiliment word what did what was the foreign film about i asked richard its not an appropriate subject for you my mother told me dont you tell him about it richard my mother said sorry bill richard said sheepishly nothing shakespeare would have shied away from ill bet i said to richard but i kept looking at my mom she wouldnt look at me she went back inside her bedroom and closed the door if i was less than forthcoming to my one true friend elaine hadley i needed only to think of my mother if i couldnt tell richard about my crush on kittredge or admit to miss frost that i loved her i had no doubt concerning where my lack of candor came from from my mother unquestionably but possibly from my womanizing father too maybe from both of them it only now occurred to me good night richardi love you i said to my stepfather he quickly kissed me on my forehead good night billi love you too richard said he gave me a pleaseforgiveme kind of smile i really did love him but i was fighting against my disappointment in him at the same time also i was mortally tired it is exhausting to be seventeen and not know who you are and elaines bra was summoning me to my bed chapter leaving esmeralda perhaps you need to have your world change your entire world to understand why anyone would write an epiloguenot to mention why there is an act to the tempest and why the epilogue to that play spoken by prospero is absolutely fitting when i made that juvenile criticism of the tempest my world hadnt changed now my charms are all oerthrown prospero begins the epiloguenot unlike the way kittredge might have started a conversation offhand and innocentseeming that winter of when elaine and i were continuing our masquerade which even extended to our holding hands while we watched kittredge wrestle was marked by martha hadleys first official efforts to address the probable cause or causes of my pronunciation problems i use the official word because i made appointments to see mrs hadley and i met with her in her officeit was in the academy music building at seventeen id not yet seen a psychiatrist had i ever been tempted to talk to herr doktor grau im certain that my beloved stepfather richard abbott would have persuaded me not to besides that same winter when i was faithfully keeping my appointments with mrs hadley old grau died favorite river academy would eventually replace him with a younger if no less modern school psychiatrist but not before the fall term of the next academic year moreover while i was seeing martha hadley i had no need of a psychiatrist in the ferreting out of those myriad words i couldnt pronounce and in her farreaching speculations regarding the reason or reasons for my mispronunciations mrs hadley an expert voice and singing teacher became my first psychiatrist my closer contact with her gave me a better understanding of my attraction to herher homeliness notwithstanding martha hadley had a masculine kind of homeliness she was thinlipped but she had a big mouth and big teeth her jaw was as prominent as kittredges but her neck was long and contrastingly feminine she had broad shoulders and big hands like miss frost mrs hadleys hair was longer than miss frosts and she wore it in a severe ponytail her flat chest never failed to remind me of elaines overlarge nipples and those darkerskinned rings around themthe areolae which i imagined were a motherdaughter thing but unlike elaine mrs hadley was very stronglooking i was realizing how much i liked that look when the areola and areolae words were added to my long list of troublesome pronunciations martha hadley asked me does the difficulty lie in what they are maybe i answered her fortunately theyre not words that come up every day whereas library or libraries not to mention penis mrs hadley started to say its more of a problem with the plural i reminded her i suppose you dont have much use for penisesi mean the plural billy martha hadley said not every day i told her i meant that the occasion to say the penises word rarely came upnot that i didnt think about penises every day because i did and somaybe because i hadnt told elaine or richard abbott or grandpa harry and probably because i didnt dare tell miss frosti told mrs hadley everything well almost everything i began with my crush on kittredge you and elaine martha hadley said elaine had even been forthcoming to her mother about it i told mrs hadley that before i ever saw kittredge id had a homoerotic attraction to other wrestlers and thatin my perusal of the old yearbooks in the favorite river academy libraryi had a special fondness for the wrestlingteam photographs in comparison to a merely passing interest in the photos of the school drama club i see mrs hadley said i even told her about my slightly fading crush on richard abbott it had been at its strongest before he became my stepfather my goodnessthat must have been awkward martha hadley exclaimed but when it came to confessing my love for miss frost i stopped my eyes welled with tears what is it billy you can tell me mrs hadley said she took my hands in her bigger stronger hands her long neck her throat was possibly the only pretty thing about her without much evidence i could merely speculate that martha hadleys small breasts were like elaines in mrs hadleys office there was just a piano with a bench an old couch where we always sat and a desk with a straightbacked chair the thirdfloor view out her office window was uninspiringthe twisted trunks of two old maple trees some snow on the more horizontal limbs of the trees the sky streaked with graywhite clouds the photo of mr hadley on mrs hadleys desk was also uninspiring mr hadleyive long forgotten his first name if i ever knew itseemed unsuited to boardingschool life mr hadleyshaggy spottily beardedwould one day become a more active figure on the favorite river campus where he lent his historyteaching expertise to discussions which later led to protests of the vietnam war more memorable by far than mr hadley was the day of my confession in martha hadleys office when i concentrated all my attention on mrs hadleys throat whatever you tell me billy will not leave this officei swear she said somewhere in the music building a student was practicing the pianonot with the greatest competence i thought or perhaps there were two students playing two different pianos i look at my mothers mailorder catalogs i confessed to mrs hadley i imagine you among the trainingbra models i told her i masturbate i admittedone of the few verbs that gave me a little trouble though not this time oh billy this isnt criminal activity martha hadley said happily im only surprised that you would think of meim not in the least goodlookingand its a mild surprise that training bra is so easy for you to pronounce im not finding a discernible pattern here she said waving the growing list of those words that challenged me i dont know what it is about you i confessed to her what about girls your own age mrs hadley asked me i shook my head not elaine she asked i hesitated but martha hadley put her strong hands on my shoulders she faced me on the couch its all right billyelaine doesnt believe that youre interested in her in that way and this is strictly between us remember my eyes filled with tears again mrs hadley pulled my head to her hard chest billy billyyouve done nothing wrong she cried whoever knocked on the door to her office surely had heard the wrong word come in mrs hadley called in such a strident way that i realized where elaines stopyouinyourtracks voice came from it was atkinsan acknowledged loser but id not known he was a music student maybe atkins had a voice issue perhaps there were words he couldnt pronounce i can come back atkins said to martha hadley but he wouldnt stop staring at me or he couldnt look at herone or the other any idiot would have known id been crying come back in half an hour mrs hadley told atkins okay but i dont have a watch he said still staring at me take mine she told him it was when she took her watch off and handed it to him that i saw what it was that attracted me to her martha hadley not only had a masculine appearanceshe was dominant like a man in everything she did i could only imagine sexually that she was dominant toothat she would impose what she wanted on anyone and that it would be difficult to resist what she wanted you to do but why would that appeal to me naturally i wouldnt make these thoughts part of my selective confession to mrs hadley atkins was mutely staring at the watch it made me wonder if he was such a loser and an idiot that he couldnt tell time in half an hour martha hadley reminded him the numbers are roman numerals atkins said despondently just keep your eye on the minute hand count to thirty minutes come back then mrs hadley said to him atkins walked off still staring at the watch he left the office door open mrs hadley got up from the couch and closed the door billy billy she said turning to me its all right to feel what youre feelingits okay i thought of talking to richard about it i told her thats a good idea you can talk to richard about anythingim sure of that martha hadley said but not my mother i said your mother mary my dear friend mary mrs hadley began then she stopped no not your motherdont tell her yet she said why i asked i thought i knew why but i wanted to hear mrs hadley say it because shes a little damaged i asked or because she seems angry at meim not sure why i dont know about the damaged part martha hadley said your mother does seem angry at youim not sure why either i was mainly thinking that she becomes rather easily unhingedin some areas given certain subjects what areas i asked what subjects certain sexual matters upset her mrs hadley said billy i know there are things shes kept from you oh secrecy isnt my favorite thing about new england mrs hadley suddenly cried she looked at her wrist where her watch had been and then laughed at herself i wonder how atkins is managing the roman numerals she said and we both laughed you can tell elaine too you know martha hadley said you can tell elaine anything billy besides i think she already knows i thought so too but i didnt say it i was thinking about my mother becoming rather easily unhinged i was regretting that i hadnt consulted dr grau before he diedif only because i could have familiarized myself with his doctrine of how curable homosexuality was it might have made me less angry in the coming years when i would be exposed to more of that punitive dumberthandogshit doctrine its really helped me to talk to you i told mrs hadley she moved away from her office door to let me pass i was afraid she was going to grasp my hands or my shoulders or even pull my head to her hard chest again and that i would be unable to stop myself from hugging heror kissing her though i would have had to stand on my toes to do that but martha hadley didnt touch me she just stood aside theres nothing wrong with your voice billytheres nothing physically the matter with your tongue or with the roof of your mouth she said id forgotten that she had looked in my mouth at our very first appointment shed asked me to touch the roof of my mouth with my tongue and shed held the tip of my tongue with a gauze pad andwith another gauze padshed poked around on the floor of my mouth apparently feeling for something that wasnt there id been embarrassed that her playing around in my mouth had given me an erectionmore evidence of what old grau had called infantile sexual tendencies not to defame the dead mrs hadley said as i was leaving but i hope youre aware billy that the late dr grau and our sole surviving faculty member in the medical sciencesi mean dr harloware both imbeciles thats what richard says i told her listen to richard mrs hadley said hes a sweet man it would be years later when i had this thought in a small lessthanfirstrate boarding school there were various indications of the adult worldsome truly sensitive and goodhearted grownups who were trying to make the adult world more comprehensible and more bearable for young people while there were also those dinosaurs of an inflexible rectitude the dr graus and the dr harlows and the tirelessly intractable homophobes men of their ilk and generation have spawned how did dr grau really die i asked mrs hadley the story theyd told us boysdr harlow had told us in morning meetingwas that grau had slipped and fallen in the quadrangle one winter night the paths were icy the old austrian must have hit his head dr harlow did not say that herr doktor grau actually froze to deathi believe that hypothermia was the term dr harlow used the boys who were on the kitchen crew found the body in the morning one of them said that graus face was as white as the snow and another boy told us that the old austrians eyes were open but a third boy said the dead mans eyes were closed there was agreement among the kitchen boys that dr graus tyrolean hat with a greasylooking pheasant feather was discovered at some distance from the body grau was drunk martha hadley told me thered been a faculty dinner party in one of the dorms grau probably did slip and fallhe may have hit his head but he was definitely drunk he was passed out in the snow all night he froze dr grau like no small number of the faculty at favorite river had applied for a job at the academy because of the nearby skiing but old grau hadnt skied for years dr grau was terribly fat he said he could still ski very well but he admitted that when he fell down he couldnt get upnot without taking his skis off first i used to imagine grau fallen on the slope flailing to release his bindings shouting infantile sexual tendencies in english and german id chosen german for my language requirement at favorite river but only because id been assured that there were three other german teachers at the academy i never had to be taught by herr doktor grau the other german teachers were also austrianstwo of them skiers my favorite fräulein bauer was the only nonskier as i was leaving mrs hadleys office i suddenly remembered what fräulein bauer had told me i made many grammatical mistakes in german and the wordorder business gave me fits but my pronunciation was perfect there was no german word i couldnt pronounce yet when i told martha hadley this news she seemed barely interestedif at all its psychological billy you can say anything in the sense that youre able to say it but you either wont say a word because it triggers something or i interrupted her it triggers something sexual you mean i said maybe said mrs hadley she shrugged she seemed barely interested in the sexual part of my pronunciation problems as if sexual speculation of any kind was in a category as uninteresting to her as my excellent pronunciation in german i had an austrian accent naturally i think youre as angry at your mother as she is at you martha hadley told me at times billy i think youre too angry to speak oh i heard someone coming up the stairs it was atkins still staring at mrs hadleys watch i was surprised he didnt trip on the stairs it hasnt been thirty minutes yet atkins reported im leavingyou can go in i told him but atkins had paused on the stairs one step away from the third floor i passed him as i headed down the stairs the stairwell was wide i must have been close to the ground floor when i heard mrs hadley say please come in but it hasnt been thirty minutes its not atkins didnt or couldnt finish his thought its not what i heard martha hadley ask him i remember pausing on the stairs i know you can say it she said gently to him youre wearing a tieyou can say tie cant you its not tie atkins managed now say mmmlike when you eat something good mrs hadley told him i cant atkins blurted out please come in mrs hadley said again its not tiemmm atkins struggled to say thats goodthats better anyway please come in now martha hadley told him and i continued down the stairs and out of the music building where id also heard snippets of songs choral voices and a secondfloor segment of stringed instruments and on the ground floor another inprogress piano practice but my thoughts were entirely on what a loser and an idiot atkins washe couldnt pronounce the time word what a fool i was halfway across the quad where grau had died when i thought that the hatred of homosexuals was perfectly in tune with my thinking i couldnt pronounce penises yet here i was feeling utterly superior to a boy who couldnt manage to say time i remember thinking that for the rest of my life i would need to find more people like martha hadley and surround myself with them but that there would always be other people who would hate and revile meor even try to cause me physical harm this thought was as bracing as the winter air that killed dr grau it was a lot to absorb from one appointment with a sympathetic voiceandsinging teacherthis in addition to my disturbing awareness of mrs hadley as a dominant personality and that something to do with her dominance appealed to me sexually or was there something about her dominance that didnt appeal to me it only then occurred to me that maybe i wanted to be like mrs hadleythat is sexuallynot be with her maybe martha hadley was a hippie ahead of her time the hippie word was not in use in at that time id heard next to no mention of the gay word it was a littleused word in the favorite river academy community maybe gay was too friendly a word for favorite riverat least it was too neutral a word for all those homohating boys i did know what gay meant of courseit just wasnt said much in my limited circlesbut as sexually inexperienced as i was id given scant consideration to what was meant by dominant and submissive in the seemingly unattainable world of gay sex not that many years later when i was living with larryof the men and women ive tried to live with i lasted with larry the longesthe liked to make fun of me by telling everyone how shocked i was at the way he picked me up in that gay coffeehouse which was such a mysterious place in vienna this was my junior year abroad two years of college germannot to mention my studying the language at favorite river academyhad prepared me for a year in a germanspeaking country these same two college years of living in new york city had both prepared me and not prepared me for how underground a gay coffeehouse in vienna would be in that academic year of at that time the gay bars in new york were being shut down the new york worlds fair was in and it was the mayors intention to clean up the city for the tourists one new york bar julius remained open the whole timethere may have been othersbut even at julius the men at the bar werent permitted to touch one another im not saying vienna was more underground than new york at that time the situation was similar but in that place where larry picked me up there was some touching among the menpermitted or not i just remember it was larry who shocked me not vienna are you a top or a bottom beautiful bill larry had asked me i was shocked but not by the question a top i answered without hesitation really larry said either genuinely surprised or feigning surprise with larry this was often hard to tell you look like a bottom to me he said and after a pausesuch a long pause that id thought he was going to ask someone else to go home with himhe added come on bill lets leave now i was shocked all right but only because i was a college student and larry was my professor this was the institut für europäische studien in viennadas institut the students called it we were americans from all over but our faculty was a mixed bag some americans larry was by far the bestknown among them one wonderful and eccentric englishman and various austrians from the faculty at the university of vienna in those days the institute for european studies was on that end of the wollzeile nearest the doktorkarlluegerplatz and the stubenring the students complained about how far das institut was from the university many of our students the ones with better german took additional courses at the university of vienna not me i wasnt interested in more courses id gone to college in new york because i wanted to be in new york i was studying abroad in vienna to be in vienna i didnt care how near to or far from the university i was my german was good enough to get me hired at an excellent restaurant on the weihburggassenear the opposite end of the kärntnerstrasse from the opera it was called zufall coincidence and i got the job both because i had worked as a waiter in new york and because shortly after i arrived in vienna i learned that the only englishspeaking waiter at zufall had been fired id heard the story in that mysterious gay coffeehouse on the dorotheergasseone of those side streets off the graben the kaffee käfig it was calledthe coffee cage during the day it appeared to be mostly a student hangout there were girls there tooin fact it was daytime when a girl told me that the waiter at zufall had been fired but after dark the older men showed up at the kaffee käfig and there werent any girls around that was how it was the night i ran into larry and he popped the toporbottom question that first fall term at the institute i was not one of larrys students he was teaching the plays of sophocles larry was a poet and i wanted to be a novelisti thought i was done with theater and i didnt write poems but i knew that larry was a respected writer and id asked him if he would consider offering a writing coursein either the winter or the spring term in oh godnot a creative writing class larry said i knowdont tell me one day creative writing will be taught everywhere i just wanted to be able to show my writing to another writer i told him im not a poet i admitted im a fiction writer i understand if youre not interested i was walking awayi was trying to look hurtwhen he stopped me wait waitwhat is your name young fiction writer larry asked i do read fiction he told me i told him my namei said bill because miss frost owned the william name i would publish my novels under the name william abbott but i let no one else call me william well billlet me think about it larry said i knew then that he was gay and everything else he was thinking but i wouldnt become his student until january when he offered a creative writing course at the institute in the winter term larry was the alreadydistinguished poetlawrence upton to his colleagues and students but his gay friends and a coterie of lady admirers called him larry by then id been with a few older menid not lived with them but theyd been my loversand i knew who i was when it came to the toporbottom business it was not the crudeness of larrys toporbottom question that shocked me even his firsttime students knew that lawrence upton was a famous snob who could also be notoriously crass it was simply that my teacher who was such a renowned literary figure had hit on methat shocked me but that was never how larry told the story and there was no contradicting him according to larry he hadnt asked me if i was a top or a bottom in the sixties dear bill we did not say top and bottomwe said pitcher and catcher though of course you vermonters might have been prescient larry said or so far ahead of the rest of us that you were already asking plus or minus while we lessprogressive types were still stuck with the pitcherorcatcher question which soon would become the toporbottom question just not in the sixties dear bill in vienna when i picked you up i know i asked you if you were a pitcher or a catcher then turning from me to our friendshis friends for the most part both in vienna and later back in new york most of larrys friends were older than i waslarry would say bill is a fiction writer but he writes in the firstperson voice in a style that is tellall confessional in fact his fiction sounds as much like a memoir as he can make it sound then turning back to mejust me as if we were alonelarry would say yet you insist on anachronisms dear billin the sixties the top and bottom words are anachronisms that was larry that was how he talkedhe was always right i learned not to argue about the smaller stuff i would say yes professor because if id said he was mistaken that he had absolutely used the top and bottom words larry would have made another crack about my being from vermont or he would have shot the breeze about my saying i was a pitcher when all along id looked like a catcher to him didnt everyone think i looked like a catcher larry would usually ask his friends the poet lawrence upton was of that generation of older gay men who basically believed that most gay men were bottoms no matter what they saidor that those of us who said we were tops would eventually be bottoms since larry and i met in vienna our enduring disagreement concerning exactly what was said on our first date was further clouded by what many europeans felt in the sixties and still feel todaynamely that we americans make entirely too much of the toporbottom business the europeans have always believed we were too rigid about these distinctions as if everyone gay is either one or the otheras some young cocksure types tell me nowadays larrywho was a bottom if i ever knew onecould be both petulant and coy about how misunderstood he was im more versatile than you are he once said to me in tears you may say you also like women or you pretend that you do but im not the truly inflexible one in this relationship by the late seventies in new york when we were still seeing each other but no longer living togetherlarry called the seventies the blissful age of promiscuityyou could only be absolutely sure of someones sexual role in those overobvious leather bars where a hankie in the back left pocket meant you were a top and a hankie in the back right pocket signified that you were a bottom a blue hankie was for fucking a red one was for fistfuckingwell what does it matter anymore there was also that utterly annoying signal concerning where you clipped your keysto the belt loop to the right or left of the belt buckle on your jeans in new york i paid no attention to where i clipped my keys i was always getting hit on by some signalconscious top and i was a top it could be irritating even in the late seventies almost a decade after gay liberation the older gaysi mean not only older than me but also older than larrywould complain about the toporbottom advertising why do you guys want to take all the mystery away isnt the mystery an exciting part of sex i liked to look like a gay boyor enough like one to make other gay boys and men look twice at me but i wanted the girls and women to wonder about meto make them look twice at me too i wanted to retain something provocatively masculine in my appearance are you trying to look toppish tonight larry once asked me yes maybe i was i remembered when we were rehearsing the tempest how richard had said that ariels gender was mutable hed said the sex of angels was mutable too directors choice kittredge had asked richard about ariels mutability i suppose i was trying to look sexually mutable to capture something of ariels unresolved sexuality i knew i was small but goodlooking i could also be invisible when i wanted to belike ariel i could be an airy spirit there is no one way to look bisexual but that was the look i sought larry liked to make fun of me for having what he called a utopian notion of androgyny for his generation i think that socalled liberated gays were no longer supposed to be sissies i know that larry thought i looked and dressed like a sissythat was probably why i looked like a bottom to him not a top but i saw myself as an almost regular guy by regular i mean only that i was never into leather or the bullshit hankie code in new yorkas in most cities through the seventiesthere was a lot of street cruising then and now i liked the androgynous looknor were androgynous and androgyny ever words that gave me pronunciation problems youre a pretty boy bill larry often said to me but dont think you can stay ultrathin forever dont imagine that you can dress like a razor blade or even in drag and have any real effect on the macho codes youre rebelling against you wont change what real men are like nor will you ever be one yes professor was all i usually said in the fabulous seventies when i picked up a guy or i let myself be picked up there was always that moment when my hand got hold of his butt if he liked to be fucked he would start moaning and writhing aroundjust to let me know id hit the magic spot but if he turned out to be a top we would settle for a superfast and call it a night sometimes this would turn into a superrough the macho codes as larry called them might prevail my utopian notion of androgyny might not it was larrys formidable jealousy that eventually drove me away from him even when youre as young as i was theres a limit to enduring admiration being a substitute for love when larry thought id been with someone else he would try to touch my assholeto feel if i was wet or at least lubricated im a top remember i used to tell him you should be sniffing my cock instead but larrys jealousy was insanely illogical even knowing me as well as he did he actually believed i was capable of being a bottom with someone else when i met larry in vienna he was making himself a student of opera therethe opera was why hed come the opera was partly why id chosen vienna too after all miss frost had made me a devoted reader of nineteenthcentury novels the operas i loved were nineteenthcentury novels lawrence upton was a wellestablished poet but hed always wanted to write a libretto after all bill i know how to rhyme larry had this wish to write a gay opera he was very strict with himself as a poet maybe he imagined he could be more relaxed as a librettist he may have wanted to write a gay opera but lawrence upton never wrote an openly gay poemthat used to piss me off more than a little in larrys opera some cynical queensomeone a lot like larryis the narrator the narrator sings a lamentits deliberately foolish and i forget how it rhymes too many indians not enough chiefs the narrator laments too many chickens not enough roosters it was very relaxed all right there is a chorus of bottomsnumerous bottoms naturallyand a comically muchsmaller chorus of tops if larry had continued his opera its possible he would have added a mediumsize chorus of bears but the bear movement didnt begin until the mideightiesthose big hairy guys consciously sloppy rebelling against the chiseled neatandtrim men with their shaved balls and gym bodies those bears were so refreshing at first needless to say larrys libretto was never made as an opera his career as a librettist was abandoned inprogress larry would be remembered only as a poet though i remember his gayopera ideaand those many nights at the staatsoper the vast vienna state opera when i was still so young it was a valuable lesson for the young wouldbe writer that i was to see a great man an accomplished poet fail you must be careful when you stray from an acquired disciplinewhen i first hooked up with larry i was still learning that writing is such a discipline opera may be a flamboyant form of storytelling but a librettist also follows some rules good writing isnt relaxed to larrys credit he was the first to acknowledge his failure as a librettist that was a valuable lesson too when you compromise your standards bill dont blame the form opera is not at fault im not the victim of this failure billim the perpetrator you can learn a lot from your lovers butfor the most partyou get to keep your friends longer and you learn more from them at least i have i would even say that my friend elaines mother martha hadley had a greater influence on me than lawrence upton truly had in fact at favorite river academy where i was a junior in the winter of and vermont boy that i was given my naïvetéi had never heard the top or bottom words used in that way larry or any number of my gay friends and lovers would later use them but i knew i was a top before id ever had sex with anyone that day i made my partial confession to martha hadley when mrs hadleys obvious dominance made such a strong but bewildering impression on me i absolutely knew that i ceaselessly desired fucking other boys and men but always with my penis in their bottoms i never desired the penis of another boy or man penetrating me in my mouth yesin my asshole no even as i desired kittredge i knew this much about myself i wanted to fuck him and to take his penis in my mouth but i didnt want him to fuck me knowing kittredge how utterly crazy i was because if kittredge were ever to entertain the possibility of a gay relationship it was painfully clear to me what he would be if kittredge was gay he sure looked like a top to me its revealing how i have skipped ahead to my junior year abroad in vienna choosing to begin that interlude in my future life by telling you about larry you might think i should have begun that vienna interlude by telling you about my first actual girlfriend esmeralda soler because i met esmeralda shortly after i arrived in vienna in september of and id been living with esmeralda for several months before i became larrys writing studentand not long after that larrys lover but i believe i know why i have waited to tell you about esmeralda its all too common for gay men of my generation to say how much easier it is today to come out as a teenager what i want to tell you is at that age its never easy in my case i had felt ashamed of my sexual longings for other boys and men id fought against those feelings perhaps you think ive overemphasized my attraction to miss frost and mrs hadley in a desperate effort to be normal maybe you have the idea that i was never really attracted to women but i wasi am attracted to women it was just thatat favorite river academy especially no doubt because it was an allboys schooli had to suppress my attraction to other boys and men after that summer in europe with tom when id graduated from favorite river and later when i was on my ownin college in new yorki was finally able to acknowledge the homosexual side of myself yes i will say more about tom its just that tom is so difficult and after tom i had many relationships with men when i was nineteen and twentyi turned twentyone in march of shortly before i learned id been accepted to the institute for european studies in viennai had already come out when i went to vienna id been living in new york city as a young gay guy for two years it wasnt that i was no longer attracted to women i was attracted to them but to give in to my attractions to women struck me as a kind of going back to being the repressed gay boy id been not to mention the fact that at the time my gay friends and lovers all believed that anyone calling himself a bisexual man was really just a gay guy with one foot in the closet i supposewhen i was nineteen and twenty and had only recently turned twentyonethere was a part of me that believed this too yet i knew i was bisexualas surely as id known i was attracted to kittredge and exactly how i was attracted to him but in my late teens and early twenties i was holding back on my attractions to womenas id once repressed my desires for other boys and men even at such a young age i must have sensed that bisexual men were not trusted perhaps we never will be but we certainly werent trusted then i was never ashamed of being attracted to women but once id had gay loversand in new york i had an everincreasing number of gay friendsi quickly learned that being attracted to women made me distrusted and suspected or even feared by other gay guys so i held back or i was quiet about it i just looked at a lot of women that summer of in europewhen i was traveling with tompoor tom had caught me looking we were a small group i mean the american students whod been accepted to the institut für europäische studien in vienna for the academic year of we boarded one of the cruise ships in new york harbor and made the transatlantic crossingas tom and i had done two summers before i quickly concluded that there were no gay boys among the institutes students that year or none whod come outor no one who interested me in that way we traveled by bus across western europe to viennavastly more educational sightseeing in a hasty two weeks than tom and i had managed in an entire summer i had no history with my fellow junioryearabroad students i made some friendsstraight boys and girls or so they seemed to me i thought about a few of the girls but even before we arrived in vienna i decided it was an awfully small group it really wouldnt have been smart to sleep with one of the institute girls besides i had already initiated the fiction that i was trying to be faithful to a girlfriend back in the states id established to my fellow institut students that i was a straight guy apparently inclined to keep to myself when i landed that job as the only englishspeaking waiter at zufall on the weihburggasse my aloofness from the institute for european studies was completeit was too expensive a restaurant for my fellow students to ever eat there except for attending my classes on the doktorkarlluegerplatz i could continue to act out the adventure of being a young writer in a foreign countrynamely that most necessary exercise of finding the time to be alone it was an accident that i ever met esmeralda id noticed her at the opera this was both because of her size tall broadshouldered girls and women attracted me and because she took notes she stood at the rear of the staatsoper scribbling furiously the first night i saw esmeralda i mistook her for a critic though she was only three years older than i was esmeralda was twentyfour in the fall of she looked older than that when i continued to see hershe was always standing in the reari realized that if she were a critic she would at least have had a seat but she stood in the back like me and the other students in those days if you were a student you were welcome to stand in the back for students standing room at the opera was free the staatsoper dominated the intersection of the kärntnerstrasse and the opernring the opera house was less than a tenminute walk from zufall when there was a show at the staatsoper zufall had two dinner seatings we served an early supper before the opera and we served a later more extravagant dinner afterward when i worked both seatings which was the case most nights i got to the opera after the first act had begun and i left before the final act was finished one night during an intermission esmeralda spoke to me i must have looked like an american which deeply disappointed me because she spoke to me in english what is it with you esmeralda asked me youre always late and you always leave early she was clearly american as it turned out she was from ohio i have a jobim a waiter i told her what is it with you how come youre always taking notes are you trying to be a writer im trying to be one i admitted im just an understudyim trying to be a soprano esmeralda said youre trying to be a writer she repeated slowly i was immediately drawn to her one night when i wasnt working the late shift at zufall i stayed at the opera till the final curtain and i proposed that i walk esmeralda home but i dont want to go homei dont like where i live i dont spend much time there esmeralda said oh i didnt like where i lived in vienna eitheri also didnt spend much time there but i worked at that restaurant on the weihburggasse most nights i wasnt as yet very knowledgeable about where to go in vienna at night i brought esmeralda to that gay coffeehouse on the dorotheergasse it was near the staatsoper and id been there only in the daytime when there were mostly students hanging outgirls included i hadnt learned that the nighttime clientele at the kaffee käfig was allmale allgay it took esmeralda and me little time to recognize my mistake its not like this during the day i told her as we were leaving thank god larry wasnt there that night because id already approached him about teaching a writing course at the institute larry had not yet told me his decision esmeralda was laughing about me taking her to the kaffee käfigfor our first date she exclaimed as we walked up the graben to the kohlmarkt there was a coffeehouse on the kohlmarkt id not been there but it looked expensive theres a place i know in my neighborhood esmeralda said we could go there and then you could walk me home to our mutual surprise we lived in the same neighborhoodacross the ringstrasse away from the first district in the vicinity of the karlskirche at the corner of the argentinierstrasse and the schwindgasse there was a cafébarlike so many in vienna it was a coffeehouse and a bar it was my neighborhood place too i was telling esmeralda as we sat down i often wrote there thus we began to describe our lessthanhappy living situations it turned out that we both lived on the schwindgasse in the same building esmeralda had more of an actual apartment than i did she had a bedroom her own bathroom and a tiny kitchen but she shared a front hall with her landlady almost every night when esmeralda came home she had to pass her landladys living room where the old and disapproving woman was ensconced on her couch with her small disagreeable dog they were always watching television the drone from the tv could be constantly heard from esmeraldas bedroom where she listened to operas usually in german on an old phonograph shed been instructed to play her music softly though softly wasnt suitable for opera the opera was sufficiently loud to mask the sound from the landladys television and esmeralda listened and listened to the german singing to herselfalso softly she needed to improve her german accent shed told me because i needed to improve my german grammar and word ordernot to mention my vocabularyi instantly foresaw how esmeralda and i could help each other my accent was the only aspect of my german that was better than esmeraldas the waitstaff at zufall had tried to prepare me when the fall was overwhen the winter came and the tourists were gonethere would be nights when thered be no englishspeaking customers in the restaurant i had better improve my german before the winter months they had warned me the austrians werent kind to foreigners in vienna ausländer foreigner was never said nicely there was something truly xenophobic about the viennese at that cafébar on the argentinierstrasse i began to describe my living situation to esmeraldain german wed already decided that we should speak german to each other esmeralda had a spanish nameesmeralda means emerald in spanishbut she didnt speak spanish her mother was italian and esmeralda spoke and sang italian but if she wanted to be an opera singer she had to improve her german accent she said it was a joke at the staatsoper that she was a soprano understudya soprano inwaiting esmeralda called herself if they ever let her onstage in vienna it would happen only if the regular sopranothe starting soprano esmeralda called herdied or if the opera was in italian even as she told me this in grammatically perfect german i could hear strong shades of cleveland in her accent a music teacher in a cleveland elementary school had discovered that esmeralda could sing shed gone to oberlin on a scholarship esmeraldas junior year abroad had been in milan shed had a student internship at la scala and had fallen in love with italian opera but esmeralda said that german felt like chips of wood in her mouth her father had run out on her and her mother hed gone to argentina where he met another woman esmeralda had concluded that the woman her father hooked up with in argentina must have had nazi ancestors what else could explain why i cant handle the accent esmeralda asked me ive studied the shit out of german i still think about the bonds that drew esmeralda and me together we each had absconding fathers we lived in the same building on the schwindgasse and we were talking about all this in a cafébar on the argentinierstrassein our flawed german unglaublich unbelievable the institute students were housed all over vienna it was common to have your own bedroom but to share a bathroom a remarkable number of our students had widows for landladies and no kitchen privileges i had a widow for a landlady and my own bedroom and i shared a bathroom with the widows divorced daughter and the divorcées fiveyearold son siegfried the kitchen was in constant chaotic use but i was permitted to make coffee for myself there and i kept some beer in the fridge my widowed landlady wept regularly day and night she shuffled around in an unraveling terrycloth bathrobe the divorcée was a bigbreasted takecharge sort of woman it wasnt her fault that she reminded me of my bossy aunt muriel the fiveyearold siegfried had a sly demonic way of staring at me he ate a softboiled egg for breakfast every morningincluding the eggshell the first time i saw siegfried do this i went immediately to my bedroom and consulted my englishgerman dictionary i didnt know the german for eggshell when i told siegfrieds mother that her fiveyearold had eaten the shell she shrugged and said it was probably better for him than the egg in the mornings when i made my coffee and watched little siegfried eat his softboiled egg shell and all the divorcée was usually dressed in a slovenly manner in a loosefitting pair of mens pajamasconceivably belonging to her exhusband there were always too many unbuttoned buttons and siegfrieds mother had a deplorable habit of scratching herself what was funny about the bathroom we shared was that the door had a peephole which is common on hotelroom doors but not on bathroom doors i speculated that the peephole had been installed in the bathroom door so that someone leaving the bathroomperhaps halfnaked or wrapped in a towelcould see if the coast was clear in the hall if someone was out there in other words but why who would want or need to walk around naked in the hall even if the coast was clear this mystery was aggravated by the curious fact that the peephole cylinder on the bathroom door could be reversed i discovered that the cylinder was often reversed the reversal became commonplaceyou could peek into the bathroom from the hall and plainly see who was there and what he or she was doing try explaining that to someone in german and youll see how good or bad your german is but all of this i somehow managed to tell esmeraldain germanon our first date holy cow esmeralda said at one point in english her skin had a milkycoffee color and there was the faintest softest trace of a mustache on her upper lip she had jetblack hair and her darkbrown eyes were almost black her hands were bigger than mineshe was a little taller than i was toobut her breasts to my relief were normal which to me meant noticeably smaller than the rest of her okayill say it if i had hesitated to have my first actual girlfriend experience a part of the reason was that id discovered i liked anal intercourse i liked it a lot no doubt there was a part of me that feared what vaginal intercourse might be like that summer in europe with tomwhen poor tom became so insecure and felt so threatened when all i really did was just look at girls and womeni remember saying with no small amount of exasperation for christs sake tomhavent you noticed how much i like anal sex what do you think i imagine making love to a vagina would be like maybe like having sex with a ballroom naturally it had been the vagina word that sent poor tom to the bathroomwhere i could hear him gagging but although id only been kidding it was the ballroom word that had stuck with me i couldnt get it out of my mind what if having vaginal sex was like making love to a ballroom yet i continued to be attracted to largerthanaverage women our lessthanideal living situations were not the only obstacles that stood between esmeralda and me we had cautiously visited each other in our respective rooms i can deal with the reversepeepholebathroomdoor thing esmeralda had told me but that kid gives me the creeps she called siegfried the eggshelleater as my relationship with esmeralda developed though it would turn out that it wasnt siegfried per se who creeped out esmeralda far more disturbing to esmeralda than that reversepeepholebathroomdoor thing was the bigger thing she had about kids she was terrified of having one like many young women at that time esmeralda was preternaturally afraid of getting pregnantfor good reasons if esmeralda got pregnant that would be the end to her career hopes of becoming an opera singer im not ready to be a housewife soprano was how she put it to me we both knew there were countries in europe where it was possible to get an abortion not austria a catholic country but for the most part abortion was unavailableor unsafe and illegal we knew that too besides esmeraldas italian mother was very catholic esmeralda would have had misgivings about getting an abortion even if the procedure had been available and safe and legal there isnt a condom made that can keep me from getting knocked up esmeralda told me i am fertile times ten how do you know that id asked her i feel fertile all the timei just know it she said oh we were sitting chastely on her bed the pregnancy terror struck me as an insurmountable obstacle the decision in regard to which bedroom we might try to do it in had been made for us if we were going to live together we would share esmeraldas small apartment my weeping widow had complained to the institute id been accused of reversing the peephole thing on the bathroom door das institut accepted my claim that i was innocent of this deviant behavior but i had to move out ill bet it was the eggshelleater esmeralda had said i didnt argue with her but little siegfried would have had to stand on a stool or a chair just to reach the stupid peephole my bet was on the divorcée with the unbuttoned buttons esmeraldas landlady was happy to have the extra rent money shed probably never imagined that esmeraldas apartment which had such a tiny kitchen could be shared by two people but esmeralda and i never cookedwe always ate out esmeralda said that her landladys disposition had improved since id moved in if the old woman frowned upon esmeralda having a livein boyfriend the extra rent money seemed to soften her disfavor even the disagreeable dog had accepted me that same night when esmeralda and i sat not touching on her bed the old lady had invited us into her living room shed wanted us to see that she and her dog were watching an american movie on the television both esmeralda and i were still in culture shock its not easy to recover from hearing gary cooper speak german how could they have dubbed high noon i kept saying the drone from the tv wafted over us in esmeraldas bedroom tex ritter was singing do not forsake me at least they didnt dub tex ritter esmeralda was saying when ivery tentativelytouched her perfect breasts heres the thing billy she said letting me touch her i could tell shed said this before in the past i would learn this speech had been a boyfriendstopper not this time id not noticed the condom until she handed it to meit was still in its shiny foil wrapper you have to wear this billyeven if the damn thing breaks its cleaner okay i said taking the condom but the thing isthis is the hard part billyyou can only do anal thats the only intercourse i allowanal she repeated this time in a shameful whisper i know its a compromise for you but thats just how it is its anal or nothing esmeralda told me oh i understand if thats not for you billy she said i shouldnt say too much i was thinking what she proposed was hardly a compromise for mei loved anal intercourse as for anal or nothing being a boyfriendstopperon the contrary i was relieved the dreaded ballroom experience was once more postponed i knew i had to be carefulnot to appear too enthusiastic it wasnt completely a lie when i said im a little nervousits my first time okay so i didnt add with a womanokay okay esmeralda turned on her phonograph she put on that famous recording of donizettis lucia di lammermoorwith joan sutherland as the crazed soprano i then understood that this was not a night when esmeralda was focusing on improving her german accent donizetti was certainly more romantic background music than tex ritter thus i excitedly embarked on my first girlfriend experiencethe compromise which was no compromise for me being that the sex was anal or nothing the ornothing part wasnt strictly true we would have lots of oral sex i wasnt afraid of oral sex and esmeralda loved itit made her sing she said thus i was introduced to a vagina with one restriction only the ballroom or notaballroom part was withheldand for that part i was content even happy to wait for someone who had long viewed that part with trepidation i was introduced to a vagina in ways i found most intriguing and appealing i truly loved having sex with esmeralda and i loved her too there were those aprèssex moments when in a halfsleep or forgetting that i was with a woman i would reach out and touch her vaginaonly to suddenly pull back my hand as if surprised i had been reaching for esmeraldas penis poor billy esmeralda would say misunderstanding my fleeting touch she was thinking that i wanted to be inside her vagina that i was feeling a pang for all that was denied me im not poor billyim happy billy im fully satisfied billy i always told her youre a very good sport esmeralda would say she had no idea how happy i was and when i reached out and touched her vaginain my sleep sometimes or otherwise unconsciouslyesmeralda had no clue what i was reaching for which was what she didnt have and what i must have been missing der oberkellner the headwaiter at zufall was a sternlooking young man who seemed older than he was hed lost an eye and wore an eye patch he was not yet thirty but either the eye patch or how hed lost the eye gave him the gravity of a much older man his name was karl and he never talked about losing the eyethe other waiters had told me the story at the end of world war ii when karl was ten hed seen some russian soldiers raping his mother and had tried to intervene one of the russians had hit the boy with his rifle and the blow cost karl his sight in one eye late that fall of my junior year abroadit was nearing the end of novemberesmeralda was given her first chance to be the lead soprano on the tripartite stage of the staatsoper as shed predicted it was an italian operaverdis macbethand esmeralda whod been patiently waiting her turn actually shed been thinking that her turn would never come had been the soprano understudy for lady macbeth for most of that fall in fact for as long as wed been living together vieni taffretta id heard esmeralda sing in her sleepwhen lady macbeth reads the letter from her husband telling her about his first meeting with the witches i asked karl for permission to leave the restaurants first seating early and to get to the aprèsopera seating late my girlfriend was going to be lady macbeth on friday night you have a girlfriendthe understudy really is your girlfriend correct karl asked me yes thats correct karl i told him im glad to hear it billtheres been talk to the contrary karl said his one eye transfixing me esmeralda is my girlfriend and shes singing the part of lady macbeth this friday i told the headwaiter thats a oneandonly chance billdont let her blow it karl said i just dont want to miss the beginningand i want to stay till the end karl i said of course of course i know its a friday but were not that busy the warm weather is gone like the leaves the tourists are dropping off this might be the last weekend we really need an englishspeaking waiter but we can manage without you bill karl told me he had a way of making me feel bad even when he was on my side karl made me think of lady macbeth calling on the ministers of hell or tutti sorgete id heard esmeralda sing that in her sleep too it was chilling and of no help to my german fatal mia donna lady macbeth says to her weakling husband she takes the dagger macbeth has used to kill duncan and smears the sleeping guards with blood i couldnt wait to see esmeralda pussywhipping macbeth and all this happens in act no wonder i didnt want to arrive latei didnt want to miss a minute of the witches im very proud of you bill i mean for having a girlfriendnot just that big soprano of a girlfriend but any girlfriend that should silence the talk karl told me whos talking karl i asked him some of the other waiters one of the souschefsyou know how people talk bill oh in truth if anyone in the kitchen at zufall needed proof that i wasnt gay it was probably karl if thered been talk that i was gay im sure karl was the one doing the talking id kept an eye on esmeralda when she was sleeping if lady macbeth made a nightly appearance as a sleepwalker in act lamenting that there was still blood on her handsesmeralda never sleepwalked she was sound asleep and lying down when she sang almost every night una macchia the lead soprano who was taking friday night off had a singers polyp in the area of her vocal cords while this was not uncommon for opera singers much attention had been paid to gerda mühles tiny polyp should the polyp be surgically removed or not esmeralda worshipped gerda mühle her voice was resonant yet never forced through an impressive range gerda mühle could be vibrant but effortless from a low g to dizzying flights above high c her soprano voice was large and heavy enough for wagner yet mühle could also manage the requisite agility for the swift runs and complicated trills of the earlynineteenthcentury italian style but esmeralda had told me that gerda mühle was a pain in the ass about her polyp its taken over her lifeits taking over all our lives esmeralda said shed gone from worshipping gerda mühle the soprano to hating gerda mühle the womanthe polyp esmeralda now called her on friday night the polyp was resting her vocal cords esmeralda was excited to be getting what she called her first start at the staatsoper but esmeralda was dismissive of gerda mühles polyp back in cleveland esmeralda had endured a sinus surgerya risky one for a wouldbe singer as a teenager esmeraldas nasal passages were chronically clogged she sometimes wondered if that sinus surgery was responsible for the persistent american accent in her german esmeralda had zero sympathy for gerda mühle making such a big deal out of her singers polyp id learned to ignore the jokes among the kitchen crew and the waitstaff about what it was like to have a soprano for a girlfriend everyone teased me about this except karlhe didnt kid around it must be loud at times the chef at zufall had said to general laughter in the kitchen i didnt tell them of course that esmeralda had orgasms only when i went down on her by her own account esmeraldas orgasms were pretty spectacular but i was shielded from the sound esmeraldas thighs were clamped against my ears i truly heard nothing god i think i just hit a high eflatand i really held it esmeralda said after one of her more prolonged orgasms but my ears were warm and sweaty and my head had been held so tightly between her thighs that i hadnt heard anything i dont remember what the weather was like in vienna on this particular november friday i just remember that when esmeralda left our little apartment on the schwindgasse she was wearing her jfk campaign button it was her goodluck charm shed told me she was very proud of volunteering for kennedys election campaign in ohio in esmeralda had been hugely pissed off when ohio by a narrow margin went republican ohio had voted for nixon i wasnt as political as esmeralda in i believed i was too intent on becoming a writer to have a political life id said something terribly loftysounding to esmeralda about that i told her that i wasnt hedging my bets about becoming a writeri said that political involvement was a way that young people left the door open to failing in their artistic endeavors or some such bullshit do you mean billy that because im more politically involved than you i dont care about making it as a soprano as much as you care about being a writer esmeralda asked me of course i dont mean that i answered what i should have told her but i didnt dare was that i was bisexual it wasnt my writing that kept me from being politically involved it was that in my dual sexuality was all the politics i could handle believe me when youre twentyone theres a lot of politics involved in being sexually mutable that said on this november friday i would soon regret id ever given esmeralda the idea that i thought she was hedging her bets about becoming a sopranoor leaving the door open to failing as an opera singerbecause she was such a political person for the first seating at zufall there were more americans among the clientele than either karl or i had expected there were no other foreign touristsno englishspeaking ones anywaybut there were several american couples past retirement age and a table of ten obstetricians and gynecologists all of them americans who told me they were in vienna for an obgyn conference i got a generous tip from the doctors because i told them theyd picked a good opera for obstetricians and gynecologists i explained that part in macbeth act when the witches conjure up a bloody childthe child famously tells macbeth that none of woman born can harm him of course macbeth is screwed macduff who kills macbeth announces that he had a caesarean birth its possibly the only opera with a csection theme i told the obgyn table of ten karl was telling everyone that my girlfriend was the soprano singing the lady macbeth part tonight so i was pretty popular with the earlyseating crowd and karl made good on his promise to let me leave the restaurant in plenty of time for the start of act but something was wrong i had the weird impression that the audience wouldnt settle downespecially the uncouth americans one couple seemed on the verge of a divorce she was sobbing and nothing her husband had to say could soothe her im guessing that many of you know which friday night this wasit was november it was pm central standard time when president kennedy was shot in dallas i was seven hours ahead of texas time in vienna and macbethto my surprisedidnt start on time esmeralda had told me that the staatsoper always started on time but not this night i couldnt have known but things were as unsettled backstage as they appeared to me in the audience the american couple id identified as headed for a divorce had already left both of them were inconsolable now there were other americans who seemed in distress i suddenly noticed the empty seats poor esmeralda it was her debut but it wasnt a full house it would have been pm in dallas when jfk died pm in vienna when the curtain simply would not open on that barren heath in scotland i began to worry about esmeralda was she suffering from stage fright had she lost her voice had gerda mühle changed her mind about taking a night off the program had an insert page announcing that esmeralda soler was lady macbeth on friday november id already decided that i would have this page framed i was going to give it to esmeralda for christmas that year more irritating americans were talking in the audiencemore were leaving too some in tears i decided that americans were culturally deprived socially inept imbeciles or they were all philistines finally the curtain went up and there were the witches when macbeth and banquo appearedthe latter i knew would soon be a ghosti thought that this macbeth was far too old and fat to be esmeraldas husband even in an opera you can imagine my surprise in the very next scene in act when it was not my esmeralda singing vieni taffretta nor was it esmeralda calling on the ministers of hell to assist her or tutti sorgete there onstage was gerda mühle and her polyp i could only imagine how shocked the englishspeaking clientele at our early seating at zufall must have beenthose ten obstetricians and gynecologists included they must have been thinking how is it possible that this matronlylooking load of a soprano is the girlfriend of our young goodlooking waiter when lady macbeth smeared the sleeping guards with the bloody dagger i imagined that esmeralda had been murdered backstageor that something no less dire had happened to her it seemed that half the audience was crying by the end of act was it the news of banquos assassination that moved them to tears or was it banquos ghost at the dinner table about the time macbeth saw banquos ghost that second time near the end of act i might have been the only person at the vienna state opera who didnt know that president kennedy had been assassinated it wasnt until the intermission that i would learn what had happened after the intermission i stayed to see the witches againand that terrifying bloody child who tells macbeth that none of woman born can harm him i stayed until the middle of act because i wanted to see the sleepwalking scenegerda mühle and her polyp singing una macchia about the blood that still taints lady macbeths hands maybe id imagined that esmeralda would emerge from backstage and join me and the other students faithfully standing at the rear of the staatsoper butby act there were so many vacated seats that most of my fellow students had found places to sit down i did not know that there was a soundless tv set backstage and that esmeralda was glued to it she would tell me later that you didnt need the sound to understand what had happened to jfk i did not wait till the end of act the final act i didnt need to see birnam wood remove to dunsinane as shakespeare puts it or hear macduff tell macbeth about the caesarean birth i ran along the crowded kärntnerstrasse to weihburggasse passing people with tears streaming down their facesmost of them not americans in the kitchen at zufall the crew and the waitstaff were all watching television we had a small blackandwhite tv set i saw the same soundless accounts of the shooting in dallas that esmeralda must have seen youre early not late karl observed did your girlfriend blow it it wasnt herit was gerda mühle i told him blöde kuh karl cried stupid cow the viennese operagoers who were fed up with gerda mühle had called her a stupid cow long before esmeralda started calling her the polyp esmeralda must have been too upset to performshe must have lost it backstage i said to karl she was a kennedy fan so she did blow it karl said i dont envy you living with the outcome there was already a scattering of englishspeaking customers karl warned menot operagoers evidently more obstetricians and gynecologists karl observed disdainfully he thought there were too many babies in the world overpopulation is the numberone problem karl kept saying and theres a table of queers karl told me they just got here but theyre already drunk definitely fruits isnt that what you call them thats one of the things we call them i told our oneeyed headwaiter it wasnt hard to spot the obgyn table there were twelve of themeight men four women all doctors since president kennedy had just been killed i didnt think it would be a good idea for me to break the ice by telling them that theyd all missed the csection scene in macbeth as for the table of queersor fruits as karl had called themthere were four men all drunk one of them was the wellknown american poet who was teaching at the institute lawrence upton i didnt know you worked here young fiction writer larry said its bill isnt it thats right i told him jesus billyou look awful is it kennedy or has something else happened larry asked me i saw macbeth tonight i started to say oh i heard it was the soprano understudys nighti skipped it larry interrupted me yes it wasit was supposed to be the understudys night i told him but shes americanshe must have been too upset about kennedy she didnt go onit was gerda mühle as usual gerdas great larry said it must have been wonderful not for me i told him the soprano understudy is my girlfriendi was hoping to see her as lady macbeth ive been listening to her sing in her sleep i told the table of drunken queers her name is esmeralda soler i told the fruits one day maybe youll all know who she is you have a girlfriend larry saidwith the same sly disbelief he would later express when i claimed to be a top esmeralda soler i repeated she must have been too upset to sing poor girl larry said i dont suppose there is a plethora of opportunities for understudies i suppose not i said im still thinking about your writingcourse idea larry told me i havent ruled it out bill karl had said he didnt envy me living with the outcome of esmeralda not singing the part of lady macbeth butlooking at lawrence upton and his queer friendsi suddenly foresaw another notsopretty outcome of my living with esmeralda there werent many englishspeaking operagoers who came to zufall after that fridaynight performance of verdis macbeth im guessing that jfks assassination kind of kicked the latenightdinner urge out of most of my fellow americans who were in vienna that november the obgyn table was morose they left early only larry and the fruits stayed late karl urged me to go home go find your girlfriendshe cant be doing too good the oneeyed headwaiter told me but i knew that either esmeralda was with her opera people or shed already gone back to our little apartment on the schwindgasse esmeralda knew where i worked if she wanted to see me she knew where to find me the fruits are never leavingtheyve decided to die here karl kept saying you seem to know the handsome onethe talker karl added i explained who lawrence upton was and that he taught at the institute but he was not my teacher go home to your girlfriend bill karl kept saying but i shuddered to think of watching the alreadyrepetitious reports of jfks assassination on that television in the living room of esmeraldas landladys apartment visions of the disagreeable dog kept me at zufall where i could keep an eye on the small blackandwhite tv in the restaurants kitchen its the death of american culture larry was saying to the three other fruits not that there is a culture for books in the united states but kennedy offered us some hope of having a culture for writers witness frostthat inaugural poem it wasnt bad kennedy at least had taste how long will it be before we have another president who even has taste i know i knowthis is not the most appealing way to present larry but what was wonderful about the man was that he spoke the truth without taking into account the context of other peoples feelings at that moment someone overhearing larry might have been awash in sentiments for our slain presidentor feeling shipwrecked on a foreign shore battered by surging waves of patriotism larry didnt care if he believed it was true he said it this boldness didnt make larry unappealing to me but it was somewhere in the middle of larrys speech when esmeralda got to the restaurant she could never eat before she sang shed told me so i knew she hadnt eaten and shed already had some white winenot a good idea on an empty stomach esmeralda first sat at the bar crying karl had quickly ushered her into the kitchen where she sat on a stool in front of the small tv karl gave her a glass of white wine before he told me she was in the kitchen id not seen esmeralda at the bar because i was opening yet another bottle of red wine for larrys table its your girlfriend billyou should take her home karl told me shes in the kitchen larrys german wasnt bad hed understood what karl had said is it your soprano understudy bill larry asked me let her sit with uswell cheer her up he told me i rather doubted it i was pretty sure that a deathofamericanculture conversation wouldnt have cheered up esmeralda but that was how it happenedhow larry got a look at esmeralda as we were making our exit from the restaurant leave the fruits with me karl said ill split the tip with you take the girl home bill i think ill throw up if i keep watching television esmeralda told me in the kitchen she looked a little wobbly on the stool i knew she would probably throw up anywaybecause of the white wine we would have an awkwardlooking walk all the way across the ringstrasse to the schwindgasse but i hoped the walk would be good for her an unusually pretty lady macbeth i heard larry say as i was steering esmeralda out of the restaurant im still thinking about that writing course young fiction writer larry called to me as esmeralda and i were leaving i think im going to throw up eventually esmeralda was saying it was late when we got back to the schwindgasse esmeralda had thrown up when we were crossing the karlsplatz but she said she was feeling better when we got to the apartment the landlady and her disagreeable dog had gone to bed the living room was dark the television was offor they were all as dead as jfk the tv included not verdi esmeralda said when she saw me standing undecided at the phonograph i put on joan sutherland in what everyone said was her signature role i knew how much esmeralda loved lucia di lammermoor which i put on softly its your big night billymine too ive never had vaginal sex either it doesnt matter if i get pregnant when an understudy clutches thats itits over esmeralda said shed brushed her teeth and washed her face but she was still a little drunk i think dont be crazy i told her it does matter if you get pregnant youll have lots more opportunities esmeralda lookdo you want to try it in my vagina or dont you esmeralda asked me i want to try it in my vagina billyim asking you for christs sake i want to know what its like in my vagina oh of course i used a condom i would have put on two of the things if shed told me she was definitely still a little drunkno question thats how it happened on the night our president died i had vaginal sex for the first timei really really liked it i think it was during lucias mad scene when esmeralda had her very loud orgasm to be honest with you ill never know if it was joan sutherland hitting that high eflat or if it was esmeralda my ears werent protected by her thighs this time i still managed to hear the landladys dog bark but my ears were ringing holy shit i heard esmeralda say that was amazing i was amazed and relieved myself id not only really really liked iti had loved it was it as good as or better than anal sex well it was different to be diplomatic i always saywhen askedthat i love anal and vaginal sex equally my earlier worries about vaginas had been unfounded but alas i was a little slow in responding to esmeraldas holy shit and her that was amazing i was thinking how much id loved it but i didnt say it billy esmeralda asked how was it for you did you like it you know its not only writers who have this problem but writers really really have this problem for us a socalled train of thought though unspoken is unstoppable i said definitely not a ballroom on top of what a day poor esmeralda had had that was what i told her not a what she said oh its just a vermont expression i quickly said its meaningless really im not even sure what not a ballroom meansit doesnt translate very well why would you say something negative esmeralda asked me not an anything is negativenot a ballroom sounds like a big disappointment billy no noim not disappointed i loved your vagina i cried the disagreeable dog barked again lucia was repeating herselfshe had gone back to the beginning when she was still the trusting but easily unhinged young bride im not a ballroomlike im just a gym or a kitchen or something esmeralda was saying then her tears cametears for kennedy for her one chance to be a starting soprano for her unappreciated vaginalots of tears you cant take back something like definitely not a ballroom its simply not what you should ever say after your first vaginal sex of course i also couldnt take back what id said to esmeralda about her politicsabout her lack of commitment to becoming a soprano we would live together through that christmas and the first of the new year but the damagethe distrusthad begun one night i must have said something in my sleep in the morning esmeralda asked me that rather goodlooking older man in zufallyou know that terrible night what did he mean about the writing course why did he call you young fiction writer billy does he know you do you know him ah wellthere was no easy answer to that then another nightthat january of after i got off worki crossed the kärntnerstrasse and turned down dorotheergasse to the kaffee käfig i knew perfectly well what the clientele was like late at night it was allmale allgay well if it isnt the fiction writer larry might have said or maybe he just asked its bill isnt it this would have been the night he told me that hed decided to teach that writing course i had asked him about but before my first couple of classes with him as my teacher that night in the kaffee käfignot all that long before he hit on melarry might have asked no soprano understudy tonight where is that pretty pretty girl not your average lady macbeth billis she no shes not average i might have mumbled we just talked nothing happened that night in fact later that same night i was in bed with esmeralda when she asked me something significant your german accentits so perfectly austrian it just kills me your german isnt that great but you speak it so authentically where does your german come from billyi cant believe ive never asked you we had just made love okay it hadnt been that spectacularthe landladys dog didnt bark and my ears werent echoingbut wed had vaginal sex and we both loved it no more anal for us billyim over it esmeralda had said naturally i knew that i wasnt over anal sex i also understood that i not only loved esmeraldas vagina id already accepted the enslaving idea that i would never get over vaginas either of course it wasnt only esmeraldas vagina that had enslaved me it wasnt her fault that she didnt have a penis i blame the where does your german come from question that started me thinking about where our desires come from that is a dark winding road and that was the night i knew i would be leaving esmeralda chapter the pictures i kept of elaine i was in german iii my junior year at favorite river academy that winter after old grau died fräulein bauers section of german iii acquired some of dr graus studentskittredge among them they were an illprepared group herr doktor grau was a confusing teacher it was a graduation requirement at favorite river that you had to take three years of the same language if kittredge was taking german iii as a senior this meant that he had flunked german in a previous year or that hed started out studying another foreign language and for some unknown reason had switched to german isnt your mom french i asked him i assumed hed spoken french at home i got tired of doing what my alleged mother wanted kittredge said hasnt that happened to you yet nymph because kittredge was so witheringly smart i was surprised he was such a weak german student i was less surprised to discover he was lazy he was one of those people things came easily to but he did little to demonstrate that he deserved to be gifted foreign languages demand a willingness to memorize and a tolerance for repetition that kittredge could learn his lines for a play showed he had the capacity for this kind of selfpolishingonstage he was a poised performer but he lacked the necessary discipline for studying a foreign languagegerman especially the articlesthe frigging der die das den dem shit as kittredge angrily statedwere beyond his patience that year when kittredge should have graduated i didnt help his final grade by agreeing to assist him with his homework that kittredge virtually copied my translations of our daily assignments would be of no help to him in the inclass exams which he had to write by himself i most certainly didnt want kittredge to fail german iii i foresaw the repercussions of him repeating his senior year when i would also be a senior but it was hard to say no to him when he asked for help its hard to say no to him period elaine would later say i blame myself that i didnt know they were involved that winter term there were auditions for what richard abbott called the spring shakespeareto distinguish it from the shakespeare play he had directed in the fall term at favorite river richard sometimes made us boys do shakespeare in the winter term too i hate to say this but i believe that kittredges participation in the drama club was responsible for a surge in the popularity of our school playsnotwithstanding all the shakespeare there was more than usual interest when richard read aloud the cast list for twelfth night at morning meeting the list was later posted in the academy dining hall where students actually stood in line for their opportunity to stare at the dramatis personae orsino duke of illyria was our teacher and director richard abbott richard as the duke begins twelfth night with those familiar and rhapsodic lines if music be the food of love play on not ever needing any prompting from my mother on that subject orsino first professes his love for olivia a countess played by my complaining aunt muriel olivia rejects the duke who wasting no time quickly falls in love with viola thus making orsino an overproclaiming figuremaybe more in love with love than with either lady as richard abbott put it i always thought that because olivia turns down orsino as her lover muriel must have felt comfortable in accepting the role of the countess richard was still a little too much leadingman material for muriel she never entirely relaxed in her handsome brotherinlaws company elaine was cast as viola later disguised as cesario elaines immediate response was that richard had anticipated violas necessary crossdressing of herself as cesarioviola has to be flatchested because for much of the play shes a guy was how elaine put it to me i actually found it a little creepy that orsino and viola end up in lovegiven that richard was noticeably older than elainebut elaine didnt seem to care i think girls got married younger back then was all she said about it with half a brain i might have realized that elaine already had a reallife lover who was older than she was i was cast as sebastianviolas twin brother thats perfect for you two kittredge said condescendingly to elaine and me youve already got a brothersister thing going as anyone can see at the time i didnt pick up on that elaine must have told kittredge that she and i werent interested in each other in that way ill admit i was distracted that muriel as olivia is first smitten with elaine disguised as cesario and later falls for me sebastianwell that was a test of the previously mentioned disbelief business for my part i found it impossible to imagine falling in love with murielhence i stared fixedly at my aunts operatic bosom not once did this sebastian look in that olivias eyesnot even when sebastian exclaims if it be thus to dream still let me sleep or when olivia whose bossiness was right up muriels alley demands to know would thoudst be ruld by me i as sebastian staring straight ahead at my aunt muriels breasts which were laughably at eye level to me answer her in a lovestruck fashion madam i will well you best remember bill grandpa harry said to me twelfth night is sureasshit a comedy when i grew just a little taller and a little older muriel would object to my staring at her breasts but that later play wasnt a comedy and it only now occurs to me that when we were cast as olivia and sebastian in twelfth night muriel probably couldnt see that i was staring at her breasts because her breasts were in the way given my height at the time muriels breasts blocked her line of vision aunt muriels husband my dear uncle bob well understood the comic factor in twelfth night that bobs drinking was such a burden for muriel to bear seemed a subject of mockery when richard cast uncle bob as sir toby belch olivias kinsman andin his most memorable moments in the playa misbehaving drunk but bob was as much loved by the favorite river students as he was by meafter all he was the schools overly permissive admissions man bob thought it was no big deal that the students liked him of course they like me billy they met me when i interviewed them and i let them in bob also coached the racquet sports tennis and squashergo the squash balls the squash courts were on the basement level of the gym underground and dank when one of the squash courts stank of beer the boys said that coach bob must have been playing theresweating out the poisons of the night before both aunt muriel and nana victoria complained to grandpa harry that casting bob as sir toby belch encouraged bobs drinking richard abbott would be blamed for making light of the deplorable pain caused to poor muriel whenever bob drank but while muriel and my grandmother would bitch to grandpa harry about richard they would never have breathed a word of discontent to richard himself after all richard abbott had come along in the nick of time to use nana victorias cliché to save my damaged mother they spoke of this rescue as if no one else might have managed the job my mother was seen as no longer nana victorias or aunt muriels responsibility because richard had shown up and taken her off their hands at least this was very much the impression that my aunt and my grandmother gave to merichard could do no wrong or what wrongdoing nana victoria and aunt muriel thought that richard had done would be spelled out for grandpa harry as if he could ever be expected to speak to richard about it my cousin gerry and i overheard it all because when richard and my mother werent around my disapproving grandmother and my meddlesome aunt talked ceaselessly about them i got the feeling they would still be calling them the newlyweds however facetiously after my mom and richard had been married for twenty years as i grew older i was realizing that all of themnot only nana victoria and aunt muriel but also grandpa harry and richard abbotttreated my mother like a temperamental child they pussyfooted around her the way they would have done with a child who was in danger of doing some unwitting damage to herself grandpa harry would never criticize richard abbott harry might have agreed that richard was my moms savior but i think grandpa harry was smart enough to know that richard had chiefly saved my mother from nana victoria and aunt murielmore than from the next man who might have come along and swept my easily seducible mom off her feet however in the case of this illfated production of twelfth night even grandpa harry had his doubts about the casting harry was cast as maria olivias waitinggentlewoman both grandpa harry and i had thought of maria as much younger though harrys chief difficulty with the role was that he was supposed to be married off to sir toby belch i cant believe that im going to be betrothed to my muchyounger soninlaw grandpa harry said sadly when i was having dinner with him and nana victoria one winter sunday night well you best remember grandpa twelfth night is sureasshit a comedy i reminded him a good thing its only onstage i guess harry had said you and your onlyonstage routine nana victoria snapped at him i sometimes think you live to be weird harold tolerance have tolerance vicky grandpa harry intoned winking at me maybe that was why i decided to tell him what i had told mrs hadleyabout my slightly faded crush on richard my deepening attraction to kittredge even my masturbation to the unlikely contrivance of martha hadley as a trainingbra model but not still not my unmentioned love for miss frost youre the sweetest boy billby which i mean of course you have feelins for other people and you take the greatest care not to hurt their feelins this is admirable most admirable grandpa harry said to me but you must be careful not to have your feelins hurt some people are safer to be attracted to than others not other boys you mean i asked him i mean not some other boys yes it takes a special boyto safely speak your heart to some boys would hurt you grandpa harry said kittredge probably i suggested that would be my guess yes harry said he sighed maybe not here billnot in this school not at this time maybe these attractions to other boys or men will have to wait wait till when and where i asked him ah well grandpa harry started to say but he stopped i think that miss frost has been very good at findin books for you to read grandpa harry started again ill bet you that she could recommend somethin for you to readi mean on the subject of bein attracted to other boys or men and regardin when and where it may be possible to act on such attractions mind you i havent read that book bill but i bet there are such stories i know such books exist and maybe miss frost would know about them i almost told him on the spot that miss frost was one of my confusing attractions though something held me back from saying this perhaps that she was the most powerful of all my attractions was what stopped me but how do i begin to tell miss frost i said to grandpa harry i dont know how to starti mean before i get to the business of there being books on the subject or not i believe you can tell miss frost what you told me bill grandpa harry said i have a feelin she would be sympathetic he kissed me on the forehead and gave me a hugthere was both affection and concern for me in my grandfathers expression i saw him suddenly as i had so often seen himonstage where he was almost always a woman it was the way hed used the sympathetic word that had triggered a longago memory it may have been something i completely imagined but if i had to bet it was a memory how old i was i couldnt sayten or eleven at most this was long before richard abbott appeared i was billy dean and my single mom was suitorless but mary marshall dean was already the longestablished prompter for the first sister players and whatever my age and notwithstanding my innocence id been a longaccepted presence backstage i had the run of the placeprovided i kept out of the actors way and i stayed quiet youre not backstage to talk billy i remember my mom saying to me youre here to watch and listen i believe it was one of the english poetswas it audenwho said that before you could write anything you had to notice something admittedly it was lawrence upton who told me this im just guessing it was auden because larry was a fan of audens it doesnt really matter who said itits so obviously true before you can write anything you have to notice something that part of my childhoodwhen i was backstage in the little theater of our towns amateur theatrical societywas the noticing phase of my becoming a writer one of the things i noticed if not the very first thing was that not everyone thought it was wonderful or funny that my grandfather took so many womens roles in the productions of the first sister players i loved being backstage just watching and listening i liked the transitions toofor example that moment when all the actors were offscript and my mother was called upon to start prompting there then came a magical interlude even among amateurs when the actors seemed completely in character regardless of how many rehearsals id attended i remember that quickly passing illusion when the play suddenly seemed real yet there was always something you saw or heard in the dress rehearsal that struck you as entirely new last on opening night there was the excitement of seeing and hearing the play for the first time with an audience i remember that even as a child i was as nervous on opening night as the actors i had a pretty good albeit partial view of the actors from my hiding place backstage i had a better view of the audiencethough i saw only those faces in the first two or three rows of seats depending on where my mother had positioned herself as the prompter this was either a stageright or stageleft view of the people in those first few rows of seats i saw those faces in the audience only slightly more headon than in profile though the people in the audience were looking at the actors onstage they were never looking at me to tell you the truth it was a kind of eavesdroppingi felt as if i were spying on the audience or just this small segment of it the houselights were dark but the faces in the first couple of rows of seats were illuminated by whatever light there was onstage naturally in the course of the play the light on the people in the audience varied though i could almost always see their faces and make out their expressions the feeling that i was spying on these most exposed theatergoers of first sister vermont came from the fact that when youre in the audience in a theater and your attention is captured by the actors onstage you never imagine that someone is watching you but i was observing them in their expressions i saw everything they thought and felt come opening night i knew the play by heart after all id been to most of the rehearsals by then i was much more interested in the audiences reaction than i was in what the actors onstage were doing in every openingnight performanceno matter which woman or what kind of woman grandpa harry was playingi was fascinated to observe the audiences reactions to harry marshall as a female there was the delightful mr poggio our neighborhood grocer he was as bald as grandpa harry but woefully shortsightedhe was always a firstrow customer and even in the first row mr poggio was a squinter the moment grandpa harry came onstage mr poggio was convulsed with suppressed laughter tears rolled down his cheeks and i had to look away from his openmouthed gaptoothed smile or i would have burst out laughing mrs poggio was curiously less appreciative of grandpa harrys female impersonations she frowned when she first saw him and bit her lower lip she also did not seem to enjoy how happy her husband was with grandpa harry as a woman and there was mr riptonralph ripton the sawyer he operated the main blade at grandpa harrys sawmill and lumberyard it was a highly skilled and dangerous position in the mill to be the mainblade operator ralph ripton was missing the thumb and first two joints of his index finger on his left hand id heard the story of the accident many times both grandpa harry and his partner nils borkman liked to tell the bloodspattered tale id always believed that grandpa harry and mr ripton were friendsthey were more than fellow workers surely yet ralph didnt like grandpa harry as a woman mr ripton had an angry condemning expression whenever he saw grandpa harry onstage in a female role mr riptons wifeshe was completely expressionlesssat beside her overcritical husband as if shed been braindamaged by the very idea of harry marshall performing as a woman ralph ripton skillfully managed to pack his pipe with fresh tobacco at the same time he never took his hard eyes from the stage i guessed at first that mr ripton was loading up his pipe for a smoke at the intermissionhe always used the stump of his severed left index finger to tamp the tobacco tightly into the bowl of his pipebut i later noticed that the riptons never returned after the intermission they came to the theater for the devout purpose of hating what they saw and leaving early grandpa harry had told me that ralph ripton had to sit in the first or second row in order to hear the main blade in the sawmill made such a highpitched whine that the saw had deafened him but i could see for myself that there was more wrong with the sawyer than his deafness there were other faces in the collective audiencesmany regular customers in those frontrow seatsand while i didnt know most of their names or their professions i had no difficulty even as a child recognizing their obdurate dislike of grandpa harry as a woman to be fair when harry marshall kissed as a womani mean when he kissed another man onstagemost of the audience laughed or cheered or applauded but i had a knack for finding the unfriendly facesthere were always a few i saw people cringe or angrily look away i saw their eyes narrow with disgust at grandpa harry kissing as a woman harry marshall played all kinds of womenhe was a crazy lady who repeatedly bit her own hands he was a sobbing bride who was ditched at the altar he was a serial killer a hairstylist who poisoned her boyfriends he was a policewoman with a limp my grandfather loved the theater and i loved watching him perform but perhaps there were folks in first sister vermont who had rather limited imaginations they knew harry marshall was a lumbermanthey couldnt accept him as a woman indeed i saw more than obvious displeasure and condemnation in the faces of our townsfolki saw more than derision worse than meanness i saw hatred in a few of those faces one such face i wouldnt know by name until i saw him in my first morning meeting as a favorite river academy student this was dr harlow our schools physicianhe who when he spoke to us boys was usually so hearty and cajoling on dr harlows face was the conviction that harry marshalls love of performing as a woman was an affliction in dr harlows expression was the hardened belief that grandpa harrys crossdressing was treatable thus i feared and hated dr harlow before i knew who he was and even as a backstage child i used to think come on dont you get it this is makebelieve yet those hardeyed faces in the audience werent buying it those faces said you cant makebelieve this you cant makebelieve that as a child i was frightened by what i saw in those faces in the audience from my unseen backstage position i never forgot some of their expressions when i was seventeen and i told my grandfather about my crushes on boys and men and my contradictory attraction to a madeup version of martha hadley as a trainingbra model i was still frightened by what id seen in those faces in the audience at the first sister players i told grandpa harry about watching some of our fellow townspeople who were caught in the act of watching him they didnt care that it was makebelieve i told him they just knew they didnt like it they hated youralph ripton and his wife even mrs poggio no question about dr harlow they hated you pretending to be a woman you know what i say bill grandpa harry asked me i say you can makebelieve what you want there were tears in my eyes then because i was afraid for myselfnot unlike the way as a child i had been afraid backstage for grandpa harry i stole elaine hadleys bra because i wanted to wear it i blurted out ah wellthats a good fellas failin bill i wouldnt worry about that grandpa harry said it was strange what a relief it wasto see that i couldnt shock him harry marshall was only worried about my safety as id once been afraid for his did richard tell you grandpa harry suddenly asked me some morons have banned twelfth nighti mean over the years total imbeciles have actually banned shakespeares twelfth night many times why i asked him thats crazy its a comedy its a romantic comedy what could possibly be the reason for banning it i cried ah welli can only guess why grandpa harry said sebastians twin sister violashe looks a lot like her brother thats the story isnt it thats why people mistake sebastian for violaafter viola has disguised herself as a man and shes goin around callin herself cesario dont you see bill viola is a crossdresser thats what got shakespeare in trouble from everythin you told me i think youve noticed that rigidly conventional or ignorant people have no sense of humor about crossdressers yes ive noticed i said but it was what i had failed to notice that would haunt me all those years when i was backstage when i had the prompters perspective of those frontrow faces in the audience i had neglected to look at the prompter herself i had not once noticed my mothers expression when she saw and heard her father onstage as a woman that winter sunday night when i walked back to bancroft after my little talk with grandpa harry i vowed i would watch my moms face when harry was performing as maria in twelfth night i knew there would be opportunitieswhen sebastian was not onstage but maria waswhen i could spy on my mother backstage and observe her expression i was frightened of what i might see in her pretty face i doubted she would be smiling i had a bad feeling about twelfth night from the start kittredge had talked a bunch of his wrestling teammates into auditioning richard had given four of them what hed called some smaller parts but malvolio isnt a small part the wrestling teams heavyweight a sullen complainer was cast in the role of olivias stewardan arrogant pretender who is tricked into thinking that olivia desires him i must say that madden the heavyweight who thought of himself as a perpetual victim was well cast kittredge had told elaine and me that madden suffered from goinglast syndrome in those days all dual meets in wrestling began with the lightest weightclass heavyweights wrestled last if the meet was close it came down to who won the heavyweight matchmadden usually lost he had the look of someone wronged how perfect that malvolio who is jailed as a lunatic protests his fatei say there was never man thus abused madden as malvolio whines if you want to be in character madden i heard kittredge say to his unfortunate teammate just think to yourself how unfair it is to be a heavyweight but it is unfair to be a heavyweight madden protested youre going to be a great malvolio i know you are kittredge told himas ever condescendingly another wrestlerone of the lightweights who struggled to make weight at every weighinwas cast as sir tobys companion sir andrew aguecheek the boy whose name was delacorte was ghostly thin he was often so dehydrated from losing weight that he had cottonmouth he rinsed his mouth out with water from a paper cuphe spat the water out into another cup dont mix your cups up delacorte kittredge told him two cups id once heard kittredge call him we would not have been surprised to see delacorte faint from hunger one rarely saw him in the dining hall he was constantly running his fingers through his hair to be sure it wasnt falling out loss of hair is a sign of starvation delacorte told us gravely loss of common sense is another sign elaine said to him but this didnt register with delacorte why doesnt delacorte move up a weightclass id asked kittredge because he would get the shit kicked out of him kittredge had said oh two other wrestlers were cast as sea captains one of the captains isnt very importanthes the captain of the wrecked ship the one who befriends viola i cant remember the name of the wrestler who played him the second sea captain is sebastians friend antonio id earlier feared that richard might cast kittredge as antonio who is a brave and swashbuckling type there is something so genuinely affectionate in sebastians friendship with antonio i was anxious how that affection would play outi mean in the case of kittredge being antonio but richard either sensed my anxiety or knew that kittredge would have been wasted as antonio in all likelihood richard from the start had a better part in mind for kittredge the wrestler richard chose for antonio was a goodlooking guy named wheelock whatever was swashbuckling about antonio wheelock could convey wheelock can convey little else kittredge told me about his teammate i was surprised that kittredge seemed to feel superior to his wrestling teammates id heretofore thought it was only the likes of elaine and me he felt superior to i saw that id underestimated kittredge he felt superior to everyone richard cast kittredge as the clown festea very clever clown and a somewhat cruel one like others of shakespeares fools feste is smart and superior its no secret that shakespeares fools are often wiser than the ladies and gentlemen they share the stage with the clown in twelfth night is one of those smart fools in fact in most productions ive seen of twelfth night feste steals the showkittredge certainly did that late winter of kittredge stole more than the show i should have known as i crossed the quadrangle that night following my conversation with grandpa harry that the blue light in elaines fifthfloor bedroom window wasas kittredge had called ita beacon kittredge had been right that lamp with the blue shade was shining for him id once imagined that the blue light in elaines bedroom window was the last light old grau sawif only dimly as he lay freezing a farfetched idea perhaps dr grau had hit his head hed passed out in the snow old grau probably saw no lights at all not even dimly but what had kittredge seen in that blue lightwhat about that beacon had encouraged him i encouraged him billy elaine would tell me later but she didnt tell me at the time i had no idea she was fucking him and all the while my good stepfather richard abbott was bringing me condomsjust to be safe bill richard would say as he bestowed another dozen rubbers on me i had no use for them but i kept them proudly occasionally i masturbated in one of course i should have given a dozen or more condoms to elaine i would have somehow summoned the courage to give them all to kittredge if id known elaine didnt tell me when she knew she was pregnant it was the spring term and twelfth night was only a few weeks away from production wed been offscript for a while and our rehearsals were improving uncle bob as sir toby belch was making us howl every time he said dost thou think because thou art virtuous there shall be no more cakes and ale and kittredge had a strong singing voicehe was quite a good singer that song the clown feste sings to sir toby and sir andrew aguecheekthe o mistress mine where are you roaming songwell its a sweet but melancholic kind of song its the one that ends youths a stuff will not endure it was hard to hear kittredge sing that song as beautifully as he did though the slight mockery in his voicein festes character or in kittredgeswas unmistakable when i knew about elaine being pregnant i would remember a line from one of the middle stanzas of that song journeys end in lovers meeting theres no question that elaine and kittredge did their meeting in her fifthfloor bedroom the hadleys were still in the habit of going to the movies in ezra falls with richard and my mom i remember there were a few foreign films with subtitles that did not qualify as sex films there was a jacques tati film showing in vermont that yearmon oncle was it or maybe the earlier one mr hulots holidayand i went to ezra falls with my mom and richard and with mr and mrs hadley elaine didnt want to come she stayed home its not a sex film elaine my mother had assured her its french but its a comedyits very light i dont feel like lighti dont feel like a comedy elaine had said she was already throwing up at twelfth night rehearsals but no one had figured out that she had morning sickness maybe thats when elaine told kittredge that hed knocked her upwhen her family and mine were watching a jacques tati film with subtitles in ezra falls when elaine knew she was pregnant she eventually told her mother either martha hadley or mr hadley must have told richard and my mom i was in bednaturally i was wearing elaines brawhen my mother burst into my bedroom dont jeweltry to take it easy i heard richard saying but my mom had already snapped on my light i sat up in bed holding elaines bra as if i were hiding my nonexistent breasts just look at you my mother cried elaine is pregnant it wasnt me i told her she slapped me of course it wasnt youi know it wasnt you billy my mom said but why wasnt it youwhy wasnt it she cried she went out of my room sobbing and richard came in it must have been kittredge i said to richard well billof course its kittredge richard said he sat on the side of my bed trying his hardest not to notice the bra youll have to forgive your momshes upset he said i didnt reply i was thinking about what mrs hadley had said to methat bit about certain sexual matters upsetting my mother billy i know there are things shes kept from you martha hadley had told me i think elaine will have to go away for a while richard abbott was saying away where i asked him but richard either didnt know or didnt want to tell me he just shook his head im really sorry billim sorry about everything richard said i had just recently turned eighteen it was then i realized that i didnt have a crush on richard anymorenot even a slight one i knew i loved richard abbotti still do love himbut that night id found something i disliked about him in a way he was weakhe let my mother push him around whatever my mom had kept from me i knew then that richard was keeping it from me too it happens to many teenagersthat moment when you feel full of resentment or distrust for those adults you once loved unquestioningly it happens to some teenagers when theyre younger than i was but i was a brandnew eighteen when i simply tuned out my mother and richard i trusted grandpa harry more and i still loved uncle bob but richard abbott and my mom had drifted into that discredited area occupied by aunt muriel and nana victoriain their case an area of carping undermining commentary to be ignored or avoided in the case of richard and my mother it was their secrecy i shunned as for the hadleys they sent elaine away in stages i can only guess what passed between mrs kittredge and the hadleysthe deals adults make arent often explained to kidsbut mr and mrs hadley agreed to let kittredges mother take elaine to europe i have no doubt that elaine wanted the abortion martha hadley and mr hadley must have agreed it was best it was definitely what mrs kittredge had wanted im guessing that being french she knew where to go in europe being kittredges mom she may have had some previous experience with an unwanted pregnancy at the time i imagined that a boy like kittredge had gotten girls pregnant beforehe easily could have but i was also thinking that mrs kittredge might have needed to get herself out of a jami mean when she was younger its hard to explain what gave me that idea i had overheard a conversation at a twelfth night rehearsal id wandered into the middle of something kittredge and his teammate delacorte were sayingdelacorte the rinser and spitter it sounded as if theyd been arguing it seemed to me that delacorte was frightened of kittredge but so was everyone no i didnt mean thati just said she was the most beautiful mother of the mothers ive met your mom is the bestlookingthats all i said delacorte was anxiously saying then he rinsed and spat if shes anyones mother you mean kittredge said she doesnt have a very motherly look does she she looks like someone whos asking for troublethats what she looks like i didnt say what your mom looks like delacorte insisted i just said she was the most beautiful shes the bestlooking mom of all the moms maybe she doesnt look like a mom because she isnt one kittredge said delacorte looked too frightened to speak he just kept rinsing and spitting clutching the two paper cups my idea that mrs kittredge might have needed to get herself out of a jam came from kittredge he was the one who said she looks like someone whos asking for trouble quite possibly mrs kittredge had more in mind than helping elaine out of a jam the deal she made with the hadleys probably kept kittredge in school moral turpitude was among the stated grounds for dismissal at favorite river academy for a senior at the school to impregnate a faculty childremember elaine was not yet eighteen she was under the age of legal maturitycertainly struck me as base or depraved or vile behavior but kittredge stayed youre traveling with kittredges motherjust the two of you id asked elaine of course its just the two of us billywho else needs to come along elaine responded where in europe i asked elaine shrugged she was still throwing up though less frequently what does it matter where it is billy its somewhere jacqueline knows youre calling her jacqueline she asked me to call her jacquelinenot mrs kittredge oh richard had cast laura gordon as viola laura was now a senior in the high school in ezra falls according to my cousin gerry laura put outnot that i saw but gerry seemed well informed about such matters gerry was a university student now at last liberated from ezra falls if laura gordons breasts had been too developed for her to be cast as hedvig in the wild duck they should have disqualified her for viola who somehow has to disguise herself as a man laura would need to be wrapped flat with ace bandages and even so there was no flattening her but richard knew that laura could learn her lines on short notice that she looked nothing like my twin notwithstanding she wouldnt be a bad viola the show went on though elaine would miss our performances she would linger in europerecuperating i could only guess the clowns song concludes twelfth night feste is alone onstage for the rain it raineth every day kittredge sang four times the poor kid kittredge had said to me about elaine such bad luckher first time and everything as had happened to me before i was speechless i didnt notice that kittredges german homework was any worse or any better i didnt even notice my mothers expression when she saw her father onstage as a woman i was so upset about elaine that i forgot about my plan to observe the prompter when i say that the hadleys sent elaine away in stages i mean that the trip to europenot to mention the obvious reason for that tripwas just the beginning the hadleys had decided that their dormitory apartment in an allboys school was the wrong place for elaine to finish her high school years they would send her away to an allgirls boarding school but not until the fall that spring of was a writeoff for elaine and she would have to repeat her sophomore year it was said publicly that elaine had had a nervous breakdown but everyone in a town as small as first sister vermont knew what had happened when a girl of high school age withdrew from school everyone at favorite river academy knew what had happened to elaine too even atkins understood i came out of mrs hadleys office in the music building not long after elaine had disembarked for europe with mrs kittredge martha hadley had been undone by the ease with which id pronounced the abortion word shed dismissed me from our appointment twenty minutes early and i encountered atkins on the stairwell between the first and second floors i could see it crossing his mindthat it was not yet time for his appointment with mrs hadley but his struggle with the time word clearly prevented him from saying it instead he said what kind of breakdown was it what does elaine have to be nervous about i think you know i said to him atkins had an anxious ferallooking face but with dazzling blue eyes and a girls smooth complexion he was a junior like me but he looked youngerhe wasnt yet shaving shes pregnant isnt she it was kittredge wasnt it thats what everybodys saying and he isnt denying it atkins said elaine was really niceshe always said something nice to me anyway he added elaine really is nice i told him but whats she doing with kittredges mother have you seen kittredges mom shes not like a mom shes like one of those old movie stars who is secretly a witch or a dragon atkins declared i dont know what you mean i told him a woman who used to be that beautiful can never accept how atkins stopped how time passes i guessed yes he cried women like mrs kittredge hate young girls kittredge told me atkins added his dad left his mom for a younger womanshe wasnt more beautiful just younger oh i cant imagine traveling with kittredges mother atkins exclaimed will elaine have her own room he asked me i dont know i told him i hadnt thought about elaine sharing a room with mrs kittredge it gave me the shivers just to think about it what if she wasnt kittredges mother or anyones mother but mrs kittredge had to be kittredges mom there was no way those two were unrelated atkins had inched his way past me up the stairs i took a step or two down the stairs i thought we were through talking suddenly atkins said not everyone here understands people like us but elaine didmrs hadley does too yes was all i said continuing down the stairs i tried not to consider too carefully what hed meant by people like us but i was sure that atkins wasnt exclusively referring to our pronunciation problems had atkins made a pass at me i wondered as i crossed the quad was that the first pass that a boy like me ever made at me the sky was lighter nowit didnt get dark so soon in the afternoonbut it would already be past nightfall in europe i knew elaine would be going to bed soon in a room of her own or not it was warmer now toonot that there was ever much of a spring in vermontbut i shivered as i crossed the quadrangle on my way to my twelfth night rehearsal i should have been thinking of my lines of what sebastian says but i could only think of that song the clown sings before the final curtainfestes song the one kittredge sang for the rain it raineth every day just then it began to rain and i thought about how elaines life had been changed forever while i was still just acting i have kept the photographs elaine sent me they were never very good photos just blackandwhite or color snapshots because of how many of my desktops these pictures have sat onoften in sunlight and for so many yearsthe photographs are badly faded but of course i have no trouble recalling the circumstances i just wish that elaine had sent me some pictures of her trip to europe with mrs kittredge but who would have taken those photographs i cant imagine elaine snapping photos of kittredges fashionmodel motherdoing what brushing her teeth reading in bed getting dressed or undressed and what might elaine have been doing to inspire the artistasphotographer in mrs kittredge vomiting into a toilet from a kneeling position waiting nauseated in the lobby of this or that hotel because her roomor the room she would share with kittredges momwasnt ready i doubt there were many photo opportunities that captured mrs kittredges imagination not the visit to the doctors officeor was it a clinicand certainly not the messy but matteroffact procedure itself elaine was in her first trimester im sure the procedure was a standard dilation and curettageyou know the usual scraping elaine would later tell me that after the abortion when she was still taking the painkillerswhen mrs kittredge would regularly check the amount of blood on the pad to be sure the bleeding was normalkittredges mom felt her forehead to ascertain that elaine didnt have a fever and that was when mrs kittredge told elaine those outrageous stories i used to think the painkillers might have been a factor in what elaine remembered or believed she heard in those stories the painkillers werent that strong and i didnt take them for more than a day or two elaine always said i wasnt in a whole lot of pain billy but werent you drinking wine you told me that mrs kittredge gave you all the red wine you wanted i would remind elaine im sure that you werent supposed to mix the painkillers with alcohol i never had more than a glass or two of red wine billy elaine always told me i heard every word that jacqueline said either those stories are true or jacqueline was lying to meand why would anyones mother lie about that kind of thing admittedly i dont know why anyones mother would make up stories about her only childat least not that kindbut i dont hold kittredge or his mom in the highest moral esteem whatever i believed or didnt about the stories mrs kittredge told elaine elaine seemed to believe every word according to mrs kittredge her only child was a sickly little boy he had no confidence in himself and was picked on by the other children especially by the boys while this was truly difficult to imagine it was even harder to believe that kittredge was once intimidated by girls he apparently was so shy that he stuttered when he tried to talk to girls and the girls either teased him or ignored him in the seventh grade kittredge would fake being sick so that he could stay home from schoolthese were very competitive schools in paris and new york mrs kittredge had explained to elaineand at the start of eighth grade hed stopped talking to both the boys and the girls in his class so i seduced himits not as if i had lots of other options mrs kittredge told elaine the poor boyhe had to gain a little confidence somewhere i guess he gained quite a lot of confidence elaine ventured to say to kittredges mom whod simply shrugged mrs kittredge had an insouciant shrug one can only wonder if she was born with it or ifafter her husband had left her for a younger but indisputably less attractive womanshed developed an instinctive indifference to any kind of rejection mrs kittredge matteroffactly told elaine that shed slept with her son as much as hed wanted to but only until kittredge demonstrated a lack of fervor or a wandering sexual attention span he cant help it that he loses interest every twentyfour hours kittredges mom told elaine he didnt gain all that confidence by being boredbelieve me did mrs kittredge imagine she was giving elaine what amounted to an excuse for her sons behavior all the time she was talking mrs kittredge went on checking to see if the blood on elaines pad was normal or feeling elaines forehead to be sure she didnt have a fever there are no pictures of their time together in europeonly what i have managed over the years to coax out of elaine and what ive inevitably imagined of my dear friend aborting kittredges child and her subsequent recuperation in the company of kittredges mother if mrs kittredge had seduced her own son so that he might gain a little confidence did this explain why kittredge felt so strongly that his mom was somewhat less or maybe more than motherly for how long did kittredge have sex with his mom i asked elaine that eighthgrade year when he would have been thirteen and fourteen elaine answered and maybe three or four times after hed started at favorite riverhe would have been fifteen when it stopped why did it stop i asked elainenot that i completely believed it had happened perhaps the insouciance of elaines shrug was something shed picked up from mrs kittredge knowing kittredge i suppose he got tired of it elaine had said she was packing her bags for what would be her sophomore year at northfieldfall term and we were in her bedroom in bancroft it would have been late august it was hot in that room the lamp with the darkblue shade had been replaced with a colorless job like the desk lamp in an anonymous office and elaine had cut her hair shortalmost like a boys although the phases of her going away would be marked by an increasingly conscious masculinity in her appearance elaine said she would never be in a lesbian relationship yet she told me shed experimented with being a lesbian had she experimented with mrs kittredge if elaine had ever been attracted to women i imagined how mrs kittredge might have ended that but elaine was vague about it i think of my dear friend as someone doomed to be attracted to the wrong men but elaine was vague about that too theyre just not the sort of men who last was how she put it as for the photographs the pictures elaine sent me of her three years at northfield are the ones i have kept they may be blackandwhite or color and utterly amateur snapshots but they are not as artless as they first appear ill begin with the photo of elaine standing on the porch of a threestory wooden house she doesnt look like she belongs thereperhaps she was only visiting together with the name of the building and the date of its constructionmoore cottage there is also this hope expressed in elaines careful longhand on the back of the photograph i wish this were my dorm apparently it wasntnor would it be on the ground floor of moore cottage there were wooden clapboards painted white but there were whitepainted wooden shingles on the second and third floorsas if to suggest not only the passage of time but a lingering indecision possibly this uncertainty had to do with moore cottages use over the years it would be used as a dormitory for girlslater as a guesthouse for visiting parents from the spreadout look of the building there were probably a dozen or more bedroomsfar fewer bathrooms ill betand a large kitchen with an adjoining common room more bathrooms might have made the visiting parents happier whereas the students when they lived there were long accustomed to making do with less the porch where elaine stoodshe seemed uncharacteristically unsure of herselfhad a contradictory appearance what use do students have for porches in a good school which northfield was students are too busy for porches which are better suited for people with more time for leisuresuch as guests in the picture of herself on the porch at moore cottageit was among the very first of the photographs elaine sent me from northfieldmaybe she felt like a guest curiously there is someone in the window of one of the groundfloor rooms overlooking the porch a woman of indeterminate age to judge her by her clothes and the length of her hairher face lost in the shadows or obscured by an unclear reflection in the window also among the earliest photos elaine sent me from her new school which was in fact a very old school was that picture of the birthplace of dwight l moody our founders birthplace alleged to be haunted elaine had written on the back of this photo though that cant be the ghost of dl himself in a small upstairs window of the birthplace it is a womans face in profileneither young nor old but definitely prettyher expression unknown elaine smiling is in the foreground of the photograph she appears to be pointing in the direction of that upstairs window maybe the girl was a friend of hers or so i first imagined then theres the picture labeled the auditorium on a slight hill i guess elaine meant slight by vermont standards i remember it as the first of the photos where the mystery woman seemed to be consciously posed after seeing this picture i began to look for her the auditorium was a redbrick building with arched windows and doorways and with two castlesize towers a shadow cast by one of the towers fell across the lawn where elaine was standing near the trunk of an imposing tree sticking out from behind the treein sunlight not in the towers shadowwas a womans shapely leg her foot which was pointed toward elaine was in a dark and sensible shoe her kneesock was properly pulled up to her bare knee above which her long gray skirt had been hiked to midthigh whos the other girl or woman id asked elaine i dont know who you mean elaine replied what girl or woman in the pictures theres always someone else there in the photographs i said come onyou can tell me who is ita friend of yours maybe or a teacher in the photo of east hall the womans face is very smalland partially hidden by a scarfin an upperstory window east hall was evidently a dormitory though elaine didnt say the fire escape gave it away in the picture of stone hall there is a clock tower of that coppergreen color and very tall windows it must have had warm light inside on those few ungray days in the schoolyear months in western massachusetts elaine is somewhat awkwardly positioned at the far side of the photograph she is facing the camera but she is standing almost perfectly backtoback with someone you can count two or three extra fingers on elaines left hand holding her right hip is a third hand theres the one of the school chapel i guess you would call ita massivelooking cathedral with one of those big wooden doors inlaid with cast iron a womans bare arm is holding the heavylooking door open for elaine who seems not to notice the arma bracelet on the wrist rings on both the pinkie and the index fingeror maybe elaine didnt care whether or not the woman was there one can read the latin engraved on the chapel anno domini mdccccviii elaine had translated this on the back of the photo in the year of the lord shed added where i want to get married if im ever desperate enough to get marriedif so please just shoot me i believe i love best the picture of margaret olivia hall northfields music building because i knew how much elaine loved to singsinging was one thing her big voice was born to do i love to sing until i cry and then sing some more she once wrote to me the names of composers were engraved between the upperstory windows of the music hall i have memorized the names palestrina bach handel beethoven wagner gluck mozart rossini in the window above the u in gluck which had been carved like a v was a headless womanjust her torsowearing only a bra unlike elaine who is leaning against the building the headless woman in the window has very noticeable breastsbig ones who is she i asked elaine again and again if you didnt know it already the music building with the names of those composers was an accurate indication of how sophisticated a school northfield was it put a place like favorite river academy to shame it was a quantum leap heavenward from what elaine had been used to at the public high school in ezra falls most of the prep schools in new england were singlesex schools at that time many allboys schools provided faculty daughters with a tuition stipend the girls could attend an allgirls boarding school and not be adrift in whatever public high school served the community to be fair the public schools in vermont were not all as bad as the one in ezra falls as a result of the hadleys sending elaine to northfieldat first at their expensefavorite river did the right thing it provided what amounted to vouchers for its faculty daughters i would never hear the end of it from my crude cousin gerrynamely that this change in policy had happened too late to rescue her from the public high school in ezra falls as ive said gerry was a college girl that same spring when elaine traveled to europe with mrs kittredge i guess i would have been wise to get myself knocked up a few years agoprovided the lucky guy had a french mother was how gerry put it i could easily imagine muriel saying this when muriel had been a teenageralthough after staring nonstop at my aunts breasts in twelfth night it was terrifying to think of aunt muriel as a teenager i could describe other photographs that elaine sent me from northfieldive kept them allbut the pattern would simply repeat itself there was always a partial imperfect image of another woman in the pictures of elaine and those impressive buildings on the northfield campus who is she i know you know who i meanshes always there elaine i said repeatedly dont be coy about it im not being coy billyyou should talk about being coy if thats the word youre using for being evasive or not talking about things directly if you know what i mean elaine would say okay okayso i have to guess who she is is that it so youre paying me back for being less than candid with youam i getting warm i asked my dear friend elaine and i would try living together though this would be many years later after wed both had sufficient disappointments in our lives it wouldnt work outnot for very longbut we were too good friends not to have tried it we were also old enough when we embarked on this adventure to know that friends were more important than loversnot least for the fact that friendships generally lasted longer than relationships its best not to generalize but this was certainly the case for elaine and me we had a seedy eighthfloor apartment on post street in san franciscoin that area of post street between taylor and mason near union square elaine and i had our own rooms to write our bedroom was large and accommodatingit overlooked some rooftops on geary street and the vertical sign for the hotel adagio at night the neon for the hotel word was darkburned out i guessso that only the adagio was lit in my insomnia i would get out of bed and go to the window and stare at the bloodred adagio sign one night when i came back to bed i inadvertently woke up elaine and i asked her about the adagio word i knew it was italian not only had i heard esmeralda say it but id seen the word in her notes in my forays into the world of opera and other musicboth with esmeralda and with larry in viennai knew that the word had some use in music i knew that elaine would know what it meant like her mother elaine was very musical northfield had been a good fit for herit was a great school for music whats it mean i asked elaine as we lay awake in that seedy post street apartment adagio means slowly softly gently elaine answered oh that would be about the best you could say for our efforts at lovemaking which we tried toowith no more success than the livingtogether part but we tried adagio we would say when we tried to make love or afterward when we were trying to fall asleep we say it still we said it when we left san francisco and we say it when we close letters or emails to each other now its what love means to us i guessonly adagio slowly softly gently it works for friends anyway so who was she reallythe lady in all those pictures i would ask elaine in that accommodating bedroom overlooking the neondamaged hotel adagio you know billyshes still looking after me shell always be hovering somewhere nearby taking my temperature by hand checking the blood on my pad to see if the bleeding is still normal it was always normal by the way but shes still checkingshe wanted me to know that i would never leave her care or her thoughts elaine said i lay there thinking about itthe only light out the window being the dull glow of lights from union square and that damaged neon sign the vertical adagio in bloodred the hotel unlit you actually mean that mrs kittredge is still billy elaine interrupted me i was never as intimate with anyone as i was with that awful woman i will never be as close to anyone again what about kittredge i asked her though i should have known betterafter all those years fuck kittredge elaine cried its his mother who marked me its her ill never forget how intimate marked you how i asked her but shed begun to cry and i thought that i should just hold herslowly softly gentlyand say nothing id already asked her about the abortion it wasnt that shed had another abortion after the one in europe theyre not so bad when you consider the alternative was all elaine ever said about her abortions however mrs kittredge had marked her it wasnt about that and if elaine had experimented with being a lesbiani mean with mrs kittredgeelaine would go to her grave being vague about that the pictures i kept of elaine were what i could imagine about kittredges mother or how close elaine ever was to her the shadows and body parts of the woman or women in those photographs are more vivid to me than my one memory of mrs kittredge at a wrestling match the first and only time i actually saw her i know that awful woman best by her effect on my friend elainethe way i know myself best by my persistent crushes on the wrong people the way i was formed by how long i kept the secret of myself from the people i loved chapter my terrifying angels if an unwanted pregnancy was the abyss that an intrepid girl could fall intothe abyss word was my mothers though ill bet shed heard it first from fucking murielsurely the abyss for a boy like me was to succumb to homosexual activity in such love lay madness in acting out my most dire imaginings i would certainly descend to the bottomless pit of the universe of desire or so i believed in the fall of my senior year at favorite river academy when i once more ventured to the first sister public librarythis time i thought to save myself i was eighteen but my sexual misgivings were innumerable my selfhatred was huge if you were like me at an allboys boarding school in the fall of you felt utterly aloneyou trusted no one least of all another boy your ageand you loathed yourself id always been lonely but selfhatred is worse than loneliness with elaine starting her new life at northfield i was spending more and more time in the yearbook room of the academy library when my mom or richard asked me where i was going i always answered im going to the library i didnt tell them which library and without elaine to slow me downshe could never resist showing me those hotlooking boys from the more contemporary of the yearbooksi was blazing my way through the graduating classes of the decreasingly distant past id left world war i behind i was way ahead of my imagined schedule at the rate i was going through those yearbooks i would catch up with the present well before the spring of and my own graduation from favorite river in fact i was a mere thirty years behind myself on the same september evening i decided to leave the academy library and pay a visit to miss frost id begun to peruse the yearbook for the class of an absolutely heartstopping boy in the wrestlingteam photo had caused me to abruptly close the yearbook i thought i simply cant keep thinking about kittredge and boys like him i must not give in to those feelings or i am doomed just what exactly was holding my doom at bay my contrived image of martha hadley as a trainingbra model in a mailorder catalog wasnt working anymore it was increasingly difficult to masturbate to even the most imaginative transposing of mrs hadleys homely face on the least bosomy of those smallbreasted young girls all that held kittredge and boys like him at bay was my ardent fantasizing about miss frost the favorite river academy yearbook was called the owl anyone who knows why is probably dead richard abbott had replied when id asked him why i pushed the owl aside i gathered up my notebooks and my german homeworkcramming everything but the owl into my book bag i was taking german iv though it wasnt required i was still helping kittredge with german iii which hed flunked but was perforce repeating it was somewhat easier to help him since we were no longer taking german iii together essentially all i did was save kittredge a little time the hard stuff in german iii was the introduction to goethe and rilke there was more of them in german iv when kittredge got stuck on a phrase i saved him time by giving him a quick and rudimentary translation that some of the same goethe and rilke was as confounding to kittredge the second time truly incensed him but frankly the notes and hurried comments that now passed between us were easier for me than our previous conversations i was trying to be in kittredges presence as little as i possibly could to that end i dropped out of the fall shakespeare playto richards oftexpressed disappointment richard had cast kittredge as edgar in king lear furthermore there was an unforeseen flaw in richards having cast me as lears fool when i was telling mrs hadley that i wanted no part in the play because kittredge had a heros partnot to mention that edgar is later disguised as poor tom so that kittredge had essentially been given a dual rolemartha hadley wanted to know how closely id looked over my lines given that my number of unpronounceables was growing did i foresee that the fool presented me with any vocabulary issues was mrs hadley hinting that my pronunciation problems could excuse me from the play what are you getting at i asked her you think i cant handle cutpurses or courtesan or are you worried that codpiece will throw me for a loopjust because of the whatchamacallit the codpiece covers or because i have trouble with the word for the whatchamacallit itself dont be defensive billy martha hadley said or was it the arrant whore combination that you thought might trip me up i asked her or maybe coxcombeither the singular or the plural or both calm down billy mrs hadley said were both upset about kittredge kittredge had the last lines in twelfth night i cried now richard gives him the last lines again we have to hear kittredge say the weight of this sad time we must obey speak what we feel not what we ought to say the oldest hath borne most kittredgeasedgar continues in the story of king leargiven what happens to lear not to mention the blinding of gloucester richard had cast himself as gloucesterthis is certainly true but when edgar ends the play by declaring that we that are young shall never see so much nor live so longwell i dont know if that is universally true do i dispute the concluding wisdom of this great play because i cant distinguish edgar from kittredge can anyone even shakespeare know how future generations will or will not suffer richard is doing whats best for the play billy martha hadley told me richard isnt rewarding kittredge for seducing elaine yet it somehow seemed that way to me why give kittredge as good a part as edgar who is later disguised as poor tom after what had happened in twelfth night why did richard have to give kittredge a role in king lear at all i wanted out of the playbeing or not being lears fool wasnt the issue just tell richard you dont want to be around kittredge billy mrs hadley said to me richard will understand i couldnt tell martha hadley that i also didnt want to be around richard and what point was there in this production of king lear to observe my mothers expression when she watched her father onstage as a woman grandpa harry was cast as goneril lears eldest daughter goneril is such a horrid daughter why wouldnt my mom look at anyone playing goneril with the utmost disapproval aunt muriel was regan lears other awful daughter i assumed that my mother would glower at her sister muriel too it wasnt only because of kittredge that i wanted nothing to do with this king lear i had no heart to see uncle bob fall short in the leadingman department for the goodhearted bobsquash ball bob kittredge called himwas cast as king lear that bob lacked a tragic dimension seemed obvious if not to richard abbott perhaps richard pitied bob and found him tragic because bob was tragically married to muriel it was bobs body that was all wrongor was it his head bobs body was big and athletically robust compared to his body bobs head seemed too small and improbably rounda squash ball lost between two hulking shoulders uncle bob was both too goodnatured and too stronglooking to be lear it is relatively early in the play act scene when bobaslear bellows who is it that can tell me who i am who could forget how lears fool answers the king but i did i forgot that i even had a line who is it that can tell me who i am bill richard abbott asked me its your line nymph kittredge whispered to me i had anticipated that you might have a little trouble with it everyone waited while i found the fools line at first i wasnt even aware of the pronunciation problem my difficulty in saying this word was so recent that i hadnt noticed it nor had martha hadley but kittredge clearly had detected the potential unpronounceable lets hear you say it nymph kittredge said lets hear you try it anyway who is it that can tell me who i am lear asks the fool answers lears shadow since when had the shadow word given me any grief in the pronunciation department since elaine had come back from that trip to europe with mrs kittredge when elaine seemed as insubstantial as a shadowat least in comparison to her former self since elaine had come back from europe and there seemed to be an unfamiliar shadow dogging her every stepa shadow that bore a ghostly but ultrasophisticated resemblance to mrs kittredge herself since elaine had gone away again to northfield and i was left with a shadow following me aroundperhaps the disquieting unavenged shadow of my absent best friend lears shed i said his shed kittredge exclaimed try it again bill richard said i cant say it i replied maybe we need a new fool kittredge suggested that would be my decision kittredge richard told him or mine i said ah well grandpa harry started to say but uncle bob interrupted him it seems to me richard that billy could say lears reflection or even lears ghostif in your judgment this fits with what the fool means or is implying uncle bob suggested then it wouldnt be shakespeare kittredge said the line is lears shadow billy my mother the prompter said either you can say it or you cant please jewel richard started to say but i interrupted him lear should have a proper foolone who can say everything i told richard abbott i knew as i was leaving that i was walking out of my final rehearsal as a favorite river academy studentmy last shakespeare play perhaps as it would turn out king lear was my last shakespeare play as an actor the faculty daughter whom richard cast as cordelia was and remains so completely unknown to me that i cant recall her name an unformed girl but with a crackerjack memory grandpa harry had said about her neither a present nor a future beauty was all my aunt muriel said of the doomed cordelia implying that in king lear no one would ever have married this cordelianot even if shed lived lears fool would be played by delacorte since delacorte was a wrestler hed probably learned that the part was available because kittredge had told him kittredge would later inform me that because the fall shakespeare play was rehearsed and performed before the start of the wrestling season delacorte wasnt as ill affected as he usually was by the complications of cutting weight yet the lightweight who according to kittredge would have had the shit kicked out of him in a heavier weightclass still suffered from cottonmouth even when he wasnt dehydratedor perhaps delacorte dreamed of cutting weight even in the offseason therefore delacorte constantly rinsed his mouth out with water from a paper cup he eternally spat out the water into another paper cup if delacorte were alive today im sure he would still be running his fingers through his hair but delacorte is dead along with so many others awaiting me in the future was seeing delacorte die delacorte as lears fool would wisely say have more than thou showest speak less than thou knowest lend less than thou owest good advice but it wont save lears fool and it didnt save delacorte kittredge acted strangely in delacortes company he could behave affectionately and impatiently with delacorte in the same moment it was as if delacorte had been a childhood friend but one whod disappointed kittredgeone whod not turned out as kittredge had hoped or expected kittredge was preternaturally fond of delacortes rinsingandspitting routine kittredge had even suggested to richard that there might be onstage benefits to lears fool repeatedly rinsing and spitting then it wouldnt be shakespeare grandpa harry said im not prompting the rinsing and spitting richard my mom said delacorte you will kindly do your rinsing and spitting backstage richard told the compulsive lightweight it was just an idea kittredge had said with a dismissive shrug i guess it will suffice that we at least have a fool who can say the shadow word to me kittredge would be more philosophical look at it this way nymphtheres no such thing as a working actor with a restricted vocabulary but its a positive discovery to be made aware of your limitations at such a young age kittredge assured me how fortuitous reallynow you know you can never be an actor you mean its not a career choice i said as miss frost had once declared to mewhen id first told her that i wanted to be a writer i should say not nymphnot if you want to give yourself a fighting chance oh and you might be wise nymph to clarify another choicei mean before you get to the career part kittredge said i said nothing i just waited i knew kittredge well enough to know when he was setting me up theres the matter of your sexual proclivities kittredge continued my sexual proclivities are crystalclear i told hima little surprised at myself because i was acting and there wasnt a hint of a pronunciation problem i dont know nymph kittredge said with that deliberate or involuntary flutter in the broad muscles of his wrestlers neck in the area of sexual proclivities you look like a workinprogress to me oh its you miss frost said cheerfully when she saw me she sounded surprised i thought it was your friend he was herehe just left i thought it was him coming back who i asked her i had kittredge on my mind of coursenot exactly a friend tom miss frost said tom was just here im never sure why he comes hes always asking about a book he says he cant find at the academy library but i know perfectly well the school has it anyway i never have what hes looking for maybe he comes here looking for you tom who i asked her i didnt think i knew a tom atkinsisnt that his name miss frost asked i know him as tom i know him as atkins i said oh william i wonder how long the lastname culture of that awful school will persist miss frost said shouldnt we be whispering i whispered after all we were in a library i was puzzled by how loudly miss frost spoke but i was also excited to hear her say that favorite river academy was an awful school i secretly thought so but out of loyalty to richard abbott and uncle bob faculty brat that i was i would never have said so theres no one else here william miss frost whispered to me we can speak as loudly as we want oh youve come to write i suppose miss frost loudly said no i need your advice about what i should read i told her is the subject still crushes on the wrong people william very wrong i whispered she leaned over to be closer to me she was still so much taller than i was she made me feel that i hadnt grown we can whisper about this if you want to she whispered do you know jacques kittredge i asked her everyone knows kittredge miss frost said neutrally i couldnt tell what she thought about him i have a crush on kittredge but im trying not to i told her is there a novel about that miss frost put both her hands on my shoulders i knew she could feel me shaking oh williamthere are worse things you know she said yes i have the very novel you should read she whispered i know why atkins comes here i blurted out hes not looking for mehe probably has a crush on you why would he miss frost asked me why wouldnt he why wouldnt any boy have a crush on you i asked her well no ones had a crush on me for a while she said but its very flatteringits so sweet of you to say so william i have a crush on you too i told her i always have and its stronger than the crush i have on kittredge my dear boy you are so very wrong miss frost declared didnt i tell you there were worse things than having a crush on jacques kittredge listen to me william having a crush on kittredge is safer how can kittredge be safer than you i cried i could feel that i was starting to shake again this time when she put her big hands on my shoulders miss frost hugged me to her broad chest i began to sob uncontrollably i hated myself for crying but i couldnt stop dr harlow had told us in yet another lamentable morning meeting that excessive crying in boys was a homosexual tendency we should guard ourselves against naturally the moron never told us how we should guard ourselves against something we couldnt control and id overheard my mother say to muriel honestly i dont know what to do when billy cries like a girl so there i was in the first sister public library crying like a girl in miss frosts strong armshaving just told her that i had a stronger crush on her than the one i had on jacques kittredge i must have seemed to her like such a sissy my dear boy you dont really know me miss frost was saying you dont know who i amyou dont know the first thing about me do you william you dont do you i dont what i blubbered i dont know your first name i admitted i was still sobbing i was hugging her back but not as hard as she hugged me i could feel how strong she was andonce againthe smallness of her breasts seemed to stand in surprising contrast to her strength i could also feel how soft her breasts were her small soft breasts struck me as such a contradiction to her broad shoulders her muscular arms i didnt mean my name williammy first name isnt important miss frost said i mean you dont know me but what is your first name i asked her there was a theatricality in the way miss frost sigheda staged exaggeration in the way she released me from her hug almost pushing me away from her i have a lot at stake in being miss frost william she said i did not acquire the miss word accidentally i knew something about not liking the name you were given for i hadnt liked being william francis dean jr you dont like your first name i asked her we could begin with that she answered amused would you ever name a girl alberta like the province in canada i asked i could not imagine miss frost as an alberta its a better name for a province miss frost said everyone used to call me al al i repeated you see why i like the miss she said laughing i love everything about you i told her slow down william miss frost said you cant rush into crushes on the wrong people of course i didnt understand why she thought of herself as wrong for meand how could she possibly imagine that my crush on kittredge was safer i believed that miss frost must have meant merely to warn me about the difference in our ages maybe an eighteenyearold boy with a woman in her forties was a taboo to her i was thinking that i was legally an adult albeit barely and if it were true that miss frost was about my aunt muriels age i was guessing that she would have been fortytwo or fortythree girls my own age dont interest me i said to miss frost i seem to be attracted to older women my dear boy she said again it doesnt matter how old i amits what i am william you dont know what i am do you as if that existentialsounding question wasnt confusing enough atkins chose this moment to enter the dimly lit foyer of the library where he appeared to be startled he told me later hed been frightened by the reflection of himself he had seen in the mirror which hung silently in the foyer like a nonspeaking security guard oh its you tom miss frost said unsurprised do you see what did i tell you i asked miss frost while atkins went on fearfully regarding himself in the mirror youre so very wrong miss frost told me smiling kittredge is looking for you bill atkins said i went to the yearbook room but someone said youd just left the yearbook room miss frost repeated she sounded surprised i looked at her there was an unfamiliar anxiety in her expression bill is conducting a study of favorite river yearbooks from past to present atkins said to miss frost elaine told me atkins explained to me for christs sake atkinsit sounds like youre conducting a study of me i told him its kittredge who wants to talk to you atkins said sullenly since when are you kittredges messenger boy i asked him ive had enough abuse for one night atkins cried dramatically throwing up his slender hands its one thing to have kittredge insulting mehe insults everyone but having you insult me billwell thats just too much in an effort to leave the first sister public library in a flamboyant pique atkins once again encountered that menacing mirror in the foyer where he paused to deliver a parting shot im not your shadow billkittredge is atkins said he was gone before he could hear me say fuck kittredge watch your language william miss frost said putting her long fingers to my lips after all were in a fucking library the fucking word was not one that came to mind when i thought of herin the same way that miss frost seemed an implausible albertabut when i looked at her she was smiling she was just teasing me her long fingers now brushed my cheek a curious reference to the shadow word william she said would it be the unpronounceable word that caused your unplanned exit from king lear it would i told her i guess you heard in a town this small i think everyone hears everything maybe not quite everyonepossibly not quite everything william miss frost said it appears to me for example that you havent heard everythingabout me i mean i knew that nana victoria didnt like miss frost but i didnt know why i knew that aunt muriel had issues with miss frosts choice in bras but how could i have brought up the trainingbra subject when i had just expressed my love for everything about miss frost my grandmother i started to say and my aunt muriel but miss frost lightly touched my lips with her long fingers again shhh william she whispered i dont need to hear what those ladies think of me im much more interested in hearing about that project of yours in the old yearbook room oh its not really a project i told her i just look at the wrestlingteam photos mostlyand at the pictures of the plays that the drama club performed do you miss frost somewhat absently asked why was it i got the feeling that she was actingin a kind of onagain offagain way what was it shed said when richard abbott had asked her if shed ever been onstageif shed ever acted only in my mind shed answered him almost flirtatiously when i was youngerall the time and what year are you up to in those old yearbooks williamwhich graduating class miss frost then asked nineteen thirtyone i answered her fingers had strayed from my lips she was touching the collar of my shirt almost as if there were something about a boys buttondown dress shirt that had affected hera sentimental attachment maybe youre so close miss frost said close to what i asked her just close she said we havent much time is it time to close the library i asked her but miss frost only smiled then as if giving the matter more thought she glanced at her watch well what harm is there in closing a little early tonight she said suddenly surewhy not i said theres no one here but us i dont think atkins is coming back poor tom miss frost said he doesnt have a crush on me williamtom atkins has a crush on you the second she said so i knew it was true poor tom which would become how i thought of atkins probably sensed i had a crush on miss frost he must have been jealous of her poor tom is just spying on me and you miss frost told me and what does kittredge want to talk to you about she suddenly asked me oh thats nothingthats just a german thing i help kittredge with his german i explained tom atkins would be a safer choice for you than jacques kittredge william miss frost said i knew this was true too though i didnt find atkins attractiveexcept in the way that someone who adores you can become a little attractive to you over time but that almost never works out does it yet when i began to tell miss frost that i wasnt really attracted to atkinsthat not all boys were attractive to me just a very few boys actuallywell this time she put her lips to mine she simply kissed me it was a fairly firm kiss moderately aggressive there was only one assertive thrust a single dart of her warm tongue believe me ill soon be seventy ive had a long lifetime of kisses and this one was more confident than any mans handshake i know i know she murmured against my lips we have so little timelets not talk about poor tom oh i followed her into the foyer where i was still thinking that her concern with time had only to do with the closing time of the library but miss frost said i presume that checkin time for seniors is still ten oclock williamexcept on a saturday night when im guessing its still eleven nothing ever changes at that awful school does it i was impressed that miss frost even knew about checkin time at favorite river academynot to mention that she was exactly right about it i watched her lock the door to the library and turn off the outdoor light she left the dim light in the foyer on while she went about the main library killing the other lights i had completely forgotten that id asked her adviceon the subject of a book about my having a crush on kittredge and trying not towhen miss frost handed me a slender novel it was only about fortyfive pages longer than king lear which happened to be the story id read most recently it was a novel by james baldwin called giovannis roomthe title of which i could barely read because miss frost had extinguished all the lights in the main library there was only the light from the dimly lit foyerscarcely sufficient for miss frost and me to see our way to the basement stairs on the dark stairs lit only by what scant light followed us from the foyer of the libraryand a dull glowing ahead of us which beckoned us to miss frosts cubicle partitioned off from the furnace roomi suddenly remembered that there was another novel i wanted the confident librarians advice about the name al was on my lips but i could not bring myself to say it i said instead miss frost what can you tell me about madame bovary do you think i would like it when youre older william i think youll love it thats kind of what richard said and uncle bob i told her your uncle bob has read madame bovaryyou cant mean muriels bob miss frost exclaimed bob hasnt read ithe was just telling me what it was about i explained someone who hasnt read a novel doesnt really know what its about william oh you should wait william miss frost said the time to read madame bovary is when your romantic hopes and desires have crashed and you believe that your future relationships will have disappointingeven devastatingconsequences ill wait to read it until then i told her her bedroom and bathroomformerly the coal binwas lit only by a reading lamp affixed to the headboard of rails on the oldfashioned brass bed miss frost lit the cinnamonscented candle on the night table turning off the lamp in the candlelight she told me to undress that means everything williamplease dont keep on your socks i did as she told me with my back turned to her while she said she would appreciate some privacy she briefly used the toilet with the wooden seati believe i heard her pee and flushand then from the sound of running water i think she had a quick washup and brushed her teeth in the small sink i lay naked on her brass bed in the flickering candlelight i read that giovannis room was published in from the attached library card i saw that only one patron of the first sister public library had checked out the novelin four yearsand i wondered if mr baldwins solitary reader had in fact been miss frost i did not finish the first two paragraphs before miss frost said please dont read that now william its very sad and it will surely upset you upset me how i asked her i could hear her hanging her clothes in the wardrobe closet it was distracting to imagine her naked but i kept reading theres no such thing as trying not to have a crush on kittredge williamtrying not to doesnt work miss frost said that was when the penultimate sentence of the second paragraph stopped me i just closed the book and shut my eyes i told you to stop reading didnt i miss frost said the sentence began there will be a girl sitting opposite me who will wonder why i have not been flirting with heri stopped there wondering if i would dare to continue its not a novel your mother should see miss frost was saying and if youre not prepared to talk about your crush on kittredge with richardwell i wouldnt let richard know what youre reading either i could feel her lie down on the bed behind me her bare skin touched my back but shed not taken off all her clothes she gently took hold of my penis in her big hand theres a fish called a shad miss frost said a shad i asked my penis was stiffening yesthats what its called miss frost told me it migrates upstream to spawn shad roe is a delicacy you know what roe is dont you she asked me the eggs right the unborn eggs yesthey take them out of the female fish and some people love to eat them miss frost explained oh say shad roe for me william shad roe i said try saying it without the r she told me shadow i said without thinking my penis and her hand had most of my attention like lears shadow she asked me lears shadow i said i didnt want a part in the play anyway i told her well at least you didnt say lears shad roe miss frost said lears shadow i repeated and whats this that ive got in my hand she asked me my penith i answered i wouldnt change that penith for all the world william miss frost said i believe you should say that word any fucking way you want to what happened next would usher in the unattainable what miss frost did to me would prove inimitable she pulled me suddenly to heri was flat on my backand she kissed me on my mouth she was wearing a branot a padded one like elaines but a seethrough bra with only slightly bigger cups than id expected the material was sheer and much silkier than the soft cotton of elaines bra andto compare it to the more utilitarian undergarments in my mothers mailorder catalogsmiss frosts bra was not in the trainingbra category it was altogether sexier and more sophisticated miss frost also wore a halfslip of the slinky kind women wear under a skirtthis one was a beige colorand when she straddled my hips and sat on me she appeared to hike up the halfslip well above midthigh her weight and how firmly she held me pressed me into the bed i held one of her small soft breasts in one hand with my other hand i tried to touch her under her halfslip but miss frost said no william please dont touch me there she took my straying hand and clasped it to her other breast it was my penis that she guided under her halfslip i had never penetrated anyone and when i felt this most amazing friction of course this felt like penetration to me there was a slippery sensationthere was absolutely no pain yet my penis had never been so tightly grippedand when i ejaculated i cried out against her small soft breasts i was surprised that my face was pressed against her breasts and her silky bra because i didnt remember the moment when miss frost had stopped kissing me shed said no william please dont touch me there obviously she couldnt have been kissing me and speaking to me at the same time there was so much i wanted to say to her and ask her but miss frost was not in a mood for conversation perhaps she was feeling the curious constraints of so little time again or so i managed to convince myself she drew a bath for me i was hoping that she would take off the rest of her clothes and get into the big tub with me but she did not she knelt beside that bathtub with the lion paws for feet and the lion heads for faucets and she gently bathed meshe was especially gentle with my penis she even spoke of it affectionately using the penith word in a way that made us both laugh but miss frost kept looking at her watch late for checkin means a restriction william a restriction might entail an earlier checkin time no visits to the first sister public library after closing timewe wouldnt like that would we when i had a look at her watch i saw it was not even ninethirty i was just a few minutes walk from bancroft hall which i pointed out to miss frost well you might run into kittredge and have a german discussionyou never know william was all she said i had noticed a wet silky feeling and when i touched my penisbefore stepping into the bathmy fingers had a vaguely perfumy smell maybe miss frost had used a lubricant of some kind i imaginedsomething i would be reminded of years later when i first smelled those liquid soaps that are made from almond or avocado oil but whatever it was the bath had washed it away no detours to that old yearbook roomnot tonight william miss frost was saying she helped me get dressed as if i were a child going off to my first day of school she even put a dab of toothpaste on her finger and stuck it in my mouth go rinse your mouth in the sink she told me i assume you can find your way outill lock up again when i go she kissed me thena long lingering kiss that caused me to put both my hands on her hips miss frost quickly intercepted my hands taking them from her slinky kneelength halfslip and clasping them to her breasts where i had the distinct impression she believed my hands belonged or perhaps she believed that my hands didnt belong below her waistthat i should not or must not touch her there as i made my way up the dark basement stairs toward the faint light that was glowing from the foyer of the library i was remembering an idiot admonition in a longago morning meetingthe alwaysnumbing warning from dr harlow on the occasion of a weekend dance we were having with a visiting allgirls school dont touch your dates below their waists our peerless school physician said and you and your dates will be happier but this couldnt be true i was thinking when miss frost called to mei was still on the stairs go straight home williamand come see me soon we have so little time i almost called back to herone of those premonitory thoughts i would remember later and forever though at the time i imagined i was thinking of saying it just to see what she would say miss frost was the one who seemed to think we had so little time for whatever reason outside i had a passing thought about poor atkinspoor tom i was sorry that id been mean to him though it made me laugh at myself to recall i had ever imagined he might have a crush on miss frost it was funny to think of them being togetheratkins with his pronunciation problem his complete incapability of saying the time word and miss frost saying it every other minute i had passed the mirror in the dimly lit foyer scarcely looking at myself butin the starbright september nighti considered that i had looked much more grown up to myself than before my encounter with miss frost i mean yet as i made my way along river street to the favorite river campus i reflected that i could not tell from my expression in the mirror that id just had sex for the first time and that thought had an unnerving disturbing companionnamely i suddenly imagined that maybe i hadnt had sex not actual sexno actual penetration i mean then i thought how can i be thinking such a thing on what is the most pleasurable night of my young life i as yet had no idea that it was possible not to have actual sex or actual penetration and still have unsurpassable sexual pleasurea pleasure that to this day has been unmatched but what did i know i was only eighteen that night with james baldwins giovannis room in my book bag my crushes on the wrong people were just beginning the common room in bancroft hall was like the common rooms in other dorms called the butt room the seniors who were smokers were allowed to spend their study hours there many nonsmokers who were seniors thought it was a privilege too important to be missed even they chose to spend their study hours there no one warned us of the dangers of secondhand smoke in those fearless yearsleast of all our imbecilic school physician i dont recall a single morning meeting that addressed the affliction of smoking dr harlow had devoted his time and talents to the treatment of excessive crying in boysin the doctors stalwart belief that there was a cure for homosexual tendencies in the young men we were becoming i was fifteen minutes early for checkin when i walked into the familiar bluegray haze of smoke in the bancroft butt room kittredge accosted me i dont know what wrestling hold it was i would later try to describe it to delacortewho i heard didnt do a bad job as lears fool by the way between rinsing and spitting delacorte said it sounds like an armbar kittredge armbars the shit out of everyone whatever the name of the wrestling hold is it didnt hurt i just knew i couldnt get away from him and i didnt try it was frankly overwhelming to be held so tightly by kittredge when i had just been held by miss frost hi nymph kittredge said where have you been the library i answered i heard you left the library a while ago kittredge said i went to the other library i told him theres a public library the town library i suppose one library isnt enough for a busy boy like you nymph herr steiner is hitting us with a quiz tomorrowim guessing more rilke than goethe but what do you think id had herr steiner in german iihe was one of the austrian skiers he wasnt a bad teacher or a bad guy but he was pretty predictable kittredge was right that there would be more rilke than goethe on the quiz steiner liked rilke but who didnt herr steiner also liked big words and so did goethe kittredge got in trouble in german because he was always guessing you cant guess in a foreign language especially not in a language as precise as german either you know it or you dont youve got to know the big words in goethe kittredge the quiz wont be all rilke i told him the phrases steiner likes in rilke are all the long ones kittredge complained theyre hard to remember there are some short phrases in rilke too everyone likes themnot just steiner i warned him musik atem der statuen shit kittredge cried i know thatwhat is that music breathing of statues i translated for him but i was thinking about the armbar if that was the wrestling hold i was hoping he would hold me forever and theres this one du fast noch kinddo you know that one all the childhood shit kittredge cried did fucking rilke never get over his childhood or something you almost still a childi guarantee thatll be on the quiz kittredge and reine übersteigung the pure transcendence bullshit kittredge cried holding me tighter that one will be there with rilke you can count on the childhood thingitll be there i warned him lange nachmittage der kindheit kittredge sang in my ear long afternoons of childhood arent you impressed that i know that one nymph if its the long phrases youre worried about dont forget this one weder kindheit noch zukunft werden wenigerneither childhood nor future grows any smaller remember that one i asked him fuck kittredge cried i thought that was goethe its about childhood right its rilke i told him dass ich dich fassen möchtif only i could clasp you i was thinking that was goethe but all i said was schöpfungskraft doublefuck kittredge said i know thats goethe it doesnt mean doublefuck though i told him i dont know what he did with the armbar but it started hurting it means creative power or something like that i said and the pain stopped i had almost liked it ill bet you dont know stossgebetyou missed it last year i reminded him the pain was back in the armbar it felt pretty good youre feeling dauntless tonight arent you nymph the two libraries must have boosted your confidence kittredge told me hows delacorte doing with lears shadowand all the rest of it i asked him he let up on the armbar he seemed to hold me almost soothingly whats a fucking stossgebet nymph he asked me an ejaculatory prayer i told him triplefuck he said with uncharacteristic resignation fucking goethe you had trouble with überschlechter last year tooif steiner gets sneaky and throws an adjective in im just trying to help you i told him kittredge released me from the armbar i think i know this oneit means really bad right he asked me you must understand that the entire time we were not exactly wrestlingand not exactly conversing eitherthe denizens of the bancroft butt room were enthralled kittredge was ever the eye magnet in any crowd and here i wasat least appearing to hold my own with him dont get fooled by demut will you i asked him its a short word but its still goethe i know that one nymph kittredge said smiling its humility isnt it yes i said i was surprised he knew the word even in english just remember if it sounds like a homily or a proverb its probably goethe i told him old age is a polite gentlemanyou mean that sort of bullshit to my further surprise kittredge even knew the german which he then recited das alter ist ein höflich mann theres one that sounds like rilke but its goethe i warned him its the one about the fucking kiss kittredge said say it in german nymph he commanded me der kuss der letzte grausam süss i said to him thinking of miss frosts frank kisses i couldnt help but think of kissing kittredge too i was starting to shake again the kiss the last one cruelly sweet kittredge translated thats right or you could say the last kiss of all if you wanted to i told him die leidenschaft bringt leiden i then said to him taking every word to heart fucking goethe kittredge cried i could tell he didnt know itthere was no guessing it either passion brings pain i translated for him oh yeah he said lots of pain you guys one of the smokers said its almost checkin time quadruplefuck kittredge said i knew he could sprint across the quadrangle of dorms to tilley orif he was latekittredge could be counted on to make up a brilliant excuse ein jeder engel ist schrecklich i said to kittredge as he was leaving the butt room rilke right he asked me its rilke all right its a famous one i told him every angel is terrifying that stopped kittredge in the doorway to the butt room he looked at me before he ran on it was a look that frightened me because i thought i saw both complete understanding and total contempt in his handsome face it was as if kittredge suddenly knew everything about menot only who i was and what i was hiding but everything that awaited me in my future my menacing zukunft as rilke would have called it youre a special boy arent you nymph kittredge quickly asked me but he ran on not expecting an answer he just called to me as he ran ill bet every fucking one of your angels is going to be terrifying i know it isnt what rilke meant by every angel but i was thinking of kittredge and miss frost and maybe poor tom atkinsand who knew who else there would be in my futureas my terrifying angels and what was it miss frost had said when she advised me to wait before reading madame bovary what if my terrifying angels beginning with miss frost and jacques kittredge my future relationships was what miss frost had said all had disappointingeven devastatingconsequences as shed also put it whats wrong bill richard abbott asked when i came into our dormitory apartment my mother had already gone to bed at least their bedroom door was closed as it often was you look as if youve seen a ghost richard said not a ghost i told him just my future maybe i said i chose to leave him with the mystery of my remark i went straight to my bedroom and closed the door there was elaines padded bra where it nearly always wasunder my pillow i lay looking at it for a long time seeing little of my futureor my terrifying angelsin it chapter big al it is kittredges cruelty that i chiefly dislike i wrote to elaine that fall he came by it genetically she wrote me back of course i couldnt dispute elaines superior knowledge of mrs kittredge elaine and that awful woman had been intimate enough for elaine to become assertive on the matter of those mothertoson genes that were passed kittredge can deny shes his mom till the cows come home billy but im telling you shes one of those moms who breastfed the fucker till he was shaving okay i wrote to elaine but what makes you so sure cruelty is genetic what about kissing elaine wrote me back those two kiss the same way billy kissing is definitely genetic elaines genetic dissertation on kittredge was in the same letter where she announced her intention to be a writer even in the area of that most sacred ambition elaine had been more candid with me than id managed to be with her here i was embarking on my longdesired adventure with miss frost yet i still hadnt told elaine about that id not told anyone about that naturally i had also resisted reading more of giovannis room until i realized that i wanted to see miss frost againas soon as i couldand i believed that i shouldnt show up at the first sister public library without being prepared to discuss the writing of james baldwin with miss frost thus i plunged ahead in the novelnot very far ahead in fact before i was stopped cold by another sentence this one was just after the beginning of the second chapter and it rendered me incapable of reading further for an entire day i understand now that the contempt i felt for him involved my selfcontempt i read i immediately thought of kittredgehow my dislike of him was completely entangled with my dislike of myself for being attracted to him i thought that james baldwins writing was a little too true for me to handle but i forced myself to try again the very next night there is that description still in the second chapter of the usual knifeblade lean tighttrousered boys from which i inwardly recoiled i would soon model myself on those boys and seek their company and the thought of an abundance of knifeblade boys in my future frightened me then in spite of my fear i was suddenly halfway into the novel and i couldnt stop reading even that part where the narrators hatred for his male lover is as powerful as his love for him and is nourished by the same roots or the part where giovanni is described as somehow always desirable while at the same time his breath makes the narrator want to vomiti truly detested those passages but only because of how much i loathed and feared those feelings in myself yes having these disturbing attractions to other boys and men also made me afraid of what baldwin calls the dreadful whiplash of public morality but i was much more frightened by the passage that describes the narrators reaction to having sex with a womani was fantastically intimidated by her breasts and when i entered her i began to feel that i would never get out alive why hadnt that happened to me i wondered was it only because miss frost had small breasts if shed had big ones would i have felt intimidatedinstead of so amazingly aroused and once again there came the unbidden thought had i really entered her if i had not and i did enter her the next time would i subsequently feel disgustedinstead of so completely satisfied you must understand that until i read giovannis room id never read a novel that had shocked me and id already at eighteen read a lot of novelsmany of them excellent james baldwin wrote excellent stuff and he shocked memost of all when giovanni cries to his lover you want to leave giovanni because he makes you stink you want to despise giovanni because he is not afraid of the stink of love that phrase the stink of love shocked me and it made me feel so awfully naïve what had i thought making love to a boy or a man might smell like did baldwin actually mean the smell of shit because wouldnt that be the smell on your cock if you fucked a man or a boy i was terribly agitated to read this i wanted to talk to someone about it and i almost went and woke up richard to talk to him but i remembered what miss frost had said i wasnt prepared to talk to richard abbott about my crush on kittredge i just stayed in bed i was wearing elaines bra as usual and i read on and on in giovannis roomon into the night i remembered the perfumy smell on my fingers after id touched my penis and before i stepped into the bath miss frost had drawn for me that almond or avocadooil scent wasnt at all like the smell of shit but of course miss frost was a woman and if i had penetrated her surely i had not penetrated her there mrs hadley was suitably impressed that i had conquered the shadow word but because i couldnt or wouldnt tell martha hadley about miss frost i had some difficulty describing how id mastered one of my unpronounceables whatever made you think of saying shad roe without the r billy ah well i started to say and then stoppedin the manner of grandpa harry it was a mystery to mrs hadley and to me how the shadroe technique as martha hadley called it could be applied to my other pronunciation problems naturally upon leaving mrs hadleys officeonce again on the stairs in the music buildingi ran into atkins oh its you tom i said as casually as i could so now its tom is it atkins asked me im just sick of the lastname culture of this awful schoolarent you i asked him now that you mention it atkins said bitterly i could tell that poor toms feathers were still ruffled from our runin at the first sister public library look im sorry about the other night i told him i didnt mean to add to whatever misery kittredge had caused you by calling you his messenger boy i apologize atkins had a way of often seeming on the verge of tears if dr harlow had ever wanted to summon before us a quaking example of what our school physician meant by excessive crying in boys i imagined that he needed only to snap his fingers and ask tom atkins to burst into tears at morning meeting it seemed that i probably interrupted you and miss frost atkins said searchingly miss frost and i talk a lot about writing i told him she tells me what books i should read i tell her what im interested in and she gives me a novel what novel did she give you the other night tom asked what are you interested in bill crushes on the wrong people i told atkins it was astonishing how quickly my first sexual relationship with anyone had emboldened me i felt encouragedeven compelledto say things id heretofore been reluctant to say not only to a timid soul like tom atkins but even to such a powerful nemesis and forbidden love as jacques kittredge granted it was a lot easier to be brave with kittredge in german i didnt feel sufficiently emboldened to tell kittredge my true feelings and actual thoughts i wouldnt have dared to say crushes on the wrong people to kittredge not even in german not unless i pretended it was something goethe or rilke had written i saw that atkins was struggling to say somethingmaybe about what time it was or something with the time word in it but i was wrong it was crushes that poor tom couldnt say atkins suddenly blurted thrushes on the wrong peoplethats a subject that interests me too i said crushes tom i cant say that word atkins admitted but i am very interested in that subject perhaps when youre finished reading whatever novel miss frost gave you on that subject you could give it to me i like to read novels you know its a novel by james baldwin i told atkins its about being in love with a black person atkins asked no what gave you that idea tom james baldwin is black isnt he bill or am i thinking of another baldwin james baldwin was black of course but i didnt know that id not read any of his other books i had never heard of him and giovannis room was a library bookas such it didnt have a dust jacket id not seen an author photo of james baldwin its a novel about a man whos in love with another man i told tom quietly yes atkins whispered thats what i thought it would be about when you first mentioned the wrong people ill let you read it when im finished i said i had finished giovannis room of course but i wanted to read it again and talk to miss frost about it before i let atkins read it though i was certain there was nothing about the narrator being blackand poor giovanni i knew was italian in fact i even remembered that line near the end of the novel when the narrator is looking at himself in a mirrormy body is dull and white and dry but i simply wanted to reread giovannis room right away it had had that profound an effect on me it was the first novel id wanted to reread since great expectations now when im nearly seventy there are few novels i can reread and still lovei mean among those novels i first read and loved when i was a teenagerbut i recently reread great expectations and giovannis room and i admired those novels no less than i ever had oh all right there are passages in dickens that go on too long but so what and who the trannies were in paris in mr baldwins time therewell they were probably not very passable transvestites the narrator of giovannis room doesnt like them i always found it difficult to believe that they ever went to bed with anybody for a man who wanted a woman would certainly have rather had a real one and a man who wanted a man would certainly not want one of them baldwin wrote okay im guessing that mr baldwin never met one of the very passable transsexuals one can meet today he didnt know a donna one of those shemales with breasts and not a trace of facial hairone of those totally convincing females you would swear that there wasnt an iota of anything masculine in the kind of transsexual im talking about except for that fully functioning penith between her legs im also guessing that mr baldwin never wanted a lover with breasts and a cock but believe me i dont fault james baldwin for failing to be attracted to the trannies of his timeles folles he called them all i say is let us leave les folles alone lets just leave them be dont judge them you are not superior to themdont put them down in rereading giovannis room just recently i not only found the novel to be as perfect as id remembered it i also discovered something i had missed or id read without noticing when i was eighteen i mean the part where baldwin writes that people cant unhappily invent their mooring posts their lovers and their friends anymore than they can invent their parents yes thats true naturally when i was eighteen i was still inventing myself nonstop i dont only mean sexually and i was unaware that i needed mooring postsnot to mention how many i would need or who my mooring posts would be poor tom atkins needed a mooring post in the worst way that much was evident to me as atkins and i conversed or we tried to on the subject of crushes or thrushes on the wrong people for a moment it seemed we would never progress from where we stood on the stairs of the music building and that what passed for our conversation had permanently lagged have you had any breakthroughs with your pronunciation problems bill atkins awkwardly asked me just one actually i told him i seem to have conquered the shadow word good for you atkins said sincerely ive not conquered any of minenot in a while anyway im sorry tom i told him it must be tough having trouble with one of those words that comes up all the time like the time word i said yes thats a tough one atkins admitted whats one of your worst ones the word for your whatchamacallit i told him you knowdong schlong dick dork willy dipstick dipping wick quimstuffer i said you cant say penis atkins whispered it comes out penith i told him well at least its comprehensible bill atkins said encouragingly do you have one thats worse than the time word i asked him the female equivalent of your penis atkins answered i cant come close to saying itit just kills me to try it you mean vagina tom atkins nodded vigorously i thought poor tom had that vergeoftears aspect in the way he wouldnt stop nodding his head but mrs hadley saved him from cryingalbeit only momentarily tom atkins martha hadley called down the stairwell i can hear your voice but you are late for your appointment i am waiting for you atkins started to run up the stairs without thinking he gave me a friendly but vaguely embarrassed look over his shoulder i distinctly heard him call to mrs hadley as he continued up the stairs im sorry im coming atkins shouted i just lost track of the time both martha hadley and i had clearly heard him that sounds like a breakthrough to me tom i hollered up the stairs what did you just say tom atkins say it again i heard mrs hadley call down to him time time time i heard atkins crying before his tears engulfed him oh dont cry you silly boy martha hadley was saying tom tomplease stop crying you should be happy but i heard atkins blubbering on and on once the tears started he couldnt stop them i knew the feeling listen to me tom i called up the stairwell youre on a roll man nows the time to try vagina i know you can do it if you can conquer time trust mevagina is easy let me hear you say the vagina word tom vagina vagina vagina watch your language billy mrs hadley called down the stairwell i would have kept up the encouragements to poor tom but i didnt want martha hadleyor another faculty person in the music buildingto give me a restriction i had a datea fucking datewith miss frost so i didnt repeat the vagina word i just went on my way down the stairs all the way out of the music building i could hear tom atkins crying its easy to see with hindsight how i gave myself away i wasnt in the habit of showering and shaving before i went out in the evening to the library while i was in the habit of not saying to richard or my mom which library i was going to i suppose i should have been smart enough to take giovannis room with me i left the novel under my pillow with elaines bra but that was because i wasnt intending to return the book to the library i wanted to lend it to tom atkins but only after id asked miss frost if she thought that was a good idea you look nice billy my mother commented as i was leaving our dormitory apartment she almost never complimented me on my appearance while shed more than once said i was going to be goodlooking she hadnt said that in a couple of years im guessing that i was already too goodlooking in my moms opinion because the way she said the nice word wasnt very nice going to the library bill richard asked me thats right i said it was stupid of me not to take my german homework with me because of kittredge i was almost never without my goethe and my rilke but that night my book bag was practically empty i had one of my writing notebooks with methat was all you look too nice for the library billy my mom said i suppose i cant go around looking like lears shadow can i i asked the two of them i was just showing off but in retrospect it was inadvisable to give my mother and richard abbott a taste of my newfound confidence it was only a little later that same eveningim sure i was still in the yearbook room of the academy librarywhen kittredge showed up at bancroft hall looking for me my mother answered the door to our apartment but when she saw who it was im certain she wouldnt have invited kittredge in richard she no doubt called jacques kittredge is here i was hoping for a word with the german scholar kittredge said charmingly richard my mom would have called again im coming jewel richard would have answered it was a small apartment while my mother wanted nothing to do with talking to kittredge im sure she overheard every word of kittredges conversation with richard if its the german scholar youre looking for jacques im afraid hes gone to the library richard told kittredge which library kittredge asked hes a twolibrary student that german scholar the other night he was hanging out in the town libraryyou know the public one whats billy doing in the public library richard my mom might have asked she would have thought this anyway she would have asked richard later if not while kittredge was still there i guess miss frost is continuing to advise him about what to read richard abbott may have answeredeither then or later i gotta be going kittredge probably said just tell the german scholar that i did pretty well on the quizmy best grade ever tell him he was deadon about the passion brings pain part tell him he even guessed right about the terrifying angeli nailed that part kittredge told richard ill tell him richard would have said to kittredge you got the passion brings pain partyou nailed the terrifying angel too ill be sure to tell him by then my mother would already have found the library book in my bedroom she knew that i kept elaines bra under my pillow ill bet thats the first place she looked richard abbott was a wellinformed guy he may have already heard what giovannis room was about of course my german homeworkthe everpresent goethe and rilkewould have been visible in my bedroom too whatever was preoccupying me in which library it didnt appear to be my german homework and folded in the pages of mr baldwins superb novel would have been my handwritten notesquotations from giovannis room included of course naturally stink of love would have been among my jottings and that sentence i thought of whenever i thought of kittredge with everything in me screaming no yet the sum of me sighed yes kittredge would have been long gone from bancroft by the time richard and my mom drew their conclusions and called the others maybe not mrs hadleythat is not at firstbut certainly my meddlesome aunt muriel and my muchabused uncle bob and of course nana victoria and first sisters most famous female impersonator grandpa harry they must have all drawn their conclusions and even come up with a rudimentary plan while i was still in the process of leaving the old yearbook room by the time their plan of attack took its final form im sure i was already en route to the first sister public library where i arrived shortly before closing time i had a lot on my mind about miss frostespecially after seeing the owl i did my best not to linger over that heartthrob of a boy on the wrestling team there wasnt anyone who arrested my attention in the favorite river academy yearbook of not even among the wrestlers in the drama club photos from and there were some boysasgirls who looked convincingly feminineat least onstagebut i didnt pay very close attention to those photographs and i completely missed miss frost in the wrestlingteam pictures of the and teams when she was in the back row it was the owl that was the shockerwhat would have been miss frosts senior year at favorite river academy in that year miss frosteven as a boywas unmistakable she was seated frontrow center because a frost was noted as the wrestling captain in just the initial a was used in the captions under the team photo even sitting down her long torso made her a head taller than any of the other boys in the front row and i spotted her broad shoulders and big hands as easily as i doubtless would have if shed been dressed and made up as a girl her long pretty face had not changed though her thick hair was cut unfamiliarly short i quickly flipped to the head shots of the graduating seniors to my surprise albert frost was from the town of first sister vermonta day student not a boarderand while the eighteenyearold alberts choice of college or university was cited as undecided the young mans chosen career was revealing albert had designated fictionmost fitting for a future librarian and a handsome boy on his way to becoming a passable albeit smallbreasted woman i guessed that aunt muriel must have remembered albert frost the handsome wrestlingteam captainclass of and that it was as a boy that muriel meant miss frost used to be very goodlooking albert certainly was i was not surprised to see albert frosts nickname at favorite river academy it was big al miss frost hadnt been kidding when shed told me that everyone used to call her alincluding very probably my aunt muriel i was surprised that i recognized another face among the head shots of the graduating seniors in the class of robert fremontmy uncle bobhad graduated in miss frosts class bob whose nickname was racquet man must have known miss frost when she was big al it was one of lifes little coincidences that in the owl robert fremont was on the page opposite albert frost i realized on that short walk from the yearbook room to the first sister public library that everyone in my family which for a few years now included richard abbott had to have known that miss frost had been bornand in all likelihood still wasa man naturally no one had told me that miss frost was a man after all a lack of candor was endemic in my family it occurred to me as i stood looking at my frightened face in that mirror in the dimly lit foyer of the town library where tom atkins had so recently startled himself that almost anyone of a certain age in first sister vermont would have known that miss frost was a man this surely included everyone over the age of forty who had seen miss frost onstage as an ibsen woman in those amateur productions of the first sister players i had subsequently found miss frost in the wrestlingteam photos in the and yearbooks where a frost was not quite so big and broadshouldered in fact shed stood so unsure of herself in the back row of those team photos that i had overlooked her id overlooked her too in the drama club photographs a frost was always cast as a woman shed been onstage in a variety of female roles but wearing such absurd wigs and with breasts so unsuitably big that i had failed to recognize her what a lark that must have been for the boysto see their wrestlingteam captain big al flouncing around onstage pretending to be a girl yet when richard had asked miss frost if shed ever been onstageif shed ever actedshed answered only in my mind what a lot of lies i was thinking as i saw myself shaking in the mirror is someone here i heard miss frost call is that you william she called loudly enough that i knew we were alone in the library yes its me big al i answered oh dear i heard miss frost say with an exaggerated sigh i told you we didnt have much time theres quite a lot you didnt tell me i called to her i saw that in anticipation of my arrival miss frost had already killed the lights in the main library the light that glowed upward from the bottom of the basement stairsthe basement door was openbathed miss frost in a soft flattering light she sat at the checkout desk with her big hands folded in her lap i say the light was flattering because it made her look younger of course that also might have been the influence of my seeing her in those old yearbooks come kiss me william miss frost said theres no reason for you not to kiss me is there youre a man arent you i asked her goodness me what makes a man she asked isnt kittredge a man you want to kiss him dont you still want to kiss me william i did want to kiss her i wanted to do everything with her but i was angry and upset and i knew by the way i was shaking that i was very close to crying which i didnt want to do youre a transsexual i told her my dear boy miss frost said sharply my dear boy please dont put a label on medont make me a category before you get to know me when she stood up from her desk she seemed to tower over me when she opened her arms to me i didnt hesitatei ran to her strong embrace and kissed her miss frost kissed me back very hard i couldnt cry because she took my breath away my mywhat a busy boy youve been william she said leading me to the basement stairs youve read giovannis room havent you twice i managed to say twice already and youve found the time to read those old yearbooks havent you william i knew it wouldnt take you long to get from to was it that wrestlingteam photo in was that the one that caught your eye william yes i scarcely managed to tell her miss frost was lighting the cinnamonscented candle in her bedroom then she turned off the reading lamp that was fastened to the headboard of her brass bed where the covers were already turned down i couldnt very well have kept you from seeing those old yearbookscould i william she went on saying im not welcome in the academy library and if you hadnt seen that picture of me in my wrestling days surely somebody would have told you about meeventually im frankly astonished that someone didnt tell you miss frost said my family doesnt tell me much i told her i was undressing as quickly as i could and miss frost had already unbuttoned her blouse and taken off her skirt this time when she used the toilet she didnt mention the matter of her privacy yes i know about that family of yours she said laughing she hiked up her halfslip andfirst lifting the wooden toilet seatshe peed standing up rather loudly but with her back to me i didnt see her penis but there was no doubt from the forceful way she was pissing that she had one i lay naked on the brass bed and watched her washing her hands and face and brushing her teeth in that little sink i saw her wink at me in the mirror i guess you must have been a pretty good wrestler i said to her if they made you captain of the team i didnt ask to be captain she told me i just kept beating everybodyi beat everyone so they made me captain it wasnt the kind of thing you could refuse oh besides the wrestling kept them all from questioning me miss frost said she was hanging up her skirt and blouse in the wardrobe closet this time she took her bra off too they dont question youi mean sexuallyif youre a wrestler it kind of keeps them off the trackif you know what i mean william i know what you mean i told her i thought that her breasts were wonderfulso small and with such perfect nipples but her breasts were bigger than poor elaines miss frost had a fourteenyearolds breasts and they looked small on her only because she was so big and strong i love your breasts i said to her thank you william they wont get any bigger but its a wonder what hormones can induce i guess i dont really need to have bigger ones miss frost said smiling at me i think theyre the perfect size i told her i assure you i didnt have them when i wrestledthat wouldnt have worked out very well miss frost said i kept wrestlingthus i kept the questions at bay all through college she told me no breastsno living as a woman williamuntil after i was out of college whered you go to college i asked her someplace in pennsylvania she told me its no place youve ever heard of were you as good a wrestler as kittredge i asked her she lay down beside me on the bed but this time when she took my penis in her big hand i was facing her kittredge isnt that good miss frost said he just hasnt had any competition new england isnt exactly a hotbed for wrestling its nothing like pennsylvania oh i touched her halfslip in the area where i thought her penis was she let me touch her i didnt try to reach under the halfslip i just touched her penis through the slinky material of her halfslip this one was a pearlgray color almost the same color as elaines bra when i thought of elaines bra i remembered giovannis room which was under the same pillow the james baldwin novel was so unbearably sad that i suddenly didnt want to talk about it with miss frost instead i asked her wasnt it difficult being a wrestler when you wanted to be a girl and you were attracted to other boys it wasnt that difficult when i was winning i like to be on top she told me when youre winning in wrestling youre on top it was more difficult in pennsylvania because i wasnt winning all the time there i was on the bottom more than i liked she said but i was older theni could handle losing i hated being pinned but i was pinned only twiceby the same fucking guy wrestling was my cover william back then boys like us needed a cover wasnt elaine a cover william she looked like your cover to me miss frost said nowadays dont boys like us still need a little cover yes we do i whispered oh now were whispering again miss frost whispered whispering is a kind of cover too i guess you must have studied something in that college in pennsylvanianot just wrestling i said to her the yearbook said your choice of career was fictionkind of a funny career path isnt it i asked her i believe i was just babbling as a way to distract myself from miss frosts penis in college i studied library science miss frost was saying while we went on holding each others penises hers wasnt as hard as minenot yet anyway i thought that even not hard her penis was bigger than mine but if youre not experienced you cant really estimate the size of someones penisnot if you cant see it i thought that a library would be a fairly safe and forgiving place for a man who was on his way to becoming a woman miss frost continued i even knew which library i wanted to work inthe very same academy library where those old yearbooks are william i thought what other library would appreciate me as much as my old school library id been a good student at favorite river and id been a very good wrestlernot so good by pennsylvania standards maybe but id been very good in new england of course when i came back to first sister as a woman favorite river academy wanted nothing to do with someone like menot around all those impressionable boys everyone is naïve about something william and i was naïve about that i knew my old school had liked me when i was big al i was naïve enough to be unprepared for them not liking me as miss frost it was only because your grandpa harry was on the board of the town librarythis funny old public library where i was way overqualified to be the librarianthat they gave me the job here but why did you want to stay here in first sisteror be at favorite river academy which you say yourself is an awful school i asked her i was only eighteen but i already never wanted to come back to favorite river academy or the podunk town of first sister vermont i couldnt wait to get away to be somewhereto be anywherewhere i could have sex with whomever i wanted to without being stared at and judged by all these overly familiar people who presumed they knew me i have an ailing parent william miss frost explained my father died the year i started at favorite river academy if he hadnt passed away my becoming a woman probably would have killed him but my mother hasnt been healthy for quite some time i barely got through college because of my mothers health problems shes one of those people whos been sick so long that if she ever got well she wouldnt know she was cured shes sick in her mind william she doesnt even notice that im a woman or maybe she doesnt remember that her little boy was ever a man im sure she doesnt remember that she used to have a little boy oh your grandpa harry used to employ my dad harry knew i was the one who took care of my mom thats the only reason i had to come back to first sisterwhether favorite river academy would have me or not william im sorry i said oh its not so bad miss frost replied in that acting way small towns may revile you but they have to keep youthey cant turn you away and i got to meet you william who knows perhaps ill be remembered as the crazy crossdressing librarian who got you started as a writer you have started havent you she asked me but the story of her life so far seemed extraordinarily unhappy to me while i went on touching her penis through that pearlgray halfslip i thought about giovannis room which was all wrapped up in elaines bra under my pillow and i said i loved the james baldwin novel i didnt bring it back to the library because i wanted to lend it to tom atkins he and i have talked about iti think he would love giovannis room too is it all right with you if i lend it to him is giovannis room in your book bag william miss frost asked me suddenly where is the actual book right now its at home i told her i was suddenly afraid to say it was under my pillownot to mention that the novel was in contact with elaine hadleys padded pearlgray bra you mustnt leave that novel at home miss frost told me of course you can lend it to tom but tell tom not to let his roommate see it i dont know who atkins has for a roommate i told her it doesnt matter who toms roommate isjust dont let the roommate see that novel i told you not to let your motheror richard abbottsee it if i were you i wouldnt even let your grandpa harry know you have it grandpa knows i have a crush on kittredge i said to miss frost nobody but you knows i have a crush on you i told her i hope youre right about that william she whispered she bent over me and put my penis in her mouthin less time than it took me to write this sentence yet when i reached under her halfslip for her penis she stopped me nowere not doing that she said i want to do everything i told her of course you do william but youll have to do everything with someone else it is not appropriate for a young man your age to do everything with someone my age miss frost told me i will not be responsible for your first time at trying everything with that she put my penis back in her mouth for the time being she would not explain herself further when she was still sucking me i said i dont think we had actual sex the last timei mean the penetration part we did something else didnt we talking is not very easily accomplished during a blow job william miss frost said sighing in such a waywhile she lay down next to me facetofacethat i got the feeling this was probably curtains for the blow job and it was you seemed to enjoy the something else we did last time william she said oh yes i did i cried i was just wondering about the penetration part you can wonder about it all you want william but there will be no penetration part with me dont you see she asked me suddenly i am trying to protect you from actual sex at least a little miss frost added smiling but i dont want to be protected i cried i will not have actual sex with an eighteenyearold on my conscience william as for who you will become ive probably been of too much influence already miss frost declared she was certainly right about that though she must have imagined she was being more theatrical than propheticand i didnt yet know just how much of an influence on the rest of my life miss frost would be this time she showed me the lotion she usedshe let me smell it on her fingers it had an almond fragrance she didnt straddle me or sit on me we lay sideways with our penises touching i still didnt see her penis but miss frost rubbed her penis and mine together when she rolled over she took my penis between her thighs and pushed her buttocks against my stomach her halfslip was hiked up to her waist i held one of her bare breasts in one hand and her penis in the other miss frost slid my penis between her thighs until i ejaculated into the palm of her hand we seemed to lie in each others arms for the longest time afterward but i realize that we couldnt have been alone like that for nearly as long as i imagined we truly didnt have much time together i think it was because i loved listening to her talk and the sound of her voice that i imagined the time as passing more slowly than it actually did she drew me a bath like the first time but she still wouldnt completely undress and when i suggested that she climb into the big bathtub with me she laughed and said im still trying to protect you william i wouldnt want to risk drowning you i was happy enough that her breasts were bare and that shed let me hold her penis which i still hadnt seen shed gotten harder and bigger in my hand but i had the feeling that even her penis was holding backa little i cant explain this but i felt certain that miss frost was simply not allowing her penis to get any harder or bigger perhaps this was in her mind another way in which she was protecting me does it have a namehaving sex the way we did it i asked it does william can you say the word intercrural she asked me intercrural i replied without hesitating what does it mean im sure youre familiar with the prefix inter in this sense meaning between william miss frost answered as for crural it means of or pertaining to the legbetween the thighs in other words i see i said it was favored by homosexual men in ancient greece or so ive read miss frost explained not a part of my libraryscience studies but i did get to spend a lot of free time in a library what did the ancient greeks like about it i asked her i read this long agoi may have forgotten all the reasons miss frost said the frombehind part maybe but we dont live in ancient greece i reminded miss frost trust me william its possible to have sex intercrurally without exactly imitating the greeks miss frost explained one doesnt always have to do it from behind between the thighs will work sideways or in other positionseven in the missionary position the what i asked her well try it next time william she whispered it might have been in the midst of her quiet whisper when i thought i heard the first creak on the basement stairs either miss frost heard it too or it was merely a coincidence that she took that moment to glance at her watch you told richard and me that youd been onstagethat you had actedonly in your mind but i saw you in those drama club photos youd been onstageyou had acted before i said to her poetic license william miss frost replied with one of her theatrical sighs besides that wasnt acting that was merely dressing upthat was overacting those boys were clownsthey were just fooling around there was no richard abbott at favorite river academy in those days there was no one in charge of the drama club who knew half as much as nils knows and nils borkman is a dramaturgical pedant there was a second creak on the basement stairs which both miss frost and i heard there was no mistaking it this time i was mainly surprised that miss frost seemed so unsurprised in our haste william did we forget to lock the library door she whispered to me oh deari think we did we had so little timeas miss frost knew from the beginning upon the third creak on those basement stairs on that most memorable night in the clearly unlocked first sister public library miss frostwhod been kneeling beside her big bathtub while she thoughtfully attended to my penis and we talked about all sorts of interesting thingsstood up and said in a clarion voice which would have impressed my friend elaine and her voiceteacher mother mrs hadley is that you harry ive been thinking that those cowards would send you it is you isnt it ah wellyes its me i heard grandpa harry say sheepishly from the basement stairs i sat up straight in the bathtub miss frost stood very erect with her shoulders back and her small but pointy breasts aimed at her open bedroom door miss frosts nipples were rather long and her unpronounceable areolae were the intimidating size of silver dollars when my grandfather stepped tentatively into miss frosts basement room he was not the confident character id so often seen onstage he was not a woman with a commanding presence but just a manbald and small grandpa harry had clearly not volunteered to be the one to come and rescue me im disappointed that richard didnt have the balls to come miss frost said to my embarrassed grandfather richard asked to be the one but mary wouldnt let him my grandfather said richard is pussywhipped like all of you men married to those winthrop women miss frost told him my grandfather couldnt look at her with her bare breasts showing but she would not turn away from himnor did she seek her clothes she wore just the pearlgray halfslip in front of him as if it were a formal gown and she had overdressed for the occasion i dont imagine muriel was willing to let bob come miss frost continued grandpa harry just shook his head that bobby is a sweetheart but he was always a pussyeven before he was pussywhipped miss frost went on id never heard uncle bob called bobby but i now knew that robert fremont had been albert frosts classmate at favorite river academy and when youre in a boarding school in those formative years you call one another names you never hear or use again no one calls me nymph anymore for example i was attempting to get out of the bathtub without showing all of myself to my grandpa when miss frost handed me a towel even with the towel it was awkward getting out of the tub and drying myself and trying to put on my clothes let me tell you something about your aunt muriel william miss frost said standing as a barrier between my grandfather and me muriel actually had a crush on mebefore she started hanging out with her first and only beau your uncle bob imagine if i had taken muriel upi mean on her offering herself to me miss frost cried in her best ibsenwoman fashion al please dont be crude grandpa harry said muriel is my daughter after all muriel is a bossy bitch harry it might have made her nicer if shed ever gotten to know me miss frost said theres no pussywhipping me william she said looking at how i was managing to get myself dressedbadly no there isnt ali daresay grandpa harry exclaimed theres no pussywhippin you your grandpa is a good guy william miss frost told me he built this room for me when i first moved back to town my mother thought i was still a man i needed a place to change before i went to work as a womanand before i went home every night to my mother as a man you might say its a blessingat least its easier for methat my poor mom doesnt appear to notice what gender i am or should be anymore i wish you had let me finish this place properly al grandpa harry was saying jeezthere should have been a wall around that toilet anyway he observed its too small a room to have more walls miss frost said this time when she stood at the toilet and flipped up the wooden seat miss frost didnt turn her back on me or on grandpa harry her penis was not even a little hard but she had a pretty big onelike the rest of her except for her breasts come on alyoure a decent fella ive always stood up for you grandpa harry said but this isnt rightyou and bill i mean she was protecting me i blurted out we never had sex no penetration i added jeez billi dont want to hear about you doin it grandpa harry cried he cupped his hands over his ears but we didnt do it i told him that night when richard first brought you here williamwhen you got your library card and richard offered me those roles in the ibsen playsdo you remember miss frost asked me yes of course i remember i whispered richard thought he was offering the part of nora and the part of hedda to a woman it was when he took you home and he must have talked to your momwho talked to muriel im surewell that was when they all told him about me but richard still wanted to cast me those winthrop women had to accept me at least onstageas theyve had to accept you harry when you were just acting isnt that the way it happened she asked my grandfather ah wellonstage is one thing isnt it al grandpa harry asked miss frost youre pussywhipped too harry miss frost told him arent you sick of it come on bill my grandfather said to me we should be goin i always respected you harry miss frost told him i always respected you al my grandfather declared i know you didthats why the craven fuckers sent you miss frost said to him come here william she suddenly commanded me i went to her and she pulled my head to her bare breasts and held me there i knew she could feel me shaking if you want to cry do it in your roombut dont let them hear you she told me if you want to cry close your door and pull your pillow over your head cry with your good friend elaine if you want to williamjust dont cry in front of them promise me i promise you i told her so long harryi did protect him you know miss frost said i believe you did big al ive always protected you you know grandpa harry exclaimed i know you have harry she told him it might not be possible for you to protect me now dont kill yourself trying she added ill do the best i can al i know you will harry goodbye williamor till we meet again as they say miss frost said i was shaking more but i didnt cry grandpa harry took my hand and we went up those dark basement stairs together im guessin that must have been some book miss frost gave you billon that subject we were discussin grandpa harry said as we walked along river street in the direction of bancroft hall yes it is an awfully good novel i told him im thinkin i might like to read it myselfif al will let me grandpa harry said i promised to lend it to a friend i told him then i could give it to you im thinkin i better get it from miss frost billi wouldnt want you to get in trouble for givin it to me i believe youre in enough trouble for the time bein grandpa harry whispered i see i said still holding his hand but i didnt see i was merely scratching the surface of all of them i was just getting started with the seeing part when we got to bancroft the idolatrous boys in the butt room seemed disappointed to see us i suppose they now expected the occasional sighting of the idolized kittredge in my company and here i was with my grandfatherbald and small and dressed in the working clothes of a lumberman grandpa harry was clearly not a faculty type and hed not attended favorite river academy hed gone to the high school in ezra falls and had not gone to college the buttroom boys paid no attention to my grandfather and me im sure grandpa harry didnt care how would those boys have recognized harry anyway those whod ever seen him before had seen harry marshall onstage when hed been a woman you dont have to come up to the third floor with me i told my grandpa if i dont come up with you bill youll be doin the explainin grandpa harry said youve had quite a night alreadywhy dont you leave the explainin to me i love you i began but harry wouldnt let me continue of course you do and i love you too he told me you trust me to say all the right things dont you bill of course i do i told him i did trust him and i was tired i just wanted to go to bed i needed to hold elaines bra to my face and cry in such a way that none of them would hear me but when grandpa harry and i entered that thirdfloor apartment the assembled family gatheringwhich had included mrs hadley i only later learnedhad dispersed my mother was in her bedroom with the door meaningfully closed maybe there would be no further prompting from my mom tonight only richard abbott was there to greet us and he looked about as comfortable as a dog with fleas i went straight to my bedroom without saying a word to richardthat pussywhipped cowardand there was giovannis room on top of my pillow not under it theyd had no right to poke around my bedroom pawing over my stuff i was thinking then i looked under my pillow elaine hadleys pearlgray bra was gone i went back into the living room of our small apartment where i could tell that grandpa harry had not yet started doin the explainin as hed put it to me wheres elaines bra richard i asked my stepfather did my mom take it actually bill your mother was not herself richard told me she destroyed that bra bill im sorry to sayshe cut it up in small pieces jeez grandpa harry began but i interrupted him no richard i said that was mom being herself wasnt it that wasnt mom being not herself thats who mom is ah wellbill grandpa harry chimed in there are more discreet places to put your womens clothes than under your pillowspeakin from experience im disgusted with both of you i said to richard abbott not looking at grandpa harry i didnt mean him and my grandfather knew it im pretty disgusted with all of us bill grandpa harry said now why dont you be goin to bed and let me do the explainin before i could leave them i heard my mother crying in her bedroom she was crying loudly enough for us all to hear her that was the point of her crying loudly of courseso that we would all hear her and richard would go into her bedroom to attend to her which richard did my mom wasnt done prompting i know my mary grandpa harry whispered to me she wants to be in on the explainin part i know her too i told my grandfather but i had much more to learn about my mothermore than i knew i kissed grandpa harry on top of his bald head only then realizing that id grown taller than my diminutive grandfather i went into my bedroom and closed the door i could hear my mom she was still sobbing that was when i resolved that i truly would never cry loudly enough for them to hear me as id promised miss frost there was a bible of knowledge and compassion on the subject of gay love on my pillow but i was too tired and too angry to consult james baldwin any further i would have been better informed if id reread the passage near the end of that slender noveli mean the one about the heart growing cold with the death of love as baldwin writes it is a remarkable process it is far more terrible than anything i have ever read about it more terrible than anything i will ever be able to say if id reread that passage on this terrible night i might have realized miss frost had been saying goodbye to me and what shed meant by the curious till we meet again business was that we would never meet again as lovers perhaps its a good thing i didnt reread the passage then or know all this then i had enough on my mind when i went to bed that nighthearing through my walls my mother manipulatively crying i could vaguely hear grandpa harrys preternaturally high voice too though not what he was saying i knew only that he had begun doin the explainin a process that i also knew had just been seriously jumpstarted inside me from here on i thoughtat the age of eighteen as i lay in bed seethingim the one wholl be doin the explainin chapter double whammy i dont want to overuse the away word and ive already told you how elaine hadley was sent away in stages as in any small town or village where the public coexists with a private school there were towngown matters of disagreement between the townsfolk of first sister vermont and the faculty and administrators of favorite river academyyet not in the case of miss frost who was fired by the board of trustees of the first sister public library grandpa harry was no longer a member of that board had harry even been the board chair it is unlikely that he could have persuaded his fellow citizens to keep miss frost in the transsexual librarians case the higherups at favorite river academy were in agreement with the town the very pillars of the private school and their counterparts in the public community believed they had demonstrated the most commendable tolerance toward miss frost it was miss frost who had gone too far it was miss frost whod overstepped her bounds moral outrage and righteous indignation arent unique to small towns and backward schools and miss frost was not without her champions though it caused him to suffer my mothers silent treatment for several weeks richard abbott took up miss frosts cause richard argued that when faced with an earnest young mans determined infatuation miss frost had actually shielded the young man from the full array of sexual possibilities grandpa harry though it caused him the unbridled scorn of nana victoria also spoke up for miss frost shed shown admirable restraint and sensitivity harry had saidnot to mention the fact that miss frost was a source of inspiration to the readers of first sister even uncle bob risking more vigorous derision from my most indignant aunt muriel said that big al deserved a break martha hadley who continued to counsel me in the aftermath of my forcibly aborted relationship with miss frost said that the transsexual librarian had been a boost to my chronically weak selfconfidence miss frost had even managed to help me overcome a pronunciation problem which mrs hadley claimed was caused by my psychological and sexual insecurity if anyone had ever listened to tom atkins poor tom might have had a good word to say for miss frost but atkinsas miss frost had understoodwas jealous of the alluring librarian and when she was persecuted tom atkins was true to his timid nature and remained silent tom did say to me when hed finished reading giovannis room that the james baldwin novel had both moved and disturbed him though i later learned that atkins had developed a few more pronunciation problems as a result of his stimulating reading not surprisingly the stink word was chief among the culprits perhaps it was counterproductive that the most outspoken of miss frosts defenders was a known eccentric who was foreignborn the grim forester that lunatic logger the norwegian dramaturge with a suicidal streaknone other than nils borkmanpresented himself at a first sister town meeting by declaring he was miss frosts biggest fan it may have undermined borkmans defense of miss frost that nils had been known to beat up various sawmill men and loggers whod made unkind comments about grandpa harrys onstage appearances as a womanespecially those offenders whod objected to harry kissing as a woman in borkmans opinion not only was miss frost an ibsen womanto nils this meant that miss frost was both the best and most complicated kind of woman imaginablebut the obsessed norwegian went so far as to say that miss frost was more of a woman than any woman nils had met in the state of vermont quite possibly the only woman who was not offended by borkmans outrageous assertion had been mrs borkman because nils had met his wife in norway she was not from the green mountain state borkmans wife was little seen and shed been more rarely heard almost no one in first sister could remember what mrs borkman looked like nor could anyone recall if shelike her husband nilsspoke with a norwegian accent yet the damage done by nils was instantaneous hearts were hardened against miss frost she encountered a more entrenched resistance because nils borkman had boasted that she was more of a woman than any woman hed met in vermont not good nilsnot good not good harry marshall had muttered to his old friend at that first sister town meeting but the damage had been done a goodhearted bully is still a bully but nils borkman was resented for other reasons a former biathlete nils had introduced southern vermont to his love of the biathlonthe curious sporting event that entails crosscountry skiing and shooting this was at a time before crosscountry skiing had gained the popularity in the northeastern united states that the sport enjoys now in vermont there already existed a few informed and determined zealots who were crosscountry skiers in those days but no one i knew skied with a loaded rifle on his or her back nils had introduced his business partner harry marshall to hunting deer on crosscountry skis a kind of deerhunting biathlon ensued nils and harry silently skied down and shot a lot of deer there was nothing illegal about it although the local game wardenan unimaginative soulhad complained what the game warden should have complained about simply filled him with a complacent sullenness his name was chuck beebe and he ran a deerchecking stationa socalled biology station where he compiled deer ages and measurements the first saturday of deer season the checking station was overrun with women many of whom if the weather was nice were wearing opentoed shoes the women displayed other signs that they had not been deerhunting but there they werelipstick and halter tops and allpresenting chuck beebe with a stiffened deer caked with congealed blood the women had hunting licenses and theyd been issued deer tags but they had not chuck knew shot these deer their husbands or fathers or brothers or their boyfriends had shot these deer on opening day and those men were now out shooting more deer one deer tag per licensed hunter entitled you to shoot one deer whered you shoot this here buck chuck would ask one woman after another the women would say something like on the mountain or in the woods or in a field grandpa harry made muriel and mary do thisthat is claim that they had killed harrys first two deer of the season nana victoria refused uncle bob had made my cousin gerry do ituntil gerry was old enough to say she wouldnt i had done it for nils borkman on occasionas had the elusive mrs borkman chuck beebe had long accepted this perpetual fiction but that nils borkman and harry marshall hunted deer on skiswell that just struck the game warden as unfair deerhunting regulations were pretty primitive in vermontthey still are shooting deer from a motorized vehicle is not permitted almost anything else goes there is a bow season a rifle season a blackpowder season why not a knife season nils borkman had asked in an earlier nowfamous town meeting why not a slingshot season there are too many deers right we should kill more of them yes nowadays there are also too few hunters their numbers decline each year over the years deerhunting regulations have attempted to address the deerpopulation problem but the overpopulation has endured nevertheless there are townspeople in first sister vermont who remember nils borkman as a raving asshole for proposing a knife season and a slingshot season for deerseven though nils was just kidding of course i remember when you could shoot only buck then buck and doe then buck and just one doethat is if you had a special permit and the buck couldnt be a spikehorn how about we shoot outofstaters no limit nils borkman had once asked limitless shooting of outofstaters might have been a pretty popular proposal in vermont but borkman was just kidding about the outofstaters too nils has a european sense of humor grandpa harry had said in defense of his old friend european nana victoria had exclaimed with scornno with more than scorn my grandmother spoke of borkman being european in a similar manner to how she might have expressed her disgust at nils having dog shit on his shoes but the way nana victoria said the european word was mild in comparison to how derisively she spat out the she word the spittle foaming on her lips whenever she spoke of miss frost you might say that as a result of her not having actual sex with me miss frost was banished from first sister vermont she would like elaine be sent away in stages and the first stage of miss frosts removal from first sister began with her being fired from the library after shed lost her job miss frost could not long afford to maintain her ailing mother in what had been their family home the house would be sold but this took a little time and miss frost made the necessary arrangements to move her mom to that assistedliving facility harry marshall and nils borkman had built for the town it seems likely that grandpa harry and nils probably gave miss frost a special deal but it would not have been a deal of the magnitude of the one that favorite river academy made with mrs kittredgethe deal that permitted kittredge to stay in school and graduate even though he had knocked up a faculty daughter who was underage no one would offer miss frost a deal of that kind when i happened upon aunt muriel she greeted me in her usual insincere fashion oh hi billyhows everything i hope all the normal pursuits of a young man your age are as gratifying to you as they should be to which i would unfailingly respond as follows there was no penetrationno what most people call sex in other words the way i look at it aunt muriel im still a virgin this must have sent muriel running to my mother to complain about my reprehensible behavior as for my mom she was subjecting both richard and me to the silent treatmentnot realizing in my case that i liked it when she didnt speak to me in fact i vastly preferred her not speaking to me to her constant and conventional disapproval furthermore that my mother now had nothing to say to me didnt prevent me from speaking to her first oh hi momhows it going i should tell you that contrary to feeling violated i feel that miss frost was protecting meshe truly prevented me from penetrating her and i hope it goes without saying that she didnt penetrate me i usually didnt get to say more than that before my mother would run into her bedroom and close the door richard she would call forgetting that she was giving richard the silent treatment because hed taken up miss frosts lost cause no what most people call sex momthats what im telling you i would continue saying to her on the other side of her closed bedroom door what miss frost truly did to me amounted to nothing more than a fancy kind of masturbation theres a special name for it and everything but ill spare you the details stop it billystop it stop it stop it my mom would cry i guess she forgot that she was giving me the silent treatment too take it easy bill richard abbott would caution me i think your mom is feeling pretty fragile these days pretty fragile these days i repeated looking straight at himuntil richard looked away trust me on this one william miss frost had said to me when we were holding each others penises once you start repeating what people say to you its a hard habit to break but i didnt want to break that habit it had been her habit and i decided to embrace it im not judging you billy mrs hadley said i can see for myself without you belaboring the details that your experience with miss frost has affected you in certain positive ways belaboring the details i repeated positive ways however billy i feel it is my duty to inform you that in a sexual situation of this awkward kind there is an expectation in the minds of many adults here martha hadley paused so did i i was considering repeating that bit about in a sexual situation of this awkward kind but mrs hadley suddenly continued her arduous train of thought what many adults hope to hear you express billy is something you have not as yet expressed there is an expectation that i will express what i asked her remorse martha hadley said remorse i repeated looking straight at her until mrs hadley looked away the repetition thing is annoying billy martha hadley said yes isnt it i asked her im sorry that theyre making you see dr harlow she told me do you think dr harlow is hoping to hear me express remorse i asked mrs hadley that would be my guess billy she said thank you for telling me i told her atkins was on the musicbuilding stairs again its so very tragic he started last night when i was thinking about it i threw up you were thinking about what i asked him giovannis room he cried wed already discussed the novel but i gathered that poor tom wasnt done that part about the smell of love the stink of love i corrected him the reek of it atkins said gagging its stink tom the stench atkins said vomiting on the stairs jesus tom and that awful woman with the cavernous cunt atkins cried the what i asked him the terrible girlfriendyou know who i mean bill i guess that was the point of it tomhow someone he once desired now turns him off i said they smell like fish you know atkins told me do you mean women i asked him he gagged again then recovered himself i mean their things atkins said their vaginas tom dont say that word poor tom cried retching i have to go tom i told him i have to prepare myself for a little chat with dr harlow talk to kittredge bill theyre always making kittredge have a talk with dr harlow kittredge knows how to handle dr harlow atkins told me i didnt doubt it i just didnt want to talk to kittredge about anything but of course kittredge had heard about miss frost nothing of a sexual nature escaped him if you were a boy at favorite river and you received a restriction kittredge not only knew your crime he knew who had caught you and the terms of confinement your restriction entailed not only was the public library off limits to me i was told not to see miss frostnot that i knew where to find her the whereabouts of the family home shed shared with her mentalcase mother were unknown to me besides that house was for sale for all i knew miss frost and her mom had already moved out i did my homework and what writing i could manage in the yearbook room of the academy library it was always a little before checkin when i passed as quickly as i could through the bancroft hall butt room where both the smoking and the nonsmoking boys seemed uncharacteristically disturbed to see me i suppose that my sexual reputation troubled them whatever convenient pigeonhole theyd put me in might not be the right fit for me now if those boys had heretofore thought of me as a miserable faggot what were they to make of my apparent friendship with kittredge and now there was this story about the transsexual town librarian okay so she was some guy in drag she wasnt a real woman but she presented as a woman maybe more to the point i had acquired an undeniable mystiqueif only to the bancroft buttroom boys dont forget miss frost was an older woman and that goes a long way with boyseven if the older woman has a penis dont forget this too rumors arent interested in the unsensational story rumors dont care whats true the truth was i hadnt had what most people call sexthered been no penetration but those buttroom boys didnt know that nor would they have believed it in the minds of my fellow students at favorite river academy miss frost and i had done everything id climbed the stairs to the second floor of bancroft when kittredge suddenly swept me into his arms at a dead run kittredge carried me up the third flight of stairs and into the hall of the dormitory worshipful boys gaped at us from the open doorways to their rooms i could feel their sad envy a familiar and pathetic longing holy shit nymphyou are the nooky master kittredge whispered in my ear you are the poontang man way to go nymph i am so impressed with youyou are my new hero listen up kittredge called to the gawking boys in the thirdfloor hall and in their doorways while you jerkoffs are beating your meat and only dreaming about getting laid this guy is really doing it you there kittredge suddenly said to a roundfaced underclassman who stood terrorfrozen in the hall his name was trowbridge he was wearing pajamas and he held his toothbrush with a gob of toothpaste already on it as if he hoped the toothbrush were a magic wand im trowbridge the starstruck boy said where are you going trowbridge kittredge asked him im going to brush my teeth trowbridge said in a trembling voice and after that trowbridge kittredge asked the boy no doubt youll soon be pulling your pud imagining your face pressed between a couple of enormous knockers but by his aghast expression i thought it unlikely that trowbridge had yet dared to jerk off in the dormitory he surely had a roommatetrowbridge was probably afraid to beat off in bancroft whereas this young man trowbridge kittredge continued still holding me in his strong arms this young man has not only challenged the public image of gender roles this nooky master this poontang man kittredge cried jouncing me up and down this stud has actually porked a transsexual do you have any idea trowbridge what transsexual snatch even is no trowbridge said in a small voice even holding me in his arms kittredge managed his signature shrug it was his mothers insouciant shrug the one elaine had learned my dear nymph kittredge whispered as he continued to carry me down the hall i am so impressed with you he said again an actual transsexualin vermont of all places ive seen some of course but in parisand in new york the transvestites in paris tend to hang out with one another theyre quite a colorful crowd but you get the feeling that they do everything together i regret ive never tried one kittredge whispered but i have the impression that if you pick up one the others will come along that must be different do you mean les folles i asked him i couldnt stop thinking about les follesscreaming like parrots the details of their latest love affairs as baldwin describes them but either kittredge hadnt heard me or my french accent was so off the mark that he ignored me naturally the transsexuals are another story in new york kittredge continued they strike me as lonersa lot of them are hookers maybe theres one who hangs out on seventh avenueim pretty sure shes a hooker she is really tall i hear theres a club they all go toi dont know where nowhere you want to go by yourself ill bet i think if i were going to try it i would try it in paris but you nymphyouve already done it how was it he asked meseemingly with the utmost sincerity but i knew enough to be careful with kittredge you were never sure where the conversation was headed it was absolutely wonderful i told him i dont imagine ill ever have a sexual experience exactly like it again really kittredge said flatly wed stopped in front of the door to the faculty apartment i shared with my mom and richard abbott but kittredge didnt look the least tired from carrying me and he gave me no indication that he ever intended to put me down i suppose she had a penis kittredge said then and you saw it touched it and did all those things one does with a penisright nymph something in his voice had changed and i was afraid of it to be honest with you i was so caught up in the moment that i kind of lose track of the details i told him do you kittredge softly asked but he didnt seem to care it was as if the details of any sexual adventure were already known to him and he was bored by them for a moment kittredge looked surprised that he was holding meor perhaps repulsed he suddenly put me down you know nymph theyre going to make you talk to harlowyou know that dont you he asked yes i said i was wondering what i should say to him im glad you asked me kittredge said heres how to handle harlow kittredge began there was something oddly soothing and at the same time indifferent in his voice in the way kittredge coached me i felt that our roles had been reversed id been the goethe and rilke expert tutoring him through the tricky parts now here was kittredge tutoring me at favorite river academy when you were caught committing an act of carnal folly you were interrogated by dr harlow kittredge who i presumed had a wealth of experience with carnal acts was an expert at dealing with dr harlow i listened intently to kittredges advice i hung as they say on his every word it was painful to hear at times because kittredge insisted on spelling out for me the details of his sexual misadventure with elaine forgive the specific example nymph but just so you know how harlow operates kittredge would say before launching into his shortterm hearing lossthe result of how loud elaine hadleys orgasms were what harlow wants to hear from you is how sorry you are nymph hes expecting you to repent what you give him instead is nonstop titillation harlow will try to make you feel guilty kittredge told me dont buy into that shit nymphjust pretend youre reciting a pornographic novel i see i said no remorse right no remorse nymphthats exactly right mind you kittredge said in that eerily changed voicethe one i was afraid of mind you nymphi think what youve done is disgusting but i applaud you for having the courage to do it and you absolutely have a right to do it then as suddenly as hed swept me into his arms on the dormitory stairs he was gonehe was disappearing down the thirdfloor hall with those admiring boys in the doorways all watching him run it had been classic kittredge you could be careful but you could never be careful enough with him only kittredge knew where the conversation would end i often had the feeling with him that he knew the end of our conversation before he started it was then that the door to our faculty apartment opened both richard abbott and my mother were standing there as if theyd been standing on the other side of the door for quite a while we heard voices bill richard said i heard kittredges voicei would know his voice anywhere my mother said i looked all around me in the suddenly deserted hall then you must be hearing things i told my mom i heard kittredges voice too billhe sounded rather passionate richard said you should both get your ears checkedhave your hearing tested or something i told them i walked past them into the living room of our apartment i know youre seeing dr harlow tomorrow bill richard said perhaps we should talk about that i know everything im going to say to dr harlow richardin fact the details are pretty fresh i told him you should be careful what you say to dr harlow billy my mother exclaimed what do i have to be careful about i asked her i dont have anything to hidenot anymore just take it easy bill richard started to say but i wouldnt let him finish they didnt kick out kittredge for having sex did they i asked richard are you afraid theyre going to kick me out for not having sex i asked my mother dont be silly my mom started to say then what are you afraid of i asked her one day im going to have all the sex i wantthe way i want it are you afraid of that she didnt answer me but i could see that she was afraid of my having all the sex i wanted the way i wanted it this time richard didnt jump into the conversation he didnt try to help her out as i went to my bedroom and closed the door i was thinking that richard abbott probably knew something i didnt know i lay down on my bed and tried to imagine everything that i might not know it must have been something my mother had kept from me i thought and maybe richard had disapproved of her not telling me that would explain why richard hadnt rushed in to help my mom out of whatever mess shed made for herself richard hadnt even managed to say his usual take it easy bill bullshit later as i was trying to fall asleep i was thinking that if i ever had children i would tell them everything but the everything word only led me to remember the details of my sexual experience with miss frost those details which i would impartin as titillating even in as pornographic a fashion as i could manageto dr harlow in the morning led me next to imagine the sex that i hadnt had with miss frost naturally with all there was to imagine i was awake rather late into the night kittredge had prepared me so well for my meeting with dr harlow that the meeting itself was anticlimactic i simply told the truth i left no detail out i even included the part about my not knowing at first if id had what most people call sex with miss frostif thered been any penetration the penetration word seized dr harlows attention to such a degree that he stopped writing on his pad of lined paper he flat out asked me well was there any penetration the doctor said impatiently in due time i told him you cant rush that part of the story i want to know exactly what happened bill dr harlow exclaimed oh you will i cried excitedly the notknowing is part of the story i dont care about the notknowing part dr harlow declared pointing his pencil at me but i was not about to be rushed the longer i talked the more the baldheaded owlfucker had to listen at favorite river academy we called the faculty and staff we intensely disliked baldheaded owlfuckers the origin of this is obscure if the favorite river yearbook was called the owl im guessing that this hinted at an owls presumed wisdomas expressed in the questionable claim wise as an owl or the equally unprovable wise old owl our stupid sports teams were called the bald eagles which was additionally confusingeagles were not owls the baldheaded reference may indicate the physical appearance of a circumcised penis mr hadley had said oncewhen all the hadleys were having dinner with richard and my mom and me what on earth makes you think so mrs hadley asked her husband i remember that elaine and i were riveted by this conversationmy mothers obvious discomfort with the penis word being part of our enthrallment you see martha the owlfucker part is indicative of the homohating culture of an allboys school mr hadley continued in his historyteacher way the boys call those of us they most detest baldheaded owlfuckers because they are presuming that the very worst of us are homosexual men who diddleor dream of diddlingyoung boys elaine and i howled we thought this was so funny wed never imagined that the expression baldheaded owlfucker actually meant anything but my mother suddenly spoke up its just one of those vulgar things the boys say because theyre always saying vulgar thingsits how they think my mom said bitterly but it originally meant something mary mr hadley had insisted it surely originated for a reason the history teacher had intoned in my deliberate and detailed recounting to dr harlow of my sexual experience with miss frost i very much enjoyed remembering mr hadleys historical speculations concerning what a baldheaded owlfucker actually was dr harlow clearly was one andas i prolonged my discovery that miss frost and i had had an intercrural sexual experiencei admit that i borrowed a few of james baldwins wellchosen words there was no penetration i told dr harlow in due time therefore no stink of love but i so wanted there to be stink of love dr harlow repeated i could see he was writing this down and that he suddenly didnt look well i may never have a better orgasm i told dr harlow but i still want to do everythingall those things miss frost was protecting me from i mean she made me want to do all those thingsin fact i cant wait to do them those homosexual things bill dr harlow asked me through his thinning lusterless hair i could see him sweating yes of course homosexual thingsbut also other things to both men and women i said eagerly both bill dr harlow asked why not i said to the baldheaded owlfucker i was attracted to miss frost when i believed she was a woman when i realized she was a man i was no less attracted to her and are there other people of both sexesat this school and in this townwho also attract you bill dr harlow asked sure why not i said again dr harlow had stopped writing perhaps the task of the opus ahead of him seemed unending students bill the baldheaded owlfucker asked sure i said i closed my eyes for dramatic effect but this had more of an effect on me than id anticipated i suddenly saw myself in kittredges powerful embrace he had me in the armbar but of course there was more to it than that faculty wives dr harlow suggested less than spontaneously i needed only to think of mrs hadleys homely face superimposed again and again on those trainingbra models in my mothers mailorder catalogs why not i asked a third time one faculty wife anyway i added just one dr harlow asked but i could tell that the baldheaded owlfucker wanted to ask me which one at that instant it occurred to me how kittredge would have answered dr harlows insinuating question first of all i looked boredas if i had much more to say but just couldnt be bothered my acting career was almost over i didnt know this at the time when i was the center of attention in dr harlows office but i had only one extremely minor role remaining yet i was able to summon my best imitation of kittredges shrug and grandpa harrys evasions ah well i started to say then i stopped talking instead of speaking i mastered that insouciant shrugthe one kittredge had inherited from his mother the one elaine had learned from mrs kittredge i see bill dr harlow said i doubt that you do i told him i saw the old homohater stiffen you doubt that i do the doctor cried indignantly dr harlow was furiously writing down what id told him trust me on this one dr harlow i said remembering every word that miss frost had spoken to me once you start repeating what people say to you its a hard habit to break that was my meeting with dr harlow who sent a curt note to my mother and richard abbott describing me as a poor prospect for rehabilitation dr harlow didnt elaborate on his evaluation except to say that in his professional estimation my sexual problems were more a matter of attitude than action all i said to my mother was that in my professional estimation the talk with dr harlow had been a great success poor wellmeaning richard abbott attempted to have a friendly têteàtête with me about the meeting what do you think dr harlow meant by your attitude bill dear richard asked me ah well i said to richard pausing only long enough to meaningfully shrug i suppose a visible lack of remorse lies at the heart of it a visible lack of remorse richard repeated trust me on this one richard i began confident that i had miss frosts domineering intonation exactly right once you start repeating what people say to you its a hard habit to break i saw miss frost only two more times on both occasions i was completely unpreparedid not been expecting to see her the sequence of events that led to my graduation from favorite river academy and my departure from first sister vermont unfolded fairly quickly king lear was performed by the drama club before our thanksgiving vacation for a period of time not longer than a week or two richard abbott joined my mother in giving me the silent treatment id clearly hurt richards feelings by not seeing the fall shakespeare play im sure i would have enjoyed grandpa harrys performance in the goneril rolemore than i would have liked seeing kittredge in the dual roles of edgar and poor tom the other poor tomnamely atkinstold me that kittredge had pulled off both parts with a nobleseeming indifference and that grandpa harry had luxuriously indulged in the sheer awfulness of lears eldest daughter how was delacorte i asked atkins delacorte gives me the creeps atkins answered i meant how was he as lears fool tom delacorte wasnt bad bill atkins admitted i just dont know why he always looks like he needs to spit because delacorte does need to spit tom i told atkins it was after thanksgivinghence the wintersports teams had commenced their first practiceswhen i ran into delacorte who was on his way to wrestling practice he had an oozing mat burn on one cheek and a deeply split lower lip he was carrying the oftseen paper cup i noted that delacorte had just one cup which i hoped was not a multipurpose cupthat is for both rinsing and spitting how come you didnt see the play delacorte asked me kittredge said you didnt see it im sorry i missed it i told him ive had a lot of other stuff going on yeah i know delacorte said kittredge told me about it delacorte took a sip of water from the paper cup he rinsed his mouth then spit the water into a dirty snowbank alongside the footpath i heard you were a very good lears fool i told him really delacorte asked he sounded surprised who told you that everybody said so i lied i tried to do all my scenes with the awareness that i was dying delacorte said seriously i see each scene that lears fool is in as a kind of deathinprogress he added thats very interesting im sorry i missed it i told him again oh thats all rightyou probably would have done it better delacorte told me he took another sip of water then spit the water in the snow before he hurried on his way to wrestling practice delacorte suddenly asked me was she pretty i mean the transsexual librarian yes very pretty i answered i have a hard time imagining it delacorte admitted worriedly then he ran on years later when i knew that delacorte was dying i often thought of him playing lears fool as a deathinprogress i really am sorry i missed it oh delacorte how i misjudged youyou were more of a deathinprogress than i ever imagined it was tom atkins who told me that december of how kittredge was telling everyone i was a sexual hero kittredge said that to you tom i asked he says it to everyone atkins told me who knows what kittredge really thinks i said to atkins i was still suffering from the way kittredge had delivered the disgusting word when id least expected it that december the wrestling team had no home matchestheir earliest matches were away at other schoolsbut atkins had expressed his interest in seeing the home wrestling matches with me id earlier resolved to see no more wrestling matchesin part because elaine wasnt around to see the matches with me but also because i was bullshitting myself about trying to boycott kittredge yet atkins was interested in watching the wrestling and his interest had rekindled mine then that christmas of elaine came home the favorite river dormitories had emptied for the christmas break and elaine and i had the deserted campus largely to ourselves i told elaine absolutely everything about miss frost my session with dr harlow had provided me with sufficient storytelling practice and i was eager to make up for those years when id been less than candid with my dear friend elaine she was a good listener and not once did she try to make me feel guilty for not telling her about my various sexual infatuations sooner we were able to speak frankly about kittredge too and i even told elaine that i had once had a crush on her mother that mrs hadley no longer attracted me in that way made it easier for me to tell elaine about it elaine was such a good friend to me that she actually volunteered to be the gobetweenthat is should i want to try to arrange a meeting with miss frost i thought about such a meeting all the time of course but miss frost had so clearly indicated to me her unwavering intentions to say goodbyeher till we meet again had such a businesslike sound to it i couldnt imagine that miss frost had meant anything clandestine or suggestive about how we might manage to meet again i appreciated elaines willingness to be the gobetween but i didnt for a moment delude myself by imagining that miss frost would ever make herself available to me again you have to understand i said to elaine i think miss frost is pretty serious about protecting me as first experiences go billy i think youve had a pretty good one elaine told me except for the interference of my whole fucking family i cried thats just weird elaine said it cant be miss frost theyre all so afraid of surely they didnt believe that miss frost would ever hurt you what do you mean i asked her theres something about you theyre afraid of billy elaine told me that im a homosexual or that im bisexualis that what you mean i asked her because i think theyve already figured that out or at least they suspect it theyre afraid of something you dont know yet billy elaine told me im sick of everybody trying to protect me i shouted that may indeed be miss frosts motive billy elaine said im not so sure about whats motivating your whole fucking family as you say my crude cousin gerry came home from college that same christmas break in gerrys case i use the crude word affectionately please dont dismiss gerry as a stridently angry lesbian who hated her parents and all heterosexuals she had always loathed boys but id foolishly imagined that she might like me a little bit because i knew she would have heard about my scandalous relationship with miss frost yet at least for a few more years gerry wouldnt like gay or bisexual boys any better than she liked straight ones nowadays i hear my friends say that our society tends to be more accepting of gay and bi women than we are of gay and bi men in our familys case there was little apparent reaction to gerry being a lesbian at least compared to almost everyone having a cow about my relationship with miss frostnot to mention my moms horror at how i was turning out sexually yes i know its true that many people treat lesbians and bi women differently than they treat gay and bi men but gerry wasnt accepted by our family as much as she was simply ignored by them uncle bob loved gerry but bob was a coward he loved his daughter in part because she was more courageous than he was i think gerry deliberately misbehaved and not only to build a barrier around herself i think she was aggressive and crude because this forced our family to notice her i had always liked gerry but i kept my fondness for her a secret i wish id told her that i liked heri mean sooner than i did we would become better friends when we were older nowadays were quite close im truly fond of gerryokay in an odd waybut gerry was not very likable when she was a young woman all im saying is that gerry purposely made herself unlikable elaine detested her and would never like hernot even a little that christmas elaine and i were up to our usual but separate pursuits in the yearbook room of the academy library the library was open over the christmas breakexcept for christmas day many of the faculty liked to work there and christmastime was when a lot of prospective students and their parents visited favorite river academy my summer job for the past three years had been as a tour guide i showed prospective students and their parents my awful school i got a parttime job as a tour guide over the christmas break too the boys among the faculty brats frequently did this uncle bob the admissions man was our overly permissive boss elaine and i were in the yearbook room when my cousin gerry found us i hear youre queer gerry said to me ignoring elaine i guess so i said but im attracted to some women too i dont want to know gerry told me no ones sticking anything up my ass or anywhere else you never know till you try it elaine said you might like it gerry i see youre not pregnant gerry said to her unless youre already pregnant again elaine and youre not yet showing you got a girlfriend elaine asked her she could beat the shit out of you elaine gerry said you tooprobably gerry told me i could be forgiving of gerry knowing that muriel was her mother that couldnt have been easy especially for a lesbian i was less inclined to forgive gerry for how harsh she was with her father because i had always liked uncle bob but elaine felt no forgiveness for gerry at all there must have been some history between them maybe gerry had hit on her or when elaine had been pregnant with kittredges child its entirely possible that gerry had said or written something cruel to her my dads looking for you billy gerry said theres a family he wants you to show the school to the kid looks like a bedwetter to me but maybe hes a homo and you can suck each other off in one of the empty dorm rooms jesus youre crass elaine said to gerry i was naïve enough to imagine that college would have civilized youat least to some small degree but i think whatever tasteless culture you acquired from your ezra falls high school experience is the only culture youre capable of acquiring i guess the culture you acquired didnt teach you to keep your thighs together elaine gerry told her why not ask my dad to give you the master key to tilley when youre showing the bedwetter and his parents around gerry asked me that way you and elaine can sneak a look at kittredges room maybe you two jerkoffs can masturbate each other on kittredges bed gerry told us what i mean billy is that you have to have a master key to show someone a dorm room dont you why not get the key to tilley with that gerry left elaine and me in the yearbook room like her mother muriel gerry could be an insensitive bitch butunlike her mothergerry wasnt conventional maybe i admired how angry gerry was i guess your whole fucking familyas you say billytalks about you elaine said they just dont talk to you i guess so i said but i was thinking that aunt muriel and my mother were probably the chief culpritsthat is when it came to talking about me but not to me do you want to see kittredges room in tilley elaine asked me if you do i told her of course i wanted to see kittredges roomand elaine did too i had lost a little of my enthusiasm for perusing the old yearbooks following my discovery that miss frost had been the favorite river wrestlingteam captain in since then i hadnt made much progressnor had elaine elaine was still stuck in the contemporary yearbooks specifically she was held in thrall by what she called the kittredge years she devoted herself to finding photos of the younger more innocentseeming kittredge now that kittredge was in his fifth and final year at favorite river elaine sought out those photographs of him in his freshman and sophomore years yes hed looked younger then the innocentseeming part however was hard to see if one could believe mrs kittredges storyif kittredges own mother had really had sex with him when she said she didkittredge had not been innocent for very long and hed definitely not been innocent by the time he attended favorite river even as a freshmanon the very day kittredge had shown up in first sister vermontkittredge hadnt been innocent it was almost impossible for me to imagine that hed ever been innocent yet elaine kept looking through those earliest photographs for some evidence of kittredges innocence i dont remember the boy gerry had called the bedwetter he was in all likelihood a prepubescent boy probably on his way to becoming straight or gaybut not on his way to becoming bi or so i imagine i dont recall the alleged bedwetters parents either my exchange with uncle bob about the master key to tilley is more memorable sure show em tilleywhy not my easygoing uncle said to me just dont show em kittredges roomits not typical not typical i repeated see for yourself billyjust show em another room uncle bob told me i dont recall whose room i showed to the bedwetter and his parents it was the standard double with two of everythingtwo beds two desks two chests of drawers everyone has a roommate the bedwetters mom asked it was usually the mothers who asked the roommate question yes everyoneno exceptions i said those were the rules whats not typical about kittredges room elaine asked after the visiting family was through their tour well soon see i said uncle bob didnt tell me jesus no one in your family tells you anything billy elaine exclaimed id been thinking the same thing in the yearbook room i was up only to the class of i had twenty years to go before i got to my own graduating class and id just discovered that the yearbook for was missing id skipped from the owl to and before i realized that was gone when i asked the academy librarian about it i said nobody can check out a yearbook the owl for must have been stolen the academy librarian was one of favorite rivers fussy old bachelors everyone thought that such older unmarried males on the favorite river faculty were what we called at that time nonpracticing homosexuals who knew if they were or werent practicing or if they were or were not homosexuals all wed observed was that they lived alone and there was a particular fastidiousness about the way they dressed and the way they ate and spokehence we imagined that they were unnaturally effeminate students may not check out a yearbook billythe faculty can the academy librarian said primly his name was mr lockley the faculty can i repeated yes of course they can mr lockley told me he was looking through some filing cards mr fremont has checked out the owl billy oh mr fremontrobert fremont class of miss frosts classmatewas my uncle bob of course but when i asked bob if he was finished with the owl because i was waiting to have a look at it good old easygoing bob wasnt so easygoing about it im pretty sure i returned that yearbook to the library billy my uncle said he was a good guy basically but a bad liar uncle bob was a fairly forthright fella but i knew he was hanging on to the owl for some unknown reason mr lockley thinks you still have it uncle bob i told him well ill look all around for it billy but i swear i took it back to the library bob said what did you need it for i asked him a member of that class is newly deceased uncle bob replied i wanted to say some nice things about him when i wrote to his family oh poor uncle bob would never be a writer i knew he couldnt make up a story to save his ass what was his name i asked whose name billy bob said in a halfstrangled voice the deceased uncle bob gosh billyi cant for the life of me remember the fellas name oh more fucking secrets elaine said when i told her the story ask gerry to find the yearbook and give it to you gerry hates her parentsshell do it for you i think gerry hates me too i told elaine gerry hates her parents more elaine said wed located the door to kittredges room in tilley and i let us in with the master key uncle bob had given me at first the only not typical thing about the dorm room was how neat it was but neither elaine nor i was surprised to see that kittredge was tidy the one bookshelf had very few books on it there was a lot of room for more books the one desk had very little on it the one chair had no clothes draped over it there were just a couple of framed photographs on top of the lone chest of drawers and the wardrobe closet which typically had no doornot even a curtainrevealed kittredges familiar and expensivelooking clothes not even the solitary single bed had any stray clothes on it and the bed was perfectly madethe sheets and blanket uncreased the pillowcase unwrinkled jesus elaine suddenly said how did the bastard swing a single it was a single room kittredge had no roommatethats what was not typical about it elaine and i speculated that the single room might have been part of the deal mrs kittredge made with the academy when shed told themand mr and mrs hadleythat she would take elaine to europe and get the unfortunate girl a safe abortion it was also possible that kittredge had been an overpowering and abusive roommate perhaps no one had wanted to be kittredges roommate but this struck both elaine and me as unlikely at favorite river academy it would have been prestigious to be kittredges roommate even if he abused you you wouldnt want to give up the honor the single room in combination with kittredges evidently compulsive neatness smacked of privilege kittredge exuded privilege as if hed managed even in utero to create his own sense of entitlement what was most upsetting to elaine about kittredges room was that there was absolutely no evidence in it that hed ever known her maybe shed expected to see a photograph of herself she admitted to me that shed given him several i didnt ask her if shed given kittredge one of her bras but that was because i was hoping to ask her if she would give me another one there were some schoolnewspaper photographs and yearbook photos of kittredge wrestling there were no pictures of girlfriends or exgirlfriends there were no photographs of kittredge as a child if hed ever had a dog there were no pictures of the dog there were no photos of anyone who could have been his father the only picture of mrs kittredge had been taken the one time shed come to favorite river to see her son wrestle the photo must have been taken after the match elaine and i had been at that matchit was the only time i saw mrs kittredge elaine and i didnt remember seeing anyone take a picture of kittredge and his mom at the match but someone had what elaine and i noticed simultaneously was that an unseen handit must have been kittredgeshad cut off mrs kittredges face and glued it to kittredges body there was kittredges mother in kittredges wrestling tights and singlet and there was kittredges handsome face glued to his mothers beautiful and exquisitely tailored body it was a funny photograph but elaine and i didnt laugh about it the truth is kittredges face worked on a womans body with a womans clothes and mrs kittredges face went very well with kittredges wrestlers body in tights and a singlet i suppose its possible i said to elaine that mrs kittredge could have switched the faces in the photograph i didnt really think so but i said it no elaine flatly said only kittredge could have done it that woman has no imagination and no sense of humor if you say so i told my dear friend as ive already told you i wouldnt question elaines authority on the subject of mrs kittredge how could i youd better go to work on gerry and find that yearbook billy elaine told me i did this at our family dinner on christmas daywhen aunt muriel and uncle bob and gerry joined my mom and me and richard abbott at grandpa harrys house on river street nana victoria always made a big todo about the essential and necessary oldfashionedness of christmas dinner it was also a tradition in our family that the borkmans joined us for christmas dinner in my memory christmas was one of the few days of the year i saw mrs borkman at nana victorias insistence we all called her mrs borkman i never knew her first name when i say all i dont mean only the children surprisingly that is how aunt muriel and my mother addressed mrs borkmanand uncle bob and richard abbott when they spoke to the presumed ibsen woman nils had married she had not left nils nor had she shot herself in the temple but we assumed that nils borkman would never have married a woman who wasnt an ibsen woman and we therefore wouldnt have been surprised to learn that mrs borkman had done something dire the borkmans did not have children which indicated to my aunt muriel and nana victoria that there was something amiss or indeed dire in their relationship motherfucking christ gerry said to me on that christmas day isnt it perfectly possible that nils and his wife are too depressed to have kids the prospect of having kids depresses the shit out of me and im neither suicidal nor norwegian on that warmhearted note i decided to introduce gerry to the mysterious subject of the missing owl whichaccording to mr lockleys recordsuncle bob had checked out of the academy library and had not returned i dont know what your dad is doing with that yearbook i told gerry but i want it whats in it gerry asked me some members of our illustrious family dont want me to see whats in it i said to gerry dont sweat it ill find the fucking yearbookim dying to see whats in it myself gerry told me its probably something of a delicate nature i said to her ha gerry cried nothing i get my hands on is of a delicate nature for very long when i repeated what shed said to elaine my dear friend remarked the very idea of having sex with gerry is nauseating to me to me too i almost told elaine but thats not what i said i thought my sexual forecast was cloudy i wasnt at all sure about my sexual future sexual desire is pretty specific i said to elaine and its usually pretty decisive isnt it i guess so elaine answered what do you mean i mean that in the past my sexual desire has been very specificmy attraction to someone very decisive i said to elaine but all that seems to be changing your breasts for examplei love them specifically because theyre yours not just because theyre small those dark parts i tried to tell her the areolae elaine said yes i love those parts and kissing youi love kissing you i told her jesusnow you tell me billy elaine said i only know it nowim changing elaine but im not at all sure how i told her by the way i wonder if you would give me one of your brasmy mother cut up the old one she did elaine cried maybe theres one youve outgrown or youre just tired of it i said to her my stupid breasts grew only a little even when i was pregnant she told me now i think ive stopped growing you can have as many of my bras as you want billy elaine said one night after christmas we were in my bedroomwith the door open of course our parents were seeing a movie together in ezra falls wed been invited to join them but we hadnt wanted to go elaine had just started kissing me and i was fondling her breastsid managed to get one of her breasts out of her brawhen there was a pounding on the apartment door open the fucking door billy my cousin gerry was shouting i know your parents and the hadleys are at a moviemy asshole parents went with them jesusits that awful girl elaine whispered shes got the yearbook ill bet you it hadnt taken gerry long to find the owl uncle bob may have been the one to check it out of the academy library but gerry found the yearbook under her mothers side of the bed it had doubtless been my aunt muriels idea to keep the yearbook of that graduating class away from me or maybe muriel and my mom had cooked up the idea together uncle bob was just doing what those winthrop women had told him to do according to miss frost uncle bob had been a pussy before he was pussywhipped i dont know what the big deal is gerry said handing me the yearbook so its your runaway fathers graduating classso fucking what my dad went to favorite river i asked gerry id known that william francis dean was a harvardboy at fifteen but no one had told me hed gone to favorite river before that he must have met my mother here in first sister i said so fucking what gerry said whats it matter where they met but my mom was older than my dad this meant that william francis dean had been even younger than i thought when they first met if hed graduated from favorite river in and hed been only fifteen when he started his freshman year at harvard in the fall of that same yearhe might have been only twelve or thirteen when they met he could have been a prepubescent boy so fucking what gerry kept saying shed obviously not looked over the yearbook in close detail nor had she seen those earlier yearbooks where there might have been photographs of william francis dean when he was only twelve thirteen and fourteen how had i overlooked him if hed been a fouryear senior in he could have started at favorite river in the fall of when william francis dean would have been only eleven what if my mom had known him then when hed been an elevenyearold their romance such as it was might have been vastly different from the one id imagined did you see anything of the alleged womanizer in him i asked gerry as elaine and i quickly searched through the head shots of the graduating seniors in the class of who said he was a womanizer gerry asked me i thought you did i said or maybe it was something you heard your mother say about him i dont remember the womanizer word gerry told me all i heard about him was that he was kind of a pansy a pansy i repeated jesusthe repetition billy its got to stop elaine said he wasnt a pansy i said indignantly he was a womanizermy mom caught him kissing someone else yeahsome other boy maybe my cousin gerry said thats what i heard anyway and he sure looks like a poofter to me like a poofter i cried my dad said your dad was as flaming a fag as he ever saw gerry said as flaming a fag i repeated dear god billyplease stop it elaine said there he was william francis dean as pretty a boy as id ever seen he could have passed for a girl with a whole lot less effort than miss frost had put into her transformation it was easy to see why i might have missed him in those earlier yearbooks william francis dean looked like me his features were so familiar to me that i must have skipped over him without really seeing him his choice of college or university harvard his career path performer performer i repeated this was before elaine and i had seen any other photographs wed seen only the requisite head shot william francis deans nickname was franny franny i repeated look billyi thought you knew gerry was saying my dad always said it was a double whammy what was i asked her it was a double whammy that you would be queer gerry told me you had grandpa harrys homo genes on the maternal side of your family and on the paternal sidewell shit just look at him gerry said pointing to the picture of the pretty boy in the class of on the paternal side of your frigging gene pool you had flaming franny dean thats a double fucking whammy gerry said no wonder grandpa harry adored the guy flaming franny i repeated i was reading william francis deans abbreviated bio in the owl drama club i had little doubt that franny would have had strictly womens rolesi couldnt wait to see those photos wrestling team manager naturally hed not been a wrestlerjust the manager the guy who made sure the wrestlers had water and oranges and a bucket to spit in and all the handing out and picking up of towels that a wrestlingteam manager has to do genetically speaking billy you were up against a stacked deck gerry was saying my dads not the sharpest saw in the mill but you were dealt the doublewhammy card for sure jesus gerrythats enough for now elaine said would you just leave us please anyone would know youve been making out elaine gerry told her your tits are so smallone of thems fallen out of your bra and you dont even know i love elaines breasts i said to my cousin fuck you gerry for not telling me what i never knew i thought you did know asshole gerry shouted at me shit billyhow could you not know its so fucking obvious how could you be as queer as you are and not know thats not fair gerry elaine was shouting but gerry was gone she left the door to the dormitory hall wide open when she went that was okay with elaine and me we left the apartment shortly after gerry we wanted to get to the academy library while it was still open we wanted to see all the photos we could find of william francis dean in those earlier yearbooks where i had missed him now i knew where to look franny dean would be the prettiest girl in the drama club pictures in the and owl he would be the most effeminatelooking boy in the wrestlingteam photos where he would not be barechested and wearing wrestling tights he would be wearing a jacket and a tie the standard dress code in those years for the wrestlingteam manager before elaine and i went to the old yearbook room in the academy library we took the owl up to the fifth floor of bancroft hall where we hid it in elaines bedroom her parents didnt search through her things elaine had told me she had caught them at it shortly after shed returned from her trip to europe with mrs kittredge elaine suspected them of trying to discover if she was having sex with anyone else after that elaine put condoms everywhere in her room naturally mrs kittredge had given her the condoms perhaps mr and mrs hadley took the condoms as a sign that elaine was being sexually active with an army of boys more likely i knew mrs hadley was smarter than that martha hadley probably knew what the plethora of condoms meant stay the fuck out of my room after that one time mr and mrs hadley did the owl was safe in elaine hadleys bedroom if not in mine elaine and i could look at all the photos of flaming franny dean in that yearbook but we both wanted to see the pictures of the younger william francis dean first we would have the rest of our christmas vacation to learn everything we could about the favorite river class of over that same christmas dinner of when id asked gerry to get me the owl nils borkman had managed a momentwhen we were briefly aloneto confide in me your librarian friendthey are roadrailing her bill borkman whispered harshly to me railroading heryes i said they are stereo sextypes borkman exclaimed sexual stereotypes i asked yesthats what i said the norwegian dramaturge declared its a pityi had the perfect parts for you two the director whispered but of course i cannot put miss frost onstagethe puritan sextypes would stone her or something the perfect parts in what i asked he is the american ibsen nils borkman cried he is the new ibsen from your backward american south who is i asked tennessee williamsthe most important playwright since ibsen borkman reverentially intoned what play is it i asked summer and smoke nils answered trembling the repressed female character has another woman smoldering inside her i see i said that would be the miss frost character miss frost would have been a perfect alma nils cried but now i started to say borkman wouldnt let me finish now i have no choiceits mrs fremont as alma or nobody nils muttered darkly i knew mrs fremont as aunt muriel i think muriel can do repressed i told nils encouragingly but muriel doesnt smolder bill nils whispered no she doesnt i agreed what was my part going to be i asked him its still yours if you want it nils told me its a small roleit wont interfere with your workhome my homework i corrected him yesthats what i said the norwegian dramaturge declared again you play a traveling salesman a young one you make a pass at the alma character in the last scene of the play i make a pass at my aunt muriel you mean i said to the ardent director but not onstagedont worry borkman cried the hankypanky is all imagined the repetitious sexual activity happens later offstage i was pretty sure that nils borkman didnt mean the sexual activity was repetitiousnot even offstage surreptitious sexual activity i asked the director yes but theres no hankypanky with your auntie onstage borkman assured me excitedly it just would have been so symbolic if alma could have been miss frost so suggestive you mean i asked him suggestive and symbolic borkman exclaimed but with muriel we stick to the suggestiveif you know what i mean maybe i could read the play firsti dont even know my characters name i said to nils i have a copy for you borkman whispered the paperback was badly beaten upthe pages had come unglued from the binding as if the excitable director had read the little book to death your name is archie kramer bill borkman informed me the young salesman is supposed to wear a derby hat but in your case we can pissdense with the derby dispense with the derby i repeated as a salesman what do i sell shoes nils told me in the end youre taking alma on a date to a casinoyou have the last line in the play bill which is i asked the director taxi borkman shouted suddenly we were no longer alone the christmasdinner crowd was startled by nils borkman shouting for a taxi my mother and richard abbott were staring at the paperback copy of tennessee williamss summer and smoke which i held in my hands no doubt they feared it was a sequel to giovannis room you want a taxi nils grandpa harry asked his old friend didnt you come in your own car its all right harrybill and i were just shoptalking nils explained to his colleague that would be talkin shop nils grandpa harry said what part does grandpa harry have i asked the norwegian dramaturge you havent offered me a part in anything nils grandpa harry said well i was about to borkman cried your grandfather would be a brilliant mrs winemilleralmas mother the wily director said to me if you do it ill do it i said to grandpa harry it would be the spring production for the first sister players the premiere of a serious drama in the springmy last onstage performance before my departure from first sister and that summer in europe with tom atkins it would not be for richard abbott and the drama club but i would sing my swan song for nils borkman and the first sister playersthe last time my mother would have the occasion to prompt me i liked the idea of it alreadyeven before i read the play id only glanced at the title page where tennessee williams had included an epigraph from rilke the rilke was good enough for me who if i were to cry out would hear me among the angelic orders it seemed that everywhere i looked i just kept happening upon rilkes terrifying angels i wondered if kittredge knew the german okay billif you do it ill do it grandpa harry said we shook on it later i found a discreet way to ask nils if hed already signed up aunt muriel and richard abbott in the alma and john roles dont worry bill borkman told me i have muriel and richard in my pocketback in your back pocketyes i said to the crafty deerstalker on skis that christmastime night when elaine and i ran across the deserted favorite river campus to the academy libraryon our eager way to the old yearbook roomwe saw the crosscountry ski tracks crisscrossing the campus there was good deerhunting on the academy crosscountry course and the outer athletic fields when the favorite river students had gone home for christmas vacation it being christmas break i did not necessarily expect to see mr lockley at the checkout desk of the academy library but there he wasas if it were a working night or perhaps the alleged nonpracticing homosexual as mr lockley was called behind his back had nothing else to do no luck with uncle bob finding the owl huh i asked him mr fremont believes he returned it but he did notthat is not to my knowledge mr lockley stiffly replied ill just keep bugging him about it i said you do that billy mr lockley said sternly mr fremont does not often frequent the library ill bet he doesnt i said smiling mr lockley did not smilecertainly not at elaine anyway he was one of those older men who lived alone he would not take kindly to the coming two decadesby which time most if not all of the allboys boarding schools in new england would finally become coeducational in my estimation coeducation would have a humanizing effect on those boarding schools elaine and i could testify that boys treat other boys better when there are girls around and the girls are not as mean to one another in the presence of boys i know i knowthere are those diehards who maintain that singlesex education was more rigorous or less distracting and that coeducation came with a costa loss of purity ive heard the mr lockleys of the boardingschool world argue less concentration on academics they usually mean that christmastime night all mr lockley could manage to direct to elaine was a minimally cordial bowas if he were saying the unutterable good evening knockedup faculty daughter how are you managing now you smelly little slut but elaine and i went about our business paying no attention to mr lockley we were alone in the yearbook roomand more alone than usual in the otherwise abandoned academy library those old owls from and beckoned us and we soon found much to marvel about in their revealing pages william francis dean was a smiling little boy in the owl when he would have been twelve he seemed a charmingly elfin manager of the wrestling team and the only other evidence elaine and i could find of him was as the prettiest little girl in the drama club photos of that longago academic yeara scant five years before i would be born if franny dean had met the older mary marshall in there was no record of it in the owl of that yearnor was there any record of their meeting in the and owls wherein the wrestlingteam manager grew only a little in stature but seemingly a lot in selfassurance onstage for the drama club in those and yearbooks elaine and i could tell that the future harvardboy whod chosen performer as his career path had developed into a most fetching femme fatalehe was a nymphlike presence he was goodlooking wasnt he i asked elaine he looks like you billyhes handsome but different elaine said he already must have been dating my mother i said when wed finished with the owl and were hurrying back to bancroft hall my dad was fifteen when my mom was nineteen if dating is the right word billy elaine said what do you mean i asked you have to talk to your grandpa billyif you can get him alone elaine told me i could try talking to uncle bob first if i can get bob alone bob isnt as smart as grandpa harry i said ive got it elaine suddenly said you talk to the admissions man first but you tell him youve already talked to grandpa harryand that harry has told you everything he knows bobs not that dumb i told elaine yes he is elaine said we had about an hour alone in elaines fifthfloor bedroom before mr and mrs hadley came home from the movie in ezra falls it being the christmas holiday we figured that the hadleys and my mother and richardtogether with aunt muriel and uncle bobwould have stopped for a drink somewhere after the movie and they had wed had more than enough time to peruse the owl and look at all the photos of flaming franny deanthe prettiest boy in the class william francis dean was a crossdressing knockout in the photos from the drama club of that year and thereat last at the senior dancewas the missing picture elaine and i had so fervently sought there was little franny holding my mom mary marshall in a slowdancing embrace watching them with evident disapproval was bigsister muriel oh those winthrop girls those winthrop women as miss frost had labeled my mother and my aunt murielgiving them nana victorias maiden name of winthrop when it came to who had the balls in the marshall family the winthrop genes were definitely the ballcarriers i wouldnt wait long to trap uncle bob the very next day a prospective student and his parents were visiting favorite river academy uncle bob gave me a call and asked if i felt like being a tour guide when id finished the tour i found uncle bob alone in the admissions office it being christmas break the secretaries werent necessarily working whats up billy uncle bob asked me i guess you forgot that you actually did take the owl back to the library i began i did uncle bob asked i could see he was wondering how he would ever explain this to muriel it didnt show up in the yearbook room by itself i said besides grandpa harry has told me all about flaming franny dean and what a pretty boy he was what i dont get is how it all began with my momi mean why and when i mean how did it start in the first place franny wasnt a bad guy billy uncle bob quickly said he was just a little light in his loafers if you know what i mean id heard the expressionfrom kittredge of coursebut all i said was why did my mom ever fall for him in the first place how did it start he was an awfully young boy when he met your mothershe was four years older which is a big difference at that age billy uncle bob said your mom saw him in a playas a girl of course afterward he complimented her clothes her clothes i repeated it seems he liked girls clotheshe liked trying them on billy uncle bob said oh your grandmother found them in your moms bedroomone day after your mother had come home from the high school in ezra falls your mom and franny dean were trying on your moms clothes it was just a childish game but your aunt muriel told me franny had tried on her clothes too the next thing we knew mary had a crush on him but by then franny must have known he liked boys better he was genuinely fond of your mom billy but he mainly liked her clothes she still managed to get pregnant i pointed out you dont get a girl pregnant by fucking her clothes think about it billythere was all this dressing and undressing going on uncle bob said they must have been in their underwear a lotyou know i have trouble imagining it i told him your grandpa thought the world of franny dean billyi think harry believed it could work uncle bob said dont forget your mother was always a little immature a little simpleminded do you mean i interrupted him when franny was a young boy i think your mom sort of managed himyou know billy she could kind of boss him around a little but then franny grew up i said there was also the guythe one franny met in the war and they reconnected later uncle bob began it was you who told me that storywasnt it uncle bob i asked you know the toiletseat skipper the man on the shiphe lost control of madame bovary he went sliding over the toilet seats later they met on the mta the guy got on at the kendall square stationhe got off at central squareand he said to my dad hi im bovary remember me i mean that guy you told me that storydidnt you uncle bob no i didnt billy uncle bob said your dad himself told you that story and that guy didnt get off at the central square stationthat guy stayed on the train billy your father and that guy were a couple they may still be a couple for all i know uncle bob told me i thought your grandfather told you everything he added suspiciously it looks like theres more to ask grandpa harry about i told uncle bob the admissions man was staring sadly at the floor of his office did you have a good tour billy he asked me a little absently did that boy strike you as a promising candidate of course i had no memory of the prospective student or his parents thanks for everything uncle bob i said to him i really did like him and i felt sorry for him i think youre a good fella i called to him as i ran out of the admissions office i knew where grandpa harry was it was a workday so he wouldnt be at home under nana victorias thumb harry marshall didnt get a schoolteachers christmas break i knew that grandpa harry was at the sawmill and the lumberyard where i soon found him i told him id seen my father in the favorite river academy yearbooks i said that uncle bob had confessed everything he knew about flaming franny dean the effeminate crossdressing boy whod once tried on my mothers clotheseven id heard my aunt muriels clothes but what was this id heard about my dad actually visiting mewhen i was sick with scarlet fever wasnt it and how was it possible that my father had actually told me that story of the soldier he met in the head of the liberty ship during an atlantic winter storm the transport ship had just hit the open seasthe convoy was on its way to italy from hampton roads virginia port of embarkationwhen my dad made the acquaintance of a toiletseat skipper who was reading madame bovary who the hell was that fella i asked grandpa harry that would be the someone else your mom saw franny kissin bill grandpa harry told me you had scarlet fever bill your dad heard you were sick and he wanted to see you i suspect knowin franny he wanted to get a look at richard abbott too grandpa harry said franny just wanted to know you were in good hands i guess franny wasnt a bad guy billhe just wasnt really a guy and nobody told me i said ah welli dont think any of us is proud of that bill grandpa harry exclaimed thats just how such things work out i think your mom was hurt poor mary just never understood the dressinup partshe thought it was somethin franny would outgrow i guess and what about the madame bovary guy i asked my grandfather ah welltheres people you meet bill grandpa harry said some of em are merely encounters nothin more but occasionally theres a loveofyourlife meetin and thats differentyou know i had only two times left when i would see miss frost i didnt know about the longlasting effects of a loveofyourlife meetinnot yet chapter one move the nexttolast time i saw miss frost was at a wrestling matcha dual meet at favorite river academy in january it was the first home meet of the season tom atkins and i went together the wrestling roomat one time it was the only gym on the favorite river campuswas an ancient brick building attached to the more modern bigger gym by an enclosed but unheated cement catwalk the old gym was encircled by a wooden running track which hung over the wrestling room the track sloped downward at the four corners the student spectators sat on the wooden track with their arms resting on the center bar of the iron railing on this particular saturday tom atkins and i were among them peering down at the wrestlers below the mat the scorers table and the two team benches took up most of the gym floor at one end of the wrestling room was a slanted rectangle of bleachers with not more than a dozen rows of seats the students considered the bleachers to be appropriate seating for the older types faculty spectators sat there and visiting parents there were some townspeople who regularly attended the wrestling matches and they sat in the bleachers the day elaine and i had seen mrs kittredge watch her son wrestle mrs kittredge had sat in the bleacherswhile elaine and i had closely observed her from the sloped wooden running track above her i was remembering my one and only sighting of mrs kittredge when tom atkins and i noticed miss frost she was sitting in the first row of the bleacher seats as close to the wrestling mat as she could get mrs kittredge had sat in the back row of the bleachers as if to signify her immortalseeming aloofness from the grunting and grimacing of human combat look whos here billin the first row do you see her atkins asked me i know tomi see her i said i instantly wondered if miss frost often or always attended the wrestling matches if shed been a frequent spectator at the home meets how had elaine and i missed seeing her miss frost was not only tall and broadshouldered as a woman it wasnt just her size that was imposing if shed frequently had a frontrow seat at the wrestling matches how could anyone have missed seeing her miss frost seemed very much at home where she wasat the edge of the wrestling mat watching the wrestlers warm up i doubted that shed spotted tom atkins and me because she didnt glance up at the surrounding running trackeven during the warmups and once the competition started didnt everyone watch the wrestlers on the mat because delacorte was a lightweight he wrestled in one of the first matches if delacorte had played lears fool as a deathinprogress that was certainly the way he wrestled it was agonizing to watch him delacorte managed to make a wrestling match resemble a deathinprogress the weightcutting took a toll on him he was so sucked downhe was all loose skin and superprominent bones delacorte looked as if he were starving to death he was noticeably taller than most of his opponents he often outscored them in the first period and he was usually leading at the end of the second period when he began to tire the third period was delacortes time to pay for the weightcutting delacorte finished every wrestling match desperately trying to protect an everdiminishing lead he stalled he fled the mat his opponents hands appeared to grow heavy on him delacortes head hung down and his tongue lolled out a corner of his open mouth according to kittredge delacorte ran out of gas every third period a wrestling match was always a couple of minutes too long for him hang on delacorte one of the student spectators inevitably cried soon all of us would echo this plea hang on hang on hang on at this point in delacortes matches elaine and i had learned to look at favorite rivers wrestling coacha toughlooking old geezer with cauliflower ears and a crooked nose almost everyone called coach hoyt by his first name which was herm when delacorte was dying in the third period herm hoyt predictably took a towel from a stack at the end of the wrestlingteam bench nearest the scorers table coach hoyt unfailingly sat next to the towels as near as he could get to the scorers table as delacorte tried to hang on a little longer herm unfolded the towel he was bowlegged in that way a lot of old wrestlers are and when he stood up from the team bench he for just a moment looked like he wanted to strangle the dying delacorte with the towel which herm instead put over his own head coach hoyt wore the towel as if it were a hood he peered out from under the towel at delacortes final expiring momentsat the clock on the scorers table at the ref who in the waning seconds of the third period usually first warned delacorte and then penalized him for stalling while delacorte died which i found unbearable to watch i looked instead at herm hoyt who seemed to be dying of both anger and empathy under the towel naturally i advised tom atkins to keep his eyes on the old coach instead of enduring delacortes agonies because herm hoyt knew before anyone else including delacorte whether delacorte would hang on and win or finish dying and lose this saturday following his neardeath experience delacorte actually hung on and won he came off the mat and collapsed into herm hoyts arms the old coach did as he always did with delacortewin or lose herm covered delacortes head with the towel and delacorte staggered to the team bench where he sat sobbing and gasping for breath under the allconcealing mantle for once delacorte isnt rinsing or spitting atkins sarcastically observed but i was watching miss frost who suddenly looked at me and smiled it was an unselfconscious smileaccompanied by a spontaneous little wave just the wiggling of her fingers on one hand i instantly knew miss frost had known all along that i was there and shed expected that i would be i was so completely undone by her smile and the wave that i feared i would faint and slip under the railing i foresaw myself falling from the wooden track to the wrestling room below in all likelihood it wouldnt have been a lifethreatening fall the running track was not at a great height above the gym floor it just would have been humiliating to fall in a heap on the wrestling mat or to land on one or more of the wrestlers i dont feel well tom i said to atkins im a little dizzy ive got you bill atkins said putting his arm around me just dont look down for a minute i kept looking at the far end of the gym where the bleachers were but miss frost had returned her attention to the wrestling another match had started while delacorte was still wracked by sobs and gaspshis head was bobbing up and down under the consoling towel coach herm hoyt had sat back down on the team bench next to the stack of clean towels i saw kittredge who was beginning to loosen up he was standing behind the bench just bouncing on the balls of his feet and turning his head from side to side kittredge was stretching his neck but he never stopped looking at miss frost im okay tom i said but the weight of his arm rested on the back of my neck for a few seconds more i counted to five to myself before atkins took his arm from around my shoulders we should think about going to europe together i told atkins but i still watched kittredge who was skipping rope kittredge couldnt take his eyes off miss frost he continued to stare at her skipping rhythmically the speed of the jump rope never changing look whos captivated by her now bill atkins said petulantly i know tomi see him i said was it my worst fear or was it secretly thrillingto imagine kittredge and miss frost together we would go to europe this summeris that what you mean bill atkins asked me why not i replied as casually as i couldi was still watching kittredge if your parents approve and mine dowe could ask them couldnt we atkins said its in our hands tomwe have to make them understand its a priority i told him shes looking at you bill atkins said breathlessly when i glanced as casually as i could at miss frost she was smiling at me again she put her index and middle fingers to her lips and kissed them before i could blow her a kiss she was once more watching the wrestling boy did that get kittredges attention tom atkins said excitedly i kept looking at miss frost but only for a moment i didnt need atkins to tell me in order to know that kittredge was looking at me bill kittredge is atkins began i know tom i told him i let my gaze linger on miss frost a little longer before i glancedas if accidentallyat kittredge hed stopped jumping rope and was staring at me i just smiled at him as unmeaningfully as id ever managed to smile at him and kittredge began to skip rope again he had picked up the pace either consciously or unconsciously but he was once again staring at miss frost i couldnt help wonder if kittredge was reconsidering the disgusting word perhaps the everything that kittredge imagined id done with miss frost didnt disgust him anymore or was this wishful thinking the atmosphere in the wrestling room changed abruptly when kittredges match began both team benches viewed the mauling with a clinical appreciation kittredge usually beat up his opponents before he pinned them it was confusing for a nonwrestler like myself to differentiate among the displays of kittredges technical expertise his athleticism and the brute force of his physical superiority kittredge thoroughly dominated an opponent before pinning him there was always a moment in the third and final period when kittredge glanced at the clock on the scorers table at that moment the home crowd began chanting pin pin pin by then the torturing had gone on for so long that i imagined kittredges opponent was hoping to be pinned moments later when the referee signaled the fall the pin seemed both overdue and merciful id never seen kittredge lose i hadnt once seen him challenged i dont remember the remaining matches that saturday afternoon or which team won the dual meet the rest of the competition is clouded in my memory by kittredges nearly constant staring at miss frost which continued long after his matchkittredge interrupting his fixed gaze only with cursory and occasional glances at me i of course continued to look back and forth between kittredge and miss frost it was the first time i could see both of them in the same place and i admit i was deeply disturbed about that imagined split second when miss frost would look at kittredge she didntnot once she continued to watch the wrestling and albeit briefly to smile at mewhile the entire time tom atkins kept asking do you want to leave bill if this is uncomfortable for you we should just leavei would go with you you know im fine tomi want to stay i kept telling him europewell i never imagined i would see europe atkins at one point exclaimed i wonder where in europe and how we would travel by train i supposeby bus maybe i wish i knew what we would need for clothes it will be summer tomwell need summer clothes i told him yes but how formal or notthats what i mean bill and how much money would we need i truly have no idea atkins said in a panicky voice well ask someone i said lots of people have been to europe dont ask kittredge bill atkins continued in his panicstricken mode im sure we couldnt afford any of the places kittredge goes or the hotels he stays in besides we dont want kittredge to know were going to europe togetherdo we stop blithering tom i told him i saw that delacorte had emerged from under the towel he appeared to be breathing normally paper cup in hand kittredge said something to him and delacorte instantly started to stare at miss frost delacorte gives me the atkins began i know tom i told him i realized that the wrestlingteam manager was a servile furtivelooking boy in glasses id not noticed him before he handed kittredge an orange cut in quarters kittredge took the orange without looking at the manager or saying anything to him the managers name was merryweather with a last name like that as you might imagine no one ever called him by his first name merryweather handed delacorte a clean paper cup delacorte gave merryweather the old spatin cup which merryweather dropped in the spit bucket kittredge was eating the orange while he and delacorte stared at miss frost i watched merryweather who was gathering up the used and discarded towels i was trying to imagine my father franny dean doing the things a wrestlingteam manager does i must say billyoure rather remote for someone whos just asked me to spend a summer in europe with him atkins said tearfully rather remote i repeated i was beginning to regret that id asked tom atkins to go to europe with me for a whole summer his neediness was already irritating me but suddenly the wrestling was over the student spectators were filing down the corrugatediron stairs which led from the running track to the gym floor parents and facultyand the other adult spectators from the bleacher seatswere milling around on the wrestling mat where the wrestlers were talking to their families and friends youre not going to speak to her are you bill i thought you werent allowed atkins was fretting i must have wanted to see what might happen if i accidentally bumped into miss frostif i just said hi or something elaine and i used to mill around on the wrestling mat after wed watched kittredge wrestleprobably hoping and fearing that we would bump into kittredge accidentally it was not hard to spot miss frost in the crowd she was so tall and erect and tom atkins was whispering beside me with the nervous constancy of a bird dog there she is billover there do you see her i see her tom i dont see kittredge atkins said worriedly i knew that kittredges timing was not to be doubted when i had made my way to where miss frost was standing not coincidentally in the intimidating center of that starting circle on the wrestling mat i found myself stopping in front of her at the very instant kittredge materialized beside me miss frost probably realized that i couldnt speak atkins whod been blathering compulsively was now struck speechless by the awkward gravity of the moment smiling at miss frost kittredgewho was never at a loss for wordssaid to me arent you going to introduce me to your friend nymph miss frost continued smiling at me she did not look at kittredge when she spoke to him i know you onstage master kittredgeon this stage too miss frost said pointing a long finger at the wrestling mat her nail polish was a new color to memagenta maybe more purplish than red but tom atkins will have to introduce us william and i she said not once looking away from me as she spoke are not permitted to speak to each other or otherwise engage im sorry i didnt kittredge started to say but he was interrupted miss frost this is jacques kittredgejacques this is miss frost atkins blurted out miss frost is a great reader atkins told kittredge poor tom then considered what options remained for him miss frost had only tentatively extended her hand in kittredges direction because she kept looking at me kittredge was perhaps unsure if she was offering her hand to him or to me kittredge is our best wrestler tom atkins forged ahead as if miss frost had no idea who kittredge was this will be his third undefeated seasonthat is if he remains undefeated atkins bumbled on it will be a school recordthree undefeated seasons wont it atkins asked kittredge uncertainly actually kittredge said smiling at miss frost i can only tie the school record if i remain undefeated some stud did it in the thirties kittredge said of course there was no new england tournament back then i dont suppose they wrestled as many matches as we do today and who knows how tough their competition was miss frost stopped him it wasnt bad she said with a disarming shrug by how perfectly shed captured kittredges shrug i suddenly realized for how long and how closely miss frost had been observing him whos the studwhose record is it tom atkins asked kittredge of course i knew by the way kittredge answered that he had no idea whose record he was trying to tie some guy named al frost kittredge said dismissively i feared the worst from tom atkins nonstop crying explosive vomiting insane and incomprehensible repetition of the vagina word but atkins was mute and twitching hows it goin al coach hoyt asked miss frost his battered head came up to her collarbones miss frost affectionately put her magentapainted hand on the back of the old coachs neck pulling his face to her small but very noticeable breasts delacorte would explain to me later that wrestlers called this a collartie how are you herm miss frost said fondly to her former coach oh im hangin in there al herm hoyt said an errant towel protruded from one of the side pockets of his rumpled sports jacket his tie was askew and the top button of his shirt was unbuttoned with his wrestlers neck herm hoyt could never button that top button we were talking about al frost and the school record kittredge explained to his coach but kittredge continued to smile at miss frost all coach hoyt will ever say about frost is that he was pretty goodof course thats what herm says about a guy whos very good or pretty good kittredge was explaining to miss frost then he said to her i dont suppose you ever saw frost wrestle i dont think that herm hoyts sudden and obvious discomfort gave it away i honestly believe that kittredge realized who al frost was in the split second that followed his asking miss frost if shed ever seen frost wrestle it was the same split second when i saw kittredge look at miss frosts hands it wasnt the nail polish he was noticing alal frost miss frost said this time she unambiguously extended her hand to kittredge only then did she look at him i knew that look it was the penetrating way shed once looked at mewhen i was fifteen and i wanted to reread great expectations both tom atkins and i noticed how small kittredges hand looked in miss frosts grip of course we werentwe arent i should sayin the same weightclass miss frost said to kittredge big al was my oneseventysevenpounder herm hoyt was telling kittredge you were a little light to wrestle heavyweight al but i started you at heavyweight a couple of timesyou kept askin me to let you wrestle the big guys i was pretty goodjust pretty good miss frost told kittredge at least they didnt think i was very goodnot when i got to pennsylvania both atkins and i saw that kittredge couldnt speak the handshaking part was over but either kittredge couldnt let go of miss frosts hand or she didnt let him let go miss frost had lost a lot of muscle mass since her wrestling days yet with the hormones shed been taking im sure her hips were bigger than when she used to weigh in at pounds in her forties im guessing miss frost weighed or pounds but she was six feet twoin heels shed told me she was about sixfourand she carried the weight well she didnt look like a pounder jacques kittredge was a pounder im estimating that kittredges natural weightwhen it wasnt wrestling seasonwas around pounds he was fiveeleven and a bit kittredge had once told elaine that hed just missed being a sixfooter coach hoyt must have seen how unnerved kittredge wasthis was so uncharacteristicnot to mention the prolonged handholding between kittredge and miss frost which was making atkins breathe irregularly herm hoyt began to ramble his impromptu dissertation on wrestling history filled the void our suddenly halted conversation with an odd combination of nervousness and nostalgia in your day al i was just thinkin you wore nothin but tightseveryone was barechested dontcha remember the old coach asked his former pounder i most certainly do herm miss frost replied she released kittredges hand with her long fingers miss frost straightened her cardigan which was open over her fitted blousethe barechested word having drawn kittredges attention to her girlish breasts tom atkins was wheezing id not been told that atkins suffered from asthma in addition to his pronunciation problems perhaps poor tom was merely hyperventilating in lieu of bursting into tears we started wearin the singlets and the tights in if you remember jacques herm hoyt said but kittredge had not recovered the ability to speak he managed only a disheartened nod the singlets and the tights are redundant miss frost said she was examining her nail polish disapprovingly as if someone else had chosen the color it should either be just a singlet and no tights or you wear only tights and youre barechested miss frost said personally she added in a staged aside to the silent kittredge i prefer to be barechested one day it will be just a singletno tights ill bet ya the old coach predicted no bare chests allowed pity miss frost said with a theatrical sigh atkins emitted a choking sound hed spotted the scowling dr harlow maybe a halfsecond before i saw the baldheaded owlfucker i had my doubts that dr harlow was a wrestling fanat least elaine and i had never noticed him when wed watched kittredge wrestle before but why would we have paid any attention to dr harlow then this is strictly forbidden billtheres to be no contact between you two dr harlow said he didnt look at miss frost the you two was as close as dr harlow could come to saying her name miss frost and i havent said a word to each other i told the baldheaded owlfucker theres to be no contact bill dr harlow sputtered he still wouldnt look at miss frost what contact miss frost said sharply her big hand gripped the doctors shoulder causing dr harlow to spring away from her the only contact ive had is with young kittredge here miss frost told dr harlow she now put both her hands on kittredges shoulders look at me she commanded him when kittredge looked up at her he seemed as suddenly impressionable as a submissive little boy if elaine had been there she at last would have seen the innocence shed sought unsuccessfully in kittredges younger photographs i wish you lucki hope you tie that record miss frost told him thank you kittredge managed to mumble see you around herm miss frost said to her old coach take care of yourself al herm hoyt told her ill see you nymph kittredge said to me but he didnt look at meor at miss frost kittredge quickly jogged off the mat catching up to one of his teammates we were talkin about wrestlin doc herm hoyt said to dr harlow what record dr harlow asked the old coach my record miss frost told the doctor she was leaving when tom atkins made a gagging sound atkins couldnt contain himself and now that kittredge was gone poor tom was no longer afraid to say it miss frost atkins blurted out bill and i are going to europe together this summer miss frost smiled warmly at me before turning her attention to tom atkins i think thats a wonderful idea tom she told him im sure youll have a great time miss frost was walking away when she stopped and looked back at us but it was clear when miss frost spoke to us that she was looking straight at dr harlow i hope you two get to do everything together miss frost said then they were goneboth miss frost and dr harlow the latter didnt look at me as he was leaving tom atkins and i were left alone with herm hoyt ya know fellasi gotta be goin the old coach told us theres a team meetin coach hoyt i said stopping him im curious to know who would winif there were ever a match between kittredge and miss frost i mean if they were the same age and in the same weightclass you know what i meanif everything were equal herm hoyt looked around maybe he was checking to be sure that none of his wrestlers was near enough to overhear him only delacorte had lingered in the wrestling room but he was standing far off by the exit door as if he were waiting for someone delacorte was too far away to hear us listen fellas the old coach growled dont quote me on this but big al would kill kittredge at any age no matter what weightclassal could kick the shit out of kittredge i wont pretend that it wasnt gratifying to hear this but i would rather have heard it privately it wasnt something i wanted to share with tom atkins can you imagine bill atkins began when coach hoyt had left us for the locker room i interrupted atkins yes of course i can imagine tom i told him we were at the exit to the old gym when delacorte stopped us it was me hed been waiting for i saw hershes truly beautiful delacorte told me she spoke to me as she was leavingshe said i was a wonderful lears fool here delacorte paused to rinse and spit he was holding two paper cups and no longer resembled a deathinprogress she also told me i should move up a weightclass but she put it in a funny way you might lose more matches if you move up a weight but you wont suffer so much she used to be al frost you know delacorte confided to me she used to wrestle we know delacorte tom atkins said irritably i wasnt talking to you atkins delacorte said rinsing and spitting then dr harlow interrupted us delacorte told me he said something to your friendsome bullshit about it being inappropriate for her even to be here but she just kept talking to me as if the baldheaded owlfucker werent there she said oh what is it kent says to learact one scene one when lear has got things the wrong way around concerning cordelia oh what is the line i just saw it you were just in it but i didnt know what line she meanti was lears fool i wasnt kentand dr harlow was just standing there suddenly she cries out ive got itkent says kill thy physicianthats the line i was looking for and the baldheaded owlfucker says to her very funnyi suppose you think thats very funny but she turns on him she gets right in dr harlows face and she says funny i think youre a funny little manthats what i think dr harlow and the baldheaded owlfucker scurried off dr harlow just ran away your friend is marvelous delacorte told me someone shoved him delacorte dropped both paper cupsin a doomed effort to regain his balance to try to stop himself from falling delacorte fell in the mess from his rinsing and spitting cups it was kittredge whod shoved him kittredge had a towel wrapped around his waisthis hair was wet from the shower theres a team meeting after showers and you havent even showered i could get laid twice in the time it takes to wait for you delacorte kittredge told him delacorte got to his feet and ran down the enclosed cement catwalk to the new gym where the showers were tom atkins was attempting to make himself invisible he was afraid that kittredge would shove him next how did you not know she was a man nymph kittredge suddenly asked me did you overlook her adams apple did you not notice how big she is except her tits jesus how could you not know she was a man maybe i did know i said to him it just came out as the truth only occasionally will jesus nymph kittredge said he was starting to shiver there was a draft of cold air from the unheated catwalk that led to the bigger newer gym and kittredge was wearing just a towel it was unusual to see kittredge appear vulnerable but he was half naked and shivering from the cold tom atkins was not a brave boy but even atkins must have sensed kittredges vulnerabilityeven atkins could summon a moment of fearlessness how did you not know she was a wrestler atkins asked him kittredge took a step toward him and atkinsagain fearfulstumbled backward almost falling did you see her shoulders her neck her hands atkins cried to kittredge i gotta go was all kittredge said he said it to mehe didnt answer atkins even tom atkins could tell that kittredges confidence was shaken atkins and i watched kittredge run along the catwalk he clutched the towel around his waist as he ran it was a small towelas tight around his hips as a short skirt the towel made kittredge run like a girl you dont think kittredge could lose a match this seasondo you bill atkins asked me like kittredge i didnt answer atkins how could kittredge lose a wrestling match in new england i would have loved to ask miss frost that question among other questions that moment when you are tired of being treated like a childtired of adolescence toothat suddenly opening but quickly closing passage when you irreversibly want to grow up is a dangerous time in a future novel an early one i would write ambition robs you of your childhood the moment you want to become an adultin any waysomething in your childhood dies i might have been thinking of that simultaneous desire to become a writer and to have sex with miss frost not necessarily in that order in a later novel i would approach this idea a little differentlya little more carefully maybe in increments both measurable and not our childhood is stolen from usnot always in one momentous event but often in a series of small robberies which add up to the same loss i suppose i could have written betrayals instead of robberies in my own familys case i might have used the deceptions wordciting lies of both omission and commission but ill stand by what i wrote it suffices in another novelvery near the beginning of the book in facti wrote your memory is a monster you forgetit doesnt it simply files things away it keeps things for you or hides things from you your memory summons things to your recall with a will of its own you imagine you have a memory but your memory has you ill stand by that too it would have been late february or early march of when the favorite river academy community learned that kittredge had lost in fact hed lost twice the new england interscholastic wrestling championships were in east providence rhode island that year kittredge was beaten badly in the semifinals it wasnt even close delacorte told me in an almostincomprehensible sentence i could detect the vowels but not the consonants because delacorte was speaking with six stitches in his tongue kittredge had lost again in the consolation round to determine third placethis time to a kid hed beaten before that first loss kind of took it out of himafter that kittredge didnt seem to care if he finished third or fourth was all delacorte could manage to say i saw blood in his spitting cup hed bitten through his tonguehence the six stitches kittredge finished fourth i told tom atkins for a twotime defending champion this must have hurt the new england interscholastic wrestling championships had begun in fourteen years after al frost finished his third undefeated season but in the favorite river school newspaper nothing was said about al frosts recordor kittredges failure to tie it in thirteen years thered been eighteen twotime new england championskittredge among them if hed managed to win a third championship that would have been a first a first and a last coach hoyt was quoted as saying in our school newspaper as it would turn out was the final year there were allinclusive new england schoolboy wrestling championships starting in the public high schools and the private schools would have separate tournaments i asked herm hoyt about it one early spring day when our paths crossed in the quad somethin will be losthavin one tournament for everyone is tougher the old coach told me i asked coach hoyt about kittredge tooif there was anything that could explain those two losses kittredge didnt give a shit about that consolation match herm said if he couldnt win it all he didnt give a good fuck about the difference between third and fourth place what about the first loss i asked coach hoyt i kept tellin kittredge theres always someone whos better the old coach said the only way you beat the better guy is by bein tougher the other guy was better and kittredge wasnt tougher that seemed to be all there was to it atkins and i found kittredges defeat anticlimactic when i mentioned it to richard abbott he said its shakespearean bill lots of the important stuff in shakespeare happens offstageyou just hear about it its shakespearean i repeated its still anticlimactic atkins said when i told him what richard had to say as for kittredge he seemed only a little subdued he didnt strike me as much affected by those losses besides it was that time in our senior year when we were hearing about what colleges or universities wed been admitted to the wrestling season was over favorite river was not in the top tier of new england preparatory schools understandably the academy kids didnt apply to the top tier of colleges or universities most of us went to small liberalarts colleges but tom atkins saw himself as a stateuniversity type hed seen what small was like and what he wanted was biggera place you could get lost in atkins wistfully said to me i cared less about the gettinglost factor than tom atkins did i cared about the english departmentwhether or not i could continue to read those writers miss frost had introduced me to i cared about being in or near new york city whered you go to college i had asked miss frost someplace in pennsylvania shed told me its no place youve ever heard of i liked the no place youve ever heard of part but it was the new york city factor that mattered most to me i applied to every college and university i could think of in the new york city areaones youve heard of ones youve never heard of i made a point of speaking to someone in the german department too in every case i was assured that they would help me find a way to study abroad in a germanspeaking country i already had the feeling that a summer in europe with tom atkins would only serve to stimulate my desire to be far far away from first sister vermont it seemed to me to be what a wouldbe writer should dothat is live in a foreign country where they spoke a foreign language while at the same time i would be making my earliest serious attempts to write in my own language as if i were the first and only person to ever do it tom atkins ended up at the university of massachusetts in amherst it was a big school and atkins would manage to get lost theremaybe more lost than hed meant or had wanted no doubt my application to the university of new hampshire provoked some suspicion at home thered been a rumor that miss frost was moving to new hampshire this had prompted aunt muriel to remark that she wished miss frost were moving farther away from vermont than thatto which i responded by saying i hoped to move farther away from vermont than that too this must have mystified muriel who knew id applied to the university of new hampshire but that spring there was no confirmation that miss frosts rumored move to new hampshire was truenor did anyone say where in new hampshire she might be moving to truly my reasons for applying to the university of new hampshire had nothing to do with miss frosts future whereabouts id only applied there to worry my familyi had no intention of going there it was frankly more of a mysterychiefly to tom atkins and methat kittredge was going to yale granted atkins and i had the kind of sat scores that made yaleor any of the ivy league schoolsunattainable my grades had been better than kittredges however and how could yale have overlooked the fact that kittredge had been forced to repeat his senior year tom atkins had erratic grades but he had graduated on schedule atkins and i knew that kittredge had great sat scores but yale must have been motivated to take him for other reasons atkins and i knew that too atkins mentioned kittredges wrestling but i think i know what miss frost would have said about that it wasnt the wrestling that got kittredge into yale as it turned out he wouldnt wrestle in college anyway his sat scores probably helped but kittredges father from whom he was estranged had gone to yale trust me i told tom kittredge didnt get into yale for his germanthats all i can tell you why does it matter to you billywhere kittredge is going to college mrs hadley asked me i was having a pronunciation problem with the yale word which was why the subject came up im not envious i told her i assure you i dont want to go therei cant even say it as it turned out it meant nothingwhere kittredge went to college or where i wentbut at the time it was infuriating that kittredge was accepted to yale forget about fairness i said to martha hadley but doesnt merit matter it was an eighteenyearold question to ask though i had turned nineteen in march in due time of course i would get over where kittredge went to college even in that spring of tom atkins and i were more interested in planning our summer in europe than we were obsessed by the obvious injustice of kittredge getting into yale i admit it was easier to forget about kittredge now that i rarely saw him either he didnt need my help with his german or hed stopped asking for it since yale had admitted him kittredge wasnt worried about what grade he got in germanall he had to do was graduate may i remind you tom atkins asked me sniffily graduating was all kittredge had to do last year too but in kittredge did graduateso did we all frankly graduation seemed anticlimactic too nothing happened but what were we expecting apparently mrs kittredge hadnt been expecting anything she didnt attend elaine also stayed away but that was understandable why hadnt mrs kittredge come to see her only child graduate not very motherly is she was all kittredge had to say about it kittredge seemed unsurprised he was notably unimpressed with graduating his aura was one of already having moved beyond the rest of us its as if hes started at yaleits like hes not here anymore atkins observed i met toms parents at graduation his father took a despairing look at me and refused to shake my hand he didnt call me a fag but i could feel him thinking it my father is very unsophisticated atkins told me he should meet my mom was all i said were going to europe together tomthats all that matters thats all that matters atkins repeated i didnt envy him his days at home before we left it was evident that his dad would give him endless shit about me while poor tom was home atkins lived in new jersey having seen only the new jersey people who came to vermont to ski i didnt envy atkins that either delacorte introduced me to his mom this is the guy who was going to be lears fool delacorte began when the pretty little woman in the sleeveless dress and the straw hat also declined to shake my hand i realized that my being the original lears fool was probably connected to the story of my having had sex with the transsexual town librarian im so sorry for your troubles mrs delacorte told me i only then remembered that i didnt know where delacorte was going to college now that hes dead im sorry i never asked him it may have mattered to delacortewhere he went to collegemaybe as much as where i went didnt matter to me the rehearsals for the tennessee williams play werent timeconsumingnot for my small part i was only in the last scene which is all about alma the repressed woman nils borkman believed miss frost would be perfect for alma was played by aunt muriel as repressed a woman as ive ever known but i managed to invigorate my role as the young man by imagining miss frost in the alma part it seemed suitable to the young mans infatuation with alma that i stare at my aunt muriels breasts though they were gigantic in my opinion gross in comparison to miss frosts must you stare at my breasts billy muriel asked me in one memorable rehearsal im supposed to be infatuated with you i replied with all of me i would imagine aunt muriel rejoined i think its appropriate for the young man to stare at almas bosoms our director nils borkman intoned after all hes a shoe salesmanhes not very refinery its not healthy for my nephew to look at me like that aunt muriel said indignantly surely mrs fremonts bosoms have attracted the stares of many young mens nils said in an illconceived effort to flatter muriel ive momentarily forgotten why my aunt didnt complain when i stared at her breasts in twelfth night oh yesi was a little shorter then and muriels breasts had blocked me from her view my mother sighed grandpa harry who was cast as almas motherhe was wearing a huge pair of falsies accordinglysuggested that it was only natural for any young man to stare at the breasts of a woman who was well endowed youre calling me your own daughter well endowedi cant believe it muriel cried my mom sighed again everyone stares at your breasts muriel my mother said there was a time when you wanted everyone to stare at them you dont want to go down that road with methere was a time when you wanted something mary muriel warned her girls girls said grandpa harry oh shut upyou old crossdresser my mother said to grandpa harry maybe i could just stare at one of the breasts i suggested not that you care about either of them billy my mom shouted i was getting a lot of shouts and sighs from my mother that spring when id announced my plans to go to europe with tom atkins for the summer i got both the sigh and the shout first the sigh of course which was swiftly followed by tom atkinsthat fairy ladies ladies nils borkman was saying this is a forward young man mr archie kramerhe asks alma whats there to do in this town after dark thats pretty forward isnt it ah yes grandpa harry jumped in and theres a stage direction about almashe gathers confidence before the awkwardness of his youthand theres another one when alma leans back and looks at him under halfclosed lids perhaps a little suggestively i think alma is kind of encouragin this young fella to look at her breasts there can be only one director daddy my mother told grandpa harry i dont do suggestivelyi dont encourage anyone to look at my breasts muriel said to nils borkman youre so full of shit muriel my mom said theres a fountain in that final sceneso that alma can give one of her sleeping pills to the young man who washes the pill down by drinking from the fountain there were originally benches in the scene too but nils didnt like the benches muriel had been too agitated to sit still given that i was staring at her breasts i foresaw a problem with losing the benches when the young man hears that theres a casino which offers all kinds of afterdark entertainment as alma puts it he says to alma then what in hell are we sitting here for but there were no benches alma and the young man couldnt be sitting when i pointed this out to nils i said shouldnt i say then what in hell are we doing here because alma and i arent sittingtheres nothing to sit on youre not writing this play billyits already written my mother ever the prompter told me so we bring the benches back nils said tiredly youll have to sit still muriel youve just absorbed a sleeping pill remember absorbed muriel exclaimed i should have absorbed a whole bottle of sleeping pills i cant possibly sit still with billy staring at my breasts billy isnt interested in breasts muriel my mother shouted this was not true as i know you knowi simply wasnt interested in muriels breasts im just actingremember i said to aunt muriel and my mom in the end i leave the stage i go off shouting for a taxi only alma remainsshe turns slowly about toward the audience with her hand still raised in a gesture of wonder and finality as the curtain falls i hadnt a clue as to how muriel might bring that offa gesture of wonder seemed utterly beyond her capabilities as for the finality aspect i had little doubt that my aunt muriel could deliver finality lets one more time try it nils borkman implored us when our director was tired his word order eluded him lets try it one more time grandpa harry said helpfully although mrs winemiller isnt in that final scene it is dusk in the park in summer and smoke only alma and the young traveling salesman are onstage behave yourself billy my mom said to me for the last time i told her smiling as sweetly as i couldat both muriel and my mother the wateriscool muriel began did you say something i asked her breastsas the stage direction says eagerly the first sister players opened summer and smoke in our small community theater about a week after my favorite river graduation the academy students never saw the productions of our local amateur theatrical society it didnt matter that the boarders kittredge and atkins among them had left town i spent the whole play backstage until the twelfth and final scene i was past caring about observing my mothers disapproval of grandpa harry as a woman id seen all i needed to know about that in the stage directions mrs winemiller is described as a spoiled and selfish girl who evaded the responsibilities of later life by slipping into a state of perverse childishness she is known as mr winemillers cross it was evident to my mom and me that grandpa harry was drawing on nana victoriaand what a cross she was for him to bearin his testy portrayal of mrs winemiller this was evident to nana victoria too my disapproving grandmother sat in the front row of the audience looking as if shed been poleaxed while harry brought the house down with his antics my mother had to prompt the shit out of the two child actors who virtually ruined the prologue but in scene specifically the third time mrs winemiller shrieked where is the ice cream manthe audience was roaring and mrs winemiller brought the curtain down at the end of scene by taunting her pussywhipped husband insufferable cross yourself you oldwindbag grandpa harry cackled as the curtain fell it was as good a production as nils borkman had ever directed for the first sister players i have to admit that aunt muriel was excellent as alma it was hard for me to imagine that miss frost could have matched muriel in the repressed area of my aunts agitated performance beyond prompting the child actors in the prologue my mom had nothing to do no one muffed a line it is fortunate that my mother had no further need to prompt anyone because it was fairly early in the play when we both spotted miss frost in the front row of the audience that nana victoria found herself sitting in the same row as miss frost perhaps contributed to my grandmothers concussed appearance in addition to suffering her husbands scathing portrayal of a shrewish wife and mother nana victoria had to sit not more than two seats away from the transsexual wrestler upon seeing miss frost my mom might have inadvertently prompted her mother to crap in a cats litter box of course miss frost had chosen her frontrow seat wisely she knew where the prompter had positioned herself backstage she knew i always hung out with the prompter if we could see her my mother and i knew miss frost could see us in fact for entire scenes of summer and smoke miss frost paid no attention to the actors onstage miss frost just kept smiling at me while my mother increasingly took on the brainedbyatwobyfour expressionlessness of nana victoria whenever murielasalma was onstage miss frost removed a compact from her purse while alma repressed herself miss frost admired her lipstick in the compacts small mirror or she applied some powder to her nose and forehead at the closing curtain when id run offstage shouting for a taxileaving muriel to find the gesture that implies without words both wonder and finalityi encountered my mother she knew where i exited the stage and she had left her prompters chair to intercept me you will not speak to that creature billy my mom said i had anticipated such a showdown id rehearsed so many things that i wanted to say to my mother but i had not expected her to give me such a perfect opportunity to attack her richard abbott whod played john must have been in the mens room he wasnt backstage to help her muriel was still onstage for a few more secondsto be followed by resounding and allconcealing applause i will speak to her mom i began but grandpa harry wouldnt let me continue mrs winemillers wig was askew and her enormous falsies were crowded too closely together but mrs winemiller wasnt asking for ice cream now she was nobodys cross to bearnot in this sceneand grandpa harry needed no prompting just stop it mary grandpa harry told my mother just forget about franny for once in your life stop feelin so sorry for yourself a good man finally married you for christs sake what have you got to be so angry about i am speaking to my son daddy my mom started to say but her heart wasnt in it then treat him like your son my grandfather said respect bill for who he is mary what are you gonna dochange his genes or somethin that creature my mother said again meaning miss frost but just then muriel exited the stage there was thunderous applause muriels massive chest was heaving who knew whether the wonder or the finality had taken it out of her that creature is herein the audience my mom cried to muriel i know mary do you think i didnt see him muriel said see her i corrected my aunt muriel her muriel said scornfully dont you call her a creature i said to my mother she was doin her best to look after bill mary grandpa harry as mrs winemiller said she really was lookin after him ladies ladies nils borkman was saying he was trying to ready muriel and grandpa harry to go back onstage for their bows nils was a tyrant but i appreciated how he allowed me to miss the allcast curtain call nils knew i had a more important role to play backstage please dont speak to that woman billy my mom was pleading richard was with us preparing to take his bows and my mother threw herself into his arms did you see whos here she came here billy wants to speak to her i cant bear it let bill speak to her jewel richard said before running onstage the audience was treating the cast to more rousing applause when miss frost appeared backstage just seconds after richard had left kittredge lost i said to miss frost for months i had imagined speaking to her now this was all i could say to her twice miss frost said herm told me i thought youd gone to new hampshire my mom said to her you shouldnt be here i never should have been here maryi shouldnt have been born here miss frost told her richard and the rest of the cast had come offstage we should go jewelwe should leave these two alone for a minute richard abbott was saying to my mother miss frost and i would never be alone together againthat much was obvious to everyones surprise it was muriel miss frost spoke to good job miss frost told my haughty aunt is bob here i need a word with the racquet man im right here al uncle bob said uncomfortably you have the keys to everything bob miss frost told him theres something i would like to show william before i leave first sister miss frost said there was no theatricality in her delivery i need to show him something in the wrestling room miss frost said i could have asked herm to let us in but i didnt want to get herm in any trouble in the wrestling room muriel exclaimed you and billy in the wrestling room uncle bob said slowly to miss frost as if he had trouble picturing it you can stay with us bob miss frost said but she was looking at my mom you and muriel can come too maryif you think william and i need more than one chaperone i thought my whole fucking family might die on the spotmerely to hear the chaperone wordbut grandpa harry once more distinguished himself just give me the keys bobill be the chaperone you nana victoria cried no one had noticed her arrival backstage just look at you harold youre a sexual clown youre in no condition to be anyones chaperone ah well grandpa harry started to say but he couldnt continue he was scratching under one of his falsies he was fanning his bald head with his wig it was hot backstage this was exactly how it unfoldedthe last time i would see miss frost bob went to the admissions office to get his keys to the gym he would have to come with us my uncle explained because only he and herm hoyt knew where the lights were in the new gym you had to enter the new gym and cross to the old gym on the cement catwalk there was no getting into the wrestling room any other way there was no new gym in my day william miss frost was saying as we traipsed across the dark favorite river campus with uncle bob and grandpa harrynot with mrs winemiller alas because harry was once more wearing his lumbermans regalia nils borkman had decided to come along too im interested in seeing giveswhat with the wrestling the eager norwegian said in seein what gives with the wrestlin grandpa harry repeated youre going out in the world william miss frost said matteroffactly there are homohating assholes everywhere homoassholes nils asked her homohating assholes grandpa harry corrected his old friend ive never let anyone into the gym at night uncle bob was telling us apropos of nothing someone was running to catch up to us in the darkness it was richard abbott increasin popular interest in seein what gives with the wrestlin bill grandpa harry said to me i wasnt planning on a coaching clinic williamplease try to pay attention we dont have much time miss frost addedjust as uncle bob found the light switch and i could see that miss frost was smiling at me it was our storynot to have much time together having uncle bob grandpa harry richard abbott and nils borkman for an audience didnt necessarily make what miss frost had to show me a spectator sport the lighting in the old gym was spotty and no one had cleaned the wrestling mats since the end of the season there was dust and grit on the mats and some dirty towels on the gym floor in the area of the team benches bob harry richard and nils sat on the hometeam bench it was where miss frost had told them to sit and the men did as they were directed in their own ways and for their own reasons these four men were genuine fans of miss frost take your shoes off william miss frost began i could see that shed taken off hers miss frost had painted her toenails a turquoise coloror maybe it was an aqua color a kind of greenish blue it being a warm june night miss frost was wearing a white tank top and capri pants the latter in a bluegreen color that matched her toenail polish were a little tight for wrestling i was wearing some baggy bermuda shorts and a tshirt hi elaine suddenly said i hadnt noticed her in the theater shed followed us to the old gymat a discreet distance behind us no doubtand now sat watching us from the wooden running track above the wrestling room more wrestling was all i said to elaine but i was happy my dear friend was there you will one day be bullied william miss frost said she clamped what delacorte had called a collartie on the back of my neck youre going to get pushed around sooner or later i suppose so i said the bigger and more aggressive he is the more you want to crowd himthe closer you want to get to him miss frost told me i could smell her i could feel her breath on the side of my face you want to make him lean on youyou want him cheektocheek like this then you jam one of his arms into his throat like this she said the inside of my own elbow was constricting my breathing you want to make him push backyou want to make him lift that arm miss frost said when i pushed back against herwhen i lifted my arm to take my elbow away from my throatmiss frost slipped under my armpit in a split second she was at once behind me and to one side of me her hand on the back of my neck pulled my head down with all her weight she drove me shoulderfirst into the warm soft mat i felt a tweak in my neck i landed at an awkward angle how i fell put a lot of strain on that shoulder and in the area of my collarbone imagine the mat is a cement sidewalk or just a plain old wood floor she said that wouldnt feel so good would it no i answered her i was seeing stars id never seen them before again miss frost said let me do it to you a few more times williamthen you do it to me okay i said we did it again and again its called a duckunder miss frost explained you can do it to anyonehe just has to be pushing you you can do it to anyone whos being aggressive i get it i told her no williamyoure beginning to get it miss frost told me we were in the wrestling room for over an hour just drilling the duckunder its easier to do to someone whos taller than you are miss frost explained the bigger he is and the more hes leaning on you the harder his head hits the mator the pavement or the floor or the ground you get it im beginning to i told her i will remember the contact of our bodies as i learned the duckunder as with most things there is a rhythm to it when you start to do it correctly we were sweating and miss frost was saying when you hit it ten more times without a glitch you can go home william i dont want to go homei want to keep doing this i whispered to her i wouldnt have missed making your acquaintance williamnot for all the world miss frost whispered back i love you i told her not now william she said if you cant stick the guys elbow in his throat stick it in his mouth she told me in his mouth i repeated dont kill each other grandpa harry was shouting whats goin on here i heard coach hoyt ask herm had noticed all the lights the old gym and that wrestling room were sacred to him als showing billy a duckunder herm uncle bob told the old coach well i showed it to al herm said i guess al oughta know how it goes coach hoyt sat down on the hometeam benchas close as he could get to the scorers table ill never forget you i was whispering to miss frost i guess were done williamif you cant concentrate on the duckunder miss frost said okay ill concentrateten more duckunders i told her she just smiled at me and she ruffled my sweatsoaked hair i dont believe shed ruffled my hair since i was thirteen or fifteennot for a long time anyway no were done now williamherm is here coach hoyt can take over the duckunders miss frost said i suddenly saw that she looked tiredid never seen her look tired before give me a hug but dont kiss me williamlets just play by the rules and make everyone happy miss frost told me i hugged her as hard as i could but she didnt hug me backnot nearly as hard as she could have safe travels al uncle bob said thanks bob miss frost said i gotta get home before muriel sends out the police and the firemen to find me uncle bob said i can lock up the place bob coach hoyt told my uncle billy and i will just hit a few more duckunders a few more i repeated till i see how youre gettin it coach hoyt said how bout all of you goin home the old coach asked you too richardyou too harry herm was saying the coach probably didnt recognize nils borkman and if coach hoyt recognized elaine hadley he would have known her only as the unfortunate faculty daughter whod been knocked up by kittredge ill see you later richardi love you elaine i called as they were leaving i love you billy i heard elaine say ill see you at homeill leave some lights on bill i heard richard say take care of yourself al grandpa harry said to miss frost im going to miss you harry miss frost told him im gonna miss you too i heard grandpa harry say i understood that i shouldnt watch miss frost leave and i didnt occasionally you know when you wont see someone again the thing about a duckunder billy is to make the guy kinda do it to himselfthats the key coach hoyt was saying when we locked up with the growingly familiar collarties i had the feeling that grabbing hold of herm hoyt was like grabbing hold of a tree trunkhe had such a thick neck that you couldnt get much of a grip on him the place to stick the guys elbow is anywhere it makes him uncomfortable billy herm was saying in his throat in his mouthstick it up his nose if you can find a way to fit it up there youre only stickin his elbow in his face to get him to react what you want him to do is overreact billythats all youre doin the old coach did about twenty duckunders on me they were very fluid but my neck was killing me okayyour turn lets see you do it herm hoyt told me twenty times i asked him he could see that i was crying well start countin the times as soon as you stop cryin billy im guessin youll be cryin for the first forty times or sothen well start countin coach hoyt said we were there in the old gym for at least another two hoursmaybe three i had stopped counting the duckunders but i was beginning to get the feeling that i could do a duckunder in my sleep or drunk which was a funny thing for me to think because id not yet been drunk there was a first time for everything and i had a lot of first times ahead of me at some point i made the mistake of saying to the old coach i think i could do a duckunder blindfolded is that so billy herm asked me stay right heredont leave the mat he went off somewhere i could hear him on the catwalk but i couldnt see him then the lights went out and the wrestling room was in total darkness dont worryjust stay where you are the coach called to me i can find you billy it wasnt long before i felt his presence his strong hand clamped me in a collartie and we were locked up in the surrounding blackness if you can feel me you dont need to see me herm said if youve got hold of my neck you kinda know where my arms and legs are gonna be dontcha yes sir i answered you better do your duckunder on me before i do mine on you billy herm told me but i wasnt quick enough coach hoyt hit his duckunder first it was a real headbanger i guess its your turn billyjust dont make me wait all night the old coach said do you know where shes going i asked him later it was pitchdark in the old gym and we were lying on the matboth of us were resting al told me not to tell you billy herm said i understand i told him i always knew al wanted to be a girl the old coachs voice came out of the darkness i just didnt know he had the balls to go through with it billy oh he has the balls all right i said sheshe has the balls billy herm hoyt said laughing crazily there were some windows surrounding the wooden track above us an earlydawn light gave them a dull glow listen up billy the old coach said youve got one move its a pretty good duckunder but its just one move you can take a guy down with itmaybe hurt him a little but a tough guy is gonna get up and keep comin after you one move wont make you a wrestler billy i see i said when you hit your duckunder you get the hell out of therewherever you are billy do you get what im sayin coach hoyt asked me its just one movei hit it and run is that what youre telling me i asked him you hit it and runyou know how to run dontcha the old coach said what will happen to her i asked him suddenly i cant tell you that billy herm said sighing shes got more than one move doesnt she i asked him yeah but als not gettin any younger coach hoyt told me you best get home billytheres enough light to see by i thanked him i made my way across the absolutely empty favorite river campus i wanted to see elaine and hug her and kiss her but i didnt think that would be our future i had a summer ahead of me to explore the muchballyhooed sexual everything with tom atkins but i liked boys and girls i knew atkins couldnt provide me with everything was i enough of a romantic to believe miss frost knew this about me did i believe she was the first person to understand that no one person could ever give me everything yes probably after all i was only nineteena bisexual boy with a pretty good duckunder it was just one move and i was no wrestler but you can learn a lot from good teachers chapter españa you should wait william miss frost had said the time to read madame bovary is when your romantic hopes and desires have crashed and you believe that your future relationships will have disappointingeven devastatingconsequences ill wait to read it until then id told her is it any wonder that this was the novel i took with me to europe in the summer of when i was traveling with tom id just begun reading madame bovary when atkins asked me who is she bill in his tone of voice and by the pitifullooking way poor tom was biting his lower lip i perceived that he was jealous of emma bovary i hadnt yet met the woman i was still reading about the oafish charles i even shared with atkins that passage about charless father encouraging the boy to take great swigs of rum and to shout insults at religious processions a promising upbringing id ohsowrongly concluded but when i read poor tom that defining observation of charlesthe audacity of his desire protested against the servility of his conducti could see how hurtful this was it would not be the last time i underestimated atkinss inferiority complex after that first time i couldnt read madame bovary to myself i was permitted to read that novel only if i read every word of it aloud to tom atkins granted not every new reader of madame bovary takes away from that novel a distrust bordering on hatred of monogamy but my contempt of monogamy was born in the summer of to be fair to flaubert it was poor toms craven need for monogamy that i loathed what an awful way to read that wonderful novelout loud to tom atkins who feared infidelity even as the first sexual adventure of his young life was just getting started the aversion atkins felt for emmas adultery was akin to his gag reflex at the vagina word yet well before emmas descent into infidelity poor tom was revolted by herthe description of her satin slippers with their soles yellowed from the beeswax on the dancefloor disgusted him who cares about that sickening womans feet atkins cried of course it was emmas heart that flaubert was exposingcontact with the rich had left it smeared with something that would never fade away like the beeswax on her slippersdont you see i asked poor tom emma is nauseating atkins replied what i soon found nauseating was toms conviction that having sex with me was the only remedy for how hed suffered while listening to madame bovary then let me read it to myself i begged him but in that case i would have been guilty of neglecting himworse i would have been choosing emmas company over his and so i read aloud to atkinsshe was filled with lust with rage with hatredwhile he writhed it was as if i were torturing him when i read aloud that part where emma is so enjoying the very idea of having her first loveras if a second puberty had come upon heri believed that atkins was going to throw up in our bed i thought flaubert would have appreciated the irony that poor tom and i were in france at the time and there was no toilet in our room at the pensiononly a bidet while atkins went on vomiting in the bidet i considered how the infidelity that poor tom truly fearednamely minewas thrilling to me with the accidental assistance of madame bovary i see now why i added monogamy to the list of distasteful things i associated with the exclusively heterosexual life butmore accuratelyit was tom atkins who was to blame here we were in europeexperiencing the sexual everything that miss frost had so protectively withheld from meand atkins was already agonizing over the eventuality of my leaving him perhaps but not necessarily for someone else while atkins was barfing in that bidet in france i kept reading aloud to him about emma bovary she summoned the heroines from the books she had read and the lyric host of these unchaste women began their chorus in her memory sistervoices enticing her dont you just love that okay it was cruelhow i raised my voice with that bit about the unchaste womenbut atkins was noisily retching and i wanted to be heard over the running water in the bidet tom and i were in italy when emma poisoned herself and died this was around the time i was compelled to keep looking at that prostitute with the faintest trace of a mustache on her upper lip and poor tom had noticed me looking at her soon she was vomiting blood i read aloud by then i thought i understood those things that atkins disapproved ofeven as they attracted mebut id not foreseen the vehemence with which tom atkins could disapprove atkins cheered when the end was near and emma bovary was vomiting blood let me see if i understand you correctly tom i said pausing just before that moment when emma starts screaming your cheers indicate to me that emma is getting what she deservesis that what youre saying well billof course she deserves it look what shes done look how shes behaved atkins cried she has married the dullest man in france but because she fucks around she deserves to die in agonyis that your point tom i asked him emma bovary is bored tom should she just stay boredand by so doing earn the right to die peacefully in her sleep youre bored arent you bill youre bored with me arent you atkins asked pitifully not everything is about us tom i told him i would regret this conversation years later when tom atkins was dyingat that time when there were so many righteous souls who believed poor tom and others like him deserved to diei regretted that i had embarrassed atkins or that id ever made him feel ashamed tom atkins was a good person he was just an insecure guy and a cloying lover he was one of those boys whod always felt unloved and he loaded up our summer relationship with unrealistic expectations atkins was manipulative and possessive but only because he wanted me to be the love of his life i think poor tom was afraid he would always be unloved he imagined he could force the search for the love of his life into a single summer of onestop shopping as for my ideas about finding the love of my life i was quite the opposite to tom atkins that summer of i was in no hurry to stop shoppingid just started not that many pages further on in madame bovary i would read aloud emmas actual death scene her final convulsionupon hearing the blind mans tapping stick and his raucous singing emma dies imagining the beggars hideous face stationed in the eternal darkness like a monster atkins was shaking with guilt and terror i wouldnt wish that on anyone bill poor tom cried i didnt mean iti didnt mean she deserved that bill i remember holding him while he cried madame bovary is not a horror story but the novel had that effect on tom atkins he was very fairskinned with freckles on his chest and back and when he got upset and cried his face flushed pinkas if someone had slapped himand his freckles looked inflamed when i read on in madame bovarythat part where charles finds rodolphes letter to emma charles is so stupid he tells himself that his unfaithful wife and rodolphe must have loved each other platonicallyatkins was wincing as if in pain charles was not one of those men who like to get to the bottom of things i continued while poor tom moaned oh billno no no please tell me im not one of those men like charles i do like to get to the bottom of things atkins cried oh billi honestly do i do i do he once more dissolved in tearsas he would again when he was dying when poor tom indeed got to the bottom of things it was not the bottom that any of us saw coming is there eternal darkness bill atkins would one day ask me is there a monsters face waiting there no no tom i would try to assure him its either just darknessno monster no anythingor its very bright truly the most amazing light and there are lots of wonderful things to see no monsters either wayright bill poor tom would ask me thats right tomno monsters either way we were still in italy that summer of when i got to the end of madame bovary by then atkins was such a selfpitying wreck that id snuck into the wc and read the ending to myself when it was time for the readingaloud part i skipped that paragraph about the autopsy on charlesthat horrifying bit when they open him up and find nothing i didnt want to deal with poor toms distress at the nothing word how could there have been nothing bill i imagined atkins asking maybe it was the fault of the paragraph i omitted from my reading but tom atkins wasnt content with the ending of madame bovary its just not very satisfying atkins complained how about a blow job tom i asked him ill show you satisfying i was being serious bill atkins told me peevishly so was i tomso was i i said after that summer it wasnt a surprise to either of us that we went our separate ways it was easier for a while to maintain a limited but cordial correspondence than to see each other i wouldnt hear from atkins for a couple of our college years i guessed that he might have tried having a girlfriend but someone told me tom was lost on drugs and that thered been an ugly and very public exposure of a homosexual kind in amherst massachusetts this was early enough in the sixties that the homosexual word had a forbiddingly clinical sound to it at that time of course homosexuals had no rightswe werent even a group i was still living in new york in and even in new york there wasnt what i would have called a gay community not a true community just all the cruising i suppose the frequency with which gay men encountered one another in doctors offices might have constituted a different kind of community im kidding but it was my impression that we had more than our fair share of gonorrhea in fact a gay doctor who was treating me for the clap told me that bisexual men should wear condoms i dont remember if the clap doctor said why or if i asked him i probably took his unfriendly advice as further evidence of prejudice against bisexuals or maybe this doctor reminded me of a gay dr harlow in i knew a lot of gay guys their doctors werent telling them to wear condoms the only reason i remember this incident at all is that i was about to publish my first novel and i had just met a woman i was interested in in that way at the same time of course i was constantly meeting gay guys and it wasnt only because of this clap doctor with the apparent prejudice against bisexuals that i started wearing a condom i credit esmeralda for making condoms appealing to me and i missed esmeraldai definitely did in any case the next time i heard from tom atkins i had become a condomwearer and poor tom had a wife and children as if that werent shocking enough our correspondence had degenerated to christmas cards thus i learned from a christmas photo that tom atkins had a familyan older boy a younger girl needless to say i hadnt been invited to the wedding in the winter of i became a published novelist the woman id met in new york around the time i was persuaded to wear a condom had lured me to los angeles her name was alice and she was a screenwriter it was somehow reassuring that alice had told me she wasnt interested in adapting my first novel im not going down that road alice said our relationship means more to me than a job id told larry what alice had said thinking this might reassure him about her larry had met alice only once he hadnt liked her maybe you should consider bill what alice means larry said what if she already pitched your novel to all the studios and no one was interested well my old pal larry was the first to tell me that no one would ever make a film from my first novel he also told me i would hate living in la although i think what larry meant or hoped was that i would hate living with alice shes not your soprano understudy bill larry said but i liked living with alicealice was the first woman id lived with who knew i was bisexual she said it didnt matter alice was bisexual alice was also the first woman id talked to about having a child togetherbut like me she was no fan of monogamy wed gone to los angeles with a bohemian belief in the enduring superiority of friendship alice and i were friends and we both believed that the concept of the couple was a dinosaur idea wed given each other permission to have other lovers though there were limitationsnamely it was okay with alice if i saw men just not other women and i told her it was okay with me if she saw women just not other men uhoh elaine had said i dont think those kinds of arrangements work at the time i wouldnt have considered elaine to be an authority on arrangements i also knew that even in elaine had expressed an onagain offagain interest in our living together but elaine was steadfast in her resolution never to have any children she hadnt changed her mind about the size of babies heads alice and i additionally believed most naïvely in the enduring superiority of writers naturally we didnt see each other as rivals she was a screenwriter i was a novelist what could possibly go wrong uhoh as elaine would say id forgotten that my first conversation with alice had been about the draft when i got summoned for a physicali cant remember exactly when this was or many other details because i had a terrible hangover that dayi checked the box that said something along the lines of homosexual tendencies which i vaguely recall whispering to myself in an austrian accent as if herr doktor grau were still alive and speaking to me the army psychiatrist was a tightassed lieutenant i remember him he kept his office door open while he interrogated meso that the recruits who were waiting their turn could overhear usbut id lived through earlier and vastly smarter intimidation tactics think of kittredge and then what alice had asked when i was telling her the story she was a great person to tell a story to alice always gave me the impression that she couldnt wait to hear what happened next but alice was impatient with the vagueness of my draft story you dont like girls the lieutenant had asked me yes i doi do like girls i told him then what are your homosexual tendencies exactly the army psychiatrist asked i like guys too i told him you do he asked do you like guys better than you like girls the psychiatrist continued loudly oh its just so hard to choose i said a little breathlessly i really really like them both uhhuh the lieutenant said and do you see this tendency continuing well i certainly hope so i saidas enthusiastically as i could manage alice loved this story at least she said she did she thought it would make a funny scene in a movie the funny word should have warned you bill larry would tell me much later when i was back in new york or the movie word maybe what might have warned me about alice was that she took notes when we were talking who takes notes on conversations larry had asked me not waiting for an answer hed also asked and which of you likes it that she doesnt shave her armpits about two weeks after id checked the box for homosexual tendencies or whatever the stupid form said i received my classification noticeor maybe it was my reclassification notice i think it was a f i was found not qualified there was something about the established physical mental or moral standards but exactly what did the notification saywhat was your actual classification alice had asked me you cant just think it was a fourf i dont rememberi dont care i told her but thats just so vague alice said of course the vague word should have warned me too thered been a followup letter perhaps from the selective service but maybe not telling me to see a shrinknot just any shrink but a particular one id sent the letter to grandpa harry he and nils knew a lawyer for their logging and lumber business the lawyer said that i couldnt be forced to see a shrink i didnt and i never heard from the draft again the problem was that id written about thisalbeit in passingin my first novel i didnt realize it was my novel alice was interested in i thought she was interested in every little thing about me most places we leave in childhood grow less not more fancy i wrote in that novel alice had told me how much she loved that line the firstperson narrator is an outofthecloset gay man whos in love with the protagonist who refuses to check the homosexual tendencies box the protagonist who is an inthecloset gay man will die in vietnam you might say it is a story about how not coming out can kill you one day i could tell that alice was really agitated she seemed to be working on so many projects at the same timei never knew which screenplay she was writing at any given moment i just assumed that one of these scriptsinprogress was causing her agitation but she confessed to me that one of the studio execs she knew had been bugging her about me and my first novel he was a guy she regularly made a point of putting down mr sharpie she sometimes called himor mr pastel more recently i had the impression of an immaculate dresser but a guy who wore golfing clotheslightcolored clothes anyway you know limegreen pants pink polo shirtspastel colors alice told me that mr pastel had asked her if i would try to interfere with a film based on my novelif there ever were a movie made mr sharpie must have known she lived with me hed asked her if i would be compliant to changes in my story just the usual noveltoscreenplay sort of changes i guess alice said vaguely the guy just has a lot of questions like what i asked her where does the servicetomycountry part come into the story the studio exec in the lightcolored clothing had asked alice i was a little confused by the question i thought id written an antivietnam novel but in the execs opinion the reason the closeted gay protagonist doesnt check the homosexual tendencies box is that he feels an obligation to serve his countrynot that hes so afraid to come out he would rather risk dying in an unjust war in this studio execs opinion our voiceover character he meant my firstperson narrator admits to homosexual tendencies because hes a coward the exec even said we should get the idea that hes faking it the fakingit idea was mr sharpies substitute for my idea in the novelnamely that my firstperson narrator is being brave to come out who is this guy i asked alice no one had made me an offer for the film rights to my novel i still owned those rights it sounds like someone is writing a script i said alices back was to me theres no script she mumbled this guy just has a lot of questions about what youre like to deal with alice said i dont know the guy i told her whats he like to deal with alice i was trying to spare you meeting this guy bill was all alice said we were living in santa monica she was always the driver so she was sparing me the driving too i just stayed in the apartment and wrote i could walk to ocean avenue and see the homeless peoplei could run on the beach what was it herm hoyt had said to me about the duckunder you hit it and runyou know how to run dontcha the old coach had said i started to run in santa monica in i would soon be twentyseven i was already writing my second novel it had been eight years since miss frost and herm hoyt had showed me how to hit a duckunder i was probably a little rusty the running suddenly seemed like a good idea alice drove me to the meeting there were four or five studio execs gathered around an eggshaped table in a glassy building in beverly hills with nearblinding sunlight pouring through the windows but only mr sharpie spoke this is william abbott the novelist mr sharpie said introducing me it was probably my extreme selfconsciousness but i thought the novelist word made all the execs uneasy to my surprise mr sharpie was a slob the sharpie word wasnt a compliment to how the guy dressed it referred to the brand of waterproof pen he twirled in his hand i hate those permanent markers you cant really write with themthey bleed through the page they make a mess theyre only good for making short remarks in the wide margins of screenplaysyou know manageable words like this is shit or fuck this as for where the mr pastel nickname came fromwell i couldnt see it the guy was an unshaven slob dressed all in black he was one of those execs who was trying to look like an artist of some indeterminate kind he wore a sweatstained black jogging suit over a black tshirt with black running shoes mr pastel looked very fit since id just started running i could see at a glance he ran harder than i did golf wasnt his gameit would have been insufficient exercise for him perhaps mr abbott will tell us his thoughts mr sharpie said twirling his waterproof pen ill tell you when i might take seriously the idea of service to my country i began when local state and federal legislation which currently criminalizes homosexual acts between consenting adults is repealed when the countrys archaic antisodomy laws are overturned when psychiatrists stop diagnosing me and my friends as clinically abnormal medically incompetent freaks in need of rehabilitation when the media stops representing us as sissy pansy fairy childmolesting perverts i would actually like to have children one day i said pausing to look at alice but she had lowered her head and sat at the table with one hand on her forehead shielding her eyes she was wearing jeans and a mans bluedenim work shirt with the sleeves rolled upher customary uniform in the sunlight her hairy arms sparkled in short i continued i might take seriously the idea of service to my country when my country begins to demonstrate that it gives a shit about me i had rehearsed this speech while running on the beachfrom the santa monica pier to where chautauqua boulevard ends at the pacific coast highway and back againbut id not realized that the hairy mother of my future children and the studio exec who thought my firstperson narrator should be faking his homosexual tendencies were in cahoots you know what i love this same studio exec said then i love that voiceover about childhood hows it go alice the craven shit asked her thats when i knew they were fucking each other it was the way hed asked the question and if the voiceover existed someone was already writing the script alice knew shed been caught with her hand on her foreheadstill shielding her eyesshe recited with resignation most places we leave in childhood grow less not more fancy yeahthats it the exec cried i love that so much i think it should begin and end our movie it bears repeating doesnt it he asked me but he wasnt waiting for an answer its the tone of voice we wantisnt it alice he asked you know how much i love that line bill alice said still shielding her eyes maybe mr pastels underwear was lightcolored i thoughtor perhaps his sheets i couldnt just get up and leave i didnt know how to get back to santa monica from beverly hills alice was the driver in our little wouldbe family look at it this way dear bill larry said when i came back to new york in the fall of if youd had children with that conniving ape your kids would have been born with hairy armpits women who want babies will say and do anything but i think id wanted children with someoneokay maybe with anyoneas sincerely as alice had over time i would give up the idea of having children but its harder to stop wanting to have children do you think i would have been a good mother william miss frost had asked me once you i think you would be a fantastic mother i said to her i said would have been williamnot would be im not ever going to be a mother now miss frost told me i think you would have been a terrific mom i told her at the time i didnt understand why miss frost had made such a big deal of the would have been or would be business but i get it now shed given up the idea of ever having children but she couldnt stop the wanting part what really pissed me off about alice and the fucking movie business is that i was living in los angeles when the police raided the stonewall inn a gay bar in greenwich villagein june of i missed the stonewall riots yes i know it was street hustlers and drag queens who first fought back but the resultant protest rally in sheridan squarethe night after the raidwas the start of something i wasnt happy that i was stuck in santa monica still running on the beach and relying on larry to tell me what had happened back in new york larry had certainly not been to the stonewall with menot everand i doubt he was among the patrons on that june night when some gays resisted the nowfamous raid but to hear larry talk you would think he was the first gay man to cruise greenwich avenue and christopher street and that he was among the regulars at the stonewalleven that hed been carted off to jail with the kicking punching drag queens when as i later learned larry had been with his patronsofpoetry people in the hamptons or with that young poetaster of a wall street guy larry was fucking on fire island his name was russell and it wasnt until i came back to new york that my dearest friend elaine admitted to me that alice had hit on her the one time elaine had visited us in santa monica why didnt you tell me i asked elaine billy billy elaine began as her mother used to preface her admonitions to me did you not know that your most insecure lovers will always try to discredit your friends of course i did know that or i should have id already learned it from larrynot to mention tom atkins and it was right around that time when i heard again from poor tom a dog a labrador retriever had been added to the photograph on the atkins family christmas card of at the time toms children struck me as too young to be going to school but the breakup with alice had caused me to pay less attention to children enclosed with the christmas card was what i first mistook for one of those thirdperson christmas letters i almost didnt read it but then i did it was tom atkins trying hard to write a book review of my first novela most generous albeit awkward review as it turned out as i would later learn all of poor toms reviews of my novels would conclude with the same outrageous sentence its better than madame bovary billi know you dont believe me but it really is coming from atkins of course i knew that anything would be better than madame bovary lawrence uptons sixtieth birthday party was on a bittercold saturday night in new york in february of i was no longer larrys lovernot even his occasional fuck buddybut we were close friends my third novel was about to be publishedaround the time of my birthday in march of that same yearand larry had read the galleys hed pronounced it my best book that larrys praise had been unqualified spooked me somewhat because larry wasnt known for withholding his reservations id met him in vienna when hed been fortyfive id had fifteen years of listening to lawrence uptons edgy endorsements which had included his often barbed appreciation of me and my writing now even at the sumptuous bash for his sixtiethat the chelsea brownstone of his young wall street admirer russelllarry had singled me out for a toast i was going to be thirtysix in another month i was unprepared to have larry toast me and my soontobepublished novelespecially among his mostly older ohsosuperior friends i want to thank most of you for making me feel younger than i ambeginning with you dear bill larry had begun okayperhaps larry was being a little barbed to russell i knew it wouldnt be a late night not with all the old farts in that crowd but id not expected such a warmhearted event i wasnt living with anyone at the time i had a few fuck buddies in the citythey were men my age for the most partand i was very fond of a young novelist who was teaching in the writing program at columbia rachel was just a few years younger than i was in her early thirties shed published two novels and was working on a book of short stories at her invitation id visited one of her writing classes because the students were reading one of my novels wed been sleeping with each other for a couple of months but thered been no talk of living together rachel had an apartment on the upper west side and i was in a comfortableenough apartment on third avenue and east sixtyfourth keeping central park between us seemed an acceptable idea rachel had just escaped from a long claustrophobic relationship with someone she described as a serialmarriage zealot and i had my fuck buddies id brought elaine to larrys birthday party larry and elaine really liked each other frankly until my third novel which larry praised so generously id had the feeling that larry liked elaines writing better than mine this was okay with me i felt the same way though elaine was a doggedly slow writer shed published only one novel and one small collection of stories but she was always busy writing i mention how cold it was in new york that night because i remember that was why elaine decided she would come uptown and spend the night in my apartment on east sixtyfourth street elaine was living downtown where she was renting the loft of a painter friend on spring street and that fuckhead painters place was freezing also how cold it was in manhattan serves as a convenient foreshadow to how much colder it must have been in vermont on that same february night i was in the bathroom getting ready for bed when the phone rang it hadnt been a late party for larry as ive said but it was late for me to be getting a phone call even on a saturday night answer it will you i called to elaine what if its rachel elaine called to me rachel knows youshe knows were not doing it elaine i called from the bathroom well it will be weird if its rachelbelieve me elaine said answering the phone hellothis is billys old friend elaine i heard her say were not having sex its just a cold night to be alone downtown elaine added i finished brushing my teeth when i came out of the bathroom elaine wasnt talking either the caller had hung up or whoever it was was giving an earful to elainemaybe it was rachel and i shouldnt have let elaine answer the phone i was thinking then i saw elaine on my bed shed found a clean tshirt of mine to wear for pajamas and she was already under the covers with the phone pressed to her ear and tears streaking her face yes ill tell him mom elaine was saying i couldnt imagine under what circumstances mrs hadley might have been prompted to call me i thought it unlikely that martha hadley would have had my phone number perhaps because it was a milestone night for larry i was inclined to imagine other potential milestones who had died my mind raced through the likeliest suspects not nana victoria she was already dead shed slipped away when she was still in her seventies id heard grandpa harry sayas if he were envious maybe he washarry was eightyfour grandpa harry was fond of spending his evenings in his river street homemore often than not in his late wifes attire harry had not yet slipped away into the dementia that would one day soon cause richard abbott and me to move the old lumberman into the assistedliving facility that nils borkman and harry had built for the town i know ive already told you this storyhow the other residents of the facility as the elderly of first sister ominously called the place complained about grandpa harry surprising them in drag i would think at the time after a few episodes when harry was in drag how could anyone have been surprised but richard abbott and i immediately moved grandpa harry back to the privacy of his river street home where we hired a roundtheclock nurse to look after him all thisand more of courseawaited me in my nottoodistant future oh no i thoughtas elaine hung up the phone dont let it be grandpa harry i wrongly imagined that elaine knew my thoughts its your mom billy your mom and muriel were killed in a car crashnothings happened to miss frost elaine quickly said nothings happened to miss frost i repeated but i was thinking how could i not once have contacted her in all these years i hadnt even tried why did i never seek her out she would be sixtyone i was suddenly astonished that i hadnt seen miss frost or heard one word about her in seventeen years i hadnt even asked herm hoyt if hed heard from her on this bittercold night in new york in february of when i was almost thirtysix i had already decided that my bisexuality meant i would be categorized as more unreliable than usual by straight women while at the same time and for the same reasons i would never be entirely trusted by gay men what would miss frost have thought of me i wondered i didnt mean my writing what would she have thought of my relationships with men and women had i ever protected anyone for whom had i truly been worthwhile how could i be almost forty and not love anyone as sincerely as i loved elaine how could i not have lived up to those expectations miss frost must have had for me shed protected me but for what reason had she simply delayed my becoming promiscuous that was never a word used positively for if gay men were more openly promiscuouseven more deliberately so than straight guysbisexuals were often accused of being more promiscuous than anybody if miss frost were to meet me now who would she think i most resembled i dont mean in my choice of partners i mean in the sheer number not to mention the shallowness of my relationships kittredge i answered myself aloud what tangents i would takenot to think about my mother my mom was dead but i couldnt or wouldnt let myself think about her oh billy billycome here come here dont go down that road billy elaine said holding out her arms to me the car which my aunt muriel had been driving was hit headon by a drunk driver who had strayed into muriels lane on vermonts route my mother and muriel were returning home from one of their saturday shopping trips to boston on that saturday night they were probably talking up a stormjust yakking away nattering about nothing or everythingwhen the carload of partying skiers came down the road from stratton mountain and turned eastsoutheast on route my mom and muriel were headed westnorthwest on route somewhere between bondville and rawsonville the two cars collided there was plenty of snow for the skiers but route was bonedry and crusted with road salt it was twelve degrees below zero too cold to snow the vermont state police reported that my mother and muriel were killed instantly aunt muriel had only recently turned sixty and my mom would have been fiftyeight in april of that year richard abbott was just fortyeight kinda young to be a widower as grandpa harry would say uncle bob was on the young side to be a widower too bob was miss frosts agehe was sixtyone elaine and i rented a car and drove to vermont together we argued the whole way about what i saw in rachel the thirtysomething fiction writer who was teaching at columbia youre flattered when younger writers like your writingor youre oblivious to how they come on to you maybe elaine began all the time youve spent around larry has at least taught you to be wary of older writers who suck up to you i guess im oblivious to itnamely that rachel is sucking up to me but larry never sucked up to me i said elaine was driving she was an aggressive driver and when she drove it made her more aggressive in other ways rachel is sucking up to you and you dont see it elaine said i didnt say anything and elaine added if you ask me i think my tits are bigger bigger than rachels oh elaine was never sexually jealous of anyone i was sleeping with but she didnt like it when i was hanging out with a writer who was younger than she wasman or woman rachel writes in the present tensei go she says he goes i think that shit elaine declared yes well and the thinking wishing hoping wonderingthat shit elaine cried yes i know i started to say i hope she doesnt verbalize her orgasms billyim coming that shit elaine said well nonot that i remember i replied i think shes one of those youngwomen writers who baby her students elaine said elaine had taught more than i had i never argued with her about teaching or mrs kittredge grandpa harry was generous to me he gave me a little money for christmas every year id had parttime collegeteaching jobs the occasional writerinresidence stintthe latter never longer than a single semester i didnt dislike teaching but it hadnt invaded my writing timeas i knew it did invade the writing time of many writer friends elaine among them just so you know elainei find theres more to like about rachel than her small breasts i said i would sincerely hope so billy elaine said are you seeing anyone i asked my old friend you know that guy rachel almost married elaine asked me not personally i told her he hit on me elaine said oh he told me that one time rachel shit in the bedthats what he told me billy elaine said nothing like that has happened yet i told elaine but ill be on the lookout for anything suspicious after that we drove for a while in silence when we left new york state and crossed into vermont a little west of bennington there were more dead things in the road the bigger dead things had been dragged to the side of the road but we could still see them i remember a couple of deer in the bigger category and the usual raccoons and porcupines theres a lot of roadkill in northern new england would you like me to drive i asked elaine sureyes i would elaine answered quietly she found a place to pull off the road and i took over the driving we turned north again just before bennington there was more snow in the woods and more dead things in the road and along the roadside we were a long way from new york city when elaine said that guy didnt hit on me billyi made up the story about rachel shitting in bed too thats okay i said were writers we make things up i did run into someone you went to school withthis is a true story elaine told me who in school with where i asked her at the institute in viennashe was one of those institute girls elaine said when she met you you told her you were trying to be faithful to a girlfriend back in the states i did tell some girls that i admitted i told this institute girl that i was the girlfriend you were trying to be faithful to when you were in vienna elaine said we both had a laugh about that but elaine then asked memore seriouslydo you know what that institute girl said billy no what i asked she said poor you thats what she saidthis is a true story billy elaine told me i didnt doubt it das institut was awfully small every student there knew when i was fucking a soprano understudyand later when i was fucking a famous american poet if youd been my girlfriend i would have been faithful to you elaineor i would have sincerely tried i told her i let her cry for a while in the passenger seat if youd been my boyfriend i would have sincerely tried too billy elaine finally said we drove northeast then headed west from ezra fallsthe favorite river running beside us to the north side of the road even in february as cold as it was that river was never entirely frozen over of course id thought about having children with elaine but there was no point in bringing that up elaine wasnt kidding about the size of babies headsin her view they were enormous when we drove down river street past the building that had once been the first sister public libraryit was now the towns historical societyelaine said i ran lines with you on that brass bed for the tempest about a century ago almost twenty years ago yes i said i wasnt thinking about the tempest or running lines with elaine on that brass bed i had other memories of that bed but as i drove past what used to be the public library it occurred to mea mere seventeen years after the muchmaligned librarian had left townthat miss frost might have protected or not other young men in her basement bedroom but what other young men would miss frost have met in the library i suddenly remembered that id never seen any children there as for teenagers there were only those occasional girlsthe high school students condemned to ezra falls id never seen any teenage boys in the first sister public libraryexcept for the night tom atkins came looking for me except for me our towns young boys would not have been encouraged to visit that library surely no responsible parents in first sister would have wanted their young male children to be in the company of the transsexual wrestler who was in charge of the place i suddenly realized why id been so late in getting a library card no one in my family would ever have introduced me to miss frost it was only because richard abbott proposed taking me to the first sister public library and no one in my family could ever say no to richardnor was anyone in my family quick enough to overrule richards goodhearted and impromptu proposition id managed to meet miss frost only because richard recognized the absurdity of a smalltown thirteenyearold boy not having a library card almost twenty years ago feels like a century to me billy elaine was saying not to me i was trying to say but the words wouldnt come it feels like yesterday to me i wanted to shout but i couldnt speak elaine who saw i was crying put her hand on my thigh sorry i brought up that brass bed billy elaine said elaine who knew me so well knew i wasnt crying for my mother given the secrets my family watched overthose silent vigils we kept in lieu of anything remotely resembling honest disclosureit is a wonder i didnt also suffer a religious upbringing but those winthrop women were not religious grandpa harry and i had been spared that falsehood as for uncle bob and richard abbott i know there were times when living with my aunt muriel and my mother must have resembled a religious observancethe kind of demanding devotion that fasting requires or perhaps a nocturnal trial such as staying up all night when going to sleep would be both customary and more natural what is it thats so appealin about a wake grandpa harry asked elaine and me we went first to his house on river street id half expected harry to greet us as a woman or at least dressed in nana victorias clothes but he was looking like a lumbermanjeans a flannel shirt unshaven i mean why would anyone livin find it suitable to watch over the bodies of the deadthat is before you get to the buryin part where are the dead bodies gonna go why do dead bodies need watchin grandpa harry asked it was vermont it was february nobody was burying muriel or my mother until april after the ground had thawed i could only guess that the funeral home had asked grandpa harry if hed wanted to have a proper wake that had probably started the tirade jeezwell be watchin the bodies till spring harry had shouted there was no religious service planned grandpa harry had a big house friends and family members would show up for cocktails and a catered buffet the memorial word was allowed but not a memorial service elaine and i didnt hear the service word mentioned harry seemed distracted and forgetful elaine and i both thought he didnt behave like a man whod just lost his only children his two daughters instead harry struck us as an eightyfouryearold who had misplaced his reading glassesgrandpa harry was eerily disconnected from the moment we left him to ready himself for the party elaine and i were not mistakenharry had used the party word uhoh elaine had said as we were leaving the river street house it was the first time i had been home when school was in sessionthat is to richard abbotts faculty apartment in bancroft hallsince id been a favorite river student but how young the students looked was more unnerving to elaine i dont see anyone i could even imagine having sex with elaine said at least bancroft was still a boys dorm it was disconcerting enough to see all the girls on the campus in a process that was familiar to most of the singlesex boarding schools in new england favorite river had become a coed institution in uncle bob was no longer working in admissions the racquet man had a new career in alumni affairs i could easily see uncle bob as a gladhander a natural at soliciting goodwill and money from a sentimental favorite river alum bob also had a gift for inserting his queries into the class notes in the academys alumni magazine the river bulletin it had become bobs passion to track down those elusive favorite river graduates whod failed to keep in touch with their old school uncle bob called his queries cries for help from the wherehaveyougone dept cousin gerry had forewarned me that bobs drinking had been unleashed by all his traveling for alumni affairs but i counted gerry as the last surviving winthrop womanalbeit a watereddown lesbian version of that steadfastly disapproving gene you will recall that id always imagined uncle bobs reputation for drinking was exaggerated on another subject upon our return to bancroft hall elaine and i discovered that richard abbott couldnt speak and that mr and mrs hadley werent talking to each other the lack of communication between martha hadley and her husband was not unknown to me elaine had long predicted that her parents were headed for a divorce it wont be acrimonious billytheyre already indifferent to each other elaine had told me and richard abbott had confided to methat is before my mother died when richard could still speakthat he and my mom had stopped socializing with the hadleys elaine and i had speculated on the mysterious stopped socializing part naturally this dovetailed with elaines twentyyear theory that her mother was in love with richard abbott since id had crushes on mrs hadley and richard what could i possibly contribute to this conversation id always believed that richard abbott was a vastly better man than my mother deserved and that martha hadley was entirely too good for mr hadley not only could i never remember that mans first name if he ever had one something about mr hadleys fleeting brush with famethe fame was due to his emergence as a political historian and a voice of protest during the vietnam warhad served to dislocate him if hed once appeared aloof from his familynot only remoteseeming to his wife mrs hadley but even distant from his only child elainemr hadleys identification with a cause his antivietnam crusades with the favorite river students completely severed him from elaine and martha hadley and further led him to have little if anything to do with adults it happens in boarding schools theres occasionally a male faculty member who is unhappy with his life as a grownup he tries to become one of the students in mr hadleys caseaccording to elainehis unfortunate regression to become one of the students when he himself was already in his fifties coincided with favorite river academys decision to admit girls this was just two years before the end of the vietnam war uhoh as id heard elaine say so many times but this time shed added something when the war is over what crusade will my father be leading hows he going to engage all those girls elaine and i didnt see my uncle bob until the party i had just read the racquet mans query in the most recent issue of the river bulletin attached to the class notes for the class of which was my class there was this plaintive entry in the cries for help from the wherehaveyougone dept whats up with you jacques kittredge uncle bob had written following his undergraduate degree from yale kittredge had completed a threeyear residence at the yale school of drama hed earned an mfa in thereafter wed heard nothing an mfa in fucking what elaine had asked more than ten years agowhen the river bulletin had last heard a word from or about kittredge elaine meant that it could have been a degree in acting design sound design directing playwriting stage management technical design and production theater managementeven dramaturgy and dramatic criticism ill bet hes a fucking critic elaine said i told her i didnt care what kittredge was i said i didnt want to know yes you do want to know you cant bullshit me billy elaine had said now here was the racquet man slumped on a couchactually sunken into a couch in grandpa harrys living room as if it would take a wrestling team to get bob back on his feet im sorry about aunt muriel i told him uncle bob reached up from the couch to give me a hug spilling his beer shit billy bob said its the people you would least expect who are disappearing disappearing i repeated warily take your classmate billy who would have picked kittredge as a likely disappearance uncle bob asked you dont think hes dead do you i asked the racquet man an unwillingness to communicate is more likely uncle bob said his speech was so slowed down that the communicate word sounded as if it had seven or eight syllables i realized that bob was quietly but spectacularly drunk although the gathering in memory of my aunt muriel and my mother was just getting started there were some empty beer bottles at bobs feet when he dropped the nowempty bottle hed been drinking and spilling he deftly kicked all but one of the bottles under the couchsomehow without even looking at the bottles id once wondered if kittredge had gone to vietnam hed had that herolooking aspect about him i knew two other favorite river wrestlers had died in the war remember wheelock i barely remember himan adequately swashbuckling antonio sebastians friend in twelfth night and how about madden the selfpitying heavyweight who played malvolio in that same production madden always saw himself as a perpetual victim thats all i remember about him but drunk as he was uncle bob must have read my mind because he suddenly said knowing kittredge ill bet he ducked vietnamsomehow ill bet he did was all i said to bob no offense billy the racquet man added accepting another beer from one of the passing caterersa woman about my moms age or muriels with dyedred hair she looked vaguely familiar maybe she worked with uncle bob in alumni affairs or she might have worked with him years ago in the admissions office my dad was sloshed before he got here gerry told elaine and me when we were standing together in the line for the buffet i knew gerrys girlfriend she was an occasional standup comic at a club i went to in the village she had a deadpan delivery and always wore a mans black suit or a tuxedo with a loosefitting white dress shirt no bra elaine had observed but the shirts too big for her and its not seethrough material the point is she doesnt want you to know she has breastsor what they look like oh im sorry about your mom billy gerry said i know she was completely dysfunctional but she was your mother im sorry about yours i told gerry the standup comic made a horsey snorting sound not as deadpan as usual elaine would say later someones gotta get the car keys from my fucking father gerry said i was keeping an eye on grandpa harry i was afraid he would sneak away from the party only to reappear as a surprise reincarnation of nana victoria nils borkman was keeping an eye on his old partner too if mrs borkman was there i either didnt see her or didnt recognize her im backwatching your grandfather bill nils told me if the funny stuff gets out of hand i am emergencycalling you what funny stuff i asked him but just then grandpa harry suddenly spoke up theyre always late those girls i dont know where they are but theyll show up everyone just go ahead and eat theres plenty of food those girls can find somethin to eat when they get here that quieted the crowd down i already told him that his girls arent coming to the party bill i mean he knows theyre deadhes just forgetfulness exemplified nils told me forgetfulness personified i said to the old norwegian he was two years older than grandpa harry but nils seemed a little more reliable in the remembering department and in some other departments i asked martha hadley if richard had spoken yet not since the news of the accident mrs hadley informed me richard had hugged me a lot and id hugged him back but thered been no words mr hadley appeared lost in thoughtas he often did i couldnt remember the last time hed talked about anything but the war in vietnam mr hadley had made himself a droll obituarist of every favorite river boy whod bitten the dust in vietnam i saw that he was waiting for me at the end of the buffet table get ready elaine warned me in a whisper here comes another death you didnt know about there was no prologuethere never was with mr hadley he was a history teacher he just announced things do you remember merryweather mr hadley asked me not merryweather i thought yes i remembered him he was still an underclassman when i graduated hed been the wrestlingteam managerhe handed out oranges cut in quarters he picked up the bloody and discarded towels not merryweathernot in vietnam i automatically said yes im afraid so billy mr hadley said gravely and trowbridgedid you know trowbridge billy not trowbridge i cried i couldnt believe it id last seen trowbridge in his pajamas kittredge had accosted him when the roundfaced little boy was on his way to brush his teeth i was very upset to think of trowbridge dying in vietnam yes im afraid sotrowbridge too billy mr hadley selfimportantly went on alas yesyoung trowbridge too i saw that grandpa harry had disappearedif not in the way uncle bob had recently used the word not a costume change lets hope bill nils borkman whispered in my ear i only then noticed that mr poggio the grocer was therehe whod so enjoyed grandpa harry onstage as a woman in fact both mr and mrs poggio were there to pay their respects mrs poggio i remembered had not enjoyed grandpa harrys female impersonations this sighting caused me to look all around for the disapproving riptonsralph ripton the sawyer and his nolessdisapproving wife but the riptons if theyd come to pay their respects had left earlyas was their habit at the plays put on by the first sister players i went to see how uncle bob was doing there were a few more empty beer bottles at his feet and now those feet could no longer locate the bottles and kick them under the couch i kicked a few bottles under the couch for him you wont be tempted to drive yourself home will you uncle bob i asked him thats why i already put the car keys in your jacket pocket billy my uncle told me but when i felt around in my jacket pockets i found only a squash ball not the car keys uncle bob i said showing him the ball well i know i put my car keys in someones jacket pocket billy the racquet man said any news from your graduating class i suddenly asked him he was drunk enoughi thought i might catch him offguard what news from the class of i asked my uncle as casually as i could nothing from big al billybelieve me i would tell you he said grandpa harry was making the rounds at his party as a woman now it was at least an improvement that he was acknowledging to everyone that his daughters were deadnot just late for the party as hed earlier said i could see nils borkman following his old partner as if the two of them were on skis and armed gliding through the snowy woods bob dropped another empty beer bottle and i kicked it under grandpa harrys livingroom couch no one noticed the beer bottles not since grandpa harry had reappearedthat is not as grandpa harry im sorry for your loss harryyours and mine uncle bob said to my grandfather who was wearing a fadedpurple dress i remembered as one of nana victorias favorites the bluegray wig was at least ageappropriate richard abbott would later saywhen richard was able to speak again which wouldnt be soon nils borkman told me that the falsies must have come from the costume shop at the first sister players or maybe grandpa harry had stolen them from the drama club at favorite river academy the withered and arthritic hand that held out a new beer to my uncle bob did not belong to the caterer with the dyedred hair it was herm hoythe was only a year older than grandpa harry but coach hoyt looked a lot more beaten up herm had been sixtyeight when he was coaching kittredge in hed looked ready to retire then now at eightyfive coach hoyt had been retired for fifteen years thanks herm the racquet man quietly said raising the beer to his lips billy here has been asking about our old friend al hows that duckunder comin along billy coach hoyt asked i guess you havent heard from her herm i replied i hope youve been practicin billy the old coach said i then told herm hoyt a long and involved story about a fellow runner id met in central park the guy was about my age i told the coach and by his cauliflower earsand a certain stiffness in his shoulders and neck as he rani deduced that he was a wrestler and when i mentioned wrestling he thought that i was a wrestler too oh noi just have a halfwaydecent duckunder i told him im no wrestler but arthurthe wrestlers name was arthurmisunderstood me he thought i meant that i used to wrestle and i was just being modest or selfdeprecating arthur had gone on and on the way wrestlers will about how i should still be wrestling you should be picking up some other moves to go with that duckunderits not too late hed told me arthur wrestled at a club on central park south where he said there were a lot of guys our age who were still wrestling arthur was confident that i could find an appropriate workout partner in my weightclass arthur was unstoppably enthusiastic about my not quitting wrestling simply because i was in my thirties and no longer competing on a school or college team but i was never on a team i tried to tell him looki know a lot of guys our age who were never starters arthur had told me and theyre still wrestling finally as i told herm hoyt i just became so exasperated with arthurs insistence that i come to wrestling practice at his frigging club i told him the truth exactly what did you tell the fella billy coach hoyt asked me that i was gayor more accurately bisexual jeez herm started to say that a former wrestler whod briefly been my lover had tried to teach me a little wrestlingstrictly for my own selfdefense that the former wrestling coach of this same exwrestler had also given me some tips you mean that duckunder you mentionedthats it arthur had asked thats it just the duckunder id admitted jeez billy old coach hoyt was saying shaking his head well thats the story i said to herm i havent been practicing the duckunder theres only one wrestlin club i know on central park south billy herm hoyt told me its a pretty good one when arthur understood what my history with the duckunder was he didnt seem interested in pursuing the matter of my coming to wrestling practice i explained to coach hoyt it might not be the best idea herm said i dont know the fellas at that clubnot anymore they probably dont get many gay guys wrestling thereyou know for selfdefenseis that your guess herm i asked the old coach has this arthur fella read your writin billy herm hoyt asked me have you i asked herm surprised jeezsure i have just dont ask me what its about billy the old wrestling coach said how about miss frost i suddenly asked him has she read my writing persistent isnt he uncle bob asked herm she knows youre a writer billyeverybody who knows you knows that the wrestling coach said dont ask me what you write about either billy uncle bob said he dropped the empty bottle and i kicked it under grandpa harrys couch the woman with the dyedred hair brought another beer for the racquet man i realized why shed seemed familiar all the caterers were from the favorite river academy dining servicethey were kitchen workers from the academy dining halls that woman who kept bringing bob another beer had been in her forties when id last seen her she came from the past which would always be with me the wrestlin club is the new york athletic clubthey have other sports there for sure but they werent bad at wrestlin billy you could probably do some practicin of your duckunder there herm was saying maybe ask that arthur fella about it billyafter all these years ill bet you could use some practicin herm what if the wrestlers beat the shit out of me i asked him wouldnt that kind of defeat the purpose of miss frost and you showing me a duckunder in the first place bobs asleep and hes pissed all over himself the old coach abruptly observed uncle bob i started to say but herm hoyt grabbed the racquet man by both shoulders and shook him bobstop pissin the wrestling coach shouted when bobs eyes blinked open he was as caught offguard as anyone working in the office of alumni affairs at favorite river academy ever would be españa the racquet man said when he saw me jeez bobbe careful what you say herm hoyt said españa i repeated thats where he ishe says hes never coming back billy uncle bob told me thats where who is i asked my drunken uncle our only conversation if you could call it that had been about kittredge it was hard to imagine kittredge speaking spanish i knew the racquet man didnt mean big aluncle bob wasnt telling me that miss frost was in spain and she was never coming back bob i started to say but the racquet man had nodded off again herm hoyt and i could see that bob was still pissing herm i started to say franny dean my former wrestlinteam manager billyhes in spain your father is in spain billy and hes happy therethats all i know where in spain herm i asked the old coach españa herm hoyt repeated shrugging somewhere in spain billythats all i can tell ya just keep thinkin about the happy part your dad is happy and hes in spain your mom was never happy billy i knew herm was right about that i went looking for elaine i wanted to tell her that my father was in spain my mother was dead but my fatherwhom id never knownwas alive and happy but before i could tell her elaine spoke to me first we should sleep in your bedroom tonight billynot in mine she began okay i said if richard wakes up and decides to say something he shouldnt be alonewe should be there elaine went on okay but i just found out about something i told her she wasnt listening i owe you a blow job billymaybe this is your lucky night elaine said i thought she was drunk or else id misheard her what i said im sorry for what i said about rachel thats what the blow job is for elaine explained she was drunk extending the number of syllables in her words in the overly articulated manner of the racquet man you dont owe me a blow job elaine i told her you dont want a blow job billy she asked me she made blow job sound as if it had four or five syllables i didnt say i didnt want one i told her españa i said suddenly because thats what i wanted to talk about españa elaine said is that a kind of spanish blow job billy she was tripping a little as i led her over to say good night to grandpa harry dont worry bill nils borkman suddenly said to me i am unloading the rifles i am keeping a secret of the bullets españa elaine repeated is it a gay thing billy she whispered to me no i told her youll show me right elaine asked i knew that the trick would be keeping her awake until we were back in bancroft hall i love you i said to grandpa harry hugging him i love you bill harry told me hugging me back his falsies had to have been modeled on someone with breasts as big as my aunt muriels but i didnt tell my grandfather that you dont owe me anything elaine i was saying as we left that river street house dont say good night to my mom and dad billydont get anywhere near my dad elaine told me not unless you want to hear about more casualtiesnot unless you have the stomach to listen to more fucking bodycounting after hearing about trowbridge i truly didnt have the stomach for more casualties i didnt even say good night to mrs hadley because i could see that mr hadley was loitering around españa i said quietly to myself as i was helping elaine up those three flights of stairs in bancroft hall its a good thing i didnt have to get her as far as her bedroom which was on the frigging fifth floor as we were navigating the thirdfloor dormitory hall i must have softly said españa againnot so softly i guess because elaine heard me im a little worried about what kind of blow job an españa is exactly its not rough stuff is it billy elaine asked me there was a boy in his pajamas in the hallsuch a little boy and he had his toothbrush in his hand from his frightened expression he obviously didnt know who elaine and i were hed also clearly heard what elaine had asked about the españa blow job were just fooling around i told the small boy theres not going to be any rough stuff theres not going to be a blow job i said to elaine and the boy in pajamas with his toothbrush hed reminded me of trowbridge of course trowbridge is dead did you know trowbridge he was killed in vietnam i told elaine i didnt know any trowbridge elaine said like me elaine couldnt stop staring at the young boy in pajamas youre crying billyplease stop crying elaine said we were leaning on each other when i managed to open the door to silent richards apartment dont worry about him cryinghis mom just died hell be all right elaine said to the boy holding his toothbrush but i had seen trowbridge standing there and perhaps i foresaw that there were more casualties coming maybe id imagined all the bodycounting in the nottoodistant future billy billyplease stop crying elaine was saying what did you mean theres not going to be a blow job do you think im bluffing you know me billyive stopped bluffing i dont bluff anymore billy she babbled on my father is alive hes living in spain and hes happy thats all i know elaine i told her my dad franny dean is living in spainespaña but that was as far as i got elaine had slipped off her coat as wed stumbled through richard and my mothers living room shed kicked off her shoes and her skirt upon entering my bedroom and she was struggling to unbutton the buttons on her blouse whenon another level of halfconsciousnesselaine saw the bed of my adolescent years and dove for it or she somehow managed to throw herself on it by the time i knelt next to her on the bed i could see that elaine had completely passed out she was limp and unmoving as i took off her blouse and unclasped her rather uncomfortablelooking necklace i put her to bed in her bra and panties and went about the usual business of getting into the small bed beside her españa i whispered in the dark youll show me right elaine said in her sleep i fell asleep thinking about why i had never tried to find my father a part of me had rationalized this if hes curious about me let him find me id thought but in truth i had a fabulous father my stepfather richard abbott was the best thing that ever happened to me my mom had never been happy but richard was the best thing that ever happened to her too my mother must have been happy with richard maybe id never tried to find franny dean because finding him would have made me feel i was betraying richard whats up with you jacques kittredge the racquet man had written of course i fell asleep thinking about that too chapter a world of epilogues do epidemics herald their own arrivals or do they generally arrive unannounced i had two warnings at the time they seemed merely coincidentali didnt heed them it was a few weeks after my mothers death before richard abbott began to speak again he continued to teach his classes at the academyalbeit by rote richard had even managed to direct a playbut he had nothing personal to say to those of us who loved him it was april of that same year when elaine told me that richard had spoken to her mother i called mrs hadley immediately after i got off the phone with elaine i know richards going to call you billy martha hadley told me just dont expect him to be quite his old self how is he i asked her im trying to say this carefully mrs hadley said i dont want to blame shakespeare but theres such a thing as too much graveyard humorif you ask me i didnt know what martha hadley meant i just waited for richard to call i think it was may before i finally heard from him and richard just started right inas if wed never been out of touch given his grief i would have guessed that richard hadnt had the time or inclination to read my third novel but hed read it the same old themes but better donethe pleas for tolerance never grow tiresome bill of course everyone is intolerant of something or someone do you know what youre intolerant of bill richard asked me what would that be richard youre intolerant of intolerancearent you bill isnt that a good thing to be intolerant of i asked him and you are proud of your intolerance too bill richard cried you have a most justifiable anger at intoleranceat intolerance of sexual differences especially god knows i would never say youre not entitled to your anger bill god knows i said cautiously i couldnt quite see where richard was going as forgiving as you are of sexual differencesand rightly so billyoure not always so forgiving are you richard asked ah well i started to say and then stopped so that was where he was going id heard it before richard had told me that id not been standing in my mothers shoes in when i was born hed said i couldnt or shouldnt judge her it was my not forgiving her that irked himit was my intolerance of her intolerance that bugged him as portia says the quality of mercy is not strained act four scene onebut i know its not your favorite shakespeare bill richard abbott said yes wed fought about the merchant of venice in the classroomeighteen years ago it was one of the few shakespeare plays wed read in class that richard had not directed onstage its a comedya romantic comedybut with an unfunny part richard had said he meant shylockshakespeares incontrovertible prejudice against jews i took shylocks side portias speech about mercy was vapid christian hypocrisy it was christianity at its most superiorsounding and most saccharine whereas shylock has a point the hatred of him has taught him to hate rightly so i am a jew shylock saysact scene hath not a jew eyes hath not a jew hands organs dimensions senses affections passions i love that speech but richard didnt want to be reminded that id always been on shylocks side your mom is dead bill have you no feelings for your mother richard asked me no feelings i repeated i was remembering her hatred of homosexualsher rejection of me not only because i looked like my father but also because i had something of his weird and unwelcome sexual orientation how does shylock put it i asked richard abbott i knew perfectly well how shylock put it and richard had long understood how id embraced this if you prick us do we not bleed shylock asks if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison us do we not die okay billi know i know youre a poundofflesh kind of guy richard said and if you wrong us i said quoting shylock shall we not revenge if we are like you in the rest we will resemble you in that and what did they do to shylock richard i asked they forced him to become a fucking christian its a difficult play billthats why ive not put it onstage richard said im not sure its suitable for kids in a secondary school how are you doing richard i asked him hoping to change the subject i remember that boy who was ready to rewrite shakespearethat boy who was so sure the epilogue to the tempest was extraneous richard said i remember that boy too i told him i was wrong about that epilogue if you live long enough billits a world of epilogues richard abbott said that was the first warning i paid no attention to richard was only twelve years older than i was thats not such a big differencenot when richard was fortyeight and i was thirtysix we seemed almost like contemporaries in id been only thirteen when richard had taken me to get my first library cardthat evening when we both met miss frost at twentyfive richard abbott had seemed so debonair to meand so authoritative at thirtysix i didnt find anyone authoritativenot even larry not anymore grandpa harry while he was steadfastly goodhearted was slipping into strangeness even to me a pillar of tolerance as i saw myself harrys eccentricities had been more acceptable onstage not even mrs hadley was the authority she once seemed and while i listened to my best friend elaine who knew me so well i increasingly took elaines advice with a grain of salt after all elaine wasnt any betteror more reliablein relationships than i was i suppose if id heard from miss frosteven at the knowitall age of thirtysixi might still have found her authoritative but i didnt hear from her i did albeit cautiously heed herm hoyts advice the next time i encountered arthur that wrestler who was my age and also ran around the reservoir in central park i asked him if i was still welcome to practice my lessthanbeginnerlevel wrestling skills at the new york athletic clubthat is now that arthur understood i was a bisexual man in need of improving my selfdefense and not a real wrestler poor arthur he was one of those wellintentioned straight guys who wouldnt have dreamed of being cruelor even remotely unkindto gays arthur was a liberal openminded new yorker he not only prided himself on being fairhe was exceedingly fairbut he agonized over what was right i could see him suffering over how wrong it would be not to invite me to his wrestling club just because i waswell as uncle bob would say a little light in the loafers my very existence as a bisexual was not welcomed by my gay friends they either refused to believe that i really liked women or they felt i was somehow dishonest or hedging my bets about being gay to most straight meneven a prince among them which arthur truly wasa bisexual man was simply a gay guy the only part about being bi that even registered with straight men was the gay part that was what arthur would be up against when he talked about me to his pals at the wrestling club this was the end of the freewheeling seventies while acceptance of sexual differences wasnt necessarily the norm such acceptance was almost normal in new yorkin liberal circles such acceptance was expected but i felt responsible for the spot id put arthur in i had no knowledge of the tightassed elements in the new york athletic club in those days when the venerable old institution was an allmale bastion i have no idea what arthur had to go through just to get me a guest pass or an athletic pass to the nyac like my final draft classification or reclassification im not sure what my stupid pass to the new york athletic club was called are you crazy billy elaine asked me are you trying to get yourself killed that place is notoriously antieverything its antisemitic its antiblack it is i asked her how do you know its antiwomeni fucking know that elaine had said its an irish catholic boys club billyjust the catholic part ought to have you running for the hills i think you would like arthur i told elaine hes a good guyhe really is i suppose hes married elaine said with a sigh come to think of it i had seen a wedding ring on arthurs left hand i never fooled around with married menwith married women sometimes but not with married men i was bisexual but i was long over being conflicted i couldnt stand how conflicted married men werethat is when they were also interested in gay guys and according to larry all married men were disappointing lovers why id asked him theyre freaks about gentlenessthey must have learned to be gentle from their pushy wives those men have no idea how boring gentle is larry told me i dont think gentle is always boring i said please pardon me dear bill larry had said with that characteristically condescending wave of his hand id forgotten you were steadfastly a top i really liked larry more and more as a friend i had even grown to like how he teased me wed both been reading the memoir of a noted actora noted bi larry called him the actor claimed that all his life he had fancied older women and younger men as you might imagine the noted actor wrote when i was younger there were many older women who were available now that im olderwell of course there are many more available younger men i dont see my life as that neat i said to larry i dont imagine being bi will ever seem exactly well rounded dear bill larry saidin that way he had as if he were writing me an important letter the man is an actorhe isnt bi hes gay no wondernow that hes olderthere are many more younger men around those older women were the only women he felt safe with thats not my profile larry i told him but youre still a young man larry had cried just wait dear billjust wait it became of course a source of both comedy and concernwith the women i saw and the gay men i knewthat i regularly attended wrestling practice at the nyac my gay friends refused to believe that i had next to no homoerotic interest in the wrestlers i met at the club but my crushes on that kind of wrong person had been a phase for me perhaps a part of the comingout process well okaya slowly passing notaltogethergone phase straight men didnt often attract me at least not very much that they could sense this as arthur did had made it increasingly possible for me to have straight men for friends yet larry insisted that my wrestling practices were a kind of highenergy risky cruising donna my dear but easily offended transsexual friend dismissed what she called my duckunder fixation as the cultivation of a death wish soon after this pronouncement donna disappeared from new yorkto be followed by reports that shed been sighted in toronto as for the wrestlers at the new york athletic club they were a mixed lotin every respect not only in how they treated me my women friends elaine among them believed that it was only a matter of time before i would be beaten to a pulp but i was not once threatened or deliberately hurt at the nyac the older guys generally ignored me once someone cheerfully said when we were introduced oh youre the gay guyright but he shook my hand and patted me on the back later he always smiled and said something friendly when we saw each other we werent in the same weightclass if he was avoiding contact with meon the mat i meani wouldnt have known there was the occasional mass evacuation of the sauna when i made an afterpractice appearance there i spoke to arthur about it maybe i should steer clear of the saunado you think thats your call billythats their problem not yours arthur said i was billy to all the wrestlers i decided despite arthurs assurances to stay out of the sauna practices were at seven in the evening i became almost comfortable going to them i was not calledat least not to my facethe gay guy except for that one time i was commonly referred to as the writer most of the wrestlers hadnt read my sexually explicit novelsthose pleas for tolerance of sexual differences as richard abbott would continue to describe my booksbut arthur had read them like many men hed told me that his wife was my biggest fan i was always hearing that from men about the women in their livestheir wives their girlfriends their sisters even their mothers were my biggest fans women read fiction more than men do i would guess id met arthurs wife she was very nice she truly read a lot of fiction and i liked much of what she likedas a reader i mean her name was ellenone of those perky blondes with a pageboy cut and an absurdly small thinlipped mouth she had the kind of standup boobs that belied an otherwise unisex lookboy was she ever not my kind of girl but she was genuinely sweet to me and arthurbless his heartwas very married there would be no introducing him to elaine in fact beyond having a beer in the nyac tap room with arthur i did no socializing with the wrestlers id met at the club the wrestling room was then on the fourth floorat the opposite end of the hall from the boxing room one of my frequent workout partners in the wrestling roomjim somebody i forget his last namewas also a boxer all the wrestlers knew id had no competitive wrestling experiencethat i was there for the selfdefense aspect of the sport period in support of my selfdefense jim took me down the hall to the boxing room he tried to show me how to defend myself from being hit it was interesting i never really learned how to throw a decent punch but jim taught me how to cover uphow not to get hit so hard occasionally one of jims punches would land a little harder than hed intended he always said he was sorry in the wrestling room too i took some occasional albeit accidental punishmenta split lip a bloody nose a jammed finger or thumb because i was concentrating so hard on various ways to set up and conceal my duckunder i was banging heads a lot you more or less have to bang heads if you like being in the collartie arthur inadvertently headbutted me and i took a few stitches in the area of my right eyebrow well you should have heard larry and elaineand all the others macho man larry called me for a while youre telling me everyones friendly to youis that right billy elaine asked this was just a cordial kind of headbutt huh butthe teasing from those friends in my writing world notwithstandingi was learning a little more wrestling i was getting a lot better at the duckunder too the onemove man arthur had called me in my earliest days in that wrestling roombut as time went on i picked up a few other moves it must have been boring for the real wrestlers to have me as a workout partner but they didnt complain to my surprise three or four of the oldtimers gave me some pointers maybe they appreciated my staying out of the sauna there was a fair number of wrestlers in their fortiesa few in their fifties tough old fellas there were kids right out of college there were some olympic hopefuls and former olympians there were russians whod defected one cuban too there were many eastern europeans but only two iranians there were grecoroman guys and freestyle guys and strictly folkstyle guysthe latter were most in evidence among the kids and the oldtimers ed showed me how a crossleg pull could set up my duckunder wolfie taught me an armdrag series sonny showed me the russian armtie and a nasty lowsingle i wrote to coach hoyt about my progress herm and i both knew that i would never become a wrestlernot in my late thirtiesbut as for learning to protect myself i was learning and i liked the pm wrestling routine in my life youre becoming a gladiator larry had said for once he wasnt teasing me even elaine withheld her nearconstant fears your body is different billyyou know that dont you im not saying youre one of those gym rats who are doing it for cosmetic reasonsi know you have other reasonsbut you are starting to look a little scary elaine said i knew i wasnt scarynot to anyone but as the old decade ended and the eighties began i was aware of the passing of some ancient ingrained fears and apprehensions mind you new york was not a safe city in the eighties at least it was nowhere near as safe as its become but i personally felt saferor more secure about who i wasthan id ever felt before id even begun to think of miss frosts fears for me as groundless or else shed lived in vermont too long maybe shed been right to fear for my safety in vermont but not in new york there were times when i didnt really feel like going to wrestling practice at the nyac but arthur and many others had gone out of their way to make me feel welcome there i didnt want to disappoint them yetincreasinglyi was thinking what do you need to defend yourself for whom do you need to defend yourself from there was an effort under way to make me an official member of the new york athletic club i can barely remember the process now but it was very involved and it took a long time a lifetime membership is the way to goyou dont imagine yourself moving away from new york do you billy arthur had asked he was sponsoring my membership it would be a stretch to say i was a famous novelist butwith a fourth book about to be publishedi was at least a wellknown one nor did the money matter grandpa harry was excited that i was keepin up the wrestlinmy guess is that herm hoyt had talked to him harry said he would happily pay the fee for my lifetime membership dont put yourself out arthurno more than you already have i told him the club has been good for me but i wouldnt want you alienating people or losing friends over me youre a shooin billy arthur told me its no big deal being gay im bi i started to say i mean biits no big deal billy arthur said its not like it was no i guess it isnt i said or so it seemedas was soon to become how one decade could slide unnoticed into another was a mystery to me though this period of time was marked by the death of nils borkmanand mrs borkmans subsequent suicide they were both suicides bill grandpa harry had whispered to me over the phoneas if his phone were being tapped nils was eightyeightsoon to be eightynine had he lived till it was the regular firearm season for deerthis was shortly before christmas and nils had blown off the back of his head with a carbine while he was transversing the favorite river academy athletic fields on his crosscountry skis the students had already gone home for christmas vacation and nils had called his old adversary chuck beebethe game warden who was opposed to nils and grandpa harry making deerhunting a biathlon event poachers chuck i have with my own eyes seen themon the favorite river athletic fields i am as we speak off to hunt down them nils had urgently shouted into the phone what whoa chuck had shouted back theres poachers in deer seasonwhat are they usin machine guns or somethin nils the game warden had inquired but nils had hung up the phone when chuck found the body it appeared that the rifle had been fired while nils was withdrawing the weaponfrom behind himself chuck was willing to call the shooting an accident because hed long believed that the way nils and grandpa harry hunted deer was dangerous nils had known perfectly well what he was doing he normally hunted deer with a the lighter carbine was what grandpa harry called a varmint gun harry hunted deer with it he said deer were varmints the carbine had a shorter barrel harry knew that it was easier for nils to shoot himself in the back of the head with the but why would nils shoot himself id asked grandpa harry well billnils was norwegian grandpa harry had begun it took several minutes for harry to remember that hed not told me nils had been diagnosed with an inoperable cancer oh mrs borkman will be the next to go bill grandpa harry announced dramatically wed always joked about mrs borkman being an ibsen woman but sure enough she shot herself that same day like heddawith a handgun in the temple grandpa harry had said admiringlyin a not that much later phone call i have no doubt that losing his partner and old friend nils precipitated grandpa harrys decline of course harry had lost his wife and his only children too thus richard and i would soon venture down that assistedliving road of committing grandpa harry to the facility where harrys surprise appearances in drag would quickly wear out his welcome andstill early in as i recallrichard and i would move grandpa harry back into his river street home where richard and i hired a livein nurse to look after him elmira was the nurses name not only did she have fond memories of seeing harry onstage as a woman when elmira had been a little girl but elmira even participated in choosing grandpa harrys dressoftheday from his longhoarded stash of nana victorias clothes it was also relatively early in that year when mr hadley left mrs hadley as it turned out he ran off with a brandnew favorite river academy graduate the girl was in her freshman year of collegei cant remember where she would drop out of college in order to live with mr hadley who was sixtyonemartha hadleys age exactly mrs hadley was my mothers age she was a whopping ten years older than richard abbott but elaine must have been right in guessing that her mom had always loved richard elaine was usually right what a melodrama elaine said wearily whenas early as the summer of mrs hadley and richard started living together old hippie that she was martha hadley refused to get married again and richard im sure was happy just to be in mrs hadleys uncomplaining presence what did richard abbott care about remarrying besides they both understood that if they didnt get married they would be asked to move out of bancroft hall it may have been the start of the eighties but it was smalltown vermont and favorite river had its share of boardingschool rules an unmarried couple living together in a faculty apartment in a prep schoolwell this wouldnt quite do both mrs hadley and richard had had it with an allboys dorm elaine and i didnt doubt that its entirely possible that richard abbott and martha hadley decided they would be crazy to get married by choosing to live together in sin they got out of living in a dorm mrs hadley and richard had the summer to find a place to live in town or at least near first sistera modest house something a couple of secondaryschool teachers could afford the place they found was not more than a few doors down river street from what had once been the first sister public librarynow the historical society the house had gone through a succession of owners in recent years it needed some repairs richard told me somewhat haltingly over the phone i sensed his hesitation if it was money he needed i would have gladly given him what i could but i was surprised richard hadnt asked grandpa harry first harry loved richard and i knew that grandpa harry had given his blessing to richards living with martha hadley the house isnt more than a tenminute walk from grandpa harrys house bill richard said over the phone i could tell he was stalling what is it richard i asked him its the former frost home bill richard said given the history of the many recent and unreliable owners we both knew that no traces of miss frost could conceivably have remained miss frost was goneboth richard abbott and i knew that yet the house being the former frost home was a glimpse into the darknessthe past darkness i thought at the time i saw no foreshadow of a future darkness as for my second warning that a plague was coming i just plain missed it thered been no christmas card from the atkins family in i hadnt noticed when a card cameit was long after the holiday but the card still proclaimed seasons greetingsi remember being surprised that tom hadnt included a review of my fourth novel the book wasnt yet published but id sent atkins a copy of the galleys i thought that such a faithful fan of my writing deserved a sneak preview after all no one else was comparing me favorably to flaubert but there was nothing enclosed with the seasons greetings card which arrived sometime in february of at least i think it showed up that late i noted that the children and the dog looked older what gave me pause was how much older poor tom looked it was almost as if hed aged several years between christmases my guess was that the photo had been taken on a family ski tripeveryone was dressed for skiing and atkins even wore a ski hat theyd brought the dog skiing i marveled the kids looked tannedthe wife too remembering how fairskinned tom was he probably had to be careful about the sun thus i saw nothing amiss about tom not being tanned knowing atkins hed probably heeded the earliest alarms about skin cancer and the importance of wearing sunscreenhed always been a boy who had heeded every alarm but there was something silvery about toms skin color i thoughtnot that i could see much of his face because atkinss stupid ski hat covered his eyebrows yet i could telljust from that partial view of poor toms facethat hed lost weight quite a lot of weight i speculated but given the ski clothes i couldnt really tell maybe atkins had always been a bit hollowcheeked yet id stared at this belated christmas card for the longest time there was a look i hadnt seen before in the expression of toms wife how was it possible in a single expression to convey a fear of both the unknown and the known mrs atkinss expression reminded me of that line in madame bovaryits at the end of chapter the one that goes like a dart to a bullseye or to your heartit seemed quite inconceivable that this calm life of hers could really be the happiness of which she used to dream toms wife didnt look afraidshe seemed terrified but what could possibly have frightened her so and where was the smile that the tom atkins i knew could rarely suppress for long atkins had this goofy openmouthed smilewith lots of teeth and his tongue showing but poor tom had tightly closed his mouthlike a kid whos trying to conceal a wad of chewing gum from a teacher or like someone who knows his breath is bad for some reason id shown the atkins family photo to elaine you remember atkins i said handing her the latearriving christmas card poor tom elaine automatically said we both laughed but elaine stopped laughing when she had a look at the photograph whats the matter with himwhats he got in his mouth she asked i dont know i said hes got something in his mouth billyhe doesnt want anyone to see it elaine told me and whats the matter with those children the children i asked her id not noticed that anything was wrong with the kids they look like theyve been crying elaine explained jesusit looks like they cry all the time let me see that i said taking the photo the children looked okay to me atkins used to cry a lot i told elaine he was a real crybabymaybe the kids got it from tom come on billysomethings not normal i mean with all of them elaine said the dog looks normal i said i was just fooling around im not talking about the dog billy elaine said if your passage through the reagan years was unclouded by watching someone you knew die of aids then you dont remember those years or ronald reagan the way i do what a decade it wasand we would have that horsebackriding b actor in charge for most of it for seven of the eight years he was president reagan would not say the aids word those years have been blurred by the passage of time and by the conscious and unconscious forgetting of the worst details some decades slip by others drag on what made the eighties last forever was that my friends and lovers kept dyinginto the nineties and beyond by in new york alonemore americans had died of aids than were killed in vietnam it was some months after that february conversation elaine and i had about the atkins family photoi know it was later in when larrys young lover russell got sick i felt awful that id dismissed russell as a wall street guy id called him a poetaster too i was a snob i used to turn up my nose at the patrons larry surrounded himself with but larry was a poetpoets dont make any money why shouldnt poets and other artists have patrons pcp was the big killera pneumonia pneumocystis carinii in young russells case as it often was this pneumonia was the first presentation of aidsa young and otherwise healthylooking guy with a cough or shortness of breath and a fever it was the xray that didnt look greatin the parlance of radiologists and doctors a whiteout yet there was no suspicion of the disease there was at first the phase of not getting better on antibioticsfinally there was a biopsy or lung lavage which showed the cause to be pcp that insidious pneumonia they usually put you on bactrim thats what russell was taking russell was the first aids patient i watched waste awayand dont forget russell had money and he had larry many writers who knew larry saw him as spoiled and selfcenteredeven pompous i shamefully include my former self in this category of lawrence upton observers but larry was one of those people who improve in a crisis it should be me bill larry told me when i first paid a visit to russell ive had a liferussell is just beginning his russell was placed in hospice care in his own magnificent chelsea brownstone he had his own nurse all this was new to me thenthat russell had chosen not to go on a breathing machine allowed him to be cared for at home intubating at home is problematic its easier to hook a person up to a ventilator in a hospital i later saw and remembered that gob of xylocaine jelly on the tip of the endotracheal tube but not in russells case he wasnt intubated not at home i remember larry feeding russell i could see the cheesy patches of candida in russells mouth and his whitecoated tongue russell had been a beautiful young man his face would soon be disfigured with kaposis sarcoma lesions a violetcolored lesion dangled from one of russells eyebrows where it resembled a fleshy misplaced earlobe another purplish lesion drooped from russells nose the latter was so strikingly prominent that russell later chose to hide it behind a bandanna larry told me that russell referred to himself as the turkeybecause of the kaposis sarcoma lesions why are they so young bill larry kept asking mewhen they the sheer number of young men who were dying in new york had made us realize that russell was just the beginning we saw russell age in just a few monthshis hair thinned his skin turned leaden he was often covered with a cooltothetouch film of sweat and his fevers went on forever the candida went down his throat into the esophagus russell had difficulty swallowing and his lips were crusted white and fissured the lymph nodes in his neck bulged he could scarcely breathe but russell refused to go on a ventilator or to a hospital in the end he faked taking the bactrimlarry would find the tablets scattered in russells bed russell died in larrys arms im sure larry wished it had been the other way around he weighed nothing larry said by then larry and i were already visiting friends at st vincents hospital as larry predicted it would get so crowded at st vincents that you couldnt go to visit a friend or a former lover and not encounter someone else you knew you would glance in a doorway and there was someone you hadnt known was sick in more than one instance larry claimed hed spotted someone he hadnt known was gay women found out that their husbands had been seeing menonly when their husbands were dying parents learned that their young male children were dying before they knew or had figured out that their kids were gay only a few women friends of mine were infectednot many i was terrified about elaine shed slept with some men i knew were bisexual but two abortions had taught elaine to insist on condoms she was of the opinion that nothing else could keep her from getting pregnant wed had an earlier condom conversation when the aids epidemic started elaine had asked me youre still a condom guyright billy since id told her i should be dead larry said he wasnt sick he looked fine i wasnt sick either we kept our fingers crossed it was still in near the end of the year when there was that bleeding episode in the wrestling room at the new york athletic club im not sure if all the wrestlers knew that the aids virus was mainly transmitted by blood and semen because there was a time when hospital workers were afraid they could catch it from a cough or a sneeze but that day i got a nosebleed in the wrestling room everyone already knew enough to be scared shitless of blood it often happens in wrestling you dont know youre bleeding until you see your blood on your opponent i was working out with sonny when i saw the blood on sonnys shoulder i backed away youre bleeding i started to say then i saw sonnys face he was staring at my nosebleed i put my hand to my face and saw the bloodon my hand on my chest on the mat oh its me i said but sonny had left the wrestling roomrunning the locker room where the training room was was on another floor go get the trainer billytell him weve got blood here arthur told me all the wrestlers had stopped wrestling no one would touch the blood on the mat normally a nosebleed was no big deal you just wiped off the mat with a towel blood in a wrestling room used to be of no importance sonny had already sent the trainer to the wrestling room the trainer arrived with rubber gloves on and with towels soaked in alcohol minutes later i saw sonny standing under the shower in the locker roomhe was wearing his wrestling gear even his shoes in the shower i emptied out my locker before i took a shower i wanted to give sonny time to finish showering before i went anywhere near the shower room i was betting that sonny hadnt told the trainer that the writer had bled in the wrestling room sonny must have told him that the gay guy was bleeding i know thats what i would have said to the trainer at that time arthur saw me only when i was leaving the locker room id showered and dressed and i had some cautionary cotton balls stuffed up both nostrilsnot a drop of blood in sight but i was carrying a green plastic garbage bag with the entire contents of my locker i got the garbage bag from a guy in the equipment room boy did he look happy i was leaving are you okay billy arthur asked me someone would keep asking me that questionfor about fourteen or fifteen years im going to withdraw my application for lifetime membership arthurif thats okay with you i said the dress code at this place is a nuisance for a writer i dont wear a coat and tie when i write yet i have to put on a coat and tie just to get in the front door hereonly to get undressed to wrestle i totally understand billy i just hope youre going to be okay arthur said i cant belong to a club with such an uptight dress code its all wrong for a writer i told him some of the other wrestlers were showing up in the locker room after practiceed and wolfie and jim my former workout partners among them everyone saw me holding the green plastic garbage bag i didnt have to tell them it was my last wrestling practice i left the club by the back door to the lobby you look odd carrying a garbage bag on central park south i went out of the new york athletic club on west fiftyeighth street where there were a few narrow alleys that served as delivery entrances to the hotels on central park south i knew i would find a dumpster for my garbage bag and what amounted to my life as a beginning wrestler in the dawn of the aids crisis it was shortly after the inglorious nosebleed had ended my wrestling career that larry and i were having dinner downtown and he told me hed heard that bottoms were more likely to get sick than tops i knew tops who had it but more bottoms got itthis was true i never knew how larry managed to have heard everything but he heard right most of the time blow jobs arent too terribly risky billjust so you know larry was the first person to tell me that of course larry seemed to know or he assumed that the number of sex partners in your life was a factor ironically i didnt hear about the condom factor from larry larry had responded to russells death by seeking to help every young man he knew who was dying larry had an admirably stronger stomach for visiting the aids patients we knew at st vincents and in hospice care than i did i could sense myself withdrawing just as i was aware of people shrinking away from menot only my fellow wrestlers rachel had retreated immediately she may think she can catch the disease from your writing billy elaine told me elaine and i had talked about getting out of new york but the problem with living in new york for any length of time is that many new yorkers cant imagine that theres anywhere else they could live as more of our friends contracted the virus elaine and i would imagine ourselves with one or another of the aidsassociated opportunistic illnesses elaine developed night sweats i woke up imagining i could feel the white plaques of candida encroaching on my teeth i admitted to elaine that i often woke up at night and peered into my mouth in a mirrorwith a flashlight and there was that seborrheic dermatitis it was flaky and greasylookingit cropped up mostly on your eyebrows and scalp and on the sides of your nose herpes could run wild on your lips the ulcers simply wouldnt heal there were also those clusters of molluscum they looked like smallpoxthey could completely cover your face and theres a certain smell your hair has when it is matted by your sweat and flattened by your pillow its not just how translucentlooking and funnysmelling your hair is its the salt that dries and hardens on your forehead from the unremitting fever and the incessant sweating its your mucous membranes toothey get chockfull of yeast its a yeasty but at the same time fruity smellthe way curd smells or mildew or a dogs ears when theyre wet i wasnt afraid of dying i was afraid of feeling guilty forever because i wasnt dying i couldnt accept that i would or might escape the aids virus for as accidental a reason as being told to wear a condom by a doctor who disliked me or that the random luck of my being a top would or might save me i was not ashamed of my sex life i was ashamed of myself for not wanting to be there for the people who were dying im not good at this you are i told larry i meant more than the handholding and the pep talks cryptococcal meningitis was caused by a fungus it affected your brain and was diagnosed by a lumbar punctureit presented with fever and headache and confusion there was a separate spinalcord disease a myelopathy that caused progressive weaknessloss of function in your legs incontinence there was little one could do about itvacuolar myelopathy it was called i was watching larry empty the bedpan of our friend who had this awful myelopathy i was truly marveling at larryhed become a saintwhen i suddenly realized that i had no difficulty pronouncing the myelopathy word or any of the other aidsassociated words that pneumocystis pneumonia for examplei could actually say it kaposis sarcoma those terrible lesions gave me no pronunciation problem i could say cryptococcal meningitis as if it meant no more to me than the common cold i didnt even hesitate to pronounce cytomegalovirusa major cause of blindness in aids i should call your mother i told elaine i seem to be having a pronunciation breakthrough its just because youre distancing yourself from this disease billy elaine said youre like meyoure imagining yourself as standing on the outside looking in i should call your mother i repeated but i knew elaine was right lets hear you say penis billy thats not fair elainethats different say it elaine said but i knew how it would sound it was is and will always be penith to me some things never change i didnt try to say the penis word for elaine cock i said to her i didnt call mrs hadley about my pronunciation breakthrough either i was trying to distance myself from the diseaseeven as the epidemic was only beginning i was already feeling guilty that i didnt have it the atkins christmas card came on time that year no generic seasons greetings more than a month late but an unapologetic merry christmas in december uhoh elaine said when i showed her the atkins family photo wheres tom atkins wasnt in the picture the names of the family were printed on the christmas card in small capitals tom sue peter emily jacques atkins jacques was the labrador atkins had named the dog after kittredge but tom had missed the family photograph maybe he wasnt feeling very photogenic i said to elaine his color wasnt so hot last christmas was it and hed lost all that weight elaine said the ski hat was hiding his hair and his eyebrows i added thered been no tom atkins review of my fourth novel id noticed i doubted that atkins had changed his mind about madame bovary shit billy elaine said what do you make of the message the message which was written by hand on the back of the christmas photo was from the wife there was not a lot of information in it and it wasnt very christmasy tom has mentioned you he would like to see you sue atkins i think hes dyingthats what i think i told elaine ill go with you billytom always liked me elaine said elaine was rightpoor tom had always adored her and mrs hadleyand not unlike old times i felt braver in elaines company if atkins was dying of aids i was pretty sure his wife would already know everything about that summer twenty years ago when tom and i were in europe together that night i called sue atkins it turned out that tom had been placed in hospice care at his home in short hills new jersey id never known what atkins did but his wife told me that tom had been a ceo at a lifeinsurance company hed worked in new york city five days a week for more than a decade i guessed that hed never felt like seeing me for lunch or dinner but i was surprised when sue atkins said that shed thought her husband had been seeing me apparently there were nights when tom hadnt made it back to new jersey in time for dinner it wasnt me he was seeing i told mrs atkins i mentioned that elaine wanted to visit tom tooif we werent intruding was how id put it before i could explain who elaine was sue atkins said yes that would be all rightive heard all about elaine i didnt ask mrs atkins what shed heard about me elaine was teaching that termgrading final papers i explained on the phone perhaps we could come to short hills on a saturday there wouldnt be all the commuters on the train i was thinking the children will be home from school but that will be fine with tom sue said certainly peter knows who you are that trip to europe her voice just stopped peter knows whats going on and hes devoted to his father mrs atkins began again but emilywell shes younger im not sure how much emily really knows you cant do much to counter what your kids hear in school from the other kidsnot if your kids wont tell you what the other kids are saying im sorry for what youre going through i told toms wife i always knew this might happen tom was candid about his past sue atkins said i just didnt know hed gone back there and this terrible disease her voice stopped again i was looking at the christmas card while we spoke on the phone im not good at guessing young girls ages i wasnt sure how old emily was i just knew she was the younger child i was estimating that the boy peter atkins would have been fourteen or fifteenabout the same age poor tom had been when id first met him and thought he was a loser who couldnt even pronounce the time word atkins had told me hed called me bill instead of billy because he noticed that richard abbott always called me bill and anyone could see how much i loved richard poor tom had also confessed to me that hed overheard martha hadleys outburst when i was seeing mrs hadley in her office and atkins had been waiting for his turn billy billyyouve done nothing wrong mrs hadley had cried loud enough for atkins to have heard her through the closed door it was when id told martha hadley about my crushes on other boys and men including my slightly fading crush on richard and my much more devastating crush on kittredge poor tom told me that hed thought i was having an affair with mrs hadley i actually believed youd just ejaculated in her office or something and she was trying to assure you that youd done nothing wrongthats what i thought she meant by the wrong word bill atkins had confessed to me what an idiot you are id told him now i felt ashamed i asked sue atkins how tom was doingi meant those opportunistic illnesses i already knew something about and what drugs tom was taking when she said hed developed a rash from the bactrim i knew poor tom was being treated for the pneumocystis pneumonia since tom was in hospice care at home he wasnt on a ventilator his breathing would be harsh and aspiratei knew that too sue atkins also said something about how hard it was for tom to eat he has trouble swallowing she told me just telling me this made her suppress a cough or perhaps shed gagged she suddenly sounded short of breath from the candidahe cant eat i asked her yes its esophageal candidiasis mrs atkins said the terminology sounding ohsofamiliar to her andthis is fairly recenttheres a hickman catheter sue explained how recent is the hickman i asked mrs atkins oh just the last month she told me so they were feeding him through the cathetermalnutrition with candida difficulty swallowing usually responded to fluconazole or amphotericin bunless the yeast had become resistant if they have you on a hickman for hyperalimentation feeding bill youre probably starving larry had told me i kept thinking about the boy peter in the christmas photo he reminded me of the tom atkins id known i imagined that peter might be what poor tom himself had once described as like us i was wondering if atkins had noticed that his son was like us that was how tom had put it years ago not everyone here understands people like us hed said and id wondered if atkins was making a pass at me it had been the first pass that a boy like me ever made at me bill sue atkins said sharply on the phone i realized i was crying sorry i said dont you dare cry around us when you come here mrs atkins said this family is all cried out dont let me cry i told elaine on that saturday not long before christmas the holiday shoppers were headed the other way into new york city there was almost no one on the train to short hills new jersey on that december saturday how am i supposed to stop you from crying billy i dont have a guni cant shoot you elaine said i was feeling a little jumpy about the gun word elmira the nurse richard abbott and i had hired to look after grandpa harry ceaselessly complained to richard about the gun it was a mossberg carbine leveractionthe same type of shortbarreled rifle nils had used to kill himself i cant remember but i think nils had a winchester or a savage and it wasnt a leveraction i just know it was also a carbine elmira had complained about grandpa harry excessively cleanin the damn mossberg apparently harry would clean the gun in nana victorias clotheshe got gun oil on a lot of her dresses it was all the drycleaning that upset elmira hes not out shootinno more deerhuntin on skis not at his age hes promised mebut he just keeps cleanin and cleanin the damn mossberg she told richard richard had asked grandpa harry about it theres no point in havin a gun if you dont keep it clean harry had said but perhaps you could wear your clothes when you clean it harry richard had said you knowjeans an old flannel shirt something elmira doesnt have to get drycleaned harry hadnt respondedthat is not to richard but grandpa harry told elmira not to worry if i shoot myself elmira i promise i wont leave you with any friggin drycleanin now of course both elmira and richard were worried about grandpa harry shooting himself and i kept thinking about that superclean yes i was worried about grandpa harrys intentions too butto be honest with youi was relieved to know the damn mossberg was ready for action to be very honest with you i wasnt worrying about grandpa harry as much as i was worrying about me if i got the disease i knew what i was going to do vermont boy that i am i wouldnt have hesitated i was planning to head home to first sisterto grandpa harrys house on river street i knew where he kept that i knew where harry stashed his ammunition what my grandpa called a varmint gun was good enough for me in this frame of mind and determined not to cry i showed up in short hills new jersey to pay a visit to my dying friend tom atkins whom id not seen for twenty yearsvirtually half my life ago with half a brain i might have anticipated that the boy peter would be the one to answer the door i should have expected to be greeted by a shocking physical resemblance to tom atkinsas i first knew himbut i was speechless its the son billysay something elaine whispered in my ear of course i was already struggling to make an effort not to cry hiim elaine this is billy elaine said to the boy with the carrotcolored hair you must be peter were old friends of your dad yes weve been expecting youplease come in peter said politely the boy had just turned fifteen hed applied to the lawrenceville school for what would be his sophomore year and he was waiting to hear if he got in we werent sure what time you were coming but now is a good time peter atkins was saying as he led elaine and me inside i wanted to hug the boyhed used the time word twice he had no trace of a pronunciation problembut under the circumstances i knew enough not to touch him off to one side of the lavish vestibule was a rather formallooking dining roomwhere absolutely no one ate or had ever eaten i was thinkingwhen the boy told us that charles had just left charles is my dads nurse peter was explaining charles comes to take care of the catheteryou have to keep flushing out the catheter or it will clot off peter told elaine and me clot off i repeatedmy first words in the atkins house elaine elbowed me in my ribs my mom is resting but shell be right down the boy was saying i dont know where my sister is we had stopped alongside a closed door in a downstairs hall this used to be my fathers study peter atkins said the boy was hesitating before he opened the door but our bedrooms are upstairsdad cant climb stairs peter continued not opening the door if my sister is in here with him she may screamshes only thirteen about to be fourteen the boy told elaine and me he had his hand on the doorknob but he wasnt ready to let us in i weigh about a hundred and forty pounds peter atkins said as matteroffactly as he could manage my dads lost some weight since youve seen him the boy said he weighs almost a hundredmaybe ninetysomething pounds then he opened the door it broke my heart elaine told me later how that boy was trying to prepare us but as i was only beginning to learn about that goddamn disease there was no way to be prepared for it oh there she ismy sister emily peter atkins said when he finally let us enter the room where his dad lay dying the dog jacques was a chocolate labrador with a graywhite muzzlean old dog i could tell not only by his grizzled nose and jaws but by how slowly and unsteadily the dog came out from under the hospital bed to greet us one of his hind legs slipped a little on the floor his tail wagged only slightly as if it hurt his hips to wag his tail at all jacques is almost thirteen peter told elaine and me but thats pretty old for a dogand he has arthritis the dogs cold wet nose touched my hand and then elaines that was all the old lab had wanted there was a subsequent thump when the dog lay down under the bed again the girl emily was curled up like a second dog at the foot of her fathers hospital bed it was probably of some small comfort to tom that his daughter was keeping his feet warm it was an indescribable exertion for atkins to breathe i knew that his hands and feet would be coldthe circulation to toms extremities was closing down trying to shunt blood to his brain emilys reaction to elaine and me was delayed she sat up and screamed but belatedly shed been reading a book which flew from her hands the sound of its fluttering pages was lost to the girls scream i saw an oxygen tank in the cluttered roomwhat had been atkinss study as his son had explained now converted for a deathwatch i also observed that his daughters scream had little effect on tom atkinshed barely moved in the hospital bed it probably hurt him to turn his head yet his bare chest while the rest of his shrunken body lay still was vigorously heaving the hickman catheter dangled from the right side of toms chest where it had been inserted under his clavicle it tunneled under the skin a few inches above the nipple and entered the subclavian vein below the collarbone these are dads old friends from school emily peter said irritably to his little sister you knew they were coming the girl stalked across the room to her farflung book when shed retrieved it she turned and glared emily definitely glared at me she may have been glaring at her brother and elaine too when the thirteenyearold spoke i felt certain she was speaking only to me though elaine would try in vain to assure me later on the train that toms daughter had been addressing both of us i dont think so are you sick too emily asked no im notim sorry i answered her the girl then marched out of the room tell mom theyre here emily tell mom peter called after his angry sister i will we heard the girl shout is that you bill tom atkins asked i saw him try to move his head and i stepped closer to the bed bill abbottare you here atkins asked his voice was weak and terribly labored his lungs made a thick gurgling the oxygen tank must have been for only occasional and superficial relief there probably was a mask but i didnt see itthe oxygen was in lieu of a ventilator morphine would come next at the end stage yes its mebilland elaine is with me tom i told atkins i touched his hand it was icecold and clammy i could see poor toms face now that greasylooking seborrheic dermatitis was in his scalp on his eyebrows and flaking off the sides of his nose elaine too atkins gasped elaine and bill are you all right bill he asked me yes im all right i told him id never felt so ashamed to be all right there was a tray of medications and other intimidatinglooking stuff on the bedside table i would remember the heparin solution for some reasonit was for flushing out the hickman catheter i saw the white cheesy curds of the candida crusting the corners of poor toms mouth i did not recognize him billy elaine would say later when we were returning to new york yet how do you recognize a grown man who weighs only ninetysomething pounds tom atkins and i were thirtynine but he resembled a man in his sixties his hair was not only translucent and thinwhat there was of it was completely gray his eyes were sunken in their sockets his temples deeply dented his cheeks caved in poor toms nostrils were pinched tightly together as if he could already detect the stench of his own cadaver and his taut skin which had once been so ruddy was an ashen color hippocratic facies was the term for that neardeath facethat tightly fitted mask of death which so many of my friends and lovers who died of aids would one day wear it was skin stretched over a skull the skin was so improbably hard and tense you were sure it was going to split i was holding one of toms cold hands and elaine was holding the other onei could see elaine trying not to stare at the hickman catheter in atkinss bare chestwhen we heard the dry cough for a moment i imagined that poor tom had died and his cough had somehow escaped his body but i saw the sons eyes peter knew that cough and where it came from the boy turned to the open doorway of the roomwhere his mother now stood coughing it didnt sound like all that serious a cough but sue atkins was having trouble stopping it elaine and i had heard that cough before the earliest stages of pneumocystis pneumonia dont sound too bad the shortness of breath and the fever were often worse than the cough yes i have it sue atkins said she was controlling the cough but she couldnt stop it in my case its just starting mrs atkins said she was definitely short of breath i infected her billthats the story tom atkins said peter whod been so poised was trying to slip sideways past his mother into the hall noyou stay here peter you need to hear what your father has to say to bill sue atkins told her son the boy was crying now but he backed into the room still looking at the doorway which his mom was blocking i dont want to stay i dont want to hear the boy began he was shaking his head as if this were a proven method to make himself stop crying peteryou have to stay you have to listen tom atkins said peter is why i wanted to see you bill tom said to me bill has some discernible traces of moral responsibilitydoesnt he elaine tom suddenly asked her i mean bills writingat least his writing has discernible traces of moral responsibility doesnt it i dont really know bill anymore atkins admitted tom couldnt say more than three or four words without needing to take a breath moral responsibility i repeated yes he doesbilly takes moral responsibility i think so elaine said i dont mean only in your writing billy elaine added i dont have to stayive heard this before sue atkins suddenly said you dont have to stay either elaine we can go try to talk to emily shes a challenge to talk to but shes better with women than she is with menas a rule emily really hates men mrs atkins said emily screams almost every time she sees a man peter explained he had stopped crying okay ill come with you elaine said to sue atkins im not all that crazy about most men eitheri just dont like women at all usually thats interesting mrs atkins said ill come back when its time to say goodbye elaine called to tom as she was leaving but atkins seemed to ignore the goodbye reference its amazing how easy time becomeswhen theres no more of it bill tom began where is charleshe should be here shouldnt he peter atkins asked his dad just look at this room why is that old oxygen tank still here the oxygen doesnt help him anymore the boy explained to me your lungs need to work in order to have any benefit from oxygen if you cant breathe in how are you going to get the oxygen thats what charles says peter please stop tom atkins said to his son i asked charles for a little privacycharles will be back soon youre talking too much daddy the boy said you know what happens when you try to talk too much i want to talk to bill about you peter his father said this part is crazythis part makes no sense peter said tom atkins seemed to be hoarding his remaining breath before he spoke to me i want you to keep an eye on my boy when im gone billespecially if peter is like us but even if he isnt why me tom i asked him you dont have any children do you atkins asked me all im asking you is to keep one eye on one kid i dont know what to do about emilyyou might not be the best choice for someone to look after emily no no no the boy suddenly said emily stays with meshe goes where i go youll have to talk her into it peter and you know how stubborn she is atkins said it was harder and harder for poor tom to get enough breath when i diewhen your mom is dead tooits this man here i want you talking to peter not your grandfather id met toms parents at our graduation from favorite river his father had taken a despairing look at me hed refused to shake my hand that was peters grandfather he hadnt called me a fag but id felt him thinking it my father is very unsophisticated atkins had told me at the time he should meet my mom was all id said now tom was asking me to be his sons advicegiver tom atkins had never been much of a realist not your grandfather atkins said a second time to peter no no no the boy repeated hed started to cry again tom i dont know how to be a fatherive had no experience i said and i might get sick too yes peter atkins cried what if bill or billy or whatever his name is gets sick i think i better have a little oxygen billpeter knows how to do it dont you peter tom asked his son yesof course i know how to do it the boy said he immediately stopped crying charles is the one who should be giving you oxygen daddyand it wont work anyway the fifteenyearold cried you just think the oxygen is getting to your lungs it really isnt i saw the oxygen mask thenpeter knew where it wasand while the boy attended to the oxygen tank tom atkins smiled proudly at me peter is a wonderful boy atkins said i saw that tom couldnt look at his son when he said this or he would have lost his composure atkins was managing to hold himself together by looking at me similarly when atkins spoke i could manage to hold myself together only by looking at his fifteenyearold son besides as i would say later to elaine peter looked more like tom atkins to me than atkins even remotely looked like himself you werent this assertive when i knew you tom i said but i kept my eyes on peter the boy was very gently fitting the oxygen mask to his fathers unrecognizable face what does assertive mean peter asked me his father laughed the laugh made atkins gasp and cough but hed definitely laughed what i mean by assertive is that your dad is someone who takes charge of a situationhes someone who has confidence in a situation that many people lack confidence in i said to the boy i couldnt believe i was saying this about the tom atkins id known but at this moment it was true is that any better peter asked his father who was struggling to breathe the oxygen tom was working awfully hard for very little relief or so it seemed to me but atkins managed to nod at his sons questionall the while never taking his eyes off me i dont think the oxygen makes a difference peter atkins said the boy was examining me more closely than before i saw atkins inch his forearm across the bed he nudged his son with that arm so the boy began as if this were his idea as if his dad hadnt already said to him when my old friend bill is here you be sure to ask him about the summer we spent in europe together or words to that effect so the boy started again i understand that you and my dad traveled all over europe together sowhat was that like i knew i would burst into tears if i so much as glanced at tom atkinswho laughed again and coughed and gaspedso i just kept looking at toms carrothaired likeness his darling fifteenyearold son and i said as if i were also following a script first of all i was trying to read this book but your dad wouldnt let menot unless i read the whole book out loud to him you read a whole book out loud to him peter exclaimed in disbelief we were both nineteen but he made me read the entire novelout loud and your father hated the bookhe was actually jealous of one of the characters he simply didnt want me to spend a single minute alone with her i explained to peter the boy was thoroughly delighted now i knew what i was doingi was auditioning i guess that the oxygen was working a littleor it was working in toms mindbecause atkins had closed his eyes and he was smiling it was almost the same goofy smile i remembered if you could ignore the candida how can you be jealous of a woman in a novel peter atkins asked me this was only makebelievea madeup story right right i told peter and shes a miserable woman shes unhappy all the time and she eventually poisons herself and dies your dad even detested this womans feet her feet the boy exclaimed laughing more peter we heard his mother calling come herelet your father rest but my audition was doomed from the start it was entirely orchestratedthe whole thing was rehearsed you know that dont you billy elaine would ask me later when we were on the train i know that now i would tell her i didnt know it then peter left the room just as i was getting started id had much more to say about that summer tom atkins and i spent in europe but suddenly young peter was gone i thought poor tom was asleep but hed moved the oxygen mask away from his mouth and nose andwith his eyes still closedhe found my wrist with his cold hand at first touch id thought his hand was the old dogs nose tom atkins wasnt smiling now he must have known we were alone i believe atkins also knew that the oxygen wasnt working i think he knew that it would never work again his face was wet with tears is there eternal darkness bill atkins asked me is there a monsters face waiting there no no tom i tried to assure him its either just darknessno monster no anythingor its very bright truly the most amazing light and there are lots of wonderful things to see no monsters either wayright bill poor tom asked me thats right tomno monsters either way i was aware of someone behind me in the doorway of the room it was peter hed come backi didnt know how long hed been there or what hed overheard is the monsters face in the darkness in that same book the boy asked me is the face also makebelieve ha atkins cried thats a good question peter what do you say to that bill there was a convulsion of coughing then and more violent gasping the boy ran to his dad and helped him put the oxygen mask back over his nose and mouth but the oxygen was ineffective atkinss lungs werent functioning properlyhe couldnt draw enough air to help himself is this a test tom i asked my old friend what do you want from me peter atkins just stood there watching us he helped his father pull the oxygen mask away from his mouth when youre dying everything is a test bill youll see tom said with his sons help atkins was putting the oxygen mask back in place but he suddenly stopped the seemingly pointless process its a madeup story peter i told the boy the unhappy woman who poisons herselfeven her feet are made up its makebelievethe monsters face in the darkness too its all imagined i said but this isnt imagined is it the boy asked me my mom and my dad are dyingthat isnt imagined is it no i told him you can always find me peter i suddenly said to the boy ill be available to youi promise there peter criednot to me to his dad i got him to say it does that make you happy it doesnt make me happy the boy cried peter his mom was calling let your father rest peter im coming the boy called he ran out of the room tom atkins had closed his eyes again let me know when were alone bill he gasped he held the oxygen mask away from his mouth and nose but i could tell thatas little as the oxygen helpedhe wanted it were alone i told atkins ive seen him tom whispered hoarsely hes not at all who we thought he washes more like us than we ever imagined hes beautiful bill whos beautifulwhos more like us than we ever imagined tom i asked but i knew that the subject had changed thered been only one person tom and i had always spoken of with fear and secrecy with love and hatred you know who billive seen him atkins whispered kittredge i whispered back atkins covered his mouth and nose with the oxygen mask he was nodding yes but it hurt him to move his head and he was making a torturous endeavor just to breathe kittredge is gay i asked tom atkins but this stimulated a prolonged coughing fit which was followed by a selfcontradictory nodding and shaking of his head with my help atkins lifted the oxygen mask away from his mouth and nosealbeit briefly kittredge looks exactly like his mother atkins gasped then he was back on the mask making the most horrible sucking sounds i didnt want to agitate him more than my presence already had atkins had closed his eyes again though his face was frozen in more of a grimace than a smile when i heard elaine calling me i found elaine with mrs atkins and the children in the kitchen he shouldnt be on the oxygen if no ones watching himnot for long anyway sue atkins said when she saw me no momthats not quite what charles says peter corrected her we just have to keep checking the tank for gods sake peterplease stop criticizing me mrs atkins cried this made her breathless that old tank is probably empty oxygen doesnt really help him she coughed and coughed charles shouldnt allow the oxygen tank to be empty the boy said indignantly daddy doesnt know the oxygen doesnt help himsometimes he thinks it helps i hate charles the girl emily said dont hate charles emilywe need charles sue atkins said trying to catch her breath i looked at elaine i felt truly lost it surprised me that emily was sitting next to elaine on a couch facing the kitchen tv which was off the girl was curled up beside elaine who had her arm around the thirteenyearolds shoulders tom believes in your character bill mrs atkins said to me as if my character had been under discussion for hours tom hasnt known you for twenty years yet he believes he can judge your character by the novels you write which are made up which are makebelieveright peter asked me please dont peter sue atkins said tiredly still struggling to suppress that notsoinnocent cough thats right peter i said all this time i thought tom was seeing him sue atkins said to elaine pointing at me but tom must have been seeing that other guythe one you were all so crazy about i dont think so i said to mrs atkins tom told me he had seen himnot that he was seeing him theres a difference well what do i know im just the wife sue atkins said do you mean kittredge billyis that who she means elaine asked me yes thats his namekittredge i think tom was in love with himi guess you all were mrs atkins said she was a little feverish or maybe it was the drugs she was takingi couldnt tell i knew the bactrim had given poor tom a rash i didnt know where i had only a vague idea of what other side effects were possible with bactrim i just knew that sue atkins had pneumocystis pneumonia so she was probably taking bactrim and she definitely had a fever mrs atkins seemed numb as if she were barely aware that her children emily and peter were right there with usin the kitchen heyits just me a mans voice called from the vestibule the girl emily screamedbut she didnt detach herself from elaines encompassing arm its just charles emily her brother peter said i know its charlesi hate him emily said stop it both of you their mother said whos kittredge peter atkins asked i would like to know who he is too sue atkins said gods gift to men and women i guess what did tom say about kittredge billy elaine asked me id been hoping to have this conversation on the train where we would be aloneor not to have it ever tom said he had seen kittredgethats all i told elaine but i knew that wasnt all i didnt know what atkins had meantthat kittredge was not at all who we thought he was that kittredge was more like us than we ever imagined that poor tom thought kittredge was beautifulwell that i had no trouble imagining but atkins had seemed to indicate that kittredge was and wasnt gay according to tom kittredge looked exactly like his mother i wasnt about to tell elaine that how could kittredge look exactly like mrs kittredge i was wondering emily screamed it must be charles the nurse i thought but noit was jacques the dog the old lab was standing there in the kitchen its just jacques emilyhes a dog not a man peter said disdainfully to his sister but the girl wouldnt stop screaming leave her alone peter jacques is a male dogmaybe that did it mrs atkins said but when emily didnt or couldnt stop screaming sue atkins said to elaine and me well it is unusual to see jacques anywhere but at toms bedside since tom got sick that dog wont leave him we have to drag jacques outside to pee we have to offer jacques a treat just to get him to come to the kitchen and eat peter atkins was explaining while his sister went on screaming imagine a lab you have to force to eat sue atkins said she suddenly looked again at the old dog and started screaming now emily and mrs atkins were both screaming it must be tom billysomethings happened elaine said over the screaming either peter atkins heard her or hed figured it out by himselfhe was clearly a smart boy daddy the boy called but his mother grabbed him and clutched him to her wait for charles petercharles is with him mrs atkins managed to say though her shortness of breath had worsened jacques the labrador sat there just breathing elaine and i chose not to wait for charles we left the kitchen and ran along the downstairs hall to the nowopen door to toms onetime study jacques whofor a hesitant secondseemed of a mind to follow us stayed behind on the kitchen floor the old dog must have known that his master had departed elaine and i entered the transformed room where we saw charles bent over the body on the hospital bed which the nurse had elevated to ease his task charles kept his head down he did not look up at elaine and me though it was clear to us both that the nurse knew we were there i was horribly reminded of a man id seen a few times at the mineshaft that sm club on washington streetat little west twelfth in the meatpacking district larry would tell me the club was closed by the citys department of health but that wouldnt be till four years after aids first appearedwhich was when elaine and i were conducting our experiment in living together in san francisco the mineshaft had a lot of disquieting action going on there was a sling for fistfucking suspended from the ceiling there was a whole wall of glory holes there was a room with a bathtub where men were pissed on the man charles closely resembled was a tattooed muscleman with ivorypale skin he had a shavedbald head with a black patch of whiskers on the point of his chin and two diamondstud earrings he wore a black leather vest and a jockstrap and a wellshined pair of motorcycle boots and his job at the mineshaft was to dispatch people who needed dispatching he was called mephistopheles on his nights off from the mineshaft he would hang out at a gay black bar called kellers i think kellers was on west street on the corner of barrow near the christopher street pier but i never went thereno white guys i knew did the story id heard at the mineshaft was that mephistopheles went to kellers to fuck black guys or to pick fights with them and it didnt matter to mephistopheles which he did the fucking and the fighting were all the same to him which was no doubt why he fit right in at an sm joint like the mineshaft yet the male nurse who was attending so carefully to my dead friend was not that same mephistophelesnor were the ministrations charles made to poor toms remains of a deviant or sexual nature charles was fussing over the hickman catheter dangling from atkinss unmoving chest poor tommyits not my job to remove the hickman the nurse explained to elaine and me the undertaker will pull it out you see theres a cuffits like a velcro collar around the tubejust inside the point where it enters the skin tommys cells his skin and body cells have grown into that velcro mesh thats what keeps the catheter in place so it doesnt fall out or get tugged loose all the undertaker has to do is give it a very firm jerk and out it comes charles told us elaine looked away maybe we shouldnt have left tom alone i told the nurse lots of people want to die alone the nurse said i know tommy wanted to see youi know he had something to say ill bet he said it right charles asked me he looked up at me and smiled he was a strong goodlooking man with a crew cut and one silver earringin the upper cartilaginous part of his left ear he was cleanshaven and when he smiled charles looked nothing at all like the man i knew as mephistophelesa mineshaft thugenforcer yes i think tom said what he had to say i told charles he wanted me to keep an eye on peter yes wellgood luck with that im guessing thatll be up to peter charles said id not been entirely wrong to mistake him for a bouncer at the mineshaft charles had some of the same cavalier qualities no no no we could hear young peter crying all the way from the kitchen the girl emily had stopped screaming so had her mom charles was unseasonably dressed for december in new jersey the tight black tshirt showing off his muscles and his tattoos it didnt seem that the oxygen was working i said to charles it was working only a little the problem with pcp is that its diffuse it affects both lungs and it affects your ability to get oxygen into your blood vesselshence into your body the nurse explained toms hands were so cold elaine said tommy didnt want the ventilator charles continued he appeared to be done with the hickman catheter the nurse was washing the crusted candida from the area of atkinss mouth i want to clean him up before sue and the kids see him charles said and mrs atkinsher cough i said its just going to get worse right its a dry coughsometimes its no cough people make too much of the cough its the shortness of breath that gets worse the nurse told me tommy just ran out of breath charles said charleswe want to see him mrs atkins was calling no no no peter kept crying i hate you charles emily shouted from the kitchen i know you do honey charles called back just give me a secondall of you i bent over atkins and kissed his clammy forehead i underestimated him i said to elaine dont cry now billy elaine told me i tensed up suddenly because i thought charles was going to hug me or kiss meor perhaps only push me away from the raised bedbut he was merely trying to give me his business card call me william abbottlet me know how peter can contact you if he wants to if he wants to i repeated taking the nurses card usually when anyone addressed me as william abbott i could tell the person was a readeror that he or she at least knew i was the writer but beyond my certainty that charles was gay i couldnt tell about the reader part charles sue atkins was calling breathlessly elaine and i and charles were all staring at poor tom i cant say that tom atkins looked peaceful but he was at rest from his terrible exertions to breathe no no no his darling boy was cryingsofter now elaine and i saw charles glance up suddenly at the open doorway oh its you jacques the nurse said its okayyou can come in come on elaine and i saw each other flinch there was no concealing which jacques we thought had come to say goodbye to tom atkins but in the doorway was not the zhak elaine and i had been expecting was it possible that for twenty years elaine and i were anticipating we might see kittredge again in the doorway the old dog stooduncertain of his next arthritic step come on boy charles said and jacques limped forward into his former masters former study charles lifted one of toms cold hands off the side of the bed and the old labrador put his cold nose against it there were other presences in the doorwaysoon to be in the small room with usand elaine and i retreated from poor toms bedside sue atkins gave me a wan smile how nice to have met you finally the dying woman said do stay in touch like toms father twenty years ago she didnt shake my hand the boy peter didnt once look at me he ran to his father and hugged the diminished body the girl emily glanced albeit quickly at elaine then she looked at charles and screamed the old dog just sat there as hed satexpecting nothingin the kitchen all the long way down that hall through the vestibule where i only now noticed an undecorated christmas tree and out of that afflicted house elaine kept repeating something i couldnt quite hear in the driveway was the taxi driver from the train station whom wed asked to wait to my surprise wed been inside the atkins house only for fortyfive minutes or an hour it had felt to elaine and me as if wed been there half our lives i cant hear what youre saying i said to elaine when we were in the taxi what happens to the duck billy elaine repeatedloudly enough this time so that i could hear her okay so this is another epilogue i was thinking we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep prospero saysact scene at one time id actually imagined that the tempest could and should end there how does prospero begin the epilogue i was trying to remember of course richard abbott would know but even when elaine and i got back to new york i knew i didnt want to call richard i wasnt ready to tell mrs hadley about atkins first line of the epilogue to the tempest i said as casually as i could to elaine in that funereal taxi you knowthe end spoken by prospero hows it begin now my charms are all oerthrown elaine recited is that the bit you mean billy yes thats it i told my dearest friend that was exactly how i feltoerthrown okay okay elaine said putting her arms around me you can cry now billywe both can okay okay i was trying not to think of that line in madame bovaryatkins had absolutely hated it you know that moment after emma has given herself to the undeserving rodolphewhen she feels her heart beating and the blood flowing in her body like a river of milk how that image had disgusted tom atkins yet as hard as it was for me to imaginehaving seen the ninetysomething pounds of atkins as he lay dying and his doomed wife whose blood was no river of milk in her diseased bodytom and sue atkins must have felt that way at least once or twice youre not saying that tom atkins told you kittredge was gayyoure not telling me that are you elaine asked me on the train as i knew she would no im not telling you thatin fact tom both nodded and shook his head at the gay word atkins simply wasnt clear tom didnt exactly say what kittredge is or was only that hed seen him and that kittredge was beautiful and there was something else tom said kittredge was not at all who we thought he was elainei dont know more i told her okay you ask larry if hes heard anything about kittredge ill check out some of the hospices if you check out st vincents billy elaine said tom never said that kittredge was sick elaine if tom saw him kittredge may be sick billy who knows where tom went apparently kittredge went there too okay okayill ask larry ill check out st vincents i said i waited a moment while new jersey passed by outside the windows of our train youre holding out on me elaine i told her what makes you think that kittredge might have the disease what dont i know about mrs kittredge kittredge was an experimenter wasnt he billy elaine asked thats all im going onhe was an experimenter he would fuck anyone just to see what it was like but i knew elaine so well i knew when she was lyinga lie of omission maybe not the other kindand i knew i would have to be patient with her as she had once for years been patient with me elaine was such a storyteller i dont know what or who kittredge is billy elaine told me this sounded like the truth i dont know either i said here we were tom atkins had died yet elaine and i were even then thinking about kittredge chapter not natural causes it still staggers me when i remember the impossible expectations tom atkins had for our ohsoyouthful romance those many summers ago poor tom was no less guilty of wishful thinking in the desperation of his dying days tom hoped i might make a suitable substitute father for his son petera farfetched notion which even that darling fifteenyearold boy knew would never happen i maintained contact with charles the atkins family nurse for only five or six yearsnot more it was charles who told me peter atkins was accepted at lawrenceville whichuntil a year or two after peter had graduatedwas an allboys school compared to many new england prep schoolsfavorite river academy includedlawrenceville was late in becoming coeducational boy did i ever hope peter atkins was notto use poor toms wordslike us peter went to princeton about five miles northeast of lawrenceville when my misadventure of cohabiting with elaine ended in san francisco she and i moved back to new york elaine was teaching at princeton in the academic year of when peter atkins was a student there he showed up in her writing class in the spring of when the fifteenyearold wed both met was in his early twenties elaine thought peter was an economics major but elaine never paid any attention to what her writing students were majoring in he wasnt much of a writer she told me yet he had no illusions about it peters stories were all about the suicidewhen she was seventeen or eighteenof his younger sister emily id heard about the suicide from charles at the time it happened shed always been a deeply troubled girl charles had written as for toms wife sue she died a long eighteen months after atkins was gone shed had charles replaced as a nurse almost immediately after toms death i can understand why sue didnt want a gay man looking after her was all charles said about it id asked elaine if she thought peter atkins was gay no shed said definitely not indeed it was sometime in the late ninetiesa couple of years after the worst of the aids epidemicwhen i was giving a reading in new york and a ruddyfaced redhaired young man with an attractive young woman approached me at the book signing that followed the event peter atkins must have been in his early thirties then but i had no trouble recognizing him he still looked like tom we got a babysitter for thisthats pretty rare for us his wife said smiling at me how are you peter i asked him ive read all your books the young man earnestly told me your novels were kind of in loco parentis for me he said the latin slowly you know in the place of a parentkind of young atkins said we just smiled at each other there was nothing more to say hed said it well i thought his father would have been happy how his son turned outor as happy as poor tom ever was about anything tom atkins and i had grown up at a time when we were full of selfhatred for our sexual differences because wed had it drummed into our heads that those differences were wrong in retrospect im ashamed that my expressed hope for peter atkins was that he wouldnt be like tomor like me maybe for peters generation what i should have hoped for him was that he would be like usonly proud of it yet given what happened to peters father and motherwell it suffices to say that i thought peter atkins had been burdened enough i should pen a brief obituary for the first sister players my hometowns obdurately amateur theatrical society with nils borkman dead and with the equally violent passing of that little theaters prompter my mother mary marshall abbottnot to mention my late aunt muriel marshall fremont who had wowed our town in various strident and bigbosomed rolesthe first sister players simply slipped away by the eighties even in small towns the old theaters were becoming movie houses movies were what people wanted to see more folks stayin home and watchin television too i suppose grandpa harry commented harry marshall himself was stayin home his days onstage as a woman were long gone it was richard who called me after elmira found grandpa harrys body no more drycleanin elmira harry had said when hed earlier seen the nurse hanging nana victorias clean clothes in his closet i musta misheard him elmira would later explain to richard i thought he said not more drycleanin elmiralike he was teasin me ya know but now im pretty sure he said no more drycleanin elmiralike he knew then what he was gonna do as a favor to his nurse grandpa harry had dressed himself as the old lumberman he wasjeans a flannel shirt nothin fancy as elmira would sayand when hed curled up on his side in the bathtub the way a child goes to sleep harry had somehow managed to shoot himself in the temple with the mossberg so that most of the blood was in the bathtub and what there was of it that spattered the tile in other parts of the bathroom had presented no insurmountable difficulty for elmira to clean the message on my answering machine the night before had been business as usual for grandpa harry no need to call me back billim turnin in a bit early i was just checkin to be sure you were all right that same nightit was november a little before thanksgivingthe message on richard abbotts answering machine was similar at least in regard to grandpa harry turnin in a bit early richard had taken martha hadley to a movie in town in what was the former theater for the first sister players but the end of the message grandpa harry had left for richard was a little different from the one harry left for me i miss my girls richard grandpa harry had said then hed curled up in the bathtub and pulled the trigger harold marshall was ninety soon to be ninetyonejust a bit early to be turning in richard abbott and uncle bob decided to turn that thanksgiving into what would serve as a remembrance of grandpa harry but harrys contemporariesthe ones who were still alivewere all in residence at the facility they wouldnt be joining us for thanksgiving dinner in grandpa harrys river street home elaine and i drove up from new york together wed invited larry to come with us larry was sixtysix he was without a boyfriend at the moment and elaine and i were worried about him larry wasnt sick he didnt have the disease but he was worn out elaine and i had talked about it elaine had even said that the aids virus was killing larryin another way i was happy to have larry along for the ride this prevented elaine from making up any stories about whomever i was seeing at the time man or woman therefore no one was falsely accused of shitting in the bed richard had invited some foreign students from favorite river academy for our thanksgiving dinner it was too far for them to go home for such a short school vacationtherefore we were joined by two korean girls and a lonelylooking boy from japan the rest of us all knew one anothernot counting larry whod never been to vermont before even though grandpa harrys river street house was practically in the middle of townand a short walk to the favorite river academy campusfirst sister itself struck larry as a wilderness god knows what larry thought of the surrounding woods and fields the regular firearm season for deer had started so the sound of shooting was all around a barbaric wilderness was what larry called vermont mrs hadley and richard handled the kitchen chores with help from gerry and helena the latter was gerrys new girlfrienda vivacious chatty woman whod just dumped her husband and was coming out though she was gerrys age fortyfive and had two grown children helenas kids were in their early twenties they were spending the holiday with her exhusband larry and uncle bob had perplexingly hit it offpossibly because larry was the exact same age aunt muriel would have been if muriel hadnt been in the headon collision that also killed my mom and larry loved talking to richard abbott about shakespeare i liked listening to the two of them in a way it was like overhearing my adolescence in the favorite river academy drama clubit was like watching a phase of my childhood pass by since there were now female students at favorite river richard abbott was explaining to larry the casting of the drama club plays was very different than it had been when the academy was an allboys school hed hated having to cast those boys in the female roles richard said grandpa harry who was no boy and whod been outstanding as a woman was an exception as were elaine and a handful of other faculty daughters but now that there were boys and girls at his disposal richard bemoaned what many theater directors in schoolseven in collegesare often telling me today more girls like theater there are always more girls there arent enough boys to cast in all the male parts you have to look for plays with more female parts for all the girls because there are almost always more girls than there are female roles to play shakespeare was very comfortable about switching sexes richard larry said provocatively why dont you tell your theater kids that in those plays where there are an overabundant number of male parts youre going to cast all the male roles with girls and that youll cast the female roles with boys i think shakespeare would have loved that there was little doubt that larry would have loved that larry had a genderlens view of the world shakespeare included thats a very interesting idea larry richard abbott said but this is romeo and juliet that would be richards next shakespeare play i was guessing i hadnt been paying that close attention to the schoolcalendar part of the conversation there are only four female roles in the play and only two of them really matter richard continued yes yesi know larry said he was showing off theres lady montague and lady capulettheyre of no importance as you say theres really just juliet and her nurse and there must be twenty or more men its tempting to cast the boys as women and the other way around richard admitted but these are just teenagers larry where do i find a boy with the balls to play juliet ah larry said and stopped even larry had no answer for that i remember thinking how this wasnt and never would be my problem let it be richards problem i thought i had other things on my mind grandpa harry had left his river street house to me what was i going to do with a fivebedroom sixbathroom house in vermont richard had told me to hang on to it youll get more for it if you sell it later bill he said grandpa harry had left me a little money too i didnt need the additional money i could have gotten by selling that river street houseat least not yet martha hadley vowed to organize an auction to get rid of the unwanted furniture harry had left some money for uncle bob and for richard abbott grandpa harry had left the largest sum for gerryin lieu of leaving her a share of the house it was the house id been born inthe house id grown up in until my mom married richard grandpa harry had said to richard this house should be bills i guess a writer will be okay livin with the ghostsbill can use em cant he i didnt know the ghosts or if i could use them that thanksgiving what i couldnt quite imagine were the circumstances that would ever make me want to live in first sister vermont but i decided there was no hurry to make a decision about the house i would hang on to it the ghosts sent elaine from her bedroom to minethe very first night we slept in that river street house i was in my old childhood bedroom when elaine burst in and crawled into my bed with me i dont know who those women think they are elaine said but i know theyre dead and theyre pissed off about it okay i told her i liked sleeping with elaine but the next night we moved into one of the bedrooms that had a bigger bed i saw no ghosts that thanksgiving holidayactually i never saw ghosts in that house id put larry in the biggest bedroom it had been grandpa harrys bedroomthe closet was still full of nana victorias clothes mrs hadley had promised me she would get rid of them when she and richard auctioned off the unwanted furniture but larry saw no ghosts he just had a complaint about the bathtub in that bathroom uh billis this the tub where your grandfather yes it is i quickly told him why larry had looked for bloodstains but the bathroom and the tub were spotlessly clean elmira must have scrubbed her ass off in there yet larry had found something he wanted to show me there was a chip in the enamel on the floor of the bathtub was that chip always there larry asked me yes alwaysthis bathtub was chipped when i was a small child i lied so you say billso you say larry said suspiciously we both knew how the bathtub had been chipped the bullet from the must have passed through grandpa harrys head while he had been curled up on his side the bullet had chipped the enamel on the floor of the bathtub when youre auctioning off the old furniture i told richard and martha privately please get rid of that bathtub i didnt have to specify which bathtub youll never live in this terrible town billy youre crazy even to imagine you might elaine said it was the night after our thanksgiving dinner and perhaps we were lying awake in bed because wed eaten too much and we couldnt fall asleep or maybe we were listening for ghosts when we used to live here in this terrible townwhen we were in those shakespeare playswas there ever in that time at favorite river a boy with the balls to play juliet i asked elaine i could feel her imagining him as i was in the darknesstalk about listening for ghosts there was only one boy who had the balls for it billy elaine answered me but he wouldnt have been right for the part why not i asked her i knew she meant kittredge he was pretty enoughhe had the balls all right juliet is nothing if shes not sincere elaine said kittredge would have looked the part of course but he would have hammed it up somehowkittredge didnt do sincere billy elaine said no he didnt i thought kittredge could have been anyonehe could look the part in any role but kittredge was never sincere he was forever concealedhe was always just playing a part at that thanksgiving dinner there was both awkwardness and comedy in the latter category the two korean girls managed to give the japanese boy the idea that we were eating a peacock i dont know how the girls conveyed the peacock idea to the lonelylooking boy or why fumithe boywas so stricken at the thought of eating a peacock no noits a turkey mrs hadley said to fumi as if he were having a pronunciation problem since id grown up in that river street house i found the encyclopedia and showed fumi what a turkey looked like not a peacock i said the korean girls su min and dong hee were whispering in korean they were also giggling later after a lot of wine it was the vivacious chatty mother of twonow gerrys girlfriendwho gave a toast to our extended family for welcoming her to such an intimate holiday occasion it was doubtless the wine in combination with the intimate word that compelled helena to deliver an impromptu address on the subject of her vaginaor perhaps shed meant for her remarks to praise all vaginas i want to thank you for having me helena had begun then she got sidetracked i used to be someone who hated my vagina but now i love it she said she seemed almost immediately to think better of her comments because she quickly said of course i love gerrys vaginathat goes without saying i guessbut its because of gerry that i also love my vagina and i used to just hate it she was standing a bit unsteadily with her glass raised thank you for having me she repeated sitting down im guessing that uncle bob had probably heard more toasts than anyone else at the dinner tablegiven all the gladhanding he did for alumni affairs those backslapping dinner parties with drunken favorite river alumsbut even uncle bob was rendered speechless by helenas toast to at least two vaginas i looked at larry who i know was bursting with something to say in an entirely different way from tom atkinswho had routinely overreacted to the vagina word or to even the passing thought of a vaginalarry could be counted on for a vagina reaction dont i said quietly to him across the dinner table because i could always tell when larry was struggling to restrain himself his eyes opened very wide and his nostrils flared but now it was the korean girls whod failed to understand a what dong hee had said she hates now loves her what su min asked it was fumis turn to snicker the japanese boy had put the peacockturkey misunderstanding behind himthe lonelylooking young man obviously knew what a vagina was you know a vagina elaine said softly to the korean girls but su min and dong hee had never heard the wordand no one at the dinner table knew the korean for it my goodnessits where babies come from mrs hadley tried to explain but she looked suddenly stricken perhaps recalling elaines abortions its where everything happensyou know down there elaine said to the korean girls but elaine didnt do anything when she said down there she didnt point or gesture or indicate anything specifically well its not where everything happensi beg to differ larry said smiling i knew he was just getting started oh im so sorryive had too much to drink and i forgot there were young people here helena blurted out dont you worry dear uncle bob told gerrys new girlfriend i could tell bob liked helena who was not at all similar to a long list of gerrys previous girlfriends these kids are from another country another culture the things we talk about in this country are not necessarily topics for conversation in korea the racquet man painfully explained oh crap gerry cried just try another fucking word gerry turned to su min and dong hee who were still very much in the dark as far as the vagina word was concerned its a twat a snatch a quim a pussy a muff a honeypotits a cunt for christs sake gerry cried the cunt word making elaine and even larry flinch they get it gerryplease uncle bob said indeed the korean girls had turned the color of a clean sheet of unlined paper the japanese kid had kept up for the most part although both muff and honeypot had surprised him is there a picture of it somewhere billif not in the encyclopedia larry asked mischievously before i forget it bill richard abbott interjectedi could tell richard was tactfully trying to drop the vagina subjectwhat about the mossberg the what fumi asked in a frightened voice if the muff and honeypot vulgarisms for vagina had thrown him the japanese boy had never heard the mossberg word before what about it i asked richard shall we auction it off with the furniture bill you dont want to keep that old carbine do you ill hang on to the mossberg richard i told him ill keep the ammunition tooif i ever live here it makes sense to have a varmint gun around youre in town billy uncle bob pointed out about the river street house youre not supposed to shoot in townnot even varmints grandpa harry loved that gun i said he loved his wifes clothes too billy elaine said are you going to keep her clothes around i dont see you becoming a deer hunter bill richard abbott said even if you do decide to live here but i wanted that mossberg they could all see that what do you want a gun for bill larry asked me i know youre not opposed to trying to keep a secret billy elaine told me youre just not any good at keeping secrets elaine had not kept many secrets from me but if she had a secret she knew how to keep it i could never very successfully keep a secret even when i wanted to keep one i could see that elaine knew why i wanted to hang on to that mossberg larry knew too he was looking at me with a hurt expressionas if he were saying without actually saying it how can you conceive of not letting me take care of youhow can you not die in my arms if youre ever dying how can you even imagine sneaking off and shooting yourself if you get sick thats what larrys look said without the words elaine was giving me the same hurt look as larry whatever you want bill richard abbott said richard looked hurt tooeven mrs hadley seemed disappointed in me only gerry and helena had stopped paying attention they were touching each other under the table the vagina conversation seemed to have distracted them from what remained of our thanksgiving dinner the korean girls were once more whispering in korean the lonelylooking fumi was writing something down in a notebook not much bigger than the palm of his hand maybe the mossberg word so he could use it in the next allmale dormitory conversationsuch as i would really like to get into her mossberg dont larry said quietly to me as id earlier said across the table to him you should see herm hoyt while youre in town billy uncle bob was sayinga welcome change of subject or so i first imagined i know the coach would love to have a word with you what about i asked bob with badly faked indifference but the racquet man was busy he was pouring himself another beer robert fremont my uncle bob was sixtyseven he was retiring next year but hed told me that he would continue to volunteer his services to alumni affairs and particularly continue to contribute to the academys alumni magazine the river bulletin whatever one thought of uncle bobs cries for help from the wherehaveyougone deptwell what can i sayhis enthusiasm for tracking down the schools most elusive alums made him very popular with folks in alumni affairs what would coach hoyt like to have a word with me about i tried asking uncle bob again i think you gotta ask him yourself billy the evergenial racquet man said you know hermhe can be a kind of protective fella when it comes to talking about his wrestlers oh maybe not a welcome change of subject i thought in another town at a later time the facilityfor assisted living and beyondwould probably have been named the pines or in vermont the maples but you have to remember the place was conceived and constructed by harry marshall and nils borkman ironically neither of them would die there someone had just died there on that thanksgiving weekend when i went to visit herm hoyt a shrouded body was bound to a gurney which an elderly severelooking nurse was standing guard over in the parking lot youre neither the person nor the vehicle im waitin for she told me im sorry i said its gonna snow too the old nurse said then ill have to wheel him back inside i tried to change the subject from the deceased to the reason for my visit butfirst sister being the small town it wasthe nurse already knew who i was visiting the coach is expectin ya she said when shed told me how to find herms room she added you dont look much like a wrestler when i told her who i was she said oh i knew your mother and your auntand your grandfather of course of course i said youre the writer she added with her eyes focused on the ashend of her cigarette i realized that shed wheeled the body outside because she was a smoker i was fortytwo that year i judged the nurse to be at least as old as my aunt muriel would have beenin the latter half of her sixties i agreed that i was the writer but before i could leave her in the parking lot the nurse said you were a favorite river boy werent ya yes i was i said i could see her scrutinizing me now of course she would have heard everything about me and miss frosteveryone of a certain age had heard all about that then i guess ya knew this fella the old nurse said she passed her hand over the body bound to the gurney but she touched nothing im guessin hes waitin in more ways than one the nurse said exhaling an astonishing plume of cigarette smoke she was wearing a ski parka and an old ski hat but no glovesthe gloves would have interfered with her cigarette it was just starting to snowsome scattered flakes were falling not nearly enough to have accumulated on the body on the gurney hes waitin for that idiot kid from the funeral home and hes waitin in whatchamacallit the nurse exclaimed do you mean purgatory i asked her yes i dowhat is that anyway she asked me youre the writer but i dont believe in purgatory or all the rest of it i started to say im not askin ya to believe in it she said im askin ya what it is an intermediate state after death i started to answer her but she wouldnt let me finish like almighty god is decidin whether to send this fella to the underworld or the great upstairsisnt that supposed to be whats goin on there the nurse asked me kind of i said i had a limited recollection of what purgatory was forfor some kind of expiatory purification if i remembered correctly the soul in that aforementioned intermediate state after death was expected to atone for somethingor so i guessed without ever saying it who is it i asked the old nurse as she had done i moved my hand safely above the body on the gurney the nurse narrowed her eyes as she looked at me it might have been the smoke dr harlowyou remember him dontcha im guessin it wont take the almighty too long to decide about him the old nurse said i just smiled and left her to wait for the hearse in the parking lot i didnt believe that dr harlow could ever atone enough i believed he was already in the underworld where he belonged i hoped that the great upstairs had no room for dr harlowhe who had been so absolute about my affliction herm hoyt told me that dr harlow had moved to florida after hed retired but when he got sickhed had prostate cancer it had metastasized as that cancer does to bonedr harlow had asked to come back to first sister hed wanted to spend his last days in the facility i cant figure out why billy coach hoyt said nobody here ever liked him dr harlow had died at age seventynine i hadnt seen the baldheaded owlfucker since hed been a man in his fifties but herm hoyt hadnt asked to see me because hed wanted to tell me about dr harlow im guessing youve heard from miss frost i said to her old wrestling coach is she all right funnythats what she wanted to know about you billy herm said you can tell her im all right i said quickly i never asked her to tell me the sexual detailsin fact i would just as soon know nothin about that stuff billy the coach continued but she said theres somethin you should knowso you wont worry about her you should tell miss frost im a top i told him and ive been wearing condoms since maybe she wont worry too much about me if she knows that i added jeezim too old for more sexual details billy just let me finish what i started to say herm said he was ninetyone not quite a year older than grandpa harry but herm had parkinsons and uncle bob had told me that the coach was having difficulty with one of his medications it was something herm was supposed to take for his heart or so bob had thought the parkinsons was why coach hoyt had moved into the facility in the first place im not even pretendin that i understand this billy but heres what al wanted you to knowforgive me what she wanted you to know she doesnt actually have sex herm hoyt told me she means not with anybody billyshe just doesnt ever do it shes gone to a world of trouble to make herself a woman but she doesnt ever have sexnot with men or women im tellin you not ever theres somethin greek about what she doesshe said you knew all about it billy intercrural i said to the old wrestling coach thats itthats what she called it herm cried its nothin but rubbin your thing between the other fellas thighsits just rubbin isnt it the wrestling coach asked me im pretty sure you cant get aids that way i told him but she was always this way billythats what she wants you to know herm said she became a woman but she could never pull the trigger pull the trigger i repeated for twentythree years i had thought of miss frost as protecting me id not once imagined thatfor whatever reasons even unwillingly or unconsciouslyshe was also protecting herself no penetratin no bein penetratedjust rubbin coach hoyt repeated al saidshe said im sorry billythats as far as i can go herm thats all i can do and all i ever will do i just like to look the part herm but i cant ever pull the trigger thats what she told me to tell you billy so shes safe i said she really is all right and shes going to stay all right shes sixtyseven billy what do you mean shes safewhat do you mean shes gonna stay all right nobody stays all right billy gettin old isnt safe coach hoyt exclaimed im just tellin you she doesnt have aids she didnt want you worryin about her havin aids billy oh al frostsorry miss frost to younever did anything safe billy shit the old coach said she may look like a womani know shes got the moves down patbut she still thinks if you can call it that like a fuckin wrestler its just not safe to look and act like a woman when you still believe you could be wrestlin billythats not safe at all fucking wrestlers i thought they were all like herm just when you imagined they were finally talking about other things they kept coming back to the frigging wrestling they were all like that it didnt make me miss the new york athletic club i can tell you but miss frost wasnt like other wrestlers shed put the wrestling behind herat least that had been my impression what are you saying herm i asked the old coach is miss frost going to pick up some guy and try to wrestle him is she going to pick a fight some guys arent gonna be satisfied with the rubbin part are they herm asked me she wont pick a fightshe doesnt pick fights billybut i know al shes not gonna back down from a fightnot if some dickhead who wanted more than a rubbin picks a fight with her i didnt want to think about it i was still trying to adjust to the intercrural part i was frankly relieved that miss frost didntthat she truly couldnthave aids at the time that was more than enough to think about yes it crossed my mind to wonder if miss frost was happy was she disappointed in herself that she could never pull the trigger i just like to look the part miss frost had told her old coach didnt that sound theatrical perhaps to put herm at ease didnt that sound like she was satisfied with intercrural sex that was more than enough to think about too hows that duckunder billy coach hoyt asked me oh ive been practicing i told himkind of a white lie wasnt it herm hoyt looked frail he was trembling maybe it was the parkinsons or one of the medications he was takingthe one for his heart if uncle bob was right we hugged each other goodbye it was the last time i would see him herm hoyt would die of a heart attack at the facility uncle bob would be the one to break the news to me the coach is gone billyyoure on your own with the duckunders it would be just a few years down the road herm hoyt would be ninetyfive if i remember correctly when i left the facility the old nurse was still standing outside smoking and dr harlows shrouded body was still lying there bound to the gurney still waitin she said when she saw me the snow was now starting to accumulate on the body ive decided not to wheel him back inside the nurse informed me he cant feel the snow fallin on him ill tell you something about him i said to the old nurse hes exactly the same now as he always wasdead certain she took a long drag on her cigarette and blew the smoke over dr harlows body im not quarrelin with you over language she told me youre the writer one snowy december night after that thanksgiving i stood on seventh avenue in the west village looking uptown i was outside that last stop of a hospital st vincents and i was trying to force myself to go inside where seventh avenue ran into central parkexactly at that distant intersectionwas the coatandtie allmale bastion of the new york athletic club but the club was too far north from where i stood for me to see it my feet wouldnt move i couldnt have crawled as far as west twelfth street or to west eleventh if a speeding taxi had collided with another taxi at the nearby intersection of greenwich avenue and seventh i couldnt have saved myself from the flying debris the falling snow made me miss vermont but i was absolutely paralyzed at the thought of moving homeso to speakand elaine had suggested we try living together but not in new york i was further paralyzed by the idea of trying to live anywhere with elaine i both wanted to try it and was afraid to do it i unfortunately suspected that elaine was motivated to live with me because she mistakenly believed this would save me from having sex with menand i would therefore be safe from ever getting aidsbut i knew that no one person could rescue me from wanting to have sex with men and women and if the abovementioned thoughts werent paralyzing enough i was also rooted like a tree to that seventh avenue sidewalk because i was utterly ashamed of myself i wasonce againpoised to cruise those mournful corridors of st vincents not because id come to visit and comfort a dying friend or a former lover but because i was absurdly looking for kittredge it was almost christmas and elaine and i were still searching that sacred hospitaland various hospicesfor a cruel boy who had abused us when we were all ohsoyoung elaine and i had been looking for kittredge for three years let him go larry had told us both if you find him hell only disappoint youor hurt you again youre both in your forties arent you a little old to be exorcising a demon from your unhappy lives as teenagers there was no way lawrence upton could say the teenagers word nicely these factors must have contributed to my paralysis on seventh avenue in the west village this snowy december night but the fact that elaine and i were behaving as if we were teenagersthat is as far as kittredge was concerneddoubtless contributed to my tears as a teenager i had cried a lot thus i was standing outside st vincents crying when the older woman in the fur coat came up to me she was an expensivelooking little woman in her sixties but she was notably pretty i might have recognized her if shed still been attired in the sleeveless dress and straw hat she was wearing on the occasion of my first meeting her when shed declined to shake my hand when delacorte had introduced me to his mom at our graduation from favorite river hed told her this is the guy who was going to be lears fool no doubt delacorte had also told his mother the story of my having had sex with the transsexual town librarian which had prompted mrs delacorte to sayas she said again to me that wintry night on seventh avenueim so sorry for your troubles i couldnt speak i knew that i knew her but it had been twentythree years i didnt remember how i knew her or when and where but now she was not opposed to touching me she grasped both my hands and said i know its hard to go in there but it means so much to the one youre visiting ill go with you ill help you do thisif you help me its even hard for me you know its my son whos dying mrs delacorte told me and i wish i could be him i want him to be the one whos going to go on living i dont want to go on living without him she cried mrs delacorte i guessedonly because i saw something in her tormented face that reminded me of delacortes neardeath expressions as a wrestler oh its you she cried youre that writer nowcarlton talks about you youre carltons friend from school youve come to see carlton havent you oh hell be so glad to see youyou must come inside thus i was dragged to delacortes deathbed in that hospital where so many ill and wastingaway young men were lying in their beds dying oh carltonlook whos here look whos come to see you mrs delacorte announced in that doorway which was like so many hopeless doorways in st vincents i hadnt even known delacortes first name at favorite river no one had ever called him carlton he was just plain delacorte there once kittredge had called him two cups because of the paper cups that so often accompanied himdue to the insane weightcutting and the constant rinsing and spitting which delacorte had been briefly famous for of course id seen delacorte when he was cutting weight for wrestlingwhen he looked like he was starvingbut he was really starving now it suffices to say that i knew what the hickman catheter in delacortes skeletal birdcage of a chest was for theyd had him on a breathing machine mrs delacorte had told me when we were en route to his room but he was off it for now theyd been experimenting with sublingual morphine versus morphine elixir mrs delacorte had also explained delacorte was on morphine either way at this point the suction is very importantto help clear secretions mrs delacorte had said at this point yes id lamely repeated i was numb i felt frozen on my feet as if i were still standing paralyzed on seventh avenue in the falling snow this is the guy who was going to be lears fool delacorte was struggling to say to his mother yes yesi know dear i know the little woman was telling him did you bring more cups he asked her i saw he was holding two paper cups they were absolutely empty cups his mother would later tell me she was always bringing more cups but there was no need for rinsing and spitting now in fact when they were trying the morphine under his tongue delacorte wasnt supposed to rinse or spitor so mrs delacorte thought he just wanted to hold the paper cups for some foolish reason she said delacorte also had cryptococcal meningitis his brain was affectedhe had headaches his mom told me and he was often delirious this guy was ariel in the tempest delacorte said to his mother upon my first visit to his roomand on the occasion of every later visit he was sebastian in twelfth night delacorte told his mom repeatedly it was the shadow word that prevented him from being lears fool which was why i got the part delacorte raved later when i visited him with elaine delacorte even reiterated my onstage history to her he didnt come to see me die when i was lears foolof course i understand delacorte said in a most heartfelt way to elaine i do appreciate that hes come to see me die nowyouve both come now and i truly appreciate it he told us delacorte not once called me by name and i truly cant remember if he ever did i dont recall him once addressing me as either bill or billy when we were favorite river students but what does that matter i didnt even know what his first name was since id not seen him onstage as lears fool i have a more permanent picture of delacorte from twelfth night he played sir andrew aguecheekdeclaring to sir toby belch uncle bob o had i but followed the arts delacorte died after several days of neartotal silence with the two clean paper cups held shakily in his hands elaine was there that day with mrs delacorte and me andcoincidentallyso was larry hed spotted elaine and me from the doorway of delacortes room and had poked his head inside not the one you were looking for or is it larry had asked elaine and i both shook our heads a very tired mrs delacorte was dozing while her son slipped away there was no point in introducing delacorte to larry delacorte by his silence seemed to have already slipped away or else he was headed in that directionnor did elaine and i disturb mrs delacorte to introduce her to larry the little woman hadnt slept a wink for god knows how long naturally larry was the aids authority in the room your friend hasnt got long he whispered to elaine and me then he left us there elaine took mrs delacorte to the womens room because the exhausted mother was so worn out she looked as if she might fall or become lost if she went by herself i was alone with delacorte only a moment id grown so accustomed to his silence i first thought that someone else had spoken have you seen him came the faintest whisper leave it to himhe was never the one to be satisfied with just fitting in delacorte breathlessly cried who i whispered in the dying mans ear but i knew who who else would delacorte have had on his demented mind at that instant or almost the instant of his death delacorte died minutes later with his mothers small hands on his wasted face mrs delacorte asked elaine and me if she could have a moment alone with her sons body of course we complied bullshit or not it was larry who later told us that we shouldnt have left mrs delacorte alone in the room with her sons body a single mom rightan only child im guessing larry said and when theres a hickman catheter bill you dont want to leave any loved one alone with the body i didnt know larryive never heard of such a thing i told him of course you havent heard of such a thing billyoure not involved how would you have heard youre exactly like him elaine larry told her the two of you are keeping such a distance from this diseaseyoure barely bystanders dont pull rank on us larry elaine said larry is always pulling rank one way or another i said you know youre not just bisexual bill youre bieverything larry told me whats that supposed to mean i asked him youre a solo pilot arent you bill larry asked me youre cruising solono copilot has any clout with you i still have no idea what larry meant dont pull rank on us mr florence fucking nightingale elaine said to larry elaine and i had been standing in the corridor outside delacortes room when one of the nurses passed by and paused to speak to us is carlton the nurse started to say yes hes gonehis mother is with him elaine said oh dear the nurse said stepping quickly into delacortes room but she got there too late mrs delacorte had done what she wanted to dowhat shed probably planned to do once she knew her son was going to die she must have had the needle and a syringe in her purse shed stuck the needle into the end of the hickman catheter shed drawn some blood out of the hickman but she emptied that first syringe into the wastebasket the first syringe was mostly full of heparin mrs delacorte had done her homework she knew that the second syringe would be almost entirely carltons blood teeming with the virus then shed injected herself deep into her gluteus with about five milliliters of her sons blood mrs delacorte would die of aids in she died in hospice care in her apartment in new york at elaines insistence i took mrs delacorte uptown in a taxiafter shed given herself a lethal dose of her beloved carltons blood she had a tenthfloor apartment in one of those innocuously perfect buildings with an awning and a doorman on park avenue and east seventy or eightysomething i dont know about you but im going to have a drink she told me please come in i did it was hard to fathom why delacorte had died at st vincents when mrs delacorte could clearly have provided more comfortable hospice care for him in her own park avenue apartment carlton always objected to feeling privileged mrs delacorte explained he wanted to die like everymanthats what he said he wouldnt let me provide him with hospice care here even though they could probably have used the extra room at st vincentsas i told him many times she said they no doubt did need the extra room at st vincents or they soon would some people waited to die in the corridors there would you like to see carltons room mrs delacorte asked me when we both had a drink in hand and i dont drinknothing but beer i had a whiskey with mrs delacorte maybe it was bourbon i would have done anything that little woman wanted i even went with her to delacortes childhood room i found myself in a museum of what had been carlton delacortes privileged life in new york before hed been sent away to favorite river academy it was a fairly common story that delacortes leaving home had coincided with his parents getting a divorce about which mrs delacorte was candid with me more surprising mrs delacorte was no less candid about the prevailing cause of her separation and divorce from young carltons father her husband had been a raving homohater the man had called carlton a fairy and a little fag hed berated mrs delacorte for allowing the effeminate boy to dress up in his mothers clothes and paint his lips with her lipstick of course i knewprobably long before carlton did mrs delacorte told me she seemed to be favoring her right buttock such a deep intramuscular injection had to hurt mothers know she said unconsciously limping a little you cant force children to become something theyre not you cant simply tell a boy not to play with dolls no you cant i said i was looking at all the photographs in the roompictures of the unguarded delacorte before i knew him hed been just a little boy onceone whod like nothing better than to dress and make himself up as a little girl oh look at thisjust look the little woman suddenly said the ice cubes were clicking together in her nearempty glass as she reached and untacked a photo from a bulletin board of photographs in her departed sons bedroom look at how happy he was mrs delacorte cried handing me the photo im guessing that delacorte was eleven or twelve in the picture i had no difficulty recognizing his impish little face certainly the lipstick had accentuated his grin the cheap mauve wigwith a pink streakwas ridiculous it was one of those wigs you can find in a halloweentype costume shop and of course mrs delacortes dress was too big for the boy but the overall effect was hilarious and endearingwell not if you were mr delacorte i guess there was a taller slightly olderlooking girl in the photograph with delacortea very pretty girl but with short hair as closely cut as a boys and an arrestingly confident but tightlipped smile this day didnt end well carltons father came home and was furious to see carlton like this mrs delacorte was saying as i looked more closely at the photo the boys had been having such a wonderful time and that tyrant of a man ruined it the boys i repeated the very pretty girl in the photograph was jacques kittredge oh you know himi know you do mrs delacorte said pointing at the ohsoperfectly crossdressed kittredge hed applied his lipstick far more expertly than delacorte had applied his and one of mrs delacortes beautiful but oldfashioned dresses was an exquisite fit the kittredge boy the little woman said he went to favorite riverhe was a wrestler too carlton was always in awe of him i think but he was a devilthat boy he could be charming but he was a devil how was kittredge a devil i asked mrs delacorte i know he stole my clothes she said oh i gave him some old things i didnt wanthe was always asking me if he could have my clothes oh please mrs delacorte he would say my mothers clothes are huge and she doesnt let me try them onshe says i always mess them up he just went on and on like that and then my clothes started disappearingi mean things i know perfectly well i would never have given him oh i dont know about you mrs delacorte said but im going to have another drink she left me to fix herself a second whiskey i looked at all the other photos on the bulletin board in delacortes childhood bedroom there were three or four photographs with kittredge in the picturealways as a girl when mrs delacorte came back to her dead sons room i was still holding the photo shed handed me please take it she told me i dont like remembering how that day ended okay i said i still have that photograph though i dont like remembering any part of the day carlton delacorte died did i tell elaine about kittredge and mrs delacortes clothes did i show elaine that photo of kittredge as a girl no of course notelaine was holding out on me wasnt she some guy elaine knew got a guggenheim he was a fellow writer and he told elaine that his seedy eighthfloor apartment on post street was the perfect place for two writers wheres post street i asked elaine near union square he saidits in san francisco billy elaine told me i didnt know san francisco at all i only knew there were a lot of gays there of course i knew there were gay men dying in big numbers in san francisco but i didnt have any close friends or former lovers there and larry wouldnt be there to bully me about getting more involved there was another incentive elaine and i couldnt or wouldnt keep looking for kittredgenot in san francisco or so wed thought wheres your friend going on his guggenheim i asked elaine somewhere in europe elaine said maybe we should try living together in europe i suggested the apartment in san francisco is available now billy elaine told me and for a place that will accommodate two writers its so cheap when elaine and i got a look at our view from the eighth floor of that ratsass apartmentthose uninspiring rooftops on geary street and that bloodred vertical sign for the hotel adagio the neon for hotel was burned out before we arrived in san franciscowe could understand why that twowriter apartment was so cheap it should have been free but if tom and sue atkins dying of aids struck elaine and me as too much we couldnt stand what mrs delacorte had done to herself nor have i ever heard that such a drawnout death was a common suicide plan of the loved ones of aids victims particularly as larry had so knowingly told elaine and me among single moms who were losing their only children but as larry also said how would i have heard about anything like that it was true as hed said that i wasnt involved youre going to try living together in san francisco larry said to elaine and me as if we were runaway children oh mya little late to be lovebirds isnt it i thought elaine was going to hit him and pray tell what made you choose san francisco have you heard there are no gay men dying there maybe we all should move to san francisco fuck you larry elaine said dear bill larry said ignoring her you cant run away from a plaguenot if its your plague and dont tell me that aids is too grand guignol for your taste just look at what you write billoverkill is your middle name youve taught me a lot was all i could tell him i didnt stop loving you larry just because i stopped being your lover i still love you more overkill bill was all larry said he couldnt or wouldnt even look at elaine and i knew how fond he was of herand of her writing i was never as intimate with anyone as i was with that awful woman elaine had told me about mrs kittredge i will never be as close to anyone again how intimate id asked her shed not answered me its his mother who marked me elaine had cried about that aforementioned awful woman its her ill never forget marked you how id asked her but shed begun to cry and we had done our adagio thing wed just held each other saying nothingdoing our slowly softly gently routine that was how wed lived together in san francisco for what amounted to almost all of a lot of people left where they were living in the middle of the aids crisis many of us moved somewhere else hoping it would be betterbut it wasnt there was no harm in trying at least living together didnt harm elaine and meit just didnt work out for us to be lovers if that part were ever going to work martha hadley would tell us but only after wed ended the experiment i think it would have clicked when you were kidsnot in your forties mrs hadley had a point as always but elaine and i didnt entirely have a bad year together i kept the photograph of kittredge and delacorte in dresses and lipstick as a bookmark in whatever book i was reading and i left the particular book lying around in the usual placeson the night table on my side of the bed on the kitchen countertop next to the coffeemaker in the small crowded bathroom where it would be in elaines way well elaines eyesight was awful it took almost a year for elaine to see that photo she came out of the bathroom nakedshe was holding the picture in one hand and the book id been reading in the other she had her glasses on and she threw the book at me why didnt you just show it to me billy i knew it was delacorte months ago elaine told me as for the other kid i just thought he was a girl quid pro quo i said to my dearest friend youve got something to tell me toodont you its easy to see with hindsight how it might have gone better for us in san francisco if wed just told each other what we knew about kittredge when wed first heard about it but you live your life at the time you live ityou dont have much of an overview when whats happening to you is still happening the photograph of kittredge as a girl did not make him lookas his mother had allegedly described him to elainelike a sickly little boy he or that pretty girl in the picture didnt look like a child who had no confidence as mrs kittredge had supposedly told elaine kittredge didnt look like a kid who was picked on by the other children especially by the boys or so id been told that awful woman had said mrs kittredge said that to you right i asked elaine not exactly elaine mumbled it had been even harder for me to believe that kittredge was once intimidated by girls not to mention that mrs kittredge had seduced her son so that he would gain confidencenot that id ever completely believed this had happened as i reminded elaine it happened billy elaine said softly i just didnt like the reasoni changed the reason it happened i told elaine about kittredge stealing mrs delacortes clothes i told her what delacorte had breathlessly cried just before he died delacorte had clearly meant kittredgehe was never the one to be satisfied with just fitting in i didnt want you to like him or forgive him billy elaine told me i hated him for the way he just handed me over to his mother i didnt want you to pity him or have sympathy for him i wanted you to hate him too i do hate him elaine i told her yes but thats not all you feel for himi know she told me mrs kittredge had seduced her son but no real or imagined lack of confidence on the young kittredges part was ever the reason kittredge had always been very confidenteven indeed most of all about wanting to be a girl his vain and misguided mother had seduced him for the most familiar and stupefying reasoning that many gay or bi young men commonly encounterif not usually from their own mothers mrs kittredge believed that all her little boy needed was a positive sexual experience with a womanthat would surely bring him to his senses how many of us gay or bi men have heard this bullshit before someone who ardently believes that all we need is to get laidthat is the right wayand well never so much as imagine having sex with another man you should have told me i said to elaine you should have shown me the photograph billy yes i should havewe both should have tom atkins and carlton delacorte had seen kittredge but how recently had they seen himand where what was clear to elaine and me was that atkins and delacorte had seen kittredge as a woman a pretty one too ill bet elaine said to me atkins had used the beautiful word it had been hard enough for elaine and me just living together in san francisco with kittredge back on our mindsnot to mention the as a woman partstaying together in san francisco seemed no longer tenable just dont call larrynot yet elaine said but i did call larry for one thing i wanted to hear his voice and larry knew everything and everyone if there was an apartment to rent in new york larry would know where it was and who owned it ill find you a place to stay in new york i told elaine if i cant find two places in new york ill try living in vermontyou know ill just try it your house has no furniture in it billy elaine pointed out ah well that was when i called larry i just have a coldits nothing bill larry said but i could hear his cough and that he was struggling to suppress it there was no pain with that dry pcp cough it wasnt a cough like the one you get with pleurisy and there was no phlegm it was the shortness of breath that was worrisome about pneumocystis pneumonia and the fever whats your tcell count i asked him when were you going to tell me dont bullshit me larry please come home billyou and elaine please both of you come home larry said just thatnot a long speechand he was out of breath where larry lived and where he would die was on a pretty treelined part of west tenth streetjust a block north of christopher street and an easy walk to hudson street or sheridan square it was a narrow threestory town house generally not affordable to a poetor to most other writers elaine and me included but an ironjawed heiress and grande dame among larrys poetry patronsthe patroness as i thought of herhad left the house to larry who would leave it to elaine and me not that elaine and i could afford to keep itwe would eventually be forced to sell that lovely house when elaine and i moved into help the livein nurse look after larryit was not the same as living together we were done with that experiment larrys house had five bedrooms elaine and i had our own bedrooms and our own bathrooms we took turns doing the night shift with larry so the sleepin nurse could actually sleep the nurse whose name was eddie was a calm young man who tended to larry all dayin theory so that elaine and i could write but elaine and i didnt write very much or very well in those many months when larry was wasting away larry was a good patient perhaps because hed been an excellent nurse to so many patients before he got sick thus my mentor and my old friend and former lover became when he was dying the same man id admired when i first met himin vienna more than twenty years before larry would be spared the worst progression of the esophageal candidiasis he had no hickman catheter he wouldnt hear of a ventilator he did suffer from the spinalcord disease vacuolar myelopathy larry grew progressively weak he couldnt walk or even stand and he was incontinentabout which he was but only at first vain and embarrassed truly not for long its my penis again bill larry would soon say with a smile whenever there was an incontinence issue ask billy to say the plural larry elaine would chime in oh i knowhave you ever heard anything quite like it larry would exclaim please say it billgive us the plural for larry i would do itwell for elaine too they just loved to hear that frigging plural penithzizzes i saidalways quietly at first what i cant hear you larry would say louder billy elaine said penithzizzes i would shout and then larry and elaine would join inall of us crying out as loudly as we could penithzizzes one night our exclamations woke poor eddie who was trying to sleep whats wrong the young nurse asked there he was in his pajamas were saying penises in another language larry explained bill is teaching us but it was larry who taught me as i said once to elaine ill tell you who my teachers werethe ones who meant the most to me larry of course but also richard abbott andmaybe the most important of all or at the most important timeyour mother lawrence upton died in december of he was sixtyeight its hard to believe but larry was almost the same age i am now he lived for a year in hospice care in that house on west tenth street he died on elaines shift but she came and woke me up that was the deal elaine and i had made with each other because wed both wanted to be there when larry died as larry had said about russell the night russell died in larrys arms he weighed nothing the night larry died both elaine and i lay beside him and cradled him in our arms the morphine was playing tricks on larry who knows how consciously or not larry said what he said to elaine and me its my penis again larry told us and again and again and againits always my penis isnt it elaine sang him a song and he died when she was still singing thats a beautiful song i told her who wrote it whats it called felix mendelssohn wrote it elaine said never mind what its called if you ever die on me billy youll hear it again ill tell you then what its called there were a couple of years when elaine and i rattled around in that toogrand town house larry had left us elaine had a vapid nondescript boyfriend whom i disliked for the sole reason that he wasnt substantial enough for her his name was raymond and he burned his toast almost every morning setting off the frigging smoke detector i was on elaines shit list for much of that time because i was seeing a transsexual who kept urging elaine to wear sexierlooking clothes elaine wasnt inclined to sexierlooking elwood has bigger boobs than i haveeverybody has elaine said to me elaine purposely called my transsexual friend elwood or woody my transsexual friend called herself el soon everyone would be using the transgender word my friends told me i should use it toonot to mention those terribly correct young people giving me the hairy eyeball because i continued to say transsexual when i was supposed to say transgender i just love it when certain people feel free to tell writers what the correct words are when i hear the same people use impact as a verb i want to throw up it suffices to say that the late eighties were a time of transition for elaine and me though some people apparently had nothing better to do than update the frigging gender language it was a trying two years and the financial effort to own and maintain that house on west tenth streetincluding the killer taxesput a strain on our relationship one evening elaine told me the story that she was sure shed spotted charles poor toms nurse in a room at st vincents id stopped hearing from charles elaine had peered into a doorwayshe was looking for someone elseand there was this shriveled former bodybuilder his wrinkled and ruined tattoos hanging illegibly from the stretched and sagging skin of his oncepowerful arms charles elaine had said from the doorway but the man had roared like an animal at her elaine had been too frightened to go inside the room i was pretty sure i knew who it wasnot charlesbut i went to st vincents to see for myself it was the winter of id not been inside that laststop hospital since delacorte had died and mrs delacorte had injected herself with his blood i went one more timejust to be certain that the roaring animal elaine had seen wasnt charles it was that terrifying bouncer from the mineshaft of coursethe one they called mephistopheles he roared at me too i never set foot in st vincents again hello charlesif youre out there if youre not im sorry that same winter one night when i was out with el i was told another story i just heard about this girlyou know she was like me but a little older el said uhhuh i said i think you knew hershe went to toronto el said oh you must mean donna i said yeah thats her el said what about her i asked shes not doing too wellthats what i heard el told me oh i didnt say she was sick el said i just heard shes not doing too well whatever that means i guess she was someone special to you huh i heard that too i didnt do anything with this information if you could call it that but that night was when i got the call from uncle bob about herm hoyt dying at age ninetyfive the coach is gone billyyoure on your own with the duckunders bob said no doubt that must have distracted me from following up on els story about donna the next morning elaine and i had to open all the windows in the kitchen to get rid of the smoke from raymond burning his frigging toast and i said to elaine im going to vermont i have a house there and im going to try living in it sure billyi understand elaine said this is too much house for us anywaywe should sell it that clown raymond just sat there eating his burned toast as elaine would say later raymond was probably wondering where he was going to live next he must have known it wouldnt be with elaine i said goodbye to eleither that same day or the next one she wasnt very understanding about it i called richard abbott and got mrs hadley on the phone tell richard im going to try it i told her ive got my fingers crossed for you billyrichard and i would love it if you were living here martha hadley said that was why i was living in grandpa harrys river street house now mine on the morning uncle bob called me from the office of alumni affairs at the academy its about big al billy bob said this isnt an obituary i would ever run unedited in the river bulletin but i gotta run the unedited version by you it was february in first sistercolder than a witchs tit as we say in vermont miss frost was the same age as the racquet man shed died from injuries she suffered in a fight in a barshe was seventythree the injuries were mostly head injuries uncle bob told me big al had found herself in a barroom brawl with a bunch of airmen from pease air force base in newington new hampshire the bar had been in dover or maybe in portsmouthbob didnt have all the details whats a bunch bobhow many airmen were there i asked him uh well there was one airman firstclass and one airman basic and a couple more who were only identified by the airmen wordthats all i can tell you billy uncle bob said young guys right four of them were there four of them bob i asked him yes four i assume they were young billyif they were enlisted men and still in service but im just guessing about their ages uncle bob told me miss frost had probably received her head injuries after the four of them finally managed to get her down i imagine it took two or three of them to hold her down while the fourth man had kicked her in the head all four men had been hospitalized bob told me the injuries to two of the four were listed as serious but none of the airmen had been charged at that time pease was still a sac base according to uncle bob the strategic air command disciplined its own but bob admitted that he didnt truly understand how the legal stuff when it came to the military really worked the four airmen were never identified by name nor was there any information as to why four young men had a fight with a seventythreeyearold woman whoin their eyesmay or may not have been acceptable as a woman my guess and bobs was that miss frost might have had a past relationshipor just a previous meetingwith one or more of the airmen maybe as herm hoyt had speculated to me one of the fellas had objected to the intercrural sex he might have found it insufficient perhaps given how young the airmen were they knew of miss frost only by reputation it might have been enough provocation to them that she was in their minds not a real womanit might have been only that or they were frigging homophobesit might have been only that too whatever led to the altercation it was apparentas coach hoyt had predictedthat big al would never back down from a fight im sorry billy uncle bob said later bob and i agreed we were glad that herm hoyt hadnt lived to hear about it i called elaine in new york that night she had her own small place in chelsea just a little northwest of the west village and due north of the meatpacking district i told elaine about miss frost and i asked her to sing me that mendelssohn songthe one shed said she was saving for me the same one shed sung for larry i promise i wont die on your shift elaine youll never have to sing that song for me besides i need to hear it now i told her as for the mendelssohn song elaine explained it was a small part of elijahmendelssohns longest work it comes near the end of that oratorio after god arrives in the voice of a small child and the angels sing blessings to elijah who sings his last ariafor the mountains shall depart thats what elaine sang to me her alto voice was big and strong even over the phone and i said goodbye to miss frost listening to the same music id heard when i was saying goodbye to larry miss frost had been lost to me for almost thirty years but that night i knew she was gone for good and all that uncle bob would say about her in the river bulletin wasnt nearly enough sad tidings for the class of al frost born first sister vermont wrestling team captain undefeated died dover or portsmouth new hampshire thats it i remember asking uncle bob shit billywhat else can we say in an alumni magazine the racquet man said when richard and martha were auctioning off the old furniture from grandpa harrys river street house they told me theyd found thirteen beer bottles under the livingroom couchall uncle bobs if i had to bet all from that one party to commemorate aunt muriel and my mother way to go bob id said to mrs hadley and richard i knew the racquet man was right what can you say in a frigging alumni magazine about a transsexual wrestler who was killed in a bar fight not much it was a couple of years lateri was slowly adjusting to living in vermontwhen i got a latenight phone call from el it took me a second or two to recognize her voice i think she was drunk you know that friend of yoursthe girl like me but shes older el asked you mean donna i said after a pause yeah donna el said well she is sick nowthats what i heard thank you for telling me i was saying when el hung up the phone it was too late to call anybody in toronto i just slept on the news im guessing this would have been or it may even have been early in after i moved to vermont i didnt pay such close attention to time i had a few friends in toronto i asked around i was told about an excellent hospice thereeveryone i knew said it was quite a wonderful place under the circumstances casey house it was called just recently someone told me it still exists the director of nursing at casey house at that time was a great guy his first name was john if i remember correctly and i think he had an irish last name since id moved back to first sister i was discovering that i wasnt very good at remembering names besides whenever this was exactlywhen i heard about donna being sicki was already fifty or in my fifties it wasnt just names i had trouble remembering john told me that donna had been admitted to hospice care several months before but donna was don to the nurses and other caregivers at casey house john had explained to me estrogen has side effectsin particular it can affect the liver john told me furthermore estrogens can cause a kind of hepatitis the bile stagnates and builds the itching that occurs with this condition was driving don nuts was how john put it it was donna herself whod told everyone to call her don upon stopping the estrogens her beard came back it seemed exceptionally unfair to me that donna who had worked so hard to feminize herself was not only dying of aids she was being forced to return to her former male self donna also had cytomegalovirus in this case the blindness may be a blessing john told me he meant that donna was spared seeing her beard but of course she could feel iteven though one of the nurses shaved her face every day i just want to prepare you john said to me watch yourself dont call him donna just try not to let that name slip in our phone conversations id noticed that the director of nursing was careful to use the he and him words while discussing don john not once said she or her or donna thus prepared i found my way to huntley street in downtown torontoa small residentiallooking street or so it seemed to me between church street and sherbourne street if you know the city casey house itself was like a very large familys home it had as pleasant and welcoming an atmosphere as was possible but theres only so much you can do about bedsores and muscular wastingor the lingering smell no matter how hard you try to mask it of fulminant diarrhea donnas room had an almostnice lavender smell a bathroom deodorizer a perfumed disinfectantnot one i would choose i must have held my breath is that you billy donna asked white splotches clouded her eyes but she could hear okay ill bet shed heard me hold my breath of course theyd told her i was coming and a nurse had very recently shaved her i was unused to the masculine smell of the shaving cream or maybe it was an aftershave gel yet when i kissed her i could feel the beard on donnas cheekas id not once felt it when we were making loveand i could see the shadow of a beard on her cleanshaven face she was taking coumadin i saw the pills on the bedside table i was impressed by what a good job the nurses were doing at casey house they were experts at accomplishing all they could to make donna comfortable including of course the pain control john had explained to me the subtleties of sublingual morphine versus morphine elixir versus fentanyl patch but i hadnt really been listening john also told me that don was using a special cream that seemed to help control his itching although the cream was exposing don to a lot of steroids suffice it to say i saw that donna was in good and caring hands at casey houseeven though she was blind and she was dying as a man while i was visiting with donna two of her toronto friends also came to see hertwo very passable transsexuals each of them clearly dedicated to living her life as a woman when donna introduced us i very much had the feeling that shed forewarned them i would be there in fact donna might have asked her friends to stop by when i was with her maybe donna wanted me to see that shed found her people and that shed been happy in toronto the two transsexuals were very friendly to meone of them flirted with me but it was all for show oh youre the writerwe know all about you the more outgoing but not flirtatious one said oh yeahthe bi guy right the one who was coming on to me said she definitely wasnt serious about it the flirting was entirely for donnas amusement donna had always loved flirting watch out for her billy donna told me and all three of them laughed given atkins given delacorte given larrynot to mention those airmen who killed miss frostit wasnt a terribly painful visit at one point donna even said to her flirtatious friend you know lornabilly never complained that i had too big a cock you liked my cock didnt you billy donna asked me i certainly did i told her being careful not to say i certainly did donna yeah but you told me billy was a top lorna said to donna the other transsexual whose name was lilly laughed try being a bottom and see what too big a cock does to you you see billy donna said i told you to watch out for lorna shes already found a way to let you know shes a bottom and that she likes little cocks the three friends all laughed at thati had to laugh too i only noticed when i was saying goodbye to donna that her friends and i had not once called her by namenot donna or don the two transsexuals waited for me when i was saying goodbye to john i would have hated his job i walked with lorna and lilly to the sherbourne subway station they were taking the subway home they said by the way they said the home word and the way they were holding hands i got the feeling that they lived together when i asked them where i could catch a taxi to take me back to my hotel lilly said im glad you mentioned what hotel youre staying inill be sure to tell donna that you and lorna got in a lot of trouble lorna laughed ill probably tell donna that you and lilly got in trouble too lorna told me donna loves it when i say lilly never knew a cock she didnt like big or littlethat cracks her up lilly laughed and i did too but the flirting was finished it had all been for donna i kissed donnas two friends goodbye at the sherbourne subway station their cheeks perfectly soft and smooth with no hint of a beardabsolutely nothing you could feel against your face and not the slightest shadow on their pretty faces i still have dreams about those two i was thinking as i kissed them goodbye of what elaine told me mrs kittredge had said when elaine was traveling in europe with kittredges mother this was what mrs kittredge really saidnot the story elaine first told me i dont know what your son wants elaine had told kittredges mother i just know he always wants something ill tell you what he wantseven more than he wants to fuck us mrs kittredge said he wants to be one of us elaine he doesnt want to be a boy or a man it doesnt matter to him that hes finally so good at being a boy or a man he never wanted to be a boy or a man in the first place but if kittredge was a woman nowif he was like donna had been or like donnas two very passable friendsand if kittredge had aids and was dying somewhere what if theyd had to stop giving kittredge the estrogens kittredge had a very heavy beard i could still feel after more than thirty years how heavy his beard was i had so often and for so long imagined kittredges beard scratching against my face do you remember what he said to me about transsexuals i regret ive never tried one kittredge had whispered in my ear but i have the impression that if you pick up one the others will come along hed been talking about the transvestites hed seen in paris i think if i were going to try it i would try it in paris kittredge had said to me but you nymphyouve already done it kittredge had cried elaine and i had seen kittredges single room at favorite river academy most memorably to me the photograph of kittredge and his mother that was taken after a wrestling match what elaine and i had noticed simultaneously was that an unseen hand had cut off mrs kittredges face and glued it to kittredges body there was kittredges mother in kittredges wrestling tights and singlet and there was kittredges handsome face glued to his mothers beautiful and exquisitely tailored body the truth was kittredges face had worked on a womans body with a womans clothes elaine had convinced me that kittredge must have been the one who switched the faces in the photograph mrs kittredge couldnt have done it that woman has no imagination and no sense of humor elaine had said in her authoritarian way i was back home from toronto having said goodbye to donna lavender would never smell the same to me again and you can imagine what an anticlimax it would be when uncle bob called me in my river street house with the latest news of a classmates death youve lost another classmate billynot your favorite person if memory serves the racquet man said as vague as i am concerning when i heard the news about donna i can tell you exactly when it was that uncle bob called me with the news about kittredge id just celebrated my fiftythird birthday it was march there was still a lot of snow on the ground in first sister with nothing but mud season to look forward to elaine and i had been talking about taking a trip to mexico shed been looking at houses to rent in playa del carmen i would have happily gone to mexico with her but she was having a boyfriend problem her boyfriend was a tightassed turd who didnt want elaine to go anywhere with me didnt you tell him we dont do it i asked her yes but i also told him that we used to do itor that we tried to elaine said revising herself why did you tell him that i asked her im trying out a new honesty policy elaine answered im not making up so many stories or im trying not to how is this policy working out with your fiction writing i asked her i dont think i can go to mexico with you billynot right now was all shed said id had a recent boyfriend problem of my own but when i dumped the boyfriend i had rather soon developed a girlfriend problem she was a firstyear faculty member at favorite river a young english teacher mrs hadley and richard had introduced us theyd invited me to dinner and there was amanda when i first saw her i thought she was one of richards studentsshe looked that young to me but she was an anxious young woman in her late twenties im almost thirty amanda was always saying as if she was anxious that she was too younglooking therefore saying she would soon be thirty made her seem older when we started sleeping together amanda was anxious about where we did it she had a faculty apartment in one of the girls dorms at favorite river when i spent the night with her there the girls in the dormitory knew about it but most nights amanda had dorm dutyshe couldnt stay with me in my house on river street the way it was working out i wasnt sleeping with amanda nearly enoughthat was the developing problem and then of course there was the bi issue shed read all my novels she said she loved my writing but that i was a bi guy made her anxious too i just cant believe youre fiftythree amanda kept saying which confused me i couldnt tell if she meant i seemed so much younger than i was or that she was appalled at herself for dating an old bi guy in his fifties martha hadley who was seventyfive had retired but she still met with individual students who had special needspronunciation problems included mrs hadley had told me that amanda suffered from pronunciation problems that wasnt why you introduced us was it i asked martha it wasnt my idea billy mrs hadley said it was richards idea to introduce you to amanda because she is such a fan of your writing i never thought it was a good ideashes way too young for you and shes anxious about everything i can only imagine that because you are biwell thats got to keep amanda awake at night she cant pronounce the word bisexual oh thats what was going on in my life when uncle bob called me about kittredge thats why i said half seriously i had nothing but mud season to look forward tonothing except my writing moving to vermont had been good for my writing the account of kittredges death had been submitted to the office of alumni affairs by mrs kittredge do you mean he had a wife or do you mean his mother i asked uncle bob kittredge had a wife billy but we heard from the mother jesushow old would mrs kittredge be i asked bob shes only seventytwo my uncle answered uncle bob was seventyeight and he sounded a little insulted by my question elaine had told me that mrs kittredge had only been eighteen when kittredge was born according to bobthat is according to mrs kittredgemy former heartthrob and tormentor had died in zurich switzerland of natural causes bullshit bob i said kittredge was only a year older than i amhe was fiftyfour what natural causes can kill you when youre fiftyfuckingfour my thoughts exactly billybut thats what his mom said the racquet man replied from what ive heard ill bet kittredge died of aids i said what mother of mrs kittredges generation would be likely to tell her sons old school that uncle bob asked me indeed sue atkins had reported only that tom atkins had died after a long illness you said kittredge had a wife i replied to my uncle he is survived by his wife and his sonan only childand by his mother of course the racquet man told me the boy is named after his fatheranother jacques the wife has a germansounding name you studied german didnt you billy what kind of name is irmgard uncle bob asked definitely germansounding i said if kittredge had wasted away in zuricheven if hed died in switzerland of natural causespossibly his wife was swiss but irmgard was a german name boy was that ever a tough christian name to carry around it was terribly oldfashioned one immediately felt the stiffness of the person wearing that heavy name i thought it was a suitable name for an elderly schoolmistress a strict disciplinarian i was guessing that the only child the son named jacques would have been born sometime in the early seventies that would have been right on schedule for the kind of careeroriented young man i imagined kittredge was in those early yearsgiven the mfa from yale given his first few steps along a no doubt bright and shining career path in the world of drama only at the appropriate time would kittredge have paused and found a wife and then what how had things unraveled after that that fuckergod damn him elaine cried when i told her kittredge had died she was furiousit was as if kittredge had escaped somehow she couldnt speak about the of natural causes bullshit not to mention the wife he cant get away with this elaine cried elainehe died he didnt get away with anything i said but elaine cried and cried unfortunately it was one of the few nights when amanda didnt have dorm duty she was staying with me in the river street house and so i had to tell her about kittredge and elaine and all the rest no doubt this history was more biand gay and transgender as amanda would sayin nature than anything amanda had been forced to imagine although she kept saying how much she loved my writing where shed no doubt encountered a world of sexual differences as richard would say i blame myself for not saying anything to amanda about the frigging ghosts in that river street house only other people saw themthey never bothered me but amanda got up to go to the bathroomit was the middle of the nightand her screaming woke me it was a brandnew bathtub in that bathroomit was not the same tub grandpa harry had pulled the trigger in just the same bathroombut when amanda finally calmed down enough to tell me what happened when she was sitting on the toilet it had no doubt been harry shed seen in that brandnew bathtub he was curled up like a little boy in the bathtubhe smiled at me when i was peeing amanda who was still sobbing explained im really sorry i said but he was no little boy amanda moaned no he wasntthat was my grandfather i tried to tell her calmly oh that harryhe certainly loved a new audience even as a ghost even as a man at first i didnt see the riflebut he wanted me to see it billy he showed me the gun and then he shot himself in the headhis head went all over the place amanda wailed naturally i had some explaining to do i had to tell her everything about grandpa harry we were up all night amanda would not go to the bathroom by herself in the morningshe wouldnt even be alone in one of the other bathrooms which id suggested i understood i was very understanding ive never seen a frigging ghostim sure theyre frightening i guess the last straw as i would later explain to mrs hadley and richard was that amanda was so rattled in the morningafter all the anxious young woman hadnt had a good nights sleepshe opened the door to my bedroom closet thinking she was opening the door to the upstairs hall and there was grandpa harrys mossberg i keep that old carbine in my closet where it just leans against a wall amanda screamed and screamedchrist she wouldnt stop screaming you kept the actual gunyou keep it in your bedroom closet who would ever keep the very same gun his grandfather used to blow himself all over the bathroom billy amanda yelled at me amanda has a point about the gun bill richard would say to me when i told him that amanda and i were no longer seeing each other nobody wants you to have that gun billy martha hadley said if you get rid of the gun maybe the ghosts will leave billy elaine told me but those ghosts have never appeared to me i think you have to be receptive to see ghosts like that and i guess im not receptive in that way i have my own ghostsmy own terrifying angels as i more than once have thought of thembut my ghosts dont live in that river street house in first sister vermont i would go to mexico alone that mud season of i rented a house elaine told me about in playa del carmen i drank a lot of cerveza and i picked up a handsome swashbucklinglooking guy with a pencilthin mustache and dark sideburns honestly he looked like one of the actors who played zorroone of the old blackandwhite versions we had fun we drank a lot more cerveza and when i came back to vermont it was almost looking like spring not much would happen to menot for fifteen yearsexcept that i became a teacher the private schoolsyoure supposed to call them independent schools but i still let the private word slip outarent so strict about the retirement age richard abbott wouldnt retire from favorite river academy until he was in his early seventies and even after he retired richard went to all the productions of the schools drama club richard wasnt very happy about his various replacementswell nobody was happy about that lackluster bunch of buffoons there wasnt anyone in the english department who had richards feelings for shakespeare and there was no one who knew shit about theater martha hadley and richard were all over me to get involved at the academy the kids read your novels billy richard kept telling me especiallyyou knowthe kids who are sexually different billy mrs hadley said she was still working with individual cases as she called them in her eighties it was from elaine that i first heard there were groups for lesbian gay bi and transgender kids on college campuses it was richard abbottin his late seventieswho told me there was even such a group of kids at favorite river academy it was hard for a bi guy of my generation to imagine such organized and recognized groups they were becoming so common these groups were known by their initials when i first heard about this i couldnt believe it when elaine was teaching at nyu she invited me to come give a reading from a new novel to the lgbt group on campus i was so out of it it took me days of reciting those initials before i could keep them in the correct order it would have been the fall term of at favorite river academy when mrs hadley told me there was someone special she and richard wanted me to meet i immediately thought it was a new teacher at the academysomeone in the english department either a pretty woman or a cute guy i guessed or possibly this special person had just been hired to breathe a hope of new life into the failing allbutexpired drama club at favorite river i was remembering amandathats where i thought this matchmaking enterprise of martha hadleys and richards was headed but nonot at my age i was sixtyfive in the fall of mrs hadley and richard werent trying to fix me up martha hadley was a spry eightyseven but one slip on the ice or in the snowone bad fall a broken hipand she would be checking into the facility mrs hadley would soon be checking in there anyway and richard abbott was no longer leadingman material at seventyseven richard had come partway out of retirement to teach a shakespeare course at favorite river but he didnt have the stamina to put shakespeare onstage anymore richard was just reading the plays with some firstyear kids at the academy all of them were starting freshmen at the school kids in the class of i couldnt imagine being that young again we want to introduce you to a new student bill richard said he was rather indignant at the very idea of him or martha finding me a likely date a new freshman billysomeone special mrs hadley said someone with pronunciation problems you mean i asked martha hadley were not trying to fix you up with a teacher bill we think you should be a teacher richard said we want you to meet one of the new lgbt kids billy mrs hadley told me surewhy not i said i dont know about being a teacher but ill meet the kid boy or girl i remember asking martha hadley and richard they just looked at each other ah well richard started to say but mrs hadley interrupted him martha hadley took my hands in hers and squeezed them boy or girl billy she said well thats the question thats why we want you to meet him or herthats the question oh i said that was how and why i became a teacher the racquet man was ninety when he checked into the facility this followed two hipreplacement surgeries and a fall downstairs when he was supposed to be healing from the second surgery im starting to feel like an old fella billy bob told me when i went to visit him in the facility in the autumn of the same september mrs hadley and richard introduced me to the lgbt kid the one who would change my life uncle bob was recovering from pneumoniathe result of being bedridden for a period of time after he fell from the aids epidemic i still had a vivid memory of that pneumoniathe one so many people never recovered from i was happy to see bob up and about but hed decided he was staying at the facility i gotta let these folks look after me billy the racquet man said i understood how he felt muriel had been gone for almost thirty years and gerry who was sixtyeight had just started living with a new girlfriend in california vagina lady which had been elaines name for helena was long gone no one had met gerrys new girlfriend but gerry had written me about her she was only my age gerry told meas if the girl were under the age of consent the next thing you know billy uncle bob told me theyll start legalizing samesex marriage all over the place and gerry will be marrying her next new girlfriend if i stay put in the facility gerry will have to get married in vermont the racquet man exclaimed as if the very idea of that ever happening was beyond credibility thus assured that my ninetyyearold uncle bob was safe at the facility i made my way to noah adams hall which was the building for english and foreignlanguage studies at favorite river i was meeting the special new student in richards groundfloor office which was adjacent to richards classroom mrs hadley was also meeting us there to my horror richards office hadnt changed it was awful there was a fakeleather couch that smelled worse than any dog bed youve ever smelled there were three or four straightbacked wooden chairs of the kind with those arms that have a flat minidesk for writing there was richards desk which was always a mountain of upheaval a pile of opened books and loose papers obscured the writing surface richards desk chair was on casters so that richard could slide all around his office in a seated positionwhich to the students general amusement richard did what had changed at favorite river since my days at the formerly allboys school was not only the girlsit was the dress code if there was one in i couldnt tell you what it was coats and ties were no longer required there was some vague rule against torn jeansthis meant jeans that were tattered or slashed there was a rule that you couldnt come to the dining hall in your pajamas and another one which was always being protested that concerned the girls bare midriffshow much midriff could be bare was the issue oh and socalled plumbers cracks were deemed offensivethis was most offensive i was told when the cracks belonged to the boys both the girls bare midriffs and the boys plumbers cracks were hotly debated rules which were constantly under revision in infinitesimal ways they were sexually discriminatory rules the students said girls midriffs and boys cracks were being singled out as bad here id been expecting martha and richards special student to be some cuttingedge hermaphroditea kind of alluringtoeveryone mélange of reproductive organs a he or a she as sexually beguiling as the mythological combination of a nymph and a satyr in a fellini filmbut there in richards office slouched on that dog bed of a couch was a sloppily dressed slightly overweight boy with a brightly inflamed pimple on his neck and only the spottiest evidence of a prepubescent beard that zit was almost as angrylooking as the boy himself when he saw me his eyes narrowedeither in resentment or due to the effort he was making to scrutinize me more closely hi im bill abbott i said to the boy this is george mrs hadley started to say georgia the boy quickly corrected her im georgia montgomerythe kids call me gee gee i repeated gee will do for now the boy said but im going to be georgia this isnt my body he said angrily im not what you see im becoming someone else okay i said i came to this school because you went here the boy told me gee was in school in california richard started to explain i thought there might be other transgender kids here gee told me but there arentnobody whos out anyway his parents mrs hadley tried to tell me her parents gee corrected martha gees parents are very liberal martha said to me they support you dont they mrs hadley asked the boyor the girlinprogress if thats who he or she was my parents are liberal and they do support me gee said but my parents are also afraid of methey say yes to everything like my coming all the way to vermont i see i said ive read all your books gee told me youre pretty angry arent you youre pretty pessimistic anyway you dont see all the sexual intolerance ending anytime soon do you the boy asked me i write fiction i cautioned him im not necessarily as pessimistic about real life as i am when i make up a story you seem pretty angry the boy insisted we should leave these two alone richard mrs hadley said yes yesyoure on your own bill richard said patting me on the back ask bill to tell you about a transsexual he knew gee richard said to the girlinprogress as he was leaving transgender gee corrected richard not to me i told the kid i know the language changes i know im an old man and out of date but the person i knew was a transsexual to me at that time thats who she was i say transsexual if you want to hear the story youll just have to get used to that dont correct my language i told the kid he just sat there on that smelly couch staring at me im a liberal too i told him but i dont say yes to everything were reading the tempest in richards class gee saidapropos of nothing or so i thought its too bad we cant put it onstage the boy added but richard has assigned us parts to read in class im calibanim the monster naturally i was ariel once i told him i saw my grandfather do caliban onstage he played caliban as a woman i said to the girlinprogress really the kid asked me he smiled for the first time and i could suddenly see it he had a pretty girls smile it was hidden in the boys unformed face and further concealed by his sloppy boys body but i could see the her in him tell me about the transgender you knew the kid told me transsexual i said okayplease tell me about her gee asked me its a long story geei was in love with her i told himi told her i should say okay she repeated later that day we went together to the dining hall the kid was only fourteen and she was famished you see that jock over there gee asked me i couldnt see which jock gee meant because there was a whole table of themfootball players from the look of them i just nodded he calls me tampon or sometimes just georgenot gee needless to say never georgia the kid said smiling tampon is pretty terrible i told the girl actually i prefer it to george gee told me you know mr a you could probably direct the tempest couldnt youif you wanted to that way we could put shakespeare onstage no one had ever called me mr a i must have liked it id already decided that if gee wanted to be a girl this badly she had to be one i wanted to direct the tempest too hey tampon someone called lets have a word with the football players i told gee we went over to their table they instantly stopped eating they saw the tragiclooking mess of a boythe transgender wannabe as they probably thought of himand they saw me a sixtyfiveyearold man whom they might have mistaken for a faculty member i soon would be after all i looked way too old to be gees father this is geethats her name remember it i said to them they didnt respond which of you called gee tampon i asked them there was no response to my question either fucking bullies most of them are cowards if someone mistakes you for a tampon geewhose fault is it if you dont speak up about it i asked the girl who still looked like a boy that would be my fault gee said whats her name i asked the football players all but one of them called out gee the one who hadnt spoken the biggest one was eating again he was looking at his food not at me when i spoke to him whats her name i asked again he pointed to his mouth which was full ill wait i told him hes not on the faculty the big football player said to his teammates when hed swallowed his food hes just a writer who lives in town hes some old gay guy who lives here and he went to school here he cant tell us what to dohes not on the faculty whats her name i asked him douche bag the football player asked me he was smiling nowso were the other football players you see why im pretty angry as you say gee i asked the fourteenyearold is this the guy who calls you tampon yesthats him gee said the football player the one who knew who i was had stood up from the table he was a very big kid maybe four inches taller than i am and easily twenty or thirty pounds heavier get lost you old fag the big kid said to me i thought it would be better if i could get him to say the fag word to gee i knew i would have the fucker then the dress code may have relaxed at favorite river but there were other rules in placerules that didnt exist when id been a student you couldnt get thrown out of favorite river for saying tampon or douche bag but the fag word was in the category of hate like the nigger word and the kike word the fag word could get you in trouble fucking football players i heard gee say it was something herm hoyt used to say wrestlers are rather contemptuous about how tough football players think they are that young transgenderinprogress must have been reading my mind what did you say you little fag the big kid said he took a cheap shot at geehe smacked the heel of his hand into the fourteenyearolds face it must have hurt her but i saw that gee wasnt going to back down her nose was starting to bleed when i stepped between them thats enough i said to the big kid but he bumped me with his chest i saw the right hook coming and took the punch on my left forearmthe way jim somebody had shown me down that fourthfloor hall in the boxing room at the nyac the football player was a little surprised when i reached up and caught the back of his neck in a collartie he pushed back against me hard he was a heavy kid and he leaned all his weight on mejust what you want your opponent to do if you have a halfwaydecent duckunder the dininghall floor was a lot harder than a wrestling mat and the big kid landed awkwardly with all his weight and most of mine on one shoulder i was pretty sure hed separated that shoulder or he had broken his collarboneor both at the time he was just lying on the floor trying not to move that shoulder or his upper arm fucking football players gee repeated this time to the whole table of them they could see her nose was bleeding more for the fourth time whats her name i asked the big kid lying on the floor gee the douchebag tampon guy said it turned out that he was a pga nineteenyearold postgraduate whod been admitted to favorite river to play football either the separated shoulder or the broken collarbone would cause him to miss the rest of the football season the academy didnt expel him for the fag word but he was put on probation both gee and i had hoped that her nose was broken but it wasnt the pg would be thrown out of school the following spring for using the dyke word in reference to a girl who wouldnt sleep with him when i agreed to teach parttime at favorite river i said i would do so only on the condition that the academy make an effort to educate new students especially the older pgs on the subject of the liberal culture at favorite riveri meant of course in regard to our acceptance of sexual diversity but there in the dining hall on that september day in i didnt have anything more of an educative nature to say to the football players my new protégée gee however had more to say to those jocks who were still sitting at their table im going to become a girl she told them bravely one day ill be georgia but for now im just gee and you can see me as caliban in shakespeares the tempest perhaps it will be a winterterm play i cautioned the football players not that i expected any of them to come see it i just thought that i might need that long to get the kids ready all the students in richards shakespeare class were freshmen i would open auditions to the entire school but i feared that the kids who would be most interested in the play were like gee only freshmen theres one more thing my protégée said to the football players her nose was streaming blood but i could tell gee was happy about that mr a is not an old gay guyhes an old bi guy you got that i was impressed that the football players nodded well okay not the big one on the dininghall floor he was just lying there not moving i only regret that miss frost and coach hoyt didnt see me hit that duckunder if i do say so myself it was a pretty good duckundermy one move chapter teacher all that had happened three years ago when gee was just a freshman you should have seen gee at the start of her senior year in the fall term of at seventeen that girl was a knockout gee would turn eighteen her senior year she would graduate on schedule with the class of all im saying is you should have seen her when she was a senior mrs hadley and richard were right gee was special that fall term of we were in rehearsals for what richard called the fall shakespeare we would be performing romeo and juliet in that most edgy timethe brief bit of school that remains between the thanksgiving break and christmas vacation as a teacher i can tell you thats a terrible time the kids are woefully distracted they have exams they have papers dueand to make it worse the fall sports have been replaced by the winter ones there is much thats new but a lot thats old everyone has a cough and tempers are short the drama club at favorite river had last put on romeo and juliet in the winter of which was twentyfive years ago i still remembered what larry had said to richard about casting a boy as juliet larry thought shakespeare would have loved the idea but richard had asked where do i find a boy with the balls to play juliet not even lawrence upton could find an answer for that now i knew a boy with the balls to play juliet i had gee andas a girlgee was just about perfect at seventeen gee still actually had balls too shed begun the extensive psychological examinationsthe counseling and psychotherapynecessary for young people who are serious about gender reassignment i dont believe that her beard had yet been removed by the process of electrolysis gee may not have been old enough for electrolysis but i dont really know i do know that with her parents and her doctors approval gee was receiving injections of female hormones if she stayed committed to her sex change she would have to continue to take those hormones for the rest of her life i had no doubt that gee soon to be georgia montgomery would stay committed what was it elaine once said about the possibility of kittredge playing juliet it wouldnt have worked we agreed juliet is nothing if shes not sincere elaine had said boy did i ever have a juliet who was sincere gee had always had balls but now she had breastssmall but very pretty onesand her hair had acquired a new luster my how her eyelashes had grown gees skin had become softer and the acne was altogether gone her hips had spread though shed actually lost weight since her freshman yearher hips were already womanly if not yet curvaceous whats more important the whole community at favorite river academy knew who and what gee montgomery was sure there were still a few jocks who hadnt entirely accepted how sexually diverse a school we were trying to be there will always be a few troglodytes larry would have been proud of me i thought in a word it might have surprised larry to see how involved i was political activism didnt come naturally to me but i was at least a little active politically id traveled to some college campuses in our state id spoken to the lgbt groups at middlebury college and the university of vermont id supported the samesex marriage bill which the vermont state senate passed into lawover the veto of our republican governor a troglodyte larry would have laughed to see me supporting gay marriage because larry knew what i thought of any marriage old mr monogamy larry would have teased me but gay marriage is what the gay and bi kids want and i support those kids i see a future hero in you grandpa harry had told me i wouldnt go that far but i hope miss frost might have approved of me in my own way i was protecting someoneid protected gee i was a worthwhile person in gees life maybe miss frost would have liked me for that this was my life at age sixtyeight i was a parttime english teacher at my old school favorite river academy i also directed the drama club there i was a writer and an occasional political activiston the side of lgbt groups everywhere oh forgive me the language i know keeps changing a very young teacher at favorite river told me it was no longer appropriate or inclusive enough to say lgbtit was supposed to be lgbtq what is the fucking q for i asked the teacher quarrelsome perhaps no bill the teacher said questioning oh i remember you at the questioning phase billy martha hadley told me ah wellyes i remember me at that phase too im okay about saying lgbtq at my age i just have trouble remembering the frigging q mrs hadley lives in the facility now shes ninety and richard visits her every day i visit martha twice a weekat the same time i visit uncle bob at ninetythree the racquet man is doing surprisingly wellthat is physically bobs memory isnt all it was but thats a good fellas failing sometimes bob even forgets that gerry and her california girlfriendthe one whos as old as i amwere married in vermont this year it was a june wedding we had it at my house on river street both mrs hadley and uncle bob were theremartha in a wheelchair the racquet man was pushing mrs hadley around are you sure you dont want me to take over pushing the wheelchair bob richard and i and elaine kept asking what makes you think im pushing it the racquet man asked us im just leaning on it anyway when uncle bob asks me when gerrys wedding is i have to keep reminding him that shes already married it was in part bobs forgetfulness that almost caused me to miss one small highlight of my lifea small but truly important highlight i think what are you going to do about señor bovary billy uncle bob asked me when i was driving him back to the facility from gerrys wedding señor who i asked the racquet man shit billyim sorry uncle bob said i cant remember my alumni affairs anymoreas soon as i hear something i seem to forget it but it wasnt exactly in the category of an announcement for publication in the river bulletin it was just a query that came to bob in care of the cries for help from the wherehaveyougone dept please pass this message along to young william the carefully typed letter began his father william francis dean would like to know how his son iseven if the old prima donna himself wont write his son and just ask him there was an aids epidemic you know since hes still writing books we assume that young william survived it but hows his health as we say over hereif you would be so kind as to ask young williamcómo está and please tell young william if he wants to see us before we die he ought to pay us a visit the carefully typed letter was from my fathers longtime loverthe toiletseat skipper the reader the guy who reconnected with my dad on the subway and didnt get off at the next station he had typed not signed his name señor bovary i went one summer recently with a somewhat cynical dutch friend to the gaypride parade in amsterdam that city is a hopeful experiment i have long believed and i loved the parade there were surging tides of men dancing in the streetsguys in purple and pink leather boys in speedos with leopard spots men in jockstraps kissing one woman sleekly covered with wetlooking green feathers and sporting an allblack strapon cock i said to my friend that there were many cities where they preached tolerance but amsterdam truly practiced iteven flaunted it as i spoke a long barge glided by on one of the canals an allgirls rock band was playing onboard and there were women wearing transparent leotards and waving to us onshore the women were waving dildoes but my cynical dutch friend gave me a tired and barely tolerant look he seemed as indifferent to the gay goingson as the mostly foreignborn prostitutes in the windows and doorways of de wallen amsterdams redlight district amsterdam is so over my dutch friend said the new scene for gays in europe is madrid madrid i repeated the way i do i was an old bi guy in his sixties living in vermont what did i know about the new scene for gays in europe what did i know about any frigging scene it was on señor bovarys recommendation that i stayed at the santo mauro in madrid it was a pretty quiet hotel on the zurbanoa narrow treelined street a residential but boringlooking neighborhood within walking distance of chueca well it was a long walk to chueca the gay district of madridas señor bovary described chueca in his email to me bovarys typed letter which was mailed to uncle bob at favorite rivers office of alumni affairs had not included a return addressjust an email address and señor bovarys cellphone number the initial contact by letter and my followup email communication with my fathers enduring partner suggested a curious combination of the oldfashioned and the contemporary i believe that the bovary character is your dads age billy uncle bob had forewarned me i knew from the owl that william francis dean had been born in which meant that my father and señor bovary were eightysix i also knew from the same owl that franny dean had wanted to be a performer but performing what from the emails of the bovary character as the racquet man had called my dads lover i understood that my father had not been informed of my coming to madrid this was entirely señor bovarys idea and i was following his instructions have a walk around chueca on the day you arrive go to bed early that first night ill meet you for dinner on your second night well take a stroll well end up in chueca and ill bring you to the club if your father knew you were coming it would just make him selfconscious señor bovarys email said what club i wondered franny wasnt a bad guy billy uncle bob had told me when i was still a student at favorite river he was just a little light in his loafers if you know what i mean probably the place bovary was taking me in chueca was that sort of club but what kind of gay club was it even an old bi guy in vermont knows theres more than one kind of gay club in the late afternoon in chueca most of the shops were still closed for siesta in the ninetydegree heat it was a dry heat howeververy agreeable to a visitor coming to madrid from the blackfly season in vermont i had the feeling that the calle de hortaleza was a busy street of commercialized gay sex it had a sextourism atmosphere even at the siesta time of day there were some lone older men around and only occasional groups of young gay guys there would have been more of both types on a weekend but this was a workday afternoon there was not much of a lesbian presencenot that i could see but this was my first look at chueca there was a nightclub called a noite on hortaleza near the corner of the calle de augusto figueroa but you dont notice nightclubs during the day it was the outofplace portuguese name of the club that caught my eyea noite means the night in portugueseand those tattered billboards advertising shows including one with drag queens the streets between the gran vía and the metro station in the plaza de chueca were crowded with bars and sex shops and gay clothing stores taglia the wig shop on the calle de hortaleza was opposite a bodybuilders gym i saw that tintin tshirts were popular andon the corner of the calle de hernán cortésthere were male mannequins in thongs in the storefront window theres one thing im glad to be too old for thongs fighting jet lag i was just trying to get through the day and to stay up late enough to have an early dinner at my hotel before i went to bed i was too tired to appreciate the musclebound waiters in tshirts at the mama inés café on hortaleza there were mostly men in couples and a woman who was alone she was wearing flipflops and a halter top she had an angular face and looked very sad resting her mouth on one hand i almost tried to pick her up i remember wondering if in spain the women were very thin until they suddenly became fat i was noticing a certain type of manskinny in a tank top but with a small and helplesslooking potbelly i had a café con leche as late as pmvery unlike me too late in the day for me to drink coffee but i was trying to stay awake i later found a bookstore on the calle de gravinalibros i believe it was called im not kidding a bookstore called books the english novel in english was well represented there but there was nothing contemporarynot even from the twentieth century i browsed the fiction section for a while diagonally across the street on the corner of san gregorio was what looked like a popular barthe ángel sierra the siesta must have been over by the time i left the bookstore because that bar was beginning to get crowded i passed a coffeehouse also on the calle de gravino with some older stylishly dressed lesbians sitting at a window tableto my limited knowledge the only lesbians i spotted in chueca and almost the only women i saw anywhere in that district but it was still early in the evening and i knew that everything in spain happens late id been in barcelona before on translation trips my spanishlanguage publisher is based there as i was leaving chuecafor that long walk back to the santo mauroi stopped in at a bear bar on the calle de las infantas the bar called hot was packed with men standing chest to chest and back to back they were older men and you know what bears are likeordinarylooking men chubby guys with beards many beer drinkers among them it was spain so of course there was a lot of smoking i didnt stay long but hot had a friendly atmosphere the shirtless bartenders were the youngest guys in the placethey were hot all right the dapper little man who met me at a restaurant in the plaza mayor the following night did not immediately summon to mind a young soldier with his pants down at his ankles reading madame bovary in a storm at sea whileon his bare bumhe skipped over a row of toilet seats to meet my young father señor bovarys hair was neatly trimmed and all white as were the short bristles of his nononsense mustache he wore a pressed shortsleeved white shirt with two breast pocketsone for his reading glasses the other armed with pens his khaki trousers were sharply creased perhaps the only contemporary components of the fastidious mans oldfashioned image were his sandals they were the kind of sandals that young outdoorsmen wear when they wade in raging rivers and run through fastflowing streamsthose sandals that have the builtup and seriouslooking treads of running shoes bovary he said he extended his hand palm down so that i didnt know if he expected me to shake it or kiss it i shook it im so glad you contacted me i told him i dont know what your father has been waiting for now that your motheruna mujer difícil a difficult womanhas been dead for thirtytwo years it is thirtytwo isnt it the little man asked yes i said let me know what your hiv status is ill tell your father bovary said hes dying to hear but i know himhell never ask you himself hell just worry about it after youve gone back home hes an impossible procrastinator bovary exclaimed affectionately giving me a small twinkling smile i told him i keep testing negative i dont have hiv disease no toxic cocktail for youthats the ticket señor bovary exclaimed we dont have the virus eitherif youre interested i admit to having had sex only with your father andsave that truly disastrous dalliance with your momyour dad has had sex only with me how boring is that the little man asked me smiling more ive read your writingso of course has your father on the evidence of what youve written aboutwell one cant blame your dad for worrying about you if half of what you write about has happened to you you must have had sex with everyone with men and women yeswith everyone no i said smiling back at him im only asking because he wont ask honestly youll meet your father and youll feel youve had interviews that are more indepth than anything hell ask you or even say to you señor bovary warned me it isnt that he doesnt careim not exaggerating when i say hes always worrying about youbut your father is a man who believes your privacy is not to be invaded your dad is a very private man ive only ever seen him be public about one thing and that is i asked im not going to spoil the show we should be going anyway señor bovary said looking at his watch what show i asked him look im not the performeri just manage the money bovary said youre the writer in the family but your father does know how to tell a storyeven if its always the same story i followed him at a fairly fast pace from the plaza mayor to the puerta del sol bovary must have had those special sandals because he was a walker ill bet he walked everywhere in madrid he was a trim fit man hed had very little to eat for dinner and nothing to drink but mineral water it was probably nine or ten oclock at night but there were a lot of people in the streets as we walked up montero we passed some prostitutesworking girls bovary called them i heard one of them say the guapo word she says youre handsome señor bovary translated perhaps she means you i told him he was very handsome i thought she doesnt mean meshe knows me was all bovary said he was all businessmr money manager i was thinking then we crossed the gran vía into chueca by that towering buildingthe telefónica were still a little early señor bovary was saying as he looked again at his watch he seemed to consider then he reconsidered taking a detour theres a bear bar on this street he said pausing at the intersection of hortaleza and the calle de las infantas yes hoti had a beer there last night i told him bears are all right if you like bellies bovary said i have nothing against bearsi just like beer i said its all i drink i just drink agua con gas señor bovary said giving me his small twinkling smile mineral water with bubblesright i asked him i guess we both like bubbles was all bovary said he had continued walking along hortaleza i wasnt paying very close attention to the street but i recognized that nightclub with the portuguese namea noite when señor bovary led me inside i asked oh is this the club mercifully no the little man replied were just killing time if the show were starting here i wouldnt have brought you but the show starts very late here its safe just to have a drink there were some skinny gay boys hanging around the bar if you were alone theyd be all over you bovary told me it was a black marble bar or maybe it was polished granite i had a beer and señor bovary had an agua con gas while we waited there was a bluetinted ballroom and a proscenium stage at a noite they were playing sinatra songs backstage when i quietly used the retro word for the nightclub all bovary said was to be kind he kept checking his watch when we went out on hortaleza again it was almost pm i had never seen as many people on the street when bovary brought me to the club i realized id walked past it and not noticed itat least twice it was a very small club with a long line out fronton hortaleza between the calle de las infantas and san marcos the name of the club i saw only nowfor the first time the club was called señor bovary oh i said as bovary led me around the line to the stage door well see frannys show then youll meet him the little man was saying if im lucky he wont see you with me till the end of his routineor near the end anyway the same types id seen at a noite those skinny gay boys were crowding the bar but they made room for señor bovary and me onstage was a transsexual dancer very passablenothing retro about her shameless catering to straight guys bovary whispered in my ear oh and guys like you i supposeis she your type yes definitely i told him i thought the limegreen strobe pulsing on the dancer was a little tacky it wasnt exactly a strip show the dancer had certainly had her boobs done and she was very proud of them but she never took off the thong the crowd gave her a big hand when she exited the stage passing through the audienceeven passing by the bar still in her thong but carrying the rest of her clothes bovary said something to her in spanish and she smiled i told her you were a very important guest and that she was definitely your type the little man said mischievously to me when i started to say something he put an index finger to his lips and whispered ill be your translator i first thought he was making a jokeabout translating for me if i were later to find myself with the transsexual dancerbut bovary meant that he would translate for my father franny franny franny voices in the crowd kept calling from the instant franny dean came onstage there were ooohs and ahhhs it wasnt just the glitter and dropdead décolletage of the dress but with that plunging neckline and the poised way my father carried it off i could see why grandpa harry had a soft spot for william francis dean the wig was a jetblack mane with silver sparkles it matched the dress the falsies were modestsmall like the rest of himand the pearl necklace wasnt ostentatious yet it picked up the powderblue light onstage that same powderblue light had turned all the white onstage and in the audience a pearlgray coloreven señor bovarys white shirt where we sat at the bar i have a little story to tell you my dad told the crowd in spanish it wont take very long he said with a smile his old thin fingers toyed with his pearls maybe youve heard this before he askedas bovary whispered in english in my ear sí shouted the crowd in chorus sorry my father replied but its the only story i know its the story of my life and the one love in it i already knew the story it was in part what hed told me when i was recovering from scarlet feveronly in more detail than a child could possibly have remembered imagine meeting the love of your life on a toilet franny dean cried we were in a latrine awash with seawater we were on a ship awash with vomit vómito the crowd repeated in a unified cry i was amazed how many of them had heard the story they knew it by heart there were many older people in the audience both men and women there were young people toomostly boys theres no sound quite like the sound of a human derrière passing a succession of toilet seatsthat slapping sound as the love of your life approaches coming nearer and nearer my father said he paused and took a deep breath while many of the young boys in the audience dropped their pants down to their ankles their underpants too and slapped one another on their bare asses my father exhaled onstage and said with a condemning sigh no not like thatit was a different slapping sound more refined in his glittering black dress with the plunging neckline my dad paused againwhile those chastised boys pulled up their pants and the audience settled down imagine reading in a storm at sea how much of a reader would you need to be my father asked ive been a reader all my life i knew that if i ever met the love of my life he would have to be a reader too but ohto first make contact with him that way cheek to cheek so to speak my dad said jutting out one skinny hip and slapping himself on the buttocks cheek to cheek the crowd criedor however you say that in spanish i cant remember hed met bovary on a toilet butt to butt how perfect was that there wasnt much more to the show when my fathers story about the love of his life was finished i noticed that many of the older people in the audience quickly slipped awayas did nearly all the women the women who stayed i realized only lateras i was leavingwere the transsexuals and the transvestites the young boys stayed and by the time i left the club there were many more of themin addition to some older men who were mostly alone no doubt on the prowl señor bovary led me backstage to meet my father dont be disappointed he kept whispering in my ear as if he were still translating and we were still sitting at the bar my father standing in his dressing room was already stripped to the waistwig offby the time bovary and i got backstage william francis dean had a snowwhite crew cut and the starveddown muscular body of a lightweight wrestler or a jockey the little falsies and a bra no bigger than elainesthe one i used to wear when i was sleepingwere on my dads dressingroom table all heaped together with the pearl necklace the dress which unzipped from the back had been undone only as far as my fathers slender waist and hed slipped the top half off his shoulders shall i unzip you the rest of the way franny señor bovary asked the performer my father turned his back to bovary allowing his lover to unzip him franny dean stepped out of the dress revealing only a tight black girdle hed already unfastened his black stockings from the girdlethe stockings were rolled at his narrow ankles when my dad sat at his dressingroom table he pulled the rolleddown stockings off his small feet and threw them at señor bovary all this before he began to remove his makeup starting with the eyeliner hed already removed the fake eyelashes its a good thing i didnt see you whispering to young william at the bar until i was almost done with the boston part of the story my father said peevishly to bovary its a good thing someone invited young william to come see you before youre dead franny señor bovary told him mr bovary exaggerates william my dad told me as you can see for yourself im not dying ill leave you two alone mr bovary told us in a wounded tone dont you dare my dad said to the love of his life i dare not bovary replied with droll resignation he gave me a longsuffering look of the youseewhatiputupwith kind whats the point of having a love of your life if hes not always with you my father asked me i didnt know what to say i was quite at a loss for words be nice franny señor bovary told him heres what women do williamsmalltown girls anyway my father said they find something they love about youeven if theres just one thing they find endearing for example your mother liked to dress me upand i liked it too maybe later frannymaybe say this to young william after youve had a chance to get to know each other mr bovary suggested its too late for young william and me to get to know each other we were denied that opportunity now we already are who we are arent we william my dad asked me once again i didnt know what to say please try to be nicer franny bovary told him heres what women do as i was saying my father continued those things they dont love about youthose things they dont even likewell guess what women do about those things they imagine they can change those thingsthats what women do they imagine they can change you my father said you knew one girl franny una mujer difícil mr bovary started to say now whos not being nice my dad interrupted him ive known some men who tried to change me i told my father i cant compete with everyone youve known williami couldnt possibly claim to have had your experience my dad said i was surprised he was a prig i used to wonder where i came from i told him those things in myself that i didnt understandthose things i was questioning especially you know what i mean how much of me came from my mother there was little that came from her that i could see and how much of me came from you there was a time when i thought about that quite a lot i told him we heard about you beating up some boy my father said say this later franny mr bovary pleaded with him you beat up a kid at schoolrather recently wasnt it my dad asked me bob told me about it the racquet man was quite proud of you for it but i found it upsetting you didnt get violence from meyou didnt get aggression i wonder if all that anger doesnt come from those winthrop women he told me he was a big kid i said he was nineteen a football playera fucking bully but my father and señor bovary looked as though they were ashamed of me i was on the verge of explaining gee to themhow shed been only fourteen a boy becoming a girl and the nineteenyearold thug had hit her in the face bloodying her nosebut i suddenly thought that i didnt owe these disapproving old queens an explanation i didnt give a shit about that football player he called me a fag i told them i guessed that would make them sniffy oh did you hear that my dad asked the love of his life not the fag word can you imagine being called a fag and not beating the shit out of someone my father asked his lover nicertry being nicer franny bovary said but i saw that he was smiling they were a cute couple but prissymade for each other as they say my dad stood up and hooked his thumbs into the tight waistband of his girdle if you gentlemen would be so kind as to give me a little privacy he said this ridiculous undergarment is killing me i went back to the bar with bovary but there would be no hope of further conversation there the skinny gay boys had multiplied in part because there were more older men by themselves at the bar there was an allboys band playing in a pink strobe light and men and boys were dancing together out on the dance floor some of the tgirls were dancing too either with a boy or with one another when my father joined us at the bar he was the picture of masculine conformity in addition to those athleticlooking sandals like bovarys my dad was wearing a tancolored sports jacket with a darkbrown handkerchief in the breast pocket of the jacket the murmur of franny passed through the crowd as we were leaving the club we were walking on hortaleza just past the plaza de chueca when a gang of young men recognized my father even as a man franny must have been famous in that district vómito one of the young men cheerfully greeted him vómito my dad happily said back to him i could see he was pleased that they knew who he was even not as a woman i was struck that well after midnight there were throngs of people in the streets of chueca but bovary told me there was a good chance of a smoking ban making chueca even noisier and more crowded at night all the men will be standing outside the clubs and bars on these narrow streetsall of them drinking and smoking and shouting to be heard señor bovary said think of all the bears my father said wrinkling his nose william has nothing against bears franny bovary gently said i saw that they were holding hands partners in propriety they walked me all the way back to the santo mauro my hotel on the zurbano i think you should admit to your son franny that youre a little proud of him for beating up that bully bovary said to my father in the courtyard of the santo mauro it is appealing to know i have a son who can beat the shit out of somebody my father said i didnt beat the shit out of him it was one movehe just fell awkwardly on a hard surface i tried to explain thats not what the racquet man said my dad told me bob made me believe you wiped the floor with the fucker good old bob i said i offered to call them a taxi i didnt know that they lived in the neighborhood were right around the corner from the santo mauro señor bovary explained this time when he offered me his hand palm down i took his hand and kissed it thank you for making this happen i said to bovary my father stepped forward and gave me a sudden hug he also gave me a quick dry kiss on both my cheekshe was so very european maybe when i come back to spainfor my next spanish translationmaybe i can come see you again or you can come to barcelona i said to my father but somehow this seemed to make my dad uncomfortable maybe was all my father said perhaps nearer that time would be a good time to talk about it mr bovary suggested my manager my dad said smiling at me but pointing to señor bovary and the love of your life bovary cried happily dont you ever forget it franny how could i my father said to us i keep telling the story dont i i sensed that this was goodbye it seemed unlikely that i would see them again as my father had said we already are who we are arent we but the goodbye word felt too final i couldnt say it adiós young william señor bovary said adiós i said to him they were walking awayholding hands of coursewhen i called after my father adiós dad did he call me dadis that what he said my father asked mr bovary he didhe distinctly did bovary told him adiós my son my father said adiós i kept calling to my dad and the love of his life until i could no longer see them at favorite river academy the blackbox theater in the webster center for the performing arts was not the main stage in that relatively new but brainless buildingwell intentioned to be kind but stupidly built times have changed students today dont study shakespeare the way i did nowadays i could not fill the seats for a mainstage performance of any shakespeare play not even romeo and julietnot even with a former boy playing juliet the black box was a better teaching tool for my actors anyway and it was great for smaller audiences the students were much more relaxed in our blackbox productions but we all complained about the mice it may have been a relatively new building butdue to either faulty design or misguided contractingthe crawl space under the webster center was poorly insulated and had not been mouseproofed when it starts to get cold any stupidly built building in vermont will have mice the kids working with me in our blackbox production of romeo and juliet called them stage mice i cant tell you why except that the mice had occasionally been spotted onstage it was cold that november the thanksgiving break was only a week away and we already had snow on the groundit was even cold for that time of year for vermont no wonder the mice had moved indoors id just persuaded richard abbott to move into the river street house with me at eighty richard hardly needed to spend another winter in vermont in a house by himselfhe was on his own now that martha was in the facility i gave richard what had been my bedroom as a child and that bathroom id once shared with grandpa harry richard didnt complain about the ghosts maybe he would have if hed ever encountered nana victorias ghost or aunt murielsor even my mothersbut the only ghost richard ever saw was grandpa harrys naturally harrys ghost showed up a few times in that bathroom hed once shared with methankfully not in that bathtub harry appears to be confused as if hes lost his toothbrush was all richard ever said about grandpa harrys ghost the bathtub harry had blown his brains out in was gone if grandpa harry was actually going to repeat blowing his brains out in a bathroom it would be the master bathroomthe one i now usedand that inviting new bathtub the way harry had repeated himself for amanda but as ive told you i never saw the ghosts in that river street house there was the one morning when i woke up and found my clothesneatly arranged in the order i would put them onat the foot of my bed these were clean clothes my jeans on the bottom of the pile the shirt was perfectly folded with my socks and underwear on top it was precisely the way my mother used to prepare my clothes for me when i was a little boy she must have done this every night after id fallen asleep shed stopped doing this around the time when i became a teenager or shortly before i had completely forgotten how shed once loved me my guess is that her ghost wanted to remind me it happened only that one morning but it was enough to make me remember when i had loved herwithout reservation now after those many years when i had lost her affection and believed i no longer loved her i was able to mourn herthe way we are supposed to mourn our parents when theyre gone when i first moved into the river street house i found uncle bob standing beside a box of books in the downstairs hall aunt muriel had wanted me to have these monuments of world literature bob had struggled to explain but muriels ghost hadnt delivered the booksuncle bob had brought the box hed belatedly discovered that muriel had intended to give me the books but that fatal car crash must have interrupted her plans uncle bob hadnt noticed that the books were for me there was a note inside the box but some years had passed before bob read it these books are by your forebears billy aunt muriel had written in her unmistakably assertive longhand youre the writer in the familyyou should have them im afraid i dont know when she was intending to give them to you billy bob sheepishly said the forebears word is worth noting at first i was flattered by the company of the esteemed writers muriel had selected for me it was a highly literary collection of works there were two plays by garcía lorcablood wedding and the house of bernarda alba i hadnt known that muriel knew i loved lorcahis poems too there were three plays by tennessee williams maybe nils borkman had given these plays to muriel id first thought there was a book of poems by w h auden and poems by walt whitman and lord byron there were those unsurpassed novels by herman melville and e m forsteri mean mobydick and howards end there was swanns way by marcel proust yet i still didnt understand why my aunt muriel had gathered these particular writers together and called them my forebearsnot until i unearthed from the bottom of the box two little books that lay touching each other arthur rimbauds a season in hell and james baldwins giovannis room oh i said to uncle bob my gay forebears aunt muriel must have thoughtmy notsostraight brethren i could only guess i think your aunt meant this in a positive way billy uncle bob said you think so i asked the racquet man we both stood there in the downstairs hall trying to imagine muriel putting these books in a box for me in a positive way i never told gerry about her mothers gift to mefearing that muriel might have left nothing or worse for gerry i didnt ask elaine if she thought muriel had intended these books for me in a positive way elaines opinion of muriel was that my aunt had been born a menacing ghost it was the phone call from elainelate one night in my river street housethat reminded me of esmeralda gone from my life but not from my mind these many years elaine was crying into the phone yet another bad boyfriend had dumped her but this one had made cruel comments about my dear friends vagina id never told elaine my unfortunate notaballroom appraisal of esmeraldas vaginaboy was this ever not the night to tell elaine that story youre always telling me how you love my little breasts billy elaine was saying between sobs but youve never said anything about my vagina i love your vagina i assured her youre not just saying that are you billy no i think your vagina is perfect i told her why elaine asked shed stopped crying i was determined not to make the esmeralda mistake with my dearest friend ah well i began and then paused ill be absolutely honest with you elaine some vaginas feel as big as ballrooms whereas your vagina feels just right its the perfect sizeperfect for me anyway i said as casually as i could not a ballroomis that what youre saying billy how did i end up here again i was thinking not a ballroom in a positive way i cried elaines nearsightedness was a thing of the past shed had that lasik surgeryit was as if she were seeing for the first time before the surgery when shed had sex she always took her glasses offshed never had a really good look at a penis now she could actually see penises she didnt like the looks of some of themof most of them elaine had said shed told me that the next time we were together she wanted to take a good look at my penis i thought it was a little tragic that elaine didnt know another guy well enough to feel comfortable about staring at his penis but what are friends for so my vagina is not a ballroom in a positive way elaine now said on the phone well that sounds okay i cant wait to get a good look at your penis billyi know youll take my staring at your penis in a positive way i cant wait too i told her just remember whos the perfect size for you billy elaine said i love you elaine i told her i love you too billy elaine said thus was my notaballroom faux pas put to restthus that ghost departed thus did my worst memory of esmeralda that terrifying angel take flight it was the third week of november for as long as i live i wont forget this i had my hands full with romeo and juliet i had a terrific cast of kids and as you know a juliet with all the balls a director could ever ask for the stage mice chiefly bothered the few females in that castnamely my lady montague and my lady capulet and my nurse as for my juliet gee didnt shriek when the stage mice were scurrying around gee tried to stomp on the disruptive little rodents gee and my bloodthirsty tybalt had killed some stage mice by stomping on them but my mercutio and my romeo were the experts in my cast at setting the mousetraps i was constantly reminding them that they had to disarm the mousetraps when our romeo and juliet was in performance i didnt want that grisly snapping soundor the occasional death squeal of a stage mouseto interrupt the show my romeo was a coweyed boy of strictly conventional handsomeness but he had exceptionally good diction he could say that act scene line of utmost importance so that the audience could really hear it heres much to do with hate but more with lovethat one it was also important to gee thatas she told memy romeo was not her type but im okay about kissing him shed added fortunately my romeo was okay about kissing geedespite everyone in our school knowing that gee had balls and a penis it would have taken a brave boy at favorite river to have ventured to date gee it hadnt happened gee had always lived in a girls dorm even with balls and a penis gee would never bother the girls and the girls knew it the girls had not once bothered gee either putting gee in a boys dorm might have been asking for trouble gee liked boys but because gee was a boy who was trying to become a girl some of the boys definitely would have bothered her no one had imaginedleast of all methat gee would turn out to be such a pretty young woman no doubt there were boys at favorite river academy who had a serious crush on herstraight boys because gee was completely passable and those gay boys who were turned on by gee because she had balls and a penis richard abbott and i took turns driving gee out to see martha at the facility at ninety mrs hadley was a kind of wise grandmother to gee martha told gee not to date any boys at favorite river save the dating for when you get to college mrs hadley had advised her thats what im doingim waiting on the dating gee montgomery had told me all the guys at favorite river are too immature for me anyway she said there was one boy who seemed very mature to meat least physically he was like gee a senior but he was also a wrestler which was why i had cast him as the fierytempered tybalta kinsman to the capulets and the hothead who is most responsible for what happens in the play oh i know it is the longstanding discord between the montagues and the capulets that brings about the deaths of romeo and juliet but tybalt is the catalyst i hope herm hoyt and miss frost would have forgiven me for casting a wrestler as my catalyst my tybalt was the most maturelooking boy at favorite rivera fouryear varsity wrestler from germany manfred was a lightheavyweight his english was correct and very carefully enunciated but hed retained a slight accent id told manfred to let us hear the accent in romeo and juliet how wicked of meto have my tybalt be a wrestler with a german accent but to tell you the truth i was a little worried about how big a crush manfred might have had on gee and i know gee liked him if there was a boy at favorite river who was conceivably courageous enough to date gee montgomerythat is even to ask her for a datethat boy who very much looked like a man was my hotblooded tybalt by that wednesday we were offscript in romeo and julietwe were in the finetuning phase our rehearsal was later in the evening than usual we had an pm startdue to manfred being at a preseason wrestling match somewhere in massachusetts id gone to the theater close to our usual rehearsal time about or on that wednesday andas i expectedmost of my cast would show up early as well come we would all be waiting for manfredmy most combative tybalt i was having a political conversation with my benvolio one of my gay boys he was very active in the campus lgbtq group and we were talking about the election of the new governor of vermont a democratour gayrights governor my benvolio was in the midst of saying suddenly he interrupted himself and said i forgot to tell you mr a theres a guy looking for you he was in the dining hall asking about you id actually been in the dining hall for a quick bite to eat earlier that same evening and someone else had told me there was a guy asking where he might find me a young woman in the english department had told mea kind of amandatype but not amanda had moved on to my relief how old a guy id asked this young faculty person what did he look like my age or only a little oldergoodlooking shed told me i was guessing that this young english teacher was in her early thirtiesmaybe midthirties how old a man would you guess i asked my young benvolio what did he look like late thirties maybe my benvolio answered very handsomehot if you ask me the gay boy said smiling he was an excellent benvolio to my coweyed romeo i was thinking my cast was showing up in the black boxsome arriving alone some in twos or threes if manfred got back from his wrestling match ahead of schedule we could start our rehearsal most of the kids still had homework to dothey would have a late night here came my clergymen my friar lawrence and my friar john and my officioussounding apothecary here came my chatterboxestwo junior girls my lady montague and my lady capulet and there was my mercutioonly a sophomore but a longlegged and talented one he had the requisite charm and derringdo for the likable but doomed mercutio straggling into the black box not quite last were various attendants maskers torchbearers my boy with a drum a tiny freshman who could have played a dwarf several servingmen including tybalts page sundry gentlemen and gentlewomenand my paris my prince escalus and the others my nurse came at the end shoving my balthasar and my petruchio ahead of her juliets nurse was a stalwart girla fieldhockey player and one of the most outspoken lesbians in the lgbtq group my nurse did not countenance most male behaviorincluding gay and bi male behavior i was very fond of her if there were ever any troublea food fight in the dining hall or a disaffected student with a weaponi knew i could count on juliets nurse to watch my back she had a grudging respect for gee but i knew they werent friends and where was gee i began to wonder my juliet was usually the first to arrive at the theater theres a guy looking for you mr asome creep who thinks very highly of himself juliets nurse told me i think hes hitting on gee or maybe hes just walking with her and talking to her theyre on their way here anyway my nurse said but i did not at first see the stranger when i spotted gee she was alone id been discussing mercutios death scene with my longlegged mercutio i was agreeing with him that there is as my talented sophomore put it some black humor involved when mercutio first describes the seriousness of his stab wound to romeotis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church door but tis enough twill serve ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man yet i cautioned my mercutio not to make it the least bit funny when he curses the capulets and the montagues a plague o both your houses sorry im a little late mr ai got delayed gee said she looked flushed even redcheeked but it was cold outside there was no one with her i heard some guy was bothering you i told her he wasnt bothering mehes got a thing about you my juliet told me he looked like he was hitting on you my sturdy nurse said to her no ones hitting on me till i get to college gee told her did the man say what he wanted i asked gee she shook her head i think its personal mr athe guy is upset about something gee said we were all standing in the stage area which was brightly lit my stage manager had already dimmed the houselights in our black box we can position the audience where we want them we can move the seats around sometimes the audience completely encircles the stage or sits facing one another with the stage between them for romeo and juliet i had all the seats form a shallow horseshoe around the stage with the houselights dimmed but not dark i could watch the rehearsals from any seat in the audience and still see well enough to read my notesor write new notes it was my gay benvolio who whispered in my ear while all of us were still waiting for manfred my troublemaking tybalt to get back to campus from his wrestling match mr ai see him my benvolio whispered that guy whos looking for youhes in the audience with the houselights dimmed i could not make out the mans face he was sitting in the middle of the horseshoeshaped seats about four or five rows backjust out of reach of the spotlights illuminating our stage should we call security mr a gee asked me no noill just see what he wants i told her if i appear to be stuck in an unwelcome conversation just come interrupt uspretend you have to ask me something about the play make up anything that comes to mind i said you want me to come with you my bold nurse the fieldhockey player asked me no no i told the fearless girl who was spoiling for a fight just be sure i know when manfred gets here we were at that point in our rehearsals where i like to have the kids run their lines consecutively i didnt want to be rehearsing either piecemeal or out of sequence my everready tybalt is an inciting presence in act scene enter tybalt drawing his sword as the stage directions say the only rehearsing i wanted to do without manfred was that small set piece the chorus says the prologue to the play listen up chorus i said run through the prologue a couple of times take note that the most important line ends not with a comma but a semicolon pay attention to that semicolon a pair of starcrossed lovers take their life please pause after the semicolon were here if you need us mr a i heard gee sayas i went up an aisle to the fourth or fifth row of seats into the dimly lit audience hey teacher i heard the man say maybe a split second before i could clearly see him he might as well have said hey nymphthats how familiar his voice was to me almost fifty years after id last heard it his handsome face his wrestlers build his slyly confident smilethey were all familiar to me but youre supposed to be dead i was thinkingthe of natural causes was the only doubtful part yet this kittredge of course couldnt have been my kittredge this kittredge was only slightly more than half my age if hed been born in the early seventies when id imagined kittredges son had been born he would have been in his late thirtiesthirtyseven or thirtyeight i would have guessed upon meeting kittredges only child its truly striking how much you look like your father i said to young kittredge holding out my hand he declined to shake it well of course i mean if i had seen your father at your ageyou look as i imagine he must have looked in his late thirties my father didnt look at all like me when he was my age the young man said he was already in his early thirties when i was born by the time i was old enough to remember what he looked like he already looked like a woman he hadnt had the surgical reassignment yet but he was very passable as a woman i didnt have a father i had two mothersone of them was hysterical most of the time and the other one had a penis after the surgery as i understand it he had some kind of vagina he died of aidsim surprised you havent ive read all your novels young kittredge added as if everything in my writing had indicated to him that i easily could have died of aidsor that i should have im sorry was all i could say to him as gee had said he was upset as i could see for myself he was angry i tried to make small talk i asked him what his dad had done for a living and how kittredge had met irmgard the wifethis angry young mans mother theyd met skiingdavos or maybe klosters kittredges wife was swiss but shed had a german grandmother thats where the irmgard came from kittredge and irmgard had homes in the ski town and in zurich where theyd both worked at the schauspielhaus it was quite a famous theater i imagined that kittredge had liked living in europe no doubt he was used to europe because of his mother and maybe a sexchange surgery was more easily arranged in europei had no idea really mrs kittredgethe mom i mean not the wifehad killed herself soon after kittredges death there was no doubt shed been his real mother pills was all the grandson would say about it he clearly wasnt interested in talking to me about anything except the fact that his father became a woman i began to get the feeling that young kittredge believed i had something to do with what he saw as a despicable alteration how was his german i asked kittredges son but that was of no concern to the angry young man his german was passablenot as passable as he was as a woman he didnt make any effort to improve his german kittredges son told me my father never worked as hard at anything as he worked at becoming a woman oh when he was dying he told me that something happened herewhen you knew him kittredges son said to me something started here he admired youhe said you had balls you did something inspiring or so he told me there was a transsexual involvedsomeone older i think maybe you both knew her maybe my father admired her toomaybe she inspired him i saw a photo of your father when he was youngerbefore he came here i told young kittredge he was dressed and made up as a very pretty girl i think something started as you say before he met meand all the rest of it i could show you that photo if you ive seen those photographsi dont need to see another one kittredges son said angrily what about the transsexual how did you two inspire my father im surprised to hear he admired mei cant imagine that i did anything he would have found inspiring i never thought he even liked me in fact your father was always rather cruel to me i told kittredges son what about the transsexual young kittredge asked me again i knew the transsexualyour father met her only once i was in love with the transsexual what happened with the transsexual happened to me i cried i dont know what happened to your father something happened herethats all i know the son said bitterly my father read all your books obsessively what was he looking for in your novels ive read themi never found my father there not that i would necessarily have recognized him in your pages i thought of my father then and i saidas gently as i could manageto kittredges angry son we already are who we are arent we i cant make your father comprehensible to you but surely you can have some sympathy for him cant you id never imagined myself asking anyone to have sympathy for kittredge i had once believed that if kittredge was gay he sure looked like a top to me now i wasnt so sure when kittredge had met miss frost id seen him change from dominant to submissivein about ten seconds just then gee was there in the row of seats beside us my cast for romeo and juliet had surely heard the raised voices they must have been worried about me no doubt they could hear how angry young kittredge was to me he seemed just a callow disappointing reflection of his father hi gee i said is manfred here are we ready nowe still dont have our tybalt gee told me but i have a question its about act one scene fiveits the very first thing i say when the nurse tells me romeo is a montague you know when i learn im in love with the son of my enemyits that couplet what about it i asked her she was stalling for us both i could see we wanted manfred to arrive where was my easily outraged tybalt when i needed him i dont think i should sound sorry for myself gee continued i dont think of juliet as selfpitying no shes not i said juliet may sound fatalisticat timesbut she shouldnt sound selfpitying okaylet me say it gee said i think ive got itim just saying it as it is but im not complaining about it this is my juliet i told young kittredge my best girl gee okay i said to gee lets hear it my only love sprung from my only hate too early seen unknown and known too late my juliet said that couldnt be better gee i told her but young kittredge was just staring at her i couldnt tell if he admired her or suspected her what kind of name is gee kittredges son asked her i could see that my best girls confidence was a little shaken here was a handsome rather worldlylooking mansomeone not from our favorite river community where gee had earned our respect and had developed much confidence in herself as a woman i could see that gee was doubting herself i knew what she was thinkingin young kittredges presence and under his intimidating scrutiny do i look passable gee was wondering gee is just a madeup name the young girl evasively told him whats your real name kittredges son asked her i was george montgomery at birth im going to be georgia montgomery later gee told him right now im just gee im a boy whos becoming a girlim in transition my juliet said to young kittredge that couldnt be better gee i told her again i think you said that perfectly one glance at kittredges son told me hed had no idea that gee was a workinprogress he hadnt known she was a transgender kid on her brave way to becoming a woman one glance at gee told me that she knew shed been passable i think that gave my juliet a ton of confidence i realize now that if kittredges son had said anything disrespectful to gee i would have tried to kill him at that moment manfred arrived the wrestler is here someone shoutedmy mercutio maybe or it might have been my gay benvolio we have our tybalt my strong nurse called to gee and me ah at last i said were ready gee was running toward the stageas if her next life depended on starting this delayed rehearsal good luckbreak a leg young kittredge called after her just like his fatheryou couldnt read his tone of voice was he being sincere or sarcastic i could see that my most assertive nurse had pulled manfred aside no doubt she was filling the hottempered tybalt inshe wanted the wrestler to know there was a potential problem a creep as shed called young kittredge in the audience i was ushering kittredges son to an aisle between the horseshoeshaped seats just accompanying the young man to the nearest exit when manfred presented himself in the aisleas ready for a fight as tybalt ever was when manfred wanted to speak privately to me he always spoke in german he knew id lived in vienna and could still speak a little german albeit badly manfred politely asked if there was anything he could do to help mein german fucking wrestlers i saw that my tybalt had lost half his mustache theyd had to shave one side of his lip before they gave him the stitches manfred would have to shave the other half of his lip before we were in performance i dont know about you but ive never seen a tybalt with only half a mustache your german is pretty good young kittredge sounding surprised said to manfred it ought to beim german manfred told him aggressively in english this is my tybalt hes also a wrestler like your father i said to kittredges son they shook hands a little tentatively ill be right there manfredyou can wait onstage for me nice lip i told him as he was going down the aisle to the stage young kittredge reluctantly shook my hand at the exit door he was still agitated hed had more to say butin at least one wayhe was not like his father whatever one thinks of kittredge i can tell you this he was a cruel fucker but he was a fighter the son whether he had wrestled or not needed just one look at manfred kittredges son was no fighter look here it isi just have to say this young kittredge said he almost couldnt look at me i dont know you i admiti dont have a clue who my father really was either but ive read all your books and i know what you doi mean in your writing you make all these sexual extremes seem normalthats what you do like gee that girl or whatever she isor what shes becoming you create these characters who are so sexually different as you might call themor fucked up which is what i would call themand then you expect us to sympathize with them or feel sorry for them or something yes thats more or less what i do i told him but so much of what you describe is not natural kittredges son cried i mean i know what you arenot only from your writing ive read what you say about yourself in interviews what you are isnt naturalyou arent normal hed held his voice down when he was talking about geeill give him credit for thatbut now kittredges son had raised his voice again i knew that my stage managernot to mention the entire cast for romeo and julietcould hear every word it was suddenly so quiet in our little blackbox theater i swear you could have heard a stage mouse fart youre bisexual arent you kittredges son then asked me do you think thats normal or naturalor sympathetic youre a switchhitter he said opening the exit door thank goodness everyone could see he was finally leaving my dear boy i said sharply to young kittredge in what has become my lifelong imitation of the way miss frost so pointedly and thrillingly spoke to me my dear boy please dont put a label on medont make me a category before you get to know me miss frost had said to me ive never forgotten it is it any wonder that this was what i said to young kittredge the cocksure son of my old
