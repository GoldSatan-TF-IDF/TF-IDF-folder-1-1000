restoration of faith by jim butcher i struggled to hold onto the yowling child while fumbling a quarter into the pay phone and jamming down the buttons to dial nicks mobile ragged angel investigations nick answered his voice was tense i thought anxious its harry i said you can relax man i found her you did nick asked he let out a long exhalation oh jesus harry the kid lifted up one of her oxford shoes and mulekicked her leg back at my shin she connected hard enough to make me jump she looked like a parents dream at eight or nine years old with her dimples and dark pigtailseven in her streetstained schoolgirls uniform and she had strong legs i got a better hold on the girl and lifted her up off the ground again while she twisted and wriggled ow hold still let me go beanpole she responded turning to glower back at me before starting to kick again listen to me harry nick said youve got to let the kid go right this minute and walk away what i said nick the astors are going to give us twentyfive grand to return her before nine pm i got some bad news harry they arent going to pay us the money i winced ouch maybe i should just drop her off at the nearest precinct house then the news gets worse the parents reported the girl kidnaped and the police band is sending two descriptions around town to chicago pd and they match guess who mickey and donald heh nick said i heard him flick his bic and take a drag we should be so lucky i guess its more embarrassing for mister and missus highandmighty to have their kid run away than it is to have her kidnaped hell kidnaped girl give them something to talk about at their parties for months make them look richer and more famous than their friends too of course well be in jail but what the hell they came to us i protested that wont be the way they tell it dammit i said if you get caught with her it could be trouble for both of us the astors got connections ditch the girl and get back home you were there all night no nick i said i cant do that let the boys in blue bring her in thatll clear you and me both im up on north avenue and its after dark im not leaving a nineyearold girl out here by herself ten shouted the girl furious im ten you insensitive jerk she kicked some more and i kept myself more or less out of the way of her feet she sounds so cute just let her run harry and let the criminal types beware nick aw hell harry youre getting moral on me again i smiled but it felt tight on my mouth and my stomach churned with anger look well think of something just get down here and pick us up what happened to your car broke down this afternoon again what about the el im broke nick i need a ride i cant walk back to the office with her and i dont want to stand here in a public booth fighting her either so get down here and get us i dont want to spend time in jail because you cant salve your conscience harry what about your conscience i shot back nick was all bluster when it came down to the wire he couldnt have left the girl alone in that part of town either nick growled out something that sounded vaguely obscene then said fine whatever but i cant get across the river very easy so ill be on the far side of the bridge all you have to do is cross the bridge with her and stay out of sight police patrols in the area will be looking for you half an hour if youre not there im not waiting bad neighborhood have faith man ill be there we hung up without saying goodbye all right kid i said stop kicking me and lets talk to hell with you mister she shouted let me go before i break your leg i winced at the shrill note her voice hit and stepped away from the phone halfdragging and half carrying her with me looking around nervously the last thing i needed was a bunch of good citizens running to the kids aid the streets were empty gathering dark rushing in quickly to fill the spaces left by the broken streetlights there were lights in the windows but no one came out in response to the girls shouting it was the sort of neighborhood where people looked the other way and let live ah chicago you just gotta love big sprawling american cities aint modern living grand i could have been a real sicko rather than just looking like one and no one would have done anything it made me feel a little sick look i know youre angry right now but believe me im doing whats best for you she stopped kicking and glared up at me how should you know whats best for me im older than you wiser then why are you wearing that coat i looked down at my big black duster with its heavy mantle and long canvas folds flapping around my rather spare frame whats wrong with it it belongs on the set of el dorado she snapped who are you supposed to be ichabod crane or the marlboro man i snorted im a wizard she gave me a look of skepticism you can really only get from children who have recently gone through the sobering trauma of discovering that there is no santa claus ironically there isbut he cant operate on the sort of scale that used to make everyone believe in him more modern living youve got to be kidding me she said i found you didnt i she frowned at me how did you find me i thought that spot was perfect i continued walking towards the bridge it would have been for another ten minutes or so then that dumpster would have been full of rats looking for something to eat the girls expression turned faintly green rats i nodded with luck maybe i could win the kid over good thing your mother had your brush in her purse i was able to get a couple of hairs from it so i sighed so i used a little thaumaturgy and it led me straight to you i had to walk most of the way but straight to you thaumawhat questions were better than kicks any day i kept answering them heck i like to answer questions about magic professional pride maybe thaumaturgy its ritual magic you draw symbolic links between actual persons places or events and representative models then you invest a little energy to make something happen on the small scale and something happens on the large scale as well the kid bent her head the second i was distracted with answering her question and bit my hand i yelled something i probably shouldnt have around a kid and jerked my hand away the kid dropped to the ground agile as a monkey and took off towards the bridge i shook my hand growled at myself and took off after her she was fast her pigtails flying out behind her shoes and stained kneesocks flashing she got to the bridge first an ancient twolane affair that arched over the chicago river and hurled herself out onto it wait i shouted after her dont she didnt know this town like i did sucker she called back her voice merry she kept on running that is until a great rubbery hairy arm slithered out from beneath a manhole cover at the apex of the bridge and wrapped its greasy fingers around one of her ankles the kid screamed in sudden terror pitching forward onto the asphalt and raking the skin from both knees blood shone dark on her socks in the glow of the few functioning streetlights i cursed beneath my breath and raced towards her along the bridge lungs laboring the hand tightened its grip and started dragging her back and towards the manhole i could hear deep growling laughter coming from the darkness in the hole that led down to the understructure of the bridge she screamed what is it what is it make it let go kid i shouted i ran towards the manhole jumped and came down as hard as i could on the hairy arm right at the wrist the heels of both hiking boots thumping down onto the grimy flesh a bellow erupted from the manhole and the fingers loosened the girl twisted her leg and though it cost her one of her expensive oxfords and one knee sock she dragged herself free of its grasp sobbing i gathered her up and backpedaled away turning so that i wasnt leaving my back to the manhole the troll shouldnt have been able to squeeze its way out of a hole that small but it did first came that grimy arm followed by a lumpy shoulder and then its malformed head and hideous face it looked at me and growled jerking its way out of the hole with a rubbery ease until it stood in the middle of the bridge between me and the far side of the river like some professional wrestler who had fallen victim to a correspondence course for plastic surgeons in one hand he held a meat cleaver approximately two feet long with a bone handle and suspiciouslooking stains of dark brown on it harry dresden the troll rumbled wizard deprive gogoth of his lawful prey he whipped the cleaver left and right it made a little whistling sound i lifted my chin and set my jaw its never smart to let a troll see that youre afraid of him what are you talking about gogoth you know as well as i do that mortals arent all fair game any more the unseelie accords settled that the trolls face split into a truly disgusting leer naughty children he rumbled naughty children still mine he narrowed his eyes and they started burning with malicious hunger give now the troll rolled towards me a few paces gathering momentum i lifted my right hand forced out a little will and the silver ring upon my third finger abruptly shone with a clear cool light brighter than the illumination around us law of the jungle gogoth i said keeping my voice calm survival of the fittest you take another step and youre going to land smack in the too stupid to live category the troll growled not slowing and raised one meaty fist think about it darkspawn i snarled the light pouring from my ring took on a hellish almost nuclear tone one more step and youre vapor the troll came to a lumbering halt and its rubberslime lips drew back from fetid fangs no he snarled drool slithered down his fangs and spattered on the asphalt as it stared at the girl she is mine wizard cannot interfere in this oh yeah i said watch me and with that i lowered my hand and with it the fierce silver light gave the troll my best sneer and turned in a flare of my dark duster to walk back to north avenue with long confident strides the girl stared over my shoulder her eyes wide is he coming after us i asked quietly she blinked back at the troll and then at me uh no hes just staring at you okay if he starts this way let me know so you can vapor him she asked her voice unsteady hell no so we can run but what about she touched the ring on my hand i lied kid what i lied i repeated im not a good liar but trolls arent too bright it was just a light show but he fell for it and thats all that counts i thought you said you were a wizard she accused me i am i replied annoyed a wizard who was at a seanceslashexorcism before breakfast then i had to find two wedding rings and a set of car keys and then i spent the rest of my day running after you im pooped you couldnt blow that that thing up its a troll sure i could i said cheerfully if i wasnt so worn out and if i was able to focus enough to keep from blowing myself up along with him my aims bad when im this tired we reached the edge of the bridge and i hoped gogoths territory i started to swing the girl down she was too big to be carrying then i saw her one bare foot dangling and the blood forming into dark scabs on her knees i sighed and started walking along north avenue if i could go down the long city block to the next bridge cross it and make back down the other block within half an hour i could still meet nick on the other side hows your leg i asked she shrugged though her face was pained okay i guess was that thing for real you bet i said but it was it wasnt human i said no but hell kid a lot of people i know arent really human look around us bundy manson those other animals right here in chicago youve got the vargassis working out of little italy the jamaican posses others animals worlds full of them the girl sniffed i glanced at her face she looked sad and too wise for her years my heart softened i know she said my parents are like that a little they dont think about anyone else really just themselves not even each otherexcept what they can do for one another and im just some toy that should get stuck in the closet and dragged out when people come over so i can be prettier and more perfect than their toys the rest of the time im in their way hey come on i said its not that bad is it she glanced at me and then away im not going back to them she said i dont care who you are or what you can do you cant make me go back to them theres where youre wrong i said im not going to leave you down here i heard you talking to your friend she said my parents are trying to screw you over why are you still doing this i have another six months to work for a licensed investigator before i can get a license of my own and i got this stupid thing about leaving kids in the middle of big mean cities after dark at least down here no one tries to lie and tell me that they care mister i see all these disney shows about how much parents love their kids how theres some sort of magical bond of love but its a lie like you and that troll she laid her head against my shoulder and i could feel the exhaustion in her body as she sagged against me theres no magic i fell silent for several paces just carrying her it was hard to hear that from a kid a ten year old girls world should be full of music and giggling and notes and dolls and dreams not harsh barren jaded reality if there was no light in the heart of a child a little girl like this then what hope do any of us have a few paces later i realized something that i hadnt been admitting to myself a quiet cool little voice had been trying to tell me something that i hadnt been willing to listen to i was in the business of wizardry to try to help people to try to make things better but no matter how many evil spirits i confronted no matter how many wouldbe black magicians i tracked down there was always something else worse waiting for me in the dark no matter how many lost children i found there would always be ten times as many who disappeared for good no matter how much i did how much trash i cleaned up it was only a drop in the ocean heavy thoughts for a guy like me tired and beaten my arms heavy with the girls weight flashing lights made me look up the mouth to one of the alleys between the buildings had been sealed off with police tape and four cars blue bulbs awhirl were parked on the street around the alley a couple of emts were toting a covered shape out of the alley on a stretcher the flashing strobes of cameras lit the alleyway in bursts of white i came to a stop hesitant what the girl murmured police maybe i should hand you over i felt her weary shrug theyre only going to take me home i dont care she sagged against me again i swallowed the astors were chicagos elite crowd they carried enough clout around the old town to get a bum wouldbe private investigator put away for a good long time and they could afford the best of lawyers its a lousy world dresden the cool little voice told me and the good guys dont win unless they have an expensive attorney too youd be in jail before you could blink my mouth twisted into a bitter smile as one of the uniform cops a woman noticed me and cast a long frown in my direction i turned around and started walking the other way hey the cop said i kept walking hey she said again and i heard brisk footsteps on the sidewalk i hurried along into the dark and stepped into the first alley the shadows behind a pile of crates created an ideal refuge and i carried the girl into it with me i crouched there in the darkness and waited while the cops footsteps came near and then passed on by i waited in the dark and felt all the heaviness and darkness settle into my skin into my flesh the girl just shivered and lay against me unmoving just leave me she said finally go over the bridge it will let you cross the bridge if im not with you yes i said so go on ill walk up to the police after youre gone or something she was lying im not sure how i could tell but i could she would go to the bridge im told that bravery is doing what you need to do even when youre afraid but sometimes i wonder if courage isnt a lot more complicated than that sometimes i think courage is pulling yourself up off the ground one more time doing one more set of paperwork even when you dont want to maybe thats just plain stubbornness i dont know it didnt matter not to me im a wizard i dont really belong here our world sucks it might suit the trolls and the vampires and all those nasty leering things that haunt our nightmares while we clutch our physics books to our chests and reassure ourselves that they cannot exist but im not a part of it i wont be a part of it i took a breath in the dark and asked whats your name she was silent for a moment and then said in a very uncertain voice faith faith i said i smiled so that she could hear it my names harry dresden hi she said her voice a whisper hi have you ever seen something like this i cupped my hand summoned some of the last dregs of my power and cast a warm glowing light into the ring on my right hand it lit faiths face and i could see on her smooth cheeks the streaks of the tears i had not heard she shook her head here i said and took the ring from my finger then slipped it onto hers over her right thumb where it hung a bit loose the light died away as i did it leaving us in the dark again let me show you something battery went out she mumbled i dont have money for another one faith do you remember the very best day of your life she was quiet for a minute then she said her voice a bare whisper yes a christmas when gremma was still alive gremma was nice to me tell me about it i urged quietly and covered her hand with my own i felt her shrug gremma came over christmas eve we played games she would play with me and we stayed up on the floor by the christmas tree waiting for santa claus she let me open just one present for christmas eve it was one shed gotten me faith took a shuddering breath it was a dolly a real babydolly mother and father had gotten me barbie stuff the whole line for that year they said that if i left them all in the original boxes that they would be worth a lot of money later but gremma listened to what i really wanted then i heard it the tiny smile in her voice gremma cared about me i moved my hand and a soft pinkish light flowed up out of the ring around her thumb a loving gentle warmth i heard faith draw in a little gasp of surprise and then a delighted smile spread over her mouth but how she whispered i gave her a smile magic i said the best kind a little light in the dark she looked up at me studying my face my eyes i shied away from the perception of that gaze i need to go back dont i she asked i brushed a stray bit of hair from her forehead there are people who love you faith or who one day will even if you cant see them beside you right here right now theyre out there but if you let the dark get into your eyes you might never find them so its best to keep a little light with you along the way do you think you can remember that she nodded up at me her face lit by the light from the ring whenever it gets too dark think of the good things you have the good times youve had it will help i promise she leaned against me and gave me a simple trusting hug i felt my cheeks warm up as she did aw shucks we need to go i told her weve got to get across the bridge and meet my friend nick she chewed on her lip her expression immediately worried but the troll i winked leave him to me the girl didnt feel anywhere near so heavy as i carried her back i studied the bridge as we approached maybe if i was lucky id be able to sprint across without the troll being able to stop me yeah and maybe one day id go to an art museum and become wellrounded bridges are a trolls specialty whether because of some magic or just because of aptitude you never get across the bridge without facing the troll thats life i guess i set the girl down on the ground next to me and stepped out onto the bridge all right faith i said whatever happens you run across that bridge my friend nick is going to pull up on the far side any minute now what about you i gave her a casual roll of my neck im a wizard i said i can handle him faith gave me another look of supreme skepticism and fumbled to hold my hand her fingers felt very small and very warm inside of mine and a fierce surge of determination coursed through me no matter what happened i would let no harm come to this child we walked out onto the bridge the few lights that had been burning brightly earlier were gone gogoths work doubtless night reigned over the bridge and the chicago river gurgled by smooth and cold and black below us im scared faith whispered hes just a big bully i told her face him down and hell back off which i hoped very much was true we kept walking and skirted wide around the manhole at the apex of the bridge me keeping my body between faith and the entrance to the trolls lair gogoth must have been counting on that i heard faith scream again and whirled my head to see the trolls thick hairy arm stretched up over the edge of the bridge while the troll clung to its side like some huge and overweight spider i snarled and stomped his fingers once more and the troll bellowed in rage faith slipped free and i halfhurled her towards the far side of the bridge run faith the trolls arm swept my legs out from beneath me and it came surging up over the railing at the side of the bridge too supple and swift for its bulk its burning eyes focused on the fleeing faith and more of its slimy drool spattered out of its mouth it scythed its cleaver through the air and crouched to leap after the child i got my feet under me screamed and threw myself at the trolls leg swinging my long legs around to tangle with the creatures it roared in fury and went down in a tumble with me i heard myself cackling and decided without a doubt that i had at least one screw loose the troll caught me by the corner of my jacket and threw me against the railing hard enough to make me see stars wizard gogoth snarled spitting drool and foam the cleaver swept the air again and the troll stalked towards me now you die and gogoth chew you bones i gathered myself to my feet but it was too late there was no way i could run or throw myself over the railing in time faith screamed harry and a brilliant flash of pink light flooded the bridge and made the troll whip its ugly head towards the far side of the river i ducked to my left and ran towards faith and away from the troll i looked up and saw nicks car roaring towards the bridge at enough speed to tell me that my partner had seen that something was going on the troll followed me and though i had gained a few paces on it i had the sinking realization that the beast was lighter on its feet than i was there was a whistling sound of the cleaver cutting air and i felt something skim past my scalp i bobbed to my right ducking and the second swipe missed by an even narrower margin i stumbled and fell and the troll was on top of me in a heartbeat i rolled in time to see it lift its bloodstained cleaver high above it to feel its drool splatter onto my chest wizard the troll bellowed there was a yell and then the cop the one who had followed us before hurled herself onto the trolls back and locked her nightstick across his throat she gave the stick a practiced twist and the trolls eyes bulged the huge cleaver clanged as it tumbled from gogoths grip and hit the pavement the cop leaned back making the trolls spine arch into a bow but this wasnt a man she was dealing with the thing twisted his head squirmed and popped out of her grip then opened his jaws in frenzied roar that literally blew the patrolmans cap off of her head and sent her stumbling back with a wideeyed stare the troll maddened slammed one fist into the pavement cracking it and drew the other back to drive towards her skull hey ugly i shouted the troll turned in time to see me grunt and swing the massive cleaver at its side the rotten grimy flesh just beneath its ribs split open with a howl of sound and a burst of motion gogoth leaned his head back and let out a highpitched wailing yowl i backed off knowing what came next the poor cop stared in whitefaced horror as the trolls wound split and dozens hundreds thousands of tiny wriggling figures poured out of the split in its flesh squalling and squealing the massive thews of the beast deflated like old basketballs slowly sinking in upon themselves as the bridge became littered with a myriad of tiny trolls their ugly little heads no bigger than a president on a coin they poured out of gogoth in a flood spilling onto the bridge in a writhing wriggling horde the trolls cheeks sunk and its eyes vanished its mouth opened in a slackjawed yawn and as the leathery grimy sack of tiny trolls emptied it sank to the ground until it lay there like a discarded disgusting raincoat the cop stared mouth wide attempting to form words of a prayer or a curse nicks headlights whirled and spilled across the bridge and with twice ten thousand screams of protest the tiny trolls dispersed before the light in all directions a few seconds later there were only myself faith the cop and nick approaching us across the bridge faith threw herself at me and gave me a quick hug around the waist her eyes were bright with excitement that was the most disgusting thing i have ever seen i want to be a wizard when i grow up that was was the cop said stunned she was short stocky and the loss of her cap revealed tightly braided pale hair i winked down at faith and nodded to the cop a troll i know i walked over to the cap and dusted it off a few trolls squealing protest fell to the street and scampered away the cop watched with stunned eyes hey thanks a lot for the help officer i squinted down at her badge murphy i smiled and offered her the hat she took it with numb fingers oh jesus i really have lost it she blinked a few times and then scowled up at my face you youre the perp on the astor kidnaping i opened my mouth to defend myself but i neednt have bothered are you kidding faith astor sneered this buffoon kidnap me he couldnt bum a cigarette off the marlboro man she turned towards me and gave me a wink then offered both her wrists out to murphy i admit it officer i ran away take me to the pokey and throw away the key murphy to her credit seemed to be handling things fairly well for someone who had just confronted the monster under the bed she recovered her nightstick and went to faith examining her for injuries before directing a suspicious gaze at nick and me hoo boy nick said planting his stocky bulk squarely beside mine here it comes you get the top bunk stilts but im not going to pick up your soap in the shower the cop looked at me and nick then at the girl then more thoughtfully at the leathery lump that had been gogoth the troll her eyes flashed back to nick and me and she said arent you two the ones who run ragged angel the agency that looks for lost kids i run it nick said his voice resigned he works for me yeah what he said i threw in just to let nick know that he wasnt going to the big house alone murphy nodded and eyed the girl are you all right honey faith sniffed and smiled up at murphy a little hungry and i could use something to clean up these scrapes but other than that im quite well and these two didnt kidnap you faith snorted please murphy nodded and then jabbed her nightstick at nick and me i got to call this in you two vanish before my partner gets here she glanced down at faith and winked faith grinned up at her in return murphy took the girl back towards the far side of the bridge and the other police units nick and i ambled back towards his car nicks broad honest face was set in an expression of nervous glee i cant believe it he said i cant believe that happened was that the troll whatshisname that was gogoth i said cheerfully nothing bigger than a bread crumb is going to be bothered by trolls on this bridge for a long long time i cant believe it nick said again i thought we were so dead i cant believe it i glanced back over the bridge on the far side the girl was standing up on her tiptoes waving soft pink light flowed from the ring on her right thumb i could see the smile on her face the cop was watching me too her expression thoughtful it turned into a smile modern living might suck and the world weve made can be a dark place but at least i dont have to be there alone i put an arm around nicks shoulders and grinned at him its like i keep telling you man youve got to have faith
