fear jeff abbott canst thou not minister to a mind diseasd pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuffd bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart william shakespeare macbeth tell me if you can what is courage plato one i killed my best friend miles stared at the words black in their clean lines against the white of the paper first time to write the truth he put the pen back to the pad i didnt want to kill him didnt mean to kill him but i did baring your soul fixes nothing andy sat against the edge of the kitchen table watching him write shell just hate you miles said no she wont andy lit a cigarette exhaled a blue cloud over the confession as miles wrote youve lied to allison for weeks lies a bit strong not as strong as murder telling her what you did isnt going to make you better he watched the smoke dance from the cigarettes tip shut up miles finished writing out his confession andy wandered to the kitchen rummaged in the refrigerator found an earlymorning beer priests say confession is good for the soul but this is an exceptionally bad idea even for your soul we had a deal miles this doesnt affect you miles signed his name his real name miles kendrick at the bottom of the page allison had never seen his true name you tell her what happened it very much affects me andy slapped his hand on the table let me read what you wrote miles slid the paper across the table to him then went to the kitchen counter and poured black coffee into a cup he usually drank his coffee first thing but this morning hed wanted to write the confession before he lost his nerve miles went to the bathroom splashed cold water on his face stared at himself in the mirror i used to be someone he thought i used to be me a regular guy the anybody american with a home and a business and a life and now i dont know who i am anymore the old me died the new me doesnt want to be born lies andy called from the kitchen miles wiped his face and stepped back into the kitchen im telling the truth andy slapped at the confession the truth you remember not the truth of what really happened its all i remember you didnt save those cops you know i did and i think about the high price every day miles miles stepped around andy took the paper folded it slipped it into an envelope i have to be honest with her youre breaking our deal the only deal we have is in your mind i have to go dont be here when i get back i dont want to get ugly miles andy said but you give her that confession and ill kill you miles stopped by the apartment door he yanked on his coat slid the confession into his coat pocket i will miles andys voice was low and it prickled miless skin as if an ice cube ran along his ribs ill slip a gun into your mouth ill pull the trigger ill settle the score andy paced the kitchen floor arms crossed glaring you go ahead and try miles shut the door behind him and leaned against it then he hurried down the steps past the comforting cinnamon smells of the bakery on the ground floor of his apartment building he stopped right outside the buildings front door craned his neck out an inch scanning both ways up the narrow streets eyeing every car and pedestrian no one waited to kill him no cars idling on the road full of assassins to mow him down before he took five steps he started his walk to allisons office he didnt drive anymore because he was afraid if the barradas found him theyd wire a bomb to his cars ignition theyd blown up the last two people who had testified against them scattering engine and glass and flesh across a driveway in hialeah and an office parking lot near miami the center of santa fe where he now lived and worked was territory he could cover on foot santa fe was so much smaller and quieter than the constant revving hum of miami he walked through the plaza at the heart of the old city past the native americans spreading turquoise and silver jewelry across black felt mats he headed up palace avenue past a beautiful young mother pushing a stroller with twin girls under a pink blanket tourists ambling along an architectural route joggers huffing in the crisp gray of the mountain morning jogging miles thought he should try jogging good healthy exercise to heal all the rot inside him he glanced over his shoulder twice to see if andy was following him no andy although it wouldnt take him long to catch up if he decided to press his case the confession inside his pocket made a soft crinkling sound as he walked and he smoothed the paper straight with a slide of his finger the paper would change everything in his life once again he walked past the stone grandeur of holy faith episcopal church and the elegant posada hotel and spa most of the homes along this stretch of palace avenue had been converted into office space allison vance counseled in an old brick victorian that stood out from the more common adobestyle buildings its yard dotted with spruce pines and cottonwoods the hum of a saw roared through an open upstairs window the landlord was refurbishing the empty top two floors while allison refurbished peoples heads miles went up to the house glancing over his shoulder andy stood on the bricked sidewalk huddled against the cold his tropical print shirt and khakis out of place in the morning chill of a santa fe spring go away miles mouthed at andy if you give her that confession andy said it changes nothing it doesnt hurt me it hurts you you got me miles miles gestured at him to go this aint done andy tossed the cigarette onto the street marched back toward the plaza miles found his breath and went inside the door to his right read allison vance md psychiatry he opened it stepped inside rested his head against the door as he closed it good morning michael allison said to his back im glad you made it this morning made it early he said certain days he couldnt face the appointment the idea of sifting through the black sand of his memory afraid of what he might unearth whats the matter he asked nothing at all allison said and her tense expression faded would you like a cup of green tea he hated green tea but said great thanks he took off his jacket hung it on a hook the confession still in its pocket and sat down in the fat worn leather chair across from hers she poured a steaming cup of tea and handed it to him thanks he said you look tired michael it was his newlife name one conjured up by witness security im not a morning person he sipped you probably worked a lot of nights being an investigator attempt number one to get him to talk his being a former private investigator was one of the three nuggets of truth she knew about his old life nighttime is the right time he said cheating spouses often burn the midnight oil is that who you shot a cheating spouse attempt number two based on nugget number two the dance remained the same she would try to get him to talk about the horrible instant when his old life died glean details he couldnt remember and he would duck and run hiding behind jokes and chatter no i never carried a gun the words came out like molasses dripping from his lips get up and give her the confession he told himself andy stood behind allison whats wrong miles lose your nerve go ahead tell pretty lady exactly what you did to me miles froze his skin felt like it had been slathered in ice andy had never set foot in allisons office before miles glanced at his coat where the confession lay he looked at andy andy grinned and shook his head michael is something wrong allison leaned forward with a frown miles hid behind a long sip of his tea steadied his breath against the rim of the cup looked up again andy made a gun of his fingers fired it at miles michael every time i mention the shooting you freeze up i know he set the tea down i dont want to not remember what happened anymore the words felt thick in his throat i need you to help me she sat across from him of course michael this is a major step wanting to heal yourself its a critical element thats been missing from our work together i dont want you to hate me he said i couldnt never she offered a thin smile i think i understand you better than you know wait till you find out what i did he said i dont even remember all the details of it i cant your willingness to talk about your trauma is all that matters michael i know i havent been cooperative with you but i want to be sure i stay your patient youre the only one who can help me ill take it as a welcome compliment thank you but he held up his hand dont give me the shrink line about every therapist is good blah blah blah and i dont want you sending me to a hospital i cant i wont go to one of those places theyre not an option an expression of surprise or of disappointment he couldnt tell which crossed her face then vanished with her nod no hospitals and i welcome the change in attitude toward your therapy where would you like to start prep her for the confession he decided i keep seeing the person i shot i cant live this way i cant have him on my shoulder all the time so its either get fixed or go even crazier her expression might have been cut from steel is he here now yes hes a fever i cant shake he told me this morning he wanted to kill me whats his name andy behind her andy crossed his arms i really resent you bringing this dogooder bitch between you and me miles lets talk about the shooting allison said i told you i dont remember all the details well go slow start with where the shooting happened the first word caught a stone in his throat but he coughed and said miami your home i grew up there so did andy where in miami did the shooting take place a warehouse no one there but me and he stopped he couldnt look at her handing her the confession now seemed impossible he steadied his breath the burn of panic inched along his bones me and two policemen and andy the knife thats in the kitchen drawer andy said wicked sharp ill put it in your hand ill help you draw a nice hot bath and then you can slash your wrists and were cool again miles stopped i want to be healthy again i want my life back he stood and he paced and put his face into his hands let me help you go back to the story but i cant remember i cant remember how can you help me if i cant remember small steps you shot this andy yes yes why the pictures crossed his mind a jumble photos dropped at random on a floor were laughing then andy freaked he pulled a gun aimed at the head of one of the cops and you shot him he sank into the chair yes but i dont remember it doesnt pretty lady deserve the truth andy whispered before you give her a letter full of lies lets not try to remember allison said lets just talk about what you visualize if you think about the shooting thats different from the memory itself he sipped the green tea and wished the cup held bourbon i remember the laughing but then the laughing stops and i raise the gun i see andy start to speak but i cant hear what he says i pull the trigger he shoots me he shot you yes in the shoulder i see him fall i the scar on his shoulder began to ache throbbing like a heartbeat sweat coated his palms the close air of the building tightened in his chest the smell of the paint the faint hammering two floors above him faded and suddenly the office disappeared the chill of new mexico that pressed through the windows replaced with the humid blanket of miami the gunfire boomed a ceaseless roar in his ears echoing in the cavernous warehouse drowning out andys scream his own voice filled with shock and horror the chock of the bullet hitting miless flesh a cannonball of pain michael oh jesus please miles ran his hand along his forehead he felt feverish sick he steadied his hands pressing them against the soft leather of the chair he was here not there he could not go back there never michael michael michael wasnt his name and he didnt want to answer to it and then he remembered yes he was michael now and forever if he wanted to live yes he said you were having a flashback youre safe no one will hurt you im safe he repeated after her he blinked she cleared her throat tell me about andy his hand wanted to reach for the confession just give it to her but he didnt want his hands to shake when he gave her the envelope i want michael are you listening to me he put his gaze on her yes allison but i dont want to remember any more im sorry i cant end it he thought tear up the confession walk out never come back have andy as the perpetual roommate until you die you took a forward jump today you said you want your health back your life back fight for it michael its too hard he found his breath again lets talk about my mom and dad did i tell you my dad gambled a lot i dont think we can shy away from what youre facing with andy i want to introduce a new element to our therapy he heard behind him the door to her office opening miles spun up from the chair covered the five steps to the door grabbed the mans neck and pushed him hard against the wall the man matched miless height and he closed a strong hand over miless hand tried to wrench miless grip from his throat michael stop allison yelled let him go miles released his grip the man had blond hair blue eyes a heavy build under the tailored suit he gave miles a cool stare i dislike people coming up behind me miles said clearly the man said michael this is doctor james sorenson ive known him for many years hes done amazing work with people suffering from severe posttraumatic stress disorder then he should know not to sneak up on people miles said sorry i apologize if i frightened you sorenson said for a big man he had a soft voice raspy as though he felt few words pass his lips he smoothed his suit lapel miles didnt care for the underlying tone of sorensons voice the slightly superior way in which hed said frightened he returned to his seat and faced allison i dont want another doctor miles said a hot anger surged in his chest this wasnt how a doctor as caring as allison behaved springing another doctor on him it was wrong it wasnt her i know but doctor sorenson is running a new program i believe could help you could give you your old life back the confession it would stop this shift keep this other doctor out of the picture so get up out of the chair and give her the confession and stop being petrified of what she will think of you andy standing behind sorenson said its not about what she thinks of you its about knowing exactly what happened when i died thats what you dont want to remember how you killed me my old life miles shook his head at allison then at sorenson i dont want my case discussed with anyone else you dont need to worry about confidentiality michael sorenson said your secrets are safe with me i only want to help you miles knew he could get up and leave he didnt want to hand the confession to allison not with sorenson here potentially reading what he wrote no not now sorenson seemed to study the indecision on miless face and said i want to help your memories whatever they are must be very terrible to you less terrible than dying he couldnt say andy died and i loved him like a brother best friend since i was three years old he died and i killed him god help me god forgive me i didnt mean to kill him i didnt want to kill him i was trying to save him sorenson leaned forward and miles saw muscles bunch in the mans big shoulders his expression was flat and cold theres a theory about traumatic memories our most terrible memories take the deepest root because theyre not like regular memories after a trauma we constantly dredge up the results of our worst lifealtering experiences we examine them we dissect them what could i have done differently what choice could i have made to avoid the tragedy leave for school two minutes earlier and my car doesnt crash into a truck and kill my child keep a more careful eye open and my friend doesnt get gunned down in a battle miles waited the traumatic memory is walled off from regular memories as it were and fails to integrate with other memories its never processed as a nonthreatening memory would be filed and put away to borrow an office metaphor so the terrible memory becomes more deeply rooted and so does the trauma associated with it the nightmares the crippling fear the paranoia that fate will strike a deadly blow again even when you dont remember specific details the memory is there an engine for the trauma its a vicious circle miles tucked his hands in between the armrests and the cushion of his chair in case the trembles returned if you could forget the worst moment of your life would you sorenson asked no one can forget but if you could would you forget all the trauma associated with killing this andy person yes miles said yeah i would wont happen andy said now sitting on the chairs arm leaning close to inspect sorenson were freaking inseparable well i cant wipe your brain clean but i could lessen the trauma of the memory now sorenson smiled think of it as a shot of mental botox as it were to smooth out the wrinkles in your memory that cause the pain picturing andy dying with no guilt no pain no fear no horror no guilt miles looked at allison this is for real i want to enter you in a special program for trauma victims allison thinks it might be helpful to you allison studied her hands in her lap is this program what you think i need miles asked allison wordlessly nodded she glanced at sorenson and miles saw this was why shed been tense when he arrived this other doctor hidden in her office waiting for him it all seemed wrong will you let me help you michael allison is recommending two other patients of hers for the program were meeting here tonight at eight to discuss it i hope youll join us your case fascinates me thanks for the offer ill give it serious consideration miles stood session over even though twenty minutes remained on the clock you made real progress today allison said i appreciate your listening to and talking with doctor sorenson thank you for understanding ill make my decision and let you know decision made you asshole andy said to sorenson hes not coming anywhere near you sorenson shook miless hand with an iron grip i hope we can together make your pain go away speaking of which allison said here michael she pressed a white plastic vial of pills into his hand whats this a very mild sedative to help you if you have another flashback not necessary he disliked pills and hated taking the antidepressants she prescribed for him swallowing each pill reminded him of his failure to be strong dosage directions inside allison said call me if you have questions i really hope well see you here tonight at eight miles slipped the pills into his jacket he heard his confession crinkle against the vial he left closing the office door behind him sweat coated his palms ran in a trickle down his ribs andy lounged by the entrance i knew you couldnt go through with it just tear up the confession and lets go home miles said im going to work and forget about you he stumbled outside the bracing air slapped against his face sorenson andy said calling your case interesting it made my skin crawl im a lot more than a case youre right miles said i dont like him either he spoke low into his cupped hand as if he were warming his skin with his breath good then you dont need his dumbass program andy slung an arm around his shoulder my favorite part of the confession was when you said you were trying to save me thats rich you dont save me you dont get to save yourself thats only fair miles miles stopped closed his eyes hunched his shoulders against the cold counted to one hundred listening to the distant hum of cars driving on paseo de peralta he opened his eyes and andy was gone would you forget the worst moment of your life i cant go on this way he thought i cant hed join the stupid program let sorenson take apart his brain if it would banish andy if allison believed going under sorensons wing would cure him fine he touched the confession in his pocket realizing hed been rubbing at it like a praying man fingering a rosary tonight at eight tonight hed give it to allison as a show of faith listen with an open if broken mind to sorensons proposal to fix his head but i might kill you before tonight andy said back again leaning in close make you step out in front of a speeding car put a gun in your mouth walk you up to the top of a tall building and right off the edge miles ran two dennis groote was late to visit his daughter because he had to kill the last of the duartes hed tracked the man an accountant whod managed to duck under the police radar after the duarte gang collapsed to a meeting monday night in san diego at a luxury hotel near the beach groote had spent monday night camped in an unoccupied room next to the target he had slipped inside it at nine that evening using an illegal scramble card if any latearriving guests showed up to claim the room he would simply send them back down to the front desk claiming a mistake had been made and leave the kill would wait for another day patience meant success patience meant life the accountant arrived shortly after ninethirty monday night but wasnt alone groote heard the accountant and a woman talking in awkward tones then the accountants laughter hearty trying to be macho then the unmistakable sounds of kissing of clothes sliding along skin of movement on mattress groote played solitaire on his pda during the lovemaking yawning once waiting for the accountant to be done he could simply pick the lock on the adjoining room door walk in shoot them both and not miss a second of visitation time with amanda but he did not see why he should kill a woman who simply had selected the wrong sexual partner for the evening he hated the idea of an innocent person suffering needlessly he waited and hoped that the targets girlfriend wouldnt stay the night but she did groote listened to them continue their intimacies until midnight then they fell asleep he gave them another hour hoping the woman would rouse from the postcoital slumber still the sound of silence of light snoring from both the accountant and the woman then groote dozed himself waking in the thin light of tuesday morning he listened at the door hushed steady snoring but he heard a soft step heard the shower next door rush to life now he could be done and gone while the woman showered out of harms way groote jimmied the lock between the door linking the two rooms eased it open the accountant was fortyish tall barrelchested he didnt look the part of a bean counter more like a laborer with his rough face and heavy jaw hi groote said the accountants eyes opened in sleepy confusion and he said uh hi you helped destroy my family just so you know groote shot him with his silenced gun twice between the eyes he heard a scream from behind him over the hiss of the shower damn shed started the hot water but hadnt stepped under the spray he grabbed the woman shoved her hard against the wall covered her mouth with his hand she was older than the accountant in her late forties groote recognized her a concierge at the hotel groote had noticed her last night hed noticed and taken account of every person in the lobby during his walkthrough shed had a welcoming smile for him then glancing up from her computer and he had nodded in return now groote jabbed his gun against the womans throat answer me and ill let you live the concierge closed her eyes shuddering underneath his touch you understand she nodded why are you here groote took his hand a centimeter off her mouth here the concierge sputtered in her terror oh my god oh my god yes here with him wrong place wrong time rattled in grootes head but he hated the phrase he heard cathys final words im taking your car more room for junk in the trunk he invited me please dont kill me please dont the concierge tried to back away from the gun barrel pressed into her throat but groote kept a hard grip on the womans hair does he stay at this hotel often she nodded a yes did you know him before tonight yes a predetermined choice then not the random lovemaking of just one night you know what kind of man he is she shuddered with fear he hes just a cpa for a boating company he had a different job before his actions helped kill my wife maim my daughter he paid out the cash that bought the guns that destroyed my family she shivered under his touch boating company you should be more discerning about your friends miss he said gently yes okay i will i promise im very sorry for the inconvenience and he shot the concierge once between astonished eyes he took i north to orange staying up most of the night generously giving the concierge the chance to leave taking the time to check the accountants laptop and files for anyone else connected to the remnants of the duarte crime ring who needed killing setting up the scene to appear like a robbery battling the morning traffic sludge made him late for his morning with amanda but at least he knew now he had not been unfair not like amanda or cathy who had never had a chance at ten almost an hour late he screeched into the heart of orange zooming past the restored orange circle with its charming shops down past chapman university and its sparkling new buildings orange was a nice town he ought to move here be closer to amanda hit man of suburbia the idea nearly made him laugh he drove a few more blocks down to a cluster of brick buildings that suggested the quiet ambience of a modern prep school except with bars on the windows at the gate at pleasant point hospital he gave his name to the guard at the post he drove up to the main building parked his mercedes hurried across the lot he knew he needed a shower a shave but he had not wanted to waste another moment a group of the children played outside in the morning sunshine a few others standing staring off at the sky or the ground or their hands he didnt see amanda he hurried into the building checked in at the front desk todays nurse was mariana his favorite im late groote said terrible traffic amandas in her room mariana said thank you groote signed in and hurried down the hall to amandas room he heard the plaintive notes before he reached her door stepped in slowly so she could see him not be startled she remained jumpy months after the horror amanda lay twisted on her bed knees drawn close to her chest her right cheek pressed to the pillow patsy cline her mothers favorite singer drifted softly from the speakers walking after midnight too sad a song for a bright morning too sad a song for a sixteenyearold she ought to be listening to those boy bands snapping her fingers singing into a hairbrush dancing before bathroom mirrors at home with him where she belonged amanda he stepped over to the cd player turned the volume low amanda its daddy now she opened her brown eyes looked at him through him hey amanda banana he drew a chair close to the side of the bed how are you he kept his voice gentle and soothing amanda didnt answer the frown on her mouth the way her stare cut through him as if he were mist told him a bad day loomed for her and for him he took her hand you want to get up and go outside she barely shook her head one of the scars on her face the small starshaped one near the corner of her mouth jerked and he thought she would say good morning but she went still im so sorry im late pumpkin i had a work project this morning i had to finish now her eyes focused on his face she said slowly and carefully mom came to see me ah did she yes what did mom say she wants me to hurt myself oh no baby she doesnt she doesnt groote tried to take one of her hands in his but she kept her hands twisted into claws tucked tight against her chest she said amanda whispered that i should cut off my face no baby groote said the drugs the lameass therapys not working she doesnt even remember cathys dead she wasnt here now steel crept into amandas tone she was she comes nearly every day baby its all in your head she was here he stopped trying to argue with her he wanted her calm and talking not shrieking and screaming and cutting his visit short there was so much necessary ugliness in the world she was his pocket of beauty he touched the scar at the corner of her mouth another scar bisecting her eyebrow the wriggled thread of tissue beneath her ear the outward souvenirs of bullets smashing through glass of a car tumbling down a rocky canyon he kissed each scar he whispered in her ear mom would never tell you to hurt yourself he smelled a raw metallic odor familiar the smell of blood he leaned back from her searching her face running fingers along the bed amanda she folded her gaze back into herself he yanked the covers off her she lay in soft pants and shirt and he groped along her limbs and her torso for injury nothing he pulled her cheek up from the pillow her skin lay smooth and unbroken his hands hurried at the back of her head and stickiness gummed his fingers she began to scream thrashing against him screaming for him please to take her face off i dont understand groote said why she hurts herself the reasons are many doctor warner was a heavyset man florid face under carrotred hair starting to gray she blames herself for the accident she shouldnt it wasnt remotely her fault she still blames herself well i blame you for her state of mind groote said in a voice of icy calm my daughter is cutting her scalp open for gods sakes your staff let her get hold of a safety pin and that had been her shrieked explanation as he summoned help taking my face off has to be done from the back dad its easier it wont happen again i want you groote said keeping his control but nearly hissing through his teeth to help her weve tried art therapy medications group therapy all the standard treatments to process unintegrated traumatic memory amanda is simply not improving warner tented his hands under his jaw the mental damage she suffered trapped with her dead mother for so long it may not be reparable if its broken it can be fixed groote said amanda is not a dish to be glued back together warner said patience he reminded himself deep breath when i say fix i mean give her enough health to have her life back to want to live again groote thought ill find out if you have a family doctor because if you dont help my daughter you wont be able to help your own you can get a real sense of what pain is amanda had problems before the accident her biological father abused her yes groote didnt care to be reminded of the sad details and he felt warner was saying sorry buddy your daughter was damaged goods before you brought her here but groote had taken care of the rotten nogood deadbeat father as a secret favor to his new wife and daughter he never experienced hate when he killed except when hed put ten bullets into that worthless scum he had not known he could love cathy and amanda so much the idea of love had seemed like a rumor never real until he found them and now cathy was gone and amanda needed him she only had him to protect her obviously the loss of her mother is devastating to her but the conditions in which she lost her mom theyre much more damaging than her mother dying in a hospital bed of cancer or even dying instantly in an accident in a way amanda experienced her own death when she experienced her mothers think of it as a compound fracture against her mental health it took her straight over into complex posttraumatic stress disorder youre not helping her groote said in a low tone shes trying to take her face off if she hurts herself again i will hold you personally responsible and youll learn an entirely new meaning of the word consequences warner smiled he was a smart man groote thought who knew very little threatening me doesnt help your daughter mr groote im sorry but i need you to fix her to make her right again please please and then salvation came in the form of his cell phone ringing only the hospital and his clients had this number he opened the phone he didnt use voice mail it carried too much risk ill have to call you back he said instead of hello please do a smooth voice answered this is quantrill i have the perfect job for you it could even help your daughter groote drove over the speed limit all the way to santa monica oliver quantrills house a fusion of steel and glass stood in a wealthy neighborhood quantrill sat on his expansive tiered deck drinking mineral water tapping on a laptop he was tall gymclub and proteindiet gaunt in his early forties he closed the laptop as groote approached him how did you know about my daughter groote cooled his rage no be honest its not rage its fear down to a simmer calm down dennis i had you checked when i first hired you it would have been foolish not to given your past i mean amanda no harm talk what job could i do for you that helps my kid do you know exactly what i do dennis you sell information i dont know specifics heres a specific ive acquired medical research designed to help people suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder people such as amanda grootes legs went weak he sat down research abandoned research it didnt work the first time ive had my team make improvements now it works works how its a drug that makes ptsd controllable possibly curable quantrill sipped at his orange juice would you like your daughter back dennis what would that be worth to you groote opened his mouth then closed it everything wouldnt it sure groote said i would want it for my daughter you and many many other people experts estimate that up to ten percent of the american population ten percent of the european population suffers from a form of ptsd thats many millions of potential patients and then we have all the soldiers coming back from the middle east fresh from war with as many as forty percent with traumatic memories huge cost right there and the civilian populations in the war zones add in all the other horrors of life that can haunt us hurricanes assaults rapes car crashes accidents terrorist attacks well you can see fighting trauma is a growth market quantrill took another sip of his juice poured a glass from the carafe for groote handed it to him i havent heard of any drug research along these lines and i follow anything that could help my girl the research and testing has been done well under the table so i can sell the research to a pharmaceutical and they can claim its a product of their own development i get an ongoing percentage sooner thats done sooner amanda and everyone who needs the drug gets it grootes mouth went dry whys the research got to be secret not your worry but i do need you to worry about a woman in santa fe her name is doctor allison vance shes been working with the patients whove tested the drug in a psych hospital i own there my research directors worried that she might blow a whistle on me to the fda she does that no miracle drug for anybody including amanda i already dislike doctor vance intensely groote said im sure shes a truly awful person quantrill grinned i knew you were the right guy for this job go to new mexico on the next available flight bring back the research materials to me i know theyll be safe with you and if doctor vance becomes a problem then i need you to introduce her to a very serious accident three pull yourself together miles told himself andy quit following him as he ran along paseo de peralta and turned the corner onto canyon road hes fighting you because hes afraid you really will make him go away miles stopped running stuck a hand in his pocket closed his fingers around the pills allison had given him no he wouldnt take one yet he wanted his mind sharp at work as sharp as it could be if andy reappeared then down the pill but andy didnt seem to enjoy the gallery much and miles walked on surer footing inside its walls the exercise calmed him but he couldnt shake sorenson out of his thoughts the man had seemed ready to take a swing at miles he didnt carry the soothing air of a psychiatrist easing a startled patient miles played the odd session back in his head just springing another therapist on him was wrong dead wrong not the sort of thing allison did a therapist wasnt supposed to do the unexpected life rattled his cage enough most days right now the gallery beckoned as his refuge miles had had only two job interviews in his whole life hed always worked for his dad at kendrick investigation services in its stripmall office between a pawnshop and a vintageclothing store in a miami neighborhood when andy brought miles to meet the barradas two days after his fathers funeral his first job interview had been decidedly onesided your dad owed us three hundred thousand off greyhounds and ponies miles and he put up the agency as collateral so we could take your business right this minute but thanks to your buddy andy were offering you a deal we need a man to be our own personal spy miles we need you to steal information for us get the incriminating evidence on other rings find out who their dealers are their suppliers where theyre stashing and cleaning their money we have that we take them down we take over their business you can give us leverage give us a competitive advantage mr barrada enjoyed reading the latest businessbook best sellers and adapting their ideas to mob life you do that for us when we ask for the next two years our debts settled and scared to the bone hed had no choice but to say yes the interview with joy garrison had been equally difficult hed walked through the gallery his witness security inspector contemplating the paintings and their high price tags and followed joy upstairs to her private office she was a petite woman fiftyish attractive and at first he thought she was the stereotypical santa fe hippydippy in her billowy pants and her silverandturquoise jewelry but as soon as he sat across from her he recognized a toughness in her eyes that rivaled that of mr barrada she studied him for an agonizing minute he forced himself not to fidget in the chair finally she said you really want this job yes maam but you dont know shit about art do you honey not much maam but i and he stopped because andy stood in the corner arms crossed whats the matter but what i wanted to go to art school learn photography i didnt get the chance parents disapproved yes maam said they wouldnt pay for a waste of money my parents said the same thing they were right i couldnt draw a straight line but being an artist and selling art are two different skill sets she laughed this gallery pays for mama and daddy to be in a real nice retirement village im a hard worker maam i can move the art for you lots of those paintings and sculptures must be pretty heavy i need brain more than brawn inspector pitts says youre handy with computers i sell to collectors all over the country but my web sites crap i need a much more effective one i also need help tracking inventory yes maam i can build you a database build or manage a web site run and fix your computers make your systems more secure whatever you need he didnt want to see andy so he kept his gaze locked on his lap you tell me how to sell art ill sell art ill do whatever

trust mrs garrison call me joy you start tomorrow she stood and he stood and shook her hand and hed loved the job for the past two months the door to the joy garrison gallery jangled as he opened and closed it the gallery represented fourteen artists who were growing in repute among collectors most of the paintings and sculptures were priced at two thousand dollars or more and miles wished he could have made a living creating calm beauty on canvas miles nodded at joy and her son cinco as he stepped into the back office where he and the staff worked she sat at a sales reps desk jotting on a sticky note she raised an eyebrow cinco stayed on the phone with a new york collector praising a new painting as a musthave youre not scheduled today hon joy said no maam im not i just wanted to catch

who were friends of joys were now at the door bearing lattes and gossip and joy laughed and called to them and they headed to joys office upstairs at the back of the gallery miles carried a small painting joy wanted to show them he came downstairs two tourists browsed in the front and cinco answered their questions about a sculpture of a leaping ram miles refilled his coffee mug and decided to call his witsec inspector to ask for a vetting on sorenson so he could join the treatment program if he wanted but he stepped into the back office and found blaine the pain sitting at his desk drumming fingers from the office doorway miles shot cinco a desperate frown which cinco answered with a grin that said sorryyourescrewed i got customers hes your problem hi mr blaine dont hi me michael are you rotating paintings today tomorrow sir is emilia stands in the sun his most recent work a beautifully shaded portrait of a young latina among high grasses getting shoved to a back

desperation edged his voice we wont let her be orphaned good i have to go to marfa today marfa was a town in the west texas desert reborn from its background as the shooting site for the film classic giant and emerging as a junior santa fe a thriving arts colony with lower living costs i might move there a friends driving me there to check it out for a couple of days i just wanted to be sure emilia didnt get stuck in the back would you call me if she sells he scribbled a number on a note and handed it to miles yes sir blaine the pain left miles closed the office door and dialed deshawn pittss pager number he entered his identification code and hung up less than a minute later the phone rang joy garrison gallery miles said michael raymond speaking its pitts whats up the voice sounded young but deep slightly distracted and miles could hear the rustle of paper shuffling on a desk not on the phone lunch can you drive up here deshawn lived in albuquerque he was the witsec inspector for federally protected witnesses hidden in northern new mexico he was responsible for helping miles protect his new identity finding him work and settling him into his new life keeping him safe give me a hint man my shrink wants to bring in another doctor to work with me and im concerned about him im sure doctor vance wouldnt recommend a quack whats his name james sorenson why do you need another doctor hes running a project for ptsd patients did you ever tell doctor vance youre a witness witsec had told him he was permitted to tell his psychiatrist of his status as a protected witness it was considered crucial for successful therapy given the enormous mental ordeal relocation was for witnesses but hed never told allison he was in witness protection she knew only that hed been involved in a shooting and exonerated by the authorities witsec requested he specifically not tell allison his real name or where hed originally come from unless it was critical to his therapy all those details were in the confession hed been too afraid to give her today no i never told her im a witness group therapys not a good idea for you man since you got to be circumspect but we can talk about it at lunch meet me at luisas twelvethirty and deshawn hung up joy hurried back in grabbed a file off cincos desk a rich smell of espresso rising from her coffee cup she hurried back onto the sales floor calling out to her visitors and the aroma of the coffee made the world swim before his eyes cuban coffee rich and heady a screech of laughter from one of joys friends the smell and the scream cut straight through to his brain the gallery transformed into an empty warehouse shafts of light cutting through the gloom and he stood in the warehouse and the four men drank the heavy coffee miles tried to hide his trembling hands the two undercover fbi agents miles and andy talking at the table andy about to get the best news of his life and then miles spoke just a few words and then tried to laugh the words he spoke he couldnt remember the words andy stared at him standing behind the two undercover agents who sat at the table pouring themselves refills of coffee and then it all went wrong as andy reached for his gun miles grabbing for his own gun in reaction horrified saying andy dont he heard the shots the triple echo opened his eyes back in the gallery the bloodied floor of the warehouse gone he sank to the floor next to the copier he leaned against the equipment and his finger twitched jerked once against a ghost trigger awful silence darkness as if the world had swallowed him whole its pointless andy knelt next to him this is your life now me you never parted give up trying to change miles shook his head youll die trying andy whispered then he heard laughter joys warm honeyed laughter the gallery its wonderful quiet surrounded him miles forced himself back into the chair at his desk he took deep breaths trying to ward off the pain and the fear he couldnt live this way so dont end it ill help you andy said miles groped at the weight of the pill bottle in his pocket allisons pills a very mild sedative to help you if you have a flashback shed said he fished the vial of pills out of his pocket plain plastic bottle no label he twisted it open the pills were white capsules folded among the pills lay a note he pulled out the piece of paper he spread the note flat on the desk with his fingers dear michael i need your help i need your services as a private investigator im in real trouble come to my office tonight at and ill explain dont tell anyone im depending on you see you at p m allison four miles stood in line at luisas drivethru a mercedes in front of him a homeless man who smelled of dollar wine next to him and a pickup truck loaded with truant highschool kids behind him gunning the motor when hed first arrived in santa fe miles had crafted a careful series of policies and camouflages to keep people from realizing he was dealing with issues dont answer andy in public resist jumping at sudden noises close his eyes and stand still when a flashback invaded his mind he didnt want to stick out be noticed devolve into the streetcorner crazy raving at ghosts because if you acted crazy you landed in the asylum today his fitinwiththenormals policy was in the toilet luisas drivethru was an entirely accurate name for the tinroofed simple establishment on a curve of the busy paseo de peralta it offered no counter service customers used the driveup window or nothing so a man who walked everywhere stuck out standing in line between the cars on the stroll over he had spotted a gaunt street person he knew named joe a man in his late fifties laid waste by alcohol he figured joe received few invitations to dine so hed said as he walked past ill buy you lunch at luisas if you want and joe without a word had followed him the federal witness and the homeless drunk stood between the two cars having spoken their orders into the microphone and now were waiting patiently in line to reach the order window behind him the pickups engine revved in motorized machismo miles heard the laughter hollow and cruel of stupid children hey losers a girl called miles glanced over his shoulder the girl sat close to the driver a thicknecked kid with a shavedclose head miles saw the girl was the brain the boy the brawn she was beautyqueen pretty but an ugly taunting sneer slashed her face three other kids crowded the cab hey losers beauty queen yelled again she wore a cocky confidence born of her loveliness and her knowledge of how to use it get a car why dont you the pickup jolted an inch closer to his leg he ignored it theyd leave you alone if i wasnt here joe said in his low beaten whisper no she wouldnt miles said an ass is an ass the girl secure in the presence of her personal grizzly bear laughed loud enough to be sure that miles heard its a drivethrough not a walkthrough whats the matter with you miles thought he looked normal not mental but he wondered in the sidelong glances he often earned if there was a mark on him a shock in his eyes that announced damaged goods to anyone seeking a victim or a mark joe walked in slow retreat to the other end of the lot eyes riveted to the pavement the pickup jerked closer barely nudging the back of his knee miles stood his ground the mercedes in front of him pulled away from the order window revved out into the traffic along the loop of paseo de peralta miles didnt walk forward to claim his order the pickups horn blared hey move it along miles stayed still andy next to him said whats your damn problem retard move it along another long honk the bumper edged into his leg again forcing him to take a step laughter slowly miles walked up to the order window luisa the owner worked the window and she filled a plastic bag with miles and joes meal beef and chicken tacos wrapped in thin foil cups of beans and rice hey there she said how are you whats all this honking just kids miles said asshole beauty queen leaned on the horn now miles looked at them the football player grinned move it along two wheels the boy called miles handed luisa the money in exact change he noticed she kept the napkins the salt and the homemade salsa packages and the sugar packets on a shelf just a second luisa and ill be back he said grabbing several sugar packets and a straw he walked around the pickup shaking the sugar packets at the football player and beauty queen he popped the gas cap open and wedged the first sugar packet in place to shove it inside when the drivers brain cells clicked in unity and his door flew open the kid staring at miles in shock ill beat your ass into the ground not another step miles said or youll have one sweet ride the football player stopped dont man then drive off miles said why do you want to be an asshole whats the matter beauty queen pushed on the boys broad back just go beat his ass sugar in the tank ruins the car football player said to her in a low strained voice miles suspected it wasnt enough sugar to do real damage but football player didnt know that etiquette lesson for today be nice to people who dont have a car i dump the sugar the nocar group includes you smack his ass tyler beauty queen yelled yeah tyler try to smack my ass maybe youll win or maybe ill show you how to respect your elders but one more step its definite youll be truckless tyler froze with indecision stuck between beauty queens braying enthusiasm for violence and a sureness that miles would poison the gas tank before tyler reached him tyler kick his ass beauty queen screamed tyler use your brain miles started whistling sugar sugar he saw deshawns sedan wheel hard into the lot pull into a parking space after a pause of five seconds brain won tyler got back into the truck peeled away miles could see the girl hollering and gesturing at the boy miles walked back to luisas window put the sugar packets and the unopened straw back on the counter i cost you their lunch business he said sliding her an extra twenty please accept my apology and this as payment and three cokes too please luisa she got him his food and the cokes without a word he walked a bag of tacos over to joe who stood with hung head and shamed frown here you go miles said thanks joe said sorry i left you alone them kids i just cant take it the meanness no worries theyre gone you come see me at the gallery if they bother you i set foot on canyon road the fancyasses call the cops not if you come see me okay thanks joe took the bag of food and the coke gave a polite nod and walked down the street miles got into the ford sedan and handed the taco bag to deshawn pitts was a bigbuilt guy an excollege football player with a shavedbald head the sedan fit him like a tootight suit he wished hed read allisons note before he called deshawn because he wouldnt have asked the inspector to have lunch with him she wants your help not anyone elses so keep your mouth shut dont bring deshawn into this you can be the man you once were help her on your own thanks man but feeding bums and fighting with kids deshawn said you know bud the idea is to not draw attention to yourself good to see you too deshawn handed him a chicken taco snagged a beef one for himself they started to eat deshawn demolished the first taco wiped his mouth clean first things first miles i did a quick check theres not a psychiatrist or a medical doctor or a psychologist licensed in new mexico named james sorenson miles swallowed soda i dont understand maybe you got his name wrong i must have i havent been sleeping good i must have misheard he didnt know what else to say i tried to call allison back this morning to find out more about the program but shes not answering her phone that part was truth hed tried to reach her repeatedly after getting her note but hed only gotten her voice mail and he just asked her to call him back but sorenson wasnt a doctor why had she introduced him as such why had she lied to him why had she let sorenson lie to him because sorenson had forced her to lie im in real trouble deshawn chewed on his beans sipped at his coke therapy must not be sailing smoothly if shes bringing in a backup shrink miles was now frantic to get back to allison he stuck his unfinished lunch back in the bag whats your rush deshawn asked im not in a rush you dont have to worry about my therapy ill be ready to testify deshawn man the first goround in court wasnt your finest moment but youre going to be aces for big man barradas trial i have faith in you dont say that to me if you dont miles said suddenly he had broken down twice on the stand when crossexamined about the shooting about the deal made with him to testify the defendant a junior barrada member the feds had chosen to put on trial first in hopes of cutting a cooperative deal which the guy refused got a reduced sentence because miles hadnt appeared to the jury to be an entirely reliable witness i need people to have faith in me i need your help im in real trouble miles mman total faith from big d you not seeing folks who arent there not hearing voices again right right miles lied only in my dreams and everyone should have a crazy dream now and then right ill get this doctors correct name for you all right but i want to know details of this program miles before you agree to anything sure said miles i dont work this afternoon would you mind dropping me off at my apartment miles hurried into his building with a quick wave to deshawn he ran upstairs retrieved a tool he figured he might need he ran down the stairs thinking you take this step you cant go back he headed toward allisons office five im not going on oprah celeste brent put the small razor back under the computer mouse pad where she kept it she didnt need to feel the blade against her skin right now i cant handle being on television again victor gambys voice boomed from the speakerphone i understand your hesitation but think of the people we could help sharing our stories with millions you sound like a commercial im selling an idea celeste being back on television might get you past your fears im not leaving my house and im not having a media zoo here do me a favor open your door stand in the doorway you dont have to step outside just try it no i could ask them to do a satellite link with your house when im on the show that way we could both appear together celeste we could get americas moms talking about posttraumatic stress disorder make it a real healthcare issue encourage people to think about it the way they do depression or cancer please victor you go youre an actual hero oh please im just someone who had a really bad fifteen minutes she leaned close to the plussized computer screen read the words that a young girl half a country away had posted to victors online discussion group this morning most days im so sad sadder than anybody should be and i just want to curl up amp cry forever and the bite of the blade into my skin is the only way i can feel does anyone understand celeste reconsider millions of people watched you on castaway they know you they rooted for you victor said its oprah for gods sakes you cannot say no no celeste reread the girls words on the computer screen and thought i understand sweetie i truly do she clicked to the next message in the forum jared t having soulemptying dreams about the battle of fallujah she wished she could give jared t a hug she swiveled the chair away from the computer screen did i tell you i got an offer for another reality show celeste thats wonderful brace yourself and imagine the possibilities group therapy please be kidding i couldnt make this up they want me and denise daniels the child star from too cool kimmy she had a nervous breakdown last year and that college basketball star whos supposedly bipolar and a couple of other celebrities who have had mental illnesses all living together in a house with doctor frank the talkshow host and yes it gets better once a week a player gets booted out of the house castaway for crazy people victor said oh no one says that celeste said they just think it but thats what were fighting every day this perception that people with traumas arent really sick that they just need to buck up and get over it they wouldnt do a show like that for people who had cancer would they no so stop acting like a person with ptsd and act like a famous person with ptsd let good come from your fame help me celeste the sensor that alerted celeste whenever anyone entered her front yard chimed and opened a video window on her computers monitor it showed allison vance hurrying up the stone walkway odd she didnt have an appointment scheduled with allison victor i have to go i cant do the tv appearance with you but i know youll do a wonderful job celeste ill call you soon victor take care celeste said and hung up tv again leave the house or have strangers gawking at her or wanting to hurt her again no never the doorbell buzzed she pulled hard at the rubber band looping her wrist and let it snap against the tender skin once twice the pain brief and sharp but settling her nerves she went to answer the door she unlocked it released the dead bolts said close to the wood its open and took five steps back just so allison couldnt pull her out of the house and into the open air not that she would but celeste didnt take chances allison came inside clutching a briefcase bag close to her hips hi did i forget an appointment celeste asked not at all celeste but i have a favor to ask of you if its not an intrusion how are you today extraordinarily stupid i just declined a chance to meet oprah she said with a tone of defiance im sure it would have been exciting but also a tremendous spotlight to be under you dont think im making it up youre famous celeste shrugged used to be we could up your antidepressants it might make leaving the house easier other than not wanting to leave the house i feel okay i dont want more pills celeste toyed with the rubber band popped it against her skin allison pointed at celestes wrist and hows the rubber band working out saccharine when you want sugar but you havent hurt yourself today no not today great and yesterday once just once she fingered the thin slash on her arm have you eaten today i did bowl of cereal for breakfast salad for lunch wonderful as if eating two simple meals and not slicing your skin meant sanity celeste twisted the rubber band tight a spark of pain nothing more just enough to remind her she was alive and brian lay dead and buried shut up in a coffin unable to see the sun breathe the air id like to borrow your computer allison said i know you have a really powerful setup and i need a machine for quick numbercrunching itll only take a few minutes celeste almost said no no and hell no she didnt care for the idea of anyone touching her computer her precious and only link to the rest of the world but this was allison the twiceaweek bright spot of hope so she swallowed and said no problem my system got nailed with a virus this morning down and dead bring it to me and ill see if i can fix it said celeste thats kind of you i just have research materials i need to compile for a report i have the programs and the data i need on disk my computers in the study would you like some coffee or a soda no thank you i really dont want to intrude youre not its down the hall to your right the systems already on allison thanked her and headed down the hallway after a few moments celeste heard the click of the keyboard the hum of the cd drive suddenly she wanted the razor against her skin to know its gentle bite it hit her like a fire smoldering then bursting into fresh flame sure you do she thought just because allisons here and youd get immediate attention you want attention call the television producers back and tell tbem youll do that new reality sideshow now thats attention she stretched the rubber band and it snapped in half she dug in her purse for another past the vial of pills allison had given her the previous week past the little razor she kept hidden at the purses bottom her fingers closed around the razor case just a nip of a cut just enough she closed her eyes and the world folded around her and she was trapped in the sunhot house her and brians dream home bought with her castaway prize money and she was bound and crying and begging the disturbed fan not to hurt brian to leave him alone to hurt her please god not him and the disturbed fan blew her a kiss and bent over brian the knife bright in his hand celeste sank to the chair the memory tore into her worse than the razor and when the flashes came she couldnt gouge her skin fast enough but now she stopped herself she caught her breath the only pain the heat of grief at the back of her eyes celeste allisons hand came down on her shoulder dont touch me her voice didnt sound like her own but lower and beaten allison withdrew her hand are you all right yes she stood up and the purse tumbled to the tile floor spilling its contents in a clatter celeste you were having a flashback past tense its gone youre safe yes thank you i know she wanted allison gone a flush of embarrassment creeping up her skin what triggered it i think the sound of you typing i never hear anyone on a keyboard except myself and then i dont notice it the disturbed fan after hed gotten into my house after hed tied me up he got on our computer he hacked my fan web site her throat felt rough as sandpaper the first step of not having to share me with the world she shuddered im so sorry im all right the urge to cut started to fade from fire to smoke ill stay with you so you dont hurt yourself no need i might cry i wont cut allison nodded youre making real progress i hope she hoped progress baby steps she still couldnt imagine opening the front door and walking out into the grander world too much im done with the computer thank you again its no problem i dont mean to pry i saw on your screen youre logged on to one of the posttraumatic support blogs yes victor gambys i think i mentioned him to you hes a friend of mine in los angeles hes tireless about raising awareness of ptsd issues hes the one who wanted me to appear on oprah with him i hope youre strong enough to accept his offer god are you kidding no way no way in hell someday celeste youll leave this house youll want to celeste couldnt speak allison cleared her throat blinked as though she were searching for the right words those discussion groups its good that youre reaching out to others i dont talk about myself i just read what other people say but it helps to know youre not alone ive made an art of being alone to her surprise allison knelt among the scatterings from the spilled purse fished out a fresh rubber band stood awkwardly and slid the band on celestes wrist there may come a day you dont want to be alone celeste shrugged whod want a basket case like me oh celeste allison shook her head i have a second favor to ask sure if anyone calls from the hospital especially doctor hurley you havent seen me today whos doctor hurley allison stuck out her tongue rolled her eyes my boss at my parttime job shame on you playing hooky celeste said we all need a mentalhealth day or week or month or year ill call you tomorrow see how you are allison said thanks allison left and celeste shut the heavy door behind her she peered around the curtain watching over the low adobe wall surrounding her yard as allison got into her bmw and drove off celeste stood at the window her hand against the reinforced pane of glass twenty seconds later another car shot by and then the mud road lay quiet and celeste listened to the wind rattle in the cottonwoods she went back to the computer allison had thoughtfully left it as she found it the posting from the boysoldier back from baghdad front and center she clicked on email reply and wrote it does get better sweetie be sure and find a doctor who really understands ptsd and will listen to what you tell himher dont let them tell you its just in your head or depression dont let them use nothing but pills to numb you dont lose faith if you were here id give you a big hug if youd let me then to the girl cutting herself celeste wrote i wanted to cut today and i didnt lately im more able to resist the urge maybe its the change of the seasons maybe im just less crazy today but were not crazy were broken and we are our own glue sweet girl know that we on the list care and if i were there id give you a big hug and tell you you will you will you will be okay she signed both replies ceebee the name from her initials she used on the group because she dared not use her own that would bring out the media vultures she pressed send she didnt want anyone else to suffer the hell that she did she was only twentyeight but here were these kids younger than she already with savaged souls and it broke what was left of her heart saying no to victor the flashback reading other peoples sadness she needed a lift she hunted for the antidepressants allison had prescribed for her kneeling in the jumbled spill from her purse the razor the rubber bands her wallet the vials of pills she kept in her purse were gone white pills and blue pills she took the blue if her mood sank low like now and she needed the comfort of an antidepressant the white pills right before a therapy session with allison to calm her to make it easier to talk about brian and the disturbed fan but the bottle had just been there on the floor hadnt it when allison got her a replacement rubber band she knelt glancing under the chair and the coffee table finally getting up and wandering the room she went to her bathroom and found one bottle holding the sweet blue numbers but no white pills where the hell had she put them she should have asked allison for a refill but that was all right she didnt have a session for two more days she downed a blue meanie as she called them and went and sat in front of her window she observed the shifting sunlight of the day from inside her cage the thought nagged at her those pills had been in her purse this afternoon she was sure of it perhaps allison had taken the pills palming them when she rummaged through celestes purse but why without telling her and asking her to keep her secret for her as if they were teenage girls was downright odd actually unprofessional keeping a secret meant responsibility and she wanted nothing to do with responsibility she got up and headed for the phone six miles slowed to a walk as he reached palace avenue he scanned the offices parking slots allisons silver bmw wasnt in the lot but he saw sorenson walking through the front door into the building he carried a fat briefcase the kind miles had seen government lawyers use to haul massive files into the courtroom miles ducked close to a cottonwood counted to thirty then went up to the steps and into the building allisons office was closed he risked a quick listen at the door he heard the softest tread of foot on floor the hallway air reeked of paints and solvents and he heard voices upstairs workmen discussing the renovations the quiet voice of a woman asking when the work would be finished she planned to relocate here from denver and damn she needed an office before the rents went up the painters laughed and agreed with her sense of urgency keep them occupied lady please miles thought knock or wait confront sorenson but with what that he wasnt licensed he considered the oddity of allisons request a note tucked into his medication she presumably couldnt ask for help in front of sorenson so sorenson was her socalled real trouble she couldnt call and ask for help which might mean that sorenson was going to be around her a lot or monitoring her calls that sounded ridiculous paranoid but shed said sorenson was a doctor and he wasnt so what was he he stepped away from the door toward the office across the entryway from hers the door stood open the beige paint on the walls fresh the workers upstairs must be refurbishing these rooms as well they could return at any second and he didnt want to be forced to explain his presence but he eased the office door shut to an inch where he could still see allisons door two minutes later sorenson stepped out from allisons office locked the door with a key and left the building through the front door no briefcase in hand miles watched sorenson step out of his line of vision and ten seconds later the door he was hiding behind slammed into his face jesus mister sorry the painter said peeking around the edge my fault miles managed to say sorry these offices are already leased the painter said the ones upstairs are available okay thanks sorry miles fled into the hallway then into the bathroom washed his face counted to thirty he heard after a minute the heavy tread of the painters feet going back up the staircase miles hurried to allisons door he fished the lockpick hed brought from home out of his pocket it resembled a swiss army knife set and he pulled a blade free and eased it into the door he hadnt picked a lock since hed stopped his spying for the barradas since hed walked into a meeting with the feds to help bring the barradas down lockpicks were part of the world hed left behind but when he got to santa fe hed bought a basic set of picks off the internet he had assembled and hidden in a rented locker at the bus station a cache of equipment and money in case witsec couldnt protect him in case he had to vanish on his own terms because until he lost his mind hed always taken care of himself he wondered as he bit his lip and worked the mechanism if picking a lock of a person whod asked him for help was a violation of the memorandum of understanding witsec had required him to sign he wasnt supposed to commit a crime it wasnt a contract but the mou laid out in clear black and white his responsibility as a freshly minted lawabider and the governments duty to protect him if witsec found out hed jimmied her locks they could boot him from the program and then he was dead he was crossing a line not drawn in ink or sand but in trust but she wasnt answering her phone and sorenson who wasnt a doctor and had lied about being one came and went at will from her office he was afraid for allison the lock clicked open he stepped inside shut and locked the door behind him he checked the office she wasnt here okay then he thought shes not here he comes in with a large briefcase he leaves without it which means he left it here and whats inside tells me who he is he searched the closet it stood empty except for a hooded sweatshirt a raincoat an umbrella a sealed cardboard moving box marked misc and a box of spare office supplies he peered under her desk empty there werent that many places to stash a large briefcase he went through the office methodically telling himself he should leave he wasnt a private investigator he wasnt the barradas spy anymore i dont think shed appreciate you being here andy said miles paid him no attention no sign of the briefcase now it was more interesting now it was an item sorenson didnt want found but hed run out of hiding places the phone rang he let it ring five rings and then allisons voicegreeting on the machine simply asking the caller to leave a message a womans quiet voice came on hi allison its celeste brent um the medicine you gave me last week seems to have vanished the white pills and i guess i need to get a replacement pause but he could still hear the woman breathing into the line and im not really comfortable keeping secrets for you its nothing personal i think were just crossing a line that we shouldnt so please dont put me in that position again if im being a bitch im really sorry call me and well talk the woman hung up celeste brent the name sounded vaguely familiar but he couldnt place it the fact that the name was familiar bothered him hed have to be sure and find out who she was then he heard a voice in the hallway heard the key slide back into the lock he stepped into the closet eased the door closed so he could see a sliver of the office and heard the door open then shut the thought of allison catching him here made his chest nearly burst with shame but sorenson hurried past the two chairs where allison always sat with miles into her office he couldnt see sorenson but he heard the creak of a chair he heard fingers tapping on a computer keyboard for several minutes miles stayed still careful to breathe silently through his nose a panic surging up and down his spine jesus what if sorenson stayed here until miles was supposed to meet allison the thought made his legs ache his mouth wither dry the typing stopped he heard sorenson say apparently into a phone the actions loaded dodd doesnt know a laugh a pause tonight yes her house no problem then silence miles strained to hear what did that mean who was dodd the silence was awful he imagined sorenson walking straight to the closet then he saw a flash of sorensons blazer crossing the narrow viewpoint then the rattle of a file cabinet opening a few seconds pause then the file cabinet closed with a slam he heard the click of a lock engaging in the cabinet then feet crossing the floor the office door opening shutting locking again miles remained perfectly still frozen he counted to three hundred then he counted it again slowly he unfolded himself from the closet hands shaking he inspected the file cabinet he could pick the lock but no he couldnt peruse her patient files too much of a betrayal he unlocked the door he relocked the office door and left pocketing the lockpick he glanced up and down the street no sign of sorenson nothing made sense sorenson mucking about on her computer going through her files hiding a briefcase in her office he hurried back down palace toward the plaza he dug his cell phone out of his pocket and tried allisons number again allison he said when she answered yes michael please tell me whats going on what trouble are you in she didnt answer right away and he heard the rumble of an engine it sounded as though she was in a car can you come at seven yes i can explain then before sorenson comes at eight he risked a shot across her bow is sorenson really a doctor an awkward laugh very good no hes not why did you lie to me because i didnt want him to know that you could help me who is he is he threatening you ill tell you all tonight i cant talk now hes planning something tonight at your home a pause how do you know a tinge of shock in her tone he decided to wait see her face to face i just know im i was an investigator i find out things is that how youve spent today investigating she sounded surprised yes i used to be good at it i dont doubt it at all i know i can trust you come at seven and i can explain it all all right allison whos dodd but she had hung up he tried her phone again no answer as he walked the wind began to gust and the air carried the raw scent of storm he ran up the stairs to his apartment the rooms were too warm he opened a window a couple of inches let in the chilly air witsec had offered to rent a house for him but a house meant too much space and quiet too much room for andy to roam free exhausted from his close call he collapsed onto the bed he read allisons note again he shook one of the pills from the bottle into his palm a tiny white slug of a capsule hed decided against taking one after the flashback in joys office not wanting to talk with deshawn while medicated the pill was light as a feather he fingered the capsule the casing dented under his fingernail pushed harder the dent went deep he pulled apart the two halves of the capsule empty shed given him a vial of fake pills odd on top of odd he lay down on the bed contemplating the ceiling the burden of responsibility of helping her of making a decision to do rather than just to be pressed on him the lack of sleep from the night before restless and frantic as he considered writing the confession made his eyes hurt what if he couldnt help her if he was unequal to the task he touched the confession in his pocket and closed his eyes to try to think seven does it work groote asked he nearly held his breath and thought this is it amanda heres the miracle that saves you and makes you all right again he had flown out from orange county to albuquerque then sped the hour north to santa fe his exhaustion from the long night of waiting to kill the accountant evaporated does it really work and in the hospital conference room doctor leland hurley smiled at him and his hopes and his question hurley started talking again about lessening the vivid emotional toll of the most horrifying of memories rattling off a glossary of brain chemicals epinephrine propanolol super betablockers adrenergic receptors hurley spoke of giving patients back their normal lives and all groote could think was does it work does it work does it work doctor hurley gestured at the elevator lets go to the top floor the top floor meant frost the medicine most of the patients were in their rooms after an early dinner small but comfortable cubbyholes at the end of the floors main hallway stood an expansive group room where they could talk and gather heres a treat you wont see every day hurley said leading groote through a door that read virtual reality treatment quiet please the room was dark separated in half by a glass screen a jumble of computers loading the walls a young man on the other side of the glass dangled by four elastic cables from the ceiling a strange helmet covered his eyes and ears he wore a tight white bodysuit webbed with wire and tiny gadgets that groote guessed were recording heartbeat breathing and other functions the patient hung almost motionless jerking now and then as he reacted to the scenes playing out of the goggles on a screen what appeared to be a computeranimated movie showed a darkened alleyway wet with rain three men walking close one held a chain the other a blade what are those scenes groote asked we recreate their traumas for them hurley said with a thin knife of a grin we do extensive research and interviews to get the details of their individual traumas then we construct a computergenerated scenario that matches those details we watch it onscreen he sees it on the goggles as though hes immersed in the scene you see its like a rough cut of a video game except its tailor made to help them face their worst fears it helps those who arent yet willing to talk consistently about their experiences process the memories so they can discuss them and the medicine frost can weaken the bad memories this subject was attacked and nearly murdered in a vicious gang mugging in washington so hes experiencing a recreation of the mugging virtual reality groote said but its not required for the medicine to work right for us it serves as camouflage for frost every patient here believes theyre testing the effectiveness of the virtualreality treatment they dont know theyre being dosed with frost groote frowned they dont know theyre test subjects no we couldnt let them know its important we not publicize the research since well be selling it to a pharmaceutical thatll claim the research for their own the young man jerked against the suspension cables started to gasp and plead for help as on the screen the computergenerated thugs attacked him with chains and knives a technician sitting on the same side of the glass as groote and hurley spoke quietly to the patient through a microphone reassuring him i understand your stepdaughter suffered an interesting trauma interesting nice word this guy was a labrat freak daughter i adopted her she and her mother were driving on a canyon road when another car fired shots at them and drove them off the road they were pinned in the wreckage my wife died a few hours later my daughter lay trapped in the car with her mothers body for another thirtysix hours before they were found tightness filled his chest he was surprised at himself sharing his familys horror with a nearstranger but he knew this was it clear and present hope for amanda the promise of a future for her beyond tiled hallways and sedatives and twentyfourhour care the doctors havent been able to help her she tries to hurt herself her brain is dealing with this constant recalling of the traumatic memory the memory strengthens and so does the trauma associated with it the nightmares the fear the paranoia hurley said in your daughters case everything becomes a reaction to the power of the memory i suspect shes afraid to ride in a car or thinking of her mother sends her into a dissociative state where she flashes back to the trauma itself or she hurts herself because she believes she should have died with your wife yes groote said hurley pointed at the man in the virtualreality chamber most of the research about dulling the traumatic memory we cant wipe a memory out after all has revolved around introducing beta blockers to the patient which help keep the memory from forming when we have a frightening experience our brains activate stress hormones neurotransmitters and peripheral betareceptors i call the whole mix fear juice hurley smiled those chemicals enhance the memory of the traumatic event conceivably we can interfere right away with the formation of a traumatic memory if we introduce betaadrenergic antagonists such as a beta blocker called propanolol so the memory of the trauma never gets the power of the fear juice to put it simply groote nodded i did take chemistry in college i can handle a technical explanation hurley smiled as if he didnt believe him of course a traumatic memory consolidates in regions across our brain it doesnt just exist in one set of brain cells that we can zap away but the moments when the patient recalls the memory as our boy is doing right now are also the moments when the memory is at its most chemically fragile its the best opportunity to weaken the memory make its impact less debilitating you pull the memory up out of the bed of your brain its like loosening a rose from its bed of soil if you dont treat the memory it takes root again harder and deeper but if you chemically weaken the memory after its pulled up you can strip the thorns so to speak the problem was with earlier experiments you had to introduce the beta blockers very soon after the trauma there was nothing to help those suffering from longterm trauma until frost its a cocktail well a combination sounds better of drugs that combines several approaches a synthetic super betablocker to undermine the fear juice and powerful new brain enzyme blockers to keep the fearful memories from getting their thorns back on the screens one of the animated attackers delivered a vicious kick to the mans chest held a knife to his throat the patient stayed still in the cables tilted his head as though a scene only mildly interesting were playing out of the screen youre saying frost could let this guy eventually forget this attack not entirely but frost strips the trauma of the attack keeps the fearful memory from strengthening frost can make his memory of being beaten almost to death toothless so that the recall of it produces no effects of posttraumatic stress disorder hurley tapped a pen against his bottom lip grinned with pride this man suffered his trauma two years ago four months ago seeing the computergenerated recreation practically drove him into a dissociative state but now after treatment with frost his heartbeats slightly elevated hes nervous but not frightened its a cure hurley grinned it works as long as its used in combination with therapy that brings back the traumatic memory such as our virtualreality room or regular psychiatric therapy while medicated with frost come with me groote followed him out of the vr room and down the hall to hurleys cluttered office hurley sat down at his desk and tapped on the computer keyboard all fortysix patients dosed with frost were suffering from severe ptsd with extreme flashbacks pronounced anxieties and often maladaptive behavior all of them have shown steady improvement in the lessening of their trauma through usage of the memory drug when compared with the control group of fortysix patients who got a sugar pill a small sample but enough to interest the pharmas in our sale and this allison vance knows about the program she doesnt know about frost only the vr side of the project here but i believe shes gotten suspicious about whether were dosing the patients i caught her trying to take a blood sample from the lab she said she thought the patient might be hiv positive and that we should get it tested thats not completely implausible it suggested to me she thought there was a story hiding in the blood samples hurley said if she got hold of frost or she knew about the auction of our research to the drug manufacturers she could make trouble the drug companies wouldnt develop this themselves think how many ads for drugs you see their marketing budgets are much more than their researchanddevelopment budgets well make a mint so will they hurley turned back to the computer groote crossed his arms whered quantrill get frost i dont know he steal it hes a thief even if you put a fancy consultant title on him hurley didnt answer groote leaned forward heres my theory he doesnt want the drug companies to know where he got frost from does he i couldnt say mr groote why have allison vance involved shes fairly new to town not plugged in to the local psychiatric community she keeps to herself i needed a doctor to handle assessments she was affordable and efficient patients liked her she could sneak out a frost sample and get it tested i administer all the doses none are missing how do you check them counts are these solid capsules could she replace any with fakes hurleys face grew red youre giving her far too much credit she wouldnt resort to thievery shed simply call the authorities if she had a concern so we buy her off if she raises a stink allisons not the type much motivated by money shes altruistic always blathering on about how the patients come first why not just bring her in sit her down and question her hurley gave a nervous laugh im not a strongarm type of guy thats why youre here but she hasnt run to the authorities about your setup allison would never make a sudden or illplaced accusation spend five minutes with her and you can see shes simply a careful person as most psychiatrists are you can see how she is we have videos of her interviewing the patients he unlocked a desk drawer opened it froze whats the matter groote asked i have backup dvds of all our research i keep them in here theyre gone frost gone the tightness came back to grootes chest but theyre only backups you have the originals on the hard drive thats not the point if allison wanted to expose us shes got the proof on those dvds maybe you simply misplaced them no i do a daily backup here lock them up tight i have the only key hurleys voice rose in panic is allison here now hurley moused and clicked on his computer screen a video window opened to show the three entrance and exit points from the hospital it also displayed a log that recorded the usage of the staffs electronic passkeys no shes not where might i find her probably at her office on palace avenue close to the plaza how long ago did she leave hurley clicked on the keyboard two of the video windows stayed open one showing allison vance walking out of the building according to the timer at ten that morning the other video showed a young man in patient scrubs glancing over his shoulder heading out a door the timer read ten minutes ago whos that guy groote asked a patient nathan ruiz what the hells he doing with a passkey its showing him because the key hes using is the same code as allisons the guards must not have seen him leave groote drew his sidearm from under his jacket i dont know how he got past the doors up here hurley said hes the thief not this guy hes a total fuckup and the patients dont know about frost hurley said ill handle him you find allison and see if she has those files its not the end of the world right you still have the original research hurleys tone was tight and frantic as he started to head down the hall groote following him dont be an idiot whoever took the research they could give frost to the fda and blow us out of the water no medicine for us to sell he shook his head no medicine for your kid groote bolted past him eight thunder boomed and miles opened his eyes sweaty sour mouthed jerking away from the fading dream of andy pulling a gun from the back of his pants as miles tried to say dont dont dont of andy collapsing on the greasespattered concrete miles collapsing across from him the floor dusty against his cheek he blinked again night had slid into the room he read the soft gleam of his clock six fiftyeight hed be late to meet allison he grabbed his coat and ran out into the cold drizzle he ran down two streets then across the plaza then up palace avenue the rain faded to a mist and he could see the lights aglow inside her office allison still waiting for him miles ran into the parking lot and he spotted allisons bmw parked at the back of the lot then as he turned his face toward the building the blast cracked the world and slapped him backward through the mist hitting the pavement shouldersfirst the afterimage of the explosion a fiery blot against his eyes he threw his arm up over his face and heat hooked into his pants his stomach he rolled over once wriggling knocking the burning debris away from his clothes he staggered to his feet the buildings front collapsed but he heard nothing but an awful ringing in his ears flames burst from allisons building a fiery fist raised toward the sky he ran into the wall of broiling air surrounding her building he retreated with a low moan humming in his throat where her office had been rightside front a heart of hell burned miles stood numb in shock sirens wailed as two fire engines pulled close in the street pain began to creep along his arms his hands he probed at the blood on his skin and his hair felt it drying in the heat he stumbled backward dug out his cell phone punched in her pager number frantically keyed his number for a reply thinking shes not here maybe she walked to dinner because i was late he tried her cell phone just voice mail another fire truck roared to a stop the fighters moving into position with practiced speed and grace water jetting quickly from their hoses a perfume of destruction drifting through the raincleaned air miles dodged the firefighters went back across the street sat down on the curb among the crowd that had poured out of the posada and along the street he heard a firefighter ask a kid in a posada valet uniform what had happened the kid said gas explosion man big huge boom not a gas explosion miles thought with horror as the shock cleared his head no sorenson he carried a case into her office a case i didnt find the actions loaded he had said a bomb jesus he planted a freaking bomb in her office and i didnt find it when i could have this is my fault my fault my fault sir miles raised his head another firefighter stood over him you okay youre injured no im okay i was walking he almost said to but he caught himself past the building suddenly it just blew youre cut come with me miles followed the paramedic shuffling the office building shuddered again fire tearing upward through the remnants of roof now spouting fresh flame into the sky a tremendous crash sounded as the broken innards of the building collapsed he thought of the refurbishment going on inside the solvents the paint the lumber all fueling the inferno a crowd from the residential streets nearby from the church from the hotels formed and he walked through the mass of people searching for her face listening for her voice i need your help im in real trouble see you at seven he had failed her sorenson sorenson had done this what else had he said tonight yes her house no problem her house he stopped following the paramedic toward an ambulance he cut back through the crowd he walked away unable to look at the fire no one stopped him as he left miles half walked half ran to allisons house ignoring the pain in his scraped hands the ringing in his ears the trickle of blood winding down his neck you should have died with her andy said running alongside him shut up miles said throwing a punch toward andy who sidestepped miless fist laughing miles kept running her home lay up the long curve of cerro gordo on the far east side of the city up a hill thick with chimisa and pinon cerro gordo cut through the side of the climbing terrain lined with adobe homes and stretches of scrub the road went from paved to unpaved the thunderstorm now more rumble than rain wandered to the east the clouds hung low and gray darkening the mountains shrouds for the day he shouldnt know where she lived she would have understandably considered it an intrusion he had not followed her or found her in the phone book she was unlisted but once she was leaving after their session and when they walked out of the building a bill tucked in the side of her purse fell he picked it up and gave it to her but saw the address and hed trained himself in his earlier life to memorize addresses account numbers phone numbers with a single glance he had walked by her house only once when he knew she was at her office just so he would know the route because he feared if andy got too loud too insistent that if andy slipped a gun into miless hand guided it toward his temple or his mouth he would need her and not find her by pager or phone before andy squeezed the trigger he needed to know where to run for help off cerro gordo private driveways split from the main road and snaked farther into the hills he took the driveway for the group of five houses that included hers ignoring the no trespassing sign walking past the open adobe gate hers was the second house the road stood empty gravel lined with scrub he hurried past the first house its windows black her house stood dark no car in the driveway he ran to the front door he gently tested the doorknob locked the house remained still shes gone andy said from the adobe wall that lined her driveway gone gone gone miles hurried to the rear of the house following a stone path he squatted down to study the lock no dead bolt shot if an alarm system wailed he would melt back into the night miles tested the knob first the back door swung open as he pushed he eased inside shut the door behind him he stood in her bedroom in the dim glow from a bathroom light he saw the rooms details wicker furniture painted a soft rose a turquoise throw rug with twisted geometric patterns a bookcase filled with worn paperbacks a queensize sleigh bed a bureau with a mirror crowning it the mirror was cracked from side to side in a single fracture and two of himself stood in the bedroom he walked into a kitchen dishes were stacked in the sink a forgotten glass stood on the tile countertop a swallow of soda puddled at the bottom next to it a container of aluminum wrap lay open a strip of foil dangling free in a jagged tear as though shed just stepped away to run an errand or answer the phone he went through the kitchen and into her den the barrel of a gun eased against the back of his head freeze a voice hissed nine her office is gone groote yelled into his phone he stood at the end of palace avenue watching the burning building gone hurley spoke as if he didnt understand the word destroyed burning like a goddamned torch groote said theres a crowd i heard people say thered been an explosion hed driven down from the hospital to vances office stopped as the traffic snarl formed left his car when he saw her building consumed in flames and smoke what the hell is going on i dont know i dont understand he sounded dazed allisons office is on fire someones screwing us over hard groote said and screwing with medicine that could help my kid and god help them when i find them this isnt coincidence a patient allison vance worked with breaks loose and her office gets incinerated did you find the guy no his name is ruiz hes violent dangerous christ groote thought hed been in town barely an hour and the entire operation hed been sent here to protect was collapsing i suppose we cant call the cops um wed prefer not to hurley cleared his throat if allisons dead hopefully the research files were blown up with her that means we cant be exposed i dont like it groote said suppose she wasnt at her office where does allison live ten hands on top of head palms up the voice ordered now asshole i understand miles said no problem calm down he tensed his arms his legs thinking he gets his arm close i can yank the gun past my head before he reacts but if allison was a captive fighting might endanger her and he couldnt escape and leave her behind allison he yelled on your knees prisoner the voice ordered prisoner miles sank to the brick floor thinking some head shots are survivable but not where he has the gun right in my temple he knew how much it hurt to be shot the blinding pain fingers probed for his wallet michael raymond the voice said yeah youll give complete answers to every question trying to sound commanding but the tone betrayed inexperience hes just as scared as i am but scared was not good scared meant nerves pulled tauter than wire with a finger tightening on a trigger of a gun aimed at miless head he forced calm into his voice im looking for allison vance put the gun down you with the other guy other guy the first guy who came i dont know what you mean hands hauled miles to his feet steered him into the bathroom sorenson lay in the tub a wicked bloody bruise on the side of his head his feet and arms bound with a sheet miles could see sorenson breathing shallowly he was unconscious this man blew up allisons office miles said what her office is burning down youre lying no its the truth im a patient of hers i had an appointment with her tonight i can prove it put the gun down please youre not even a good liar her patients are all at sangriaville whats sangriaville the voice ignored him you said her office was burning look at my face my hands i was in her office parking lot there was an explosion no sharp short shot with shock no no no she was in trouble she asked me for help this guy was in her office earlier today i think he planted a bomb why is he here the voice trembled he came in the back door i hit him he was emptyhanded if hes blown up her office why not her house too miles thought yes let me wake him up get away from him the guy pulled miles away from the bathroom shoved him hard onto the tile of the den floor leave him alone i dont need to be outnumbered what have you done to allison nothing miles kept his voice steady and calm her office burning isnt the kind of lie that works for long im not sure you can see from here but if you walk down cerro gordo you can see the glow from the fire the mans hand shook making the gun against miless head tremble keep him calm miles thought stand up the voice ordered and miles got to his feet the man pushed him along keeping the barrel of the gun nestled in miless hair miles pushed open the drapes opened the balcony window which faced onto the sideways spill of the hillside down to cerro gordo in the quiet the sound of sirens carried on the wind the man behind him made a choked noise in his throat they got to her they killed her whos they sorenson silence from the man the barrel of the gun pressed hard against his scalp as though a decision had been reached miless guts turned to water i promised to help her he said i have a note from her asking for my help sure right pocket pill bottle read it for yourself i can read it once youre dead then youll have made a terrible mistake the guy jammed the barrel hard against miless ear found the vial popped it open read the note in the dim light that bled in from the bedroom its her handwriting miles said seconds stretched into eternity miles waited for the shot finally the guy said allison was at her office tonight she told me to wait for her she would be here soon okay then were on the same side miles found his voice take the gun off me please no one can know i was here theyll stick me back on the top floor i wont tell miles said unsure of what the man meant i promise put the gun down i can help you hide you youre nothing im a certified hero you understand me absolutely you sound like a tough and smart guy i need your help if were going to catch whoever hurt allison miles said you already took out sorenson and i think hes the bad guy lets make him talk unless you killed her and the guy in the tubs the good guy and youre not how do i know but i have the note and he doesnt miles said the guy considered you said youre a patient whats the matter with you nothing much his standard answer given before he could think the gun stayed close to his skull define much tell me how crazy you are he prodded miless temple with the gun a dead guy follows me around miles said i killed him by accident i didnt mean to but i cant shake him im not crazy the voice said with pride not at all not anymore they fixed me the guns barrel came off miless head im better than you im made of iron now miles lashed out hard with his hand caught the guy solid in the chest he stumbled back and miles tackled him low hit him hard in the guts twice the guy bent in half collapsed miles pried the gun from the guys hands stepped back keeping the beretta trained on him miles fumbled for a lamp flicked it on the gunman was just a kid in his early twenties his hair was military short a dark burr a face crafted of angles sharp nose razors for cheekbones a pointed jaw two light patches of scarring scored his cheeks the bridge of his nose bent slightly from an old break he gasped for breath glared at miles with dark scared eyes miles aimed the gun at the kids legs he hadnt held a gun since he shot andy his hand started to quiver and he steadied the gun with a double grip he concentrated on the weight of the steel in his palm heard andys snicker behind him goddamn the kid said are you going to cry deep breath stand up hands on top of head miles said his voice cracked like a teenagers he couldnt freak now he couldnt lose it now the kid obeyed swallowing in air a step at a time miles patted down his pockets and jacket the kid wore jeans and a denim jacket that still had the store tags on them he wore slipon sneakers navycolored no wallet no money in his pockets no other weapon a bracelet id the kind used at a hospital miles stepped back kept the gun level take off the bracelet toss it to me the kid with humiliation hot in his eyes wrenched the bracelet free and threw it at miless face miles caught the bracelet it read ruiz nathan carried a ninedigit number on it the term frostc shoot him if you want andy said from the corner of the room build yourself an entourage shut up miles said i didnt say nothing nathan ruiz said his breath back in his lungs man you better shoot me now because ill kill you when i get the chance youre a very angry person miles lowered the gun aimed it away from the kid ejected the clip cycled the round out of the chamber he put the clip and the bullet into his pocket now his voice sounded calm that was stupid the kid said you should have killed me you dont want to piss me off hot hard fury was in his eyes but a waver in his voice hid behind the bravado and he didnt charge at miles im not going to shoot you and youre not going to shoot me youre her patient too i think he stepped back bumped a coffee table moved around it he noticed a lipstickred cell phone sitting on the table i went through his pockets nathan jerked his head at the bathroom he had allisons phone that didnt bode well miles jiggled the broken bracelet whats frost i dont know i dont sit around pondering the meaning of my id bracelet but miles didnt believe him the kids gaze returned to the floor why are you waiting for allison in the dark with a gun no answer i can haul your ass straight down to the police nathan i took it from that guy you said his name was sorenson hit him over the head when he came in the back door now he stretched an empty hand toward miles give me the gun and the clip back and well part ways no were going to talk to sorenson together find out what he did to allison then they heard a click from the front door lock not a key sliding into it a pick working the mechanism miles knew the subtle difference in the whisper of metal forcing metal someone was breaking into the house eleven allison nathan turned toward the door its not her miles said jesus hed unloaded the gun that was stupid he knocked over the lamp fumbled for the clip in his pocket get in the back bedroom lock the back door nathan ruiz muttered the guards cant find me they cant know she helped me he spun on his heels ran out onto the balcony jumped over the railing miles grabbed at him and missed ruiz tumbled fifteen feet landed in dirt and gravel slid into the pinon trees scrambled down the hillside that led to cerro gordo making a panicky noisy escape the front door opened miles saw a tall figure in the spilled light from the toppled lamp male thickly built miles retreating against the railing saw a gun tracking his path miles vaulted off the balcony he heard the awful vroot of the silencer the heat of the warped bullet passed above his shoulders jetted near his scalp he screamed he landed twisted into the gravel tumbled down against a pinon trunk wrenched himself free he sat on his butt and skidded down the rest of the way down from the private driveway and the house onto the unpaved stretch of cerro gordo he heard the sound of a second muffled shot in the blackness above his head to his left feet pounded gravel nathan panting as he ran follow him and maybe they catch you both so miles bolted to the right running hard and clean zigzagging on the darkened road he heard a pursuer following him off the balcony sliding down the pebbled slope to his left lay a patchwork of houses yards undeveloped land he jumped over an adobe wall fell down into a side yard ran past a kitchen window where light gleamed and children pleaded for chocolate ice cream for dessert over another fence down a strip of driveway the sound of his pursuer drawing closer miles vaulted over a few more fences then he ran into an open stretch of darkness armijo park hed noticed it on the hike up cerro gordo flat plenty of room for dogs to frolic kids to run and play tag and football he ran across the parking lot caught his leg on a chain that fenced the park sprawled on the grass he could hear the pursuer and now a searchlight sparked from an approaching car sweeping across the park he got up and ran hard not in a straight line trying to dodge the circle of light that hunted him past the fence past the playground past the swings and slides the clouds covered the sky and the gurgle of the santa fe river rose in the breeze usually the river ran dry or with the barest trickle but now it surged with the recent heavy rains and snowmelt get across the river hide in the neighborhood hunker down then his shoes hit the smooth glass of polished stone and he remembered the river still had to be across the street and below him at least fifty feet and he skidded into empty air dead dead in a straight drop to rocks and then he crashed through a web of tree limbs he grabbed at a cottonwood branch that smacked hard into his back missed fell hit another one rolled along its edge arms flailing fell again thinking in a crazy jag thisll smash out my brains and ill be fixed but the next branch caught his weight held then cracked with a slow groan and he let his weight slide down the creaking bough listened no sound of a man still giving chase the spotlight danced above him a car driving into the park itself searching hunting him he scissored his legs out over empty air the branch snapped again he let go the land rose in a sharp shift and miles hit the ground after a tenfoot drop that jarred his ankles sent him sliding his legs caught a cactus the spines needling through his thin khakis and he howled but he stumbled to his feet navigated through a maze of trees and saw a car driving by its headlights painting the night east alameda he ran out onto the road eased himself down the shallow bank forged the thread of river in a few steps the cold water soothing against his treeandrockscored hands he clambered up the side of the bank glancing over his shoulder no gunman no police car nobody across the street the river up the hill the spotlight winked out like a giants eye closing he wandered into the riverside neighborhood and ran through the spiderweb of streets a dim orange glowed against the cloud bottoms to his right allisons office or the building next to it still burning you still got the gun andy asked him walking beside him unruffled he groped along his belt no the beretta was gone lost in the tumbles hed taken but jammed deep in his jacket pocket he touched the crumpled confession hed written for allison losing the guns for the best andy said it would make my killing you a lot easier what now miles didnt answer he walked steering clear of palace and the fire engines he could smell the smoke on the wind he stumbled across the empty plaza santa fe rolled up early most nights and along the side streets until he reached his rooms he washed his hands and face clean of dirt sprayed antibacterial lotion on his palms and on his cheek the bleeding from his head had stopped clotted in his hair he dumped his wet clothes in a pile extracted a trio of cactus spines from his leg he sat on the edge of the bed wondered what sangriaville meant who was nathan ruiz who was the man who had tried to kill him why sorenson had come to allisons house and tried not to imagine allison vanishing in a ball of flame the red cell phone on the table hers hed seen her use it before shed left it at her house he tried her cell phone again two rings the phone clicked on but silence hello miles whispered then against all hope allison you and i both know shes not here a mans voice low gravelly where is allison all burned up i think you know that mister because i think you and ruiz were part of her plan i dont know what the hell you mean i heard your voice the voice said on the other side of allisons door so dont pretend you werent the asshole with ruiz that ran away from me miles sat on the bed okay i wont pretend who are you i dont like names did you kill her do you work with sorenson i dont know who the hell that is youre lying miles said but the voice talked over him allison took property of mine and i doubt it coincidentally got blown up with her ill pay you for the research we can reach a deal but youre going to give it back or youre dead miles counted to ten thinking trying to figure out how to play the shooter i cant give you what she took if i dont know what exactly it is a long silence listen you stupid bastard i dont believe you were an innocent bystander at allisons house tonight you and ruiz youre in on it with her and youre going to return frost or im going to kill you simple frost the same word on ruizs bracelet the man in her tub sorenson i think he hid a bomb in her office today i dont know anything else a pause and miles could hear the mans heavy footsteps on tile what man in what tub theres a guy in her tub knocked out a pause theres a bunch of sheets wadded up on the floor and thats all sorenson must have escaped between the time the shooting started and when the shooter returned to allisons house presumably to search for whatever this frost was shes dead you cant sell the research i told you ill pay you last chance the shooter said you want answers tell this guy youve got what he wants draw him out catch him you couldnt save allison but you can find out what the hell happened to her except if he did that he was drawing a giant bullseye on his back and an attack could come from any direction miles closed his eyes i dont have frost but i might know where you can get it where not now ill have to be in touch with you later there is no later you got right now you tell me what you know im going to let you live you dont even know who i am i know what you are greedy stupid in over your head listen jackass i hunt for a living ill find you i promise miles kept his voice steady you give me a number to reach you at and ill call with frost when i have it unacceptable i made you a onetime offer youre declining suffer the consequences asshole a cold rage gripped miless chest stomach throat ill make you suffer instead when the shooter spoke his voice was barely a whisper when im done with you youre going to think having your face ripped off is a walk in the goddamned park and the shooter hung up miles closed his eyes saw the house burning him late for the most important appointment of his life allison dead and gone she asked you for help and you failed her he had failed her failed her as he had failed andy i was supposed to save you hed wasted his time with her parrying her therapy playing smart guy never letting her within distance of the truth when all shed wanted to do was help he felt her absence in the world like a hole punched into his chest but he didnt have to curl up in a ball he could make the people who had killed her pay he got up from the bed weighed his options ruiz had the shooter and his people with the searchlights caught ruiz nathan ruiz knew his name was michael raymond now or worse maybe his cellphone number had appeared on allisons cell it gave the shooter roads to finding him the apartment was rented to michael raymond and the shooter could trace the billing address of the number to this apartment he couldnt stay here but he couldnt run again he couldnt fail allison again the man thought miles had something allison had stolen why what was frost this involved sorenson clearly hed shown up at allisons house after the blast presumably hunting for frost as well but all that mattered right now was getting the hell out of here and hiding before the shooter came calling miles grabbed a bag of clothes called deshawns number got no answer he tried to calm his thoughts decide what he was going to say he had to hide from the shooter but at the same time he couldnt let witsec move him from santa fe if that happened he could never nail the shooter nail sorenson nail ruiz whoever had killed allison is that the idea andy said sitting on his bed avenge her a charming concept and youre well adjusted again and i vanish youre kidding yourself miles you and i are a team forever miles took his bag and walked alone in the dark to a modest motel off cerillos that catered to starving artists and hikers the clerk didnt ask for id when he put an extra twenty on top of the nights rent the room was plain but clean he lay down on the bed and switched on the tv the local news was all about the terrible explosion in santa fe the fire was out firefighters had found badly burned remains in the rubble the deceased had not yet been identified but investigators believed it was the body of the woman who rented the office space a psychiatrist the reporter standing before the fire trucks and the ruined shell of the building said investigators were not ready to comment on the cause of the explosion the deceased allison was dead and gone and in the smokekissed night beyond the grimy window was the lying sorenson and a shooter determined to kill and a screwedup kid named nathan ruiz and they held the answers he needed now all he had to do was find them without getting killed its going to be fun seeing you lose it all again andy said twelve groote ordered the two security guards to dump the kid on the bed fasten the restraints to his arms and then to the railings then told them to get out they left and shut the door behind them he clicked the call log back open from allisons cell phone that hed taken from her home a cellphone number from the man who had called coded in allisons cell phone as mr mr was the walking dead he tucked the phone back in his pocket and dumped a pitcher of water on the kid nathan ruiz sputtered to consciousness with a jerk hi groote said youve had a field trip tonight i i youre at a loss for words probably because you were expecting to see doctor hurley well hes not suited for this kind of therapy nathan groote sat down next to him he lit a cigarette although he hadnt smoked in ten years puffed deep enough for the fire to catch hard blew the smoke without a cough its just going to be you and me nathan blinked youre back where you belong groote tapped his own temple youre not getting out again he let five seconds drip by and said your friend took off without you guess he didnt care who his initials are mr you give me the rest of his name were cool you and i cool is good he held up the smoldering cigarette hot is not the boys expression hardened past the grogginess groote could see him summoning up what stray courage remained in his gut i dont know his name groote jammed the cigarette into nathans wrist nathan screamed groote withdrew ill do the other wrist then ill do your tongue then your eyes itll be incredibly gross he thought please dont make me burn you bad whats mrs name i really dont know who he is he wasnt supposed to be there groote decided to deal the boy a bit of rope then who was supposed to be there allison nathan gritted his teeth against the pain she gave me a passkey to get past the door told me to meet her at her house and do what he leaned back as though getting comfortable for their nice chat leave here why she said i shouldnt be at sangriaville anymore your insurance hasnt expired nathan so why did she want you to check yourself out she said doctor hurley wanted to kill me gosh nathan and he only speaks highly of you i dont know anything else fear clenched his eyes shut groote considered put himself in allisons shoes you suspect illegal drug testing you steal the research as evidence but you also want a patient whos been guineapigged as a showandtell for the fda given that wouldnt you concoct a better scheme to get him out of the hospital no not if you were pressed for time if you knew quantrill was ready to move on frost shut the operation down now that the testing was complete wheres frost nathan frost allison took some dvds the kind you use in a computer to store big files they had information on them for a project called frost tell me where those dvds are i dont know i just did what she told me please dont hurt me no more oh i dont want to nathan seriously but i have a problem those dvds allison took theyre not in her house could be they blew up with her at her office but its awfully convenient you see and i dont believe in that convenient a world she takes something of great value she gets obliterated and then theres a group hug at her house it changes the equation he smiled at nathan i read your file while you were napping youre quite a special case tin soldier maybe you made allison go boomboom nathan shook his head in horror no man i wouldnt i couldnt ever you tell me what happened from when you ran groote rotated the cigarette in his fingers studied the smoke reheated the tip with a deep drag she left an electronic passkey for me told me to run at sixthirty told me how to get to her house she left a change of clothes for me she had told me to sit and wait in her bedroom until she came in but there was a big mirror in there i dont like mirrors dont do mirrors no mirrors you may like them less when im done groote said quietly nathan kept on so i went into the den stood near a window so i could see her come but a man came he drove up past her house left his car came back down no sign of allison i got scared he came in and i hit him on the head with this indian carving she kept on the mantel i tied him up with sheets and dumped him in the tub i didnt know what else to do i figured allison would tell me groote frowned that matched mrs story he wasnt there when we found you nathan who was he the other guy said the first guys name was sorenson the name meant nothing to groote and you had no idea who the other guy was no but him you didnt crack on the head him you didnt tie up why so nice to him nathan i wanted him to talk tell me what was happening did he no he didnt know he said allisons office was bombed groote considered it bothered him deeply that an apparent bomb had killed allison vance bombs were not built on a whim bombs were complicated and technical and a pain in the ass guns and knives and rope were far easier ways to accomplish the goal of shutting up one person bombs meant resources expertise time to plan bombs meant an enemy who might blow grootes ass out of the water i i dont think this guy you want killed her nathan said i dont have a lot of suspects that sorenson guy could just be a story you and your friend hatched to throw salt on the trail if either of you got caught no nathan i think mrs the answer to my prayers i dont know anything about mr im sorry i dont groote dropped the lit cigarette at the bottom of the water pitcher it hissed and died im sorry nathan but cigarettes are too slow he pulled the screwdriver from his pocket held it up so nathan could see you need the right tools for the right job please please dont custommade for me in hungary precisely balanced i keep the edge cleaner than an angels ass i dont know him i cant tell you i bet you liked word problems in math class i mean launching missiles and shit in the army you must have gotten at least a c in geometry word problems nathan trembling shook his head if youve got an inch of flesh covering your bones and the screwdriver can penetrate two centimeters at a blow how long before the screwdriver reaches bone i threw in the metric angle because i know youre just a mathematical genius nathan fought the restraints please dont dont dont dont well sure nathan i wont it doesnt have to be the hard way not one bit if you dont care for math he made his voice soft and intimate brought the screwdriver close to nathans wide eye lots of sick people need frost tin soldier you included someone i love included talk or i work out the word problem on your flesh and bones which is it i cant tell you what i dont know i respect your heroics truly groote gave nathan an affectionate pat on the cheek then he stabbed the screwdriver deep into nathans arm thirteen wednesday morning at am the cell phone rang next to miless head he came awake instantly panic settling in his guts trying to be fully aware before answering the phone and talking to the shooter hello where the hell are you deshawn sounded pissed i met a woman miles lied i spent the night at her place that allowed mommy i need you back at your apartment miles right now please whats wrong i got bad news ill pick you up where are you its not far ill walk and he hung up before deshawn could argue miles didnt want to go back to his place with the shooter likely to be tracking michael raymond but he couldnt act afraid to be at home deshawn would relocate his ass out of santa fe in ten seconds flat and no way he was leaving now miles washed his face changed into a clean shirt jeans and sneakers he left his duffel in the room and locked up hed head back here before the gallery opened and retrieve his stuff he walked back to the apartment but no shooters jumped out to blast flesh off his bones deshawns car wheeled over to him and miles got in doctor vance is dead deshawn said i saw it on the news this morning you okay im upset you understand miles this has anything to do with the barradas youre moved in five seconds it doesnt you sound very confident they wouldnt kill my shrink if they found me theyd kill me and probably not with a bomb off their own turf too hard to transport theyd just put bullets in my head you know anything about this tragedy miles no what happened to your face got into a fight last night man wooing and fighting you had quite an evening a tone of disbelief tinged his voice where are we going miles started to ask but then they were there deshawn inched the car past allisons burned building yellow firescene tape haloed the lot a group of firefighters were sifting the ashes toward the rear of the building a couple of news stations from albuquerque had parked their satellite wagons down from the wreckage a spill of people stood along the sidewalk gawking at the ruin the lot was empty allisons car towed away miles pointed at the firemen shaking a sifter ashes tumbling at their feet theyre searching for the doors lock to see if its locked or not a firefighter friend in miami told me its one of the first items of evidence they search for his voice sounded dead to him i heard on the news they found her do you think she suffered no miles she didnt there was very little left of doctor vance theyve only found um pieces im sure she died in the force of the blast she didnt burn to death miles put his face in his hands forced his emotions back under control he could have stopped it if hed found sorensons hidden case he missed it and she died oh goddamn ill miss her andy said from the backseat im sorry man i know you said shed been a great help to you deshawn put a hand on miless shoulder miles kept his voice neutral do they know what happened he was going to catch sorenson or whoever was ultimately responsible for allisons death and drag them in front of deshawn like a cat dropping a dead mouse at its masters feet i talked to the arson investigators they cant search the front of the building where the floors collapsed until they get heavy moving equipment in from albuquerque they got to do chemical tests see if it was a gas explosion or see if it was a bomb dont know yet they drove away from the burned hulk i have to ask again miles did she know you were in witness protection no i never told her i was going to but i didnt want her to know i was ashamed so her records no way they survived the blast and the fire and even if they did they couldnt disclose your witness status thats our numberone concern deshawn said not that my doctors murdered miles said really its nice yall care deshawn pulled the car over parked gave miles a hard stare do you know for a fact she was murdered i know this has nothing to do with the barradas but its got to do with something doesnt it miles you tell me another doctor who i cant find a record of wants to help allison with your therapy and that day shes dead i must have gotten his name wrong sorenstam sorengard i only met him for a minute allison said she used to work with him if the arson team finds this was deliberate youre answering their questions i understand how soon before they know well the investigators got to get deep into the building once its safe run those chemical tests check with the gas company to see if an undue amount of gas fed into the building but i think its got to be a gas leak all the renovations going on in that building a worker damaged a pipe started a leak why would anyone bomb a shrink in santa fe be a boy scout andy said from the backseat tell him nothing but the truth instead he wondered what else deshawn might say if miles didnt make a big deal out of the question is her house okay deshawn raised an eyebrow what do you mean okay i assume the police or the arson investigators have gone to her house to look for her yes it wasnt i dont know burglarized or anything he kept his gaze fixed on the window people rob dead peoples houses all the time miles what arent you telling me nothing i dont know why anyone would want to hurt her far as i know her house checked out just fine so the shooter had cleaned up before he left didnt want anyone unduly suspicious about what had happened at allisons house the shooter had talked about paying miles for research which he called by the name frost a code name miles guessed since it had also been inscribed on nathans medical bracelet research could be either big bulky files of paper or computer disks or both easily hidden but also easily found and moved miles said lets cut to the chase are you all going to move me he reckoned washington bureaucrats were at work figuring the calculus of his lifes worth wondering if moving him was warranted just because his doctor had died in an unusual way but he couldnt tread water and stay in the michael raymond life not if the shooter tracked him through nathans knowing his name or through the cell call he couldnt hide in his new life and he couldnt run not if theres no real chance your identity was disclosed but id feel better if we put you up at a hotel for a few days under a different name until the arson investigations done fine can i go to work now miles asked are you up for peddling art i know you cared about allison works the best thing for me right now but miles didnt mean updating the gallerys web site or moving sculptures i need dirty work he decided the kind i used to be good at bringing secrets to light the gallery was not yet open but joy was working the phone at a sales reps desk sweettalking a deal with a collector in boston she wiggled fingers at him in a friendly wave frowned at the scrapes on his face he gave her a thumbsup and suddenly wanted never to lose this job he unrolled the morning paper and scanned it nothing that deshawn hadnt already told him investigations continuing the building a loss remains recovered in such bad shape that dna testing would be required the article said allison had lived in santa fe only a few months longer than miles had it surprised him she didnt have deeper roots here he checked the police report section not a word about responding to any disturbances along cerro gordo maybe nathan had gotten away miles sat down at his desk fired up the management software that the gallery used to track sales contacts artists and works he sorted through a list of incoming paintings to process saw joys note to craft emails to three major collectors interested in one artists seventeen new paintings that the gallery had received late yesterday he needed to take digital photos of all the new paintings load them onto the web site and enter them into the system so they could be tracked then a schedule to rotate paintings hang selected new arrivals all landscapes and portraitures of the high desert ship the unsolds back to the artist or see if the staff could sell the works from the back room and joys new computer had arrived yesterday afternoon he needed to hook it into the network and load it up with software a long day but he had his own mission to perform joy hung up good morning what happened to you hon he touched his face its not an interesting story i figured you were going to say youd been out drinking with cinco she frowned did you hear about that fire over on palace yeah i did awful if you dont mind ill get your new computer set up first thing this morning it just may take more time to get it hooked into the network new operatingsystem protocols sweat showed its guilty face on his arm in his hair on his lip he really hated lying to her but no one could know what he was doing joys eyes glazed as soon as he said protocols well go do your voodoo okay he startled at the jingle of the back door joys son cinco holding a massive cup of coffee came in yawning miles asked has either of you heard of a place called sangriaville no is it a new bar cinco asked because new bars are officially off my list i dont think so i thought it might be a town with a mental hospital joy blinked there is a private mental clinic way up the road near where canyon deadends called sangre de cristo sangre de cristo sangriaville maybe its one and the same miles said joy said i dont know honey but then i dont know any crazy people fourteen upstairs miles closed the door to joys office so no one could surprise him he unboxed and fired up the new computer hooked it up to the gallerys wireless network and downloaded a free opensource web browser that he would delete when he was done he didnt want to leave a trail for joy to find he googled for a web site for the sangre de cristo mental hospital in santa fe there wasnt one odd a modern hospital without a web site didnt they need to provide information to the medical community or to potential patients he found the hospital in the yellow pages just a simple listing no advertisement for their services he found a directory of new mexican hospitals sangre de cristo was listed and licensed owned by the hopewell company he googled hopewell no web site someone didnt want to be found time to dig into the old bag of tricks he called the hospital using his cell phone hi this is steve smith im doing a story for associated press on the doctor who died last night and i need to get information on your hospital what doctor you dont read papers allison vance im afraid youre mistaken the receptionist said we have no doctor by that name may i speak to your public relations officer we have no comment and she hung up he did a web search for nathan ruiz adding santa fe as an additional search term there were two nathan ruizes in town one owned a restaurant on the south side one ran a community center he clicked through the sites the restaurateur was in his fifties definitely not the young man whod held a gun to his head last night he phoned the number for the other nathan ruiz corazon community services nathan ruiz speaking mr ruiz hi this is fred george with the state insurance board im sorry to bother you but were conducting an investigation into insurance fraud and im hoping you can assist me um sure were tracing patterns of fraudulent claims there have been a number of claims filed in your name for care at the sangre de cristo hospital in santa fe and im calling to see if those are legitimate ive never been to that hospital in my life ruiz said am i liable for these charges my insurance company hasnt said a word no sir youre not liable at all there may be a patient there with a similar name but were finding that inaccuracies in filing protocols are causing claims to be misapplied to other people with the same name miles said in a rapid officious tone its not me and i dont know another nathan ruiz the man said do i need to call my insurance company so no relative with the same name no sir youve been a big help thank you for your time miles said and hung up he went to the search engine broadened the santa fe to new mexico searched again he found a nathan ruiz in los alamos who had earned the honor of eagle scout a nathan ruiz who had died in clovis the previous month at the age of thirtyseven a nathan ruiz who had been hurt in the iraq war and come home to albuquerque he clicked on the news story this nathan ruiz had been a technician with an army battery squad a team charged with firing missiles in the opening rounds of the iraq invasion his team had been accidentally bombed in the chaos of the advance toward baghdad misidentified and attacked by a us jet as an iraqi republican guard missile unit four of the team had been killed the others badly injured nathan ruiz had been sent home if he was at sangre de cristo coming home hadnt gone well his father cipriano was quoted in the story about nathans homecoming were just so proud of his bravery of his service and we just want him back home with us cipriano ruiz miles switched over to an albuquerque phone listings site and found the number he dialed a woman answered on the fourth ring her voice sounded dejected as though each day were simply a series of disappointments hello ruiz residence mrs ruiz yes my name is mike raymond i knew your son nathan in iraq silence i havent talked to him since he came home i wanted to see if hes adjusting okay silence mrs ruiz may i speak with nathan she said nothing for five seconds and he wondered if shed hung up when she spoke no he doesnt live with us is there a number where i can reach him he hes in a hospital is he all right no hes not hes at a special clinic for when you have problems after war you know he i dont mean to pry mrs ruiz i just wanted to see how he was he paused if hes at a clinic is it sangre de cristo up in santa fe oh yes she breathed a sigh of relief youve heard of it yes maam just that its very good oh yes i hope they take good care of him because and she stopped i dont understand she paused again as though wrestling with the words you tell me why he doesnt just get over it the sadness miless stomach tightened what do you mean he survived those other boys died he should be grateful he didnt die why isnt he happy hes alive the posttraumatic stress disorder maam its he struggled with a way to describe it its not a lack of willpower it affects the way the mind works the way he reacts to everything its a fire he cant put out you think the fires out its gone then it burns again then get an extinguisher she sounded beaten he wants to cry and jump at shadows and have bad dreams forever mister i had a baby die nathans older brother he was only three weeks old and he died in his sleep crushed my heart but if i didnt get over it i dont have nathan i dont have a life wheres his strength her voice wobbled he still has his strength maam im sure last time i talked to him leaving him at the hospital i said have hope baby and he said mama all my hopes dead because ill never forget i say dont forget just deal with what happened and he shakes his head at me like im crazy how long ago did you see him when he went to the hospital six months ago i miss him terribly we get him home out of danger and her voice broke but hes not doing well it hurts my heart im very sorry mrs ruiz would it be possible do you think for me to see him no visitors not even family the doctor said its part of the therapy that seems really unusual whos his doctor there doctor leland hurley well id like to write nathan a letter then no contact at all the only way to clean out all the pain from his mind they said he inched onto thin ice that must be expensive i didnt think the government would cover a private clinic im not supposed to talk about the program she said suddenly what was your last name again michael raymond id really like to talk to nathan when hes back home you leave me your number ill give it to him he left her his cellphone number thanks mrs ruiz i hope nathan is better soon i hope so too before he hurts himself before he hurts somebody else goodbye she hung up im not supposed to talk about the program no contact thats what the doctor said weird he didnt know what was considered cutting edge in ptsd treatment but surely isolating a patient from his loved ones wasnt typical allison said sorenson ran a special program sangre de cristo offered a special program so was it one and the same and was the shooter connected to the program the next name on his list was celeste brent the woman whod left the message on allisons phone he googled her name combined with santa fe and got an avalanche of results the first was a headline reality tv star moves to santa fe after tragedy tv star a knock sounded against the door miles closed the browser the computer working yet sweetie joy asked sticking her head inside having trouble getting your email running he fibbed but ill figure it out we need to rotate a few pieces can you please come help me sure he said he could read the rest about celeste brent later but he realized with a cold shiver if he was to find the truth he had to get inside that hospital sangre de cristo find out what was going on there a mental hospital his worst nightmare the crazy guy andy said from the other side of the room as miles hung a new painting with joys guidance breaking into the asylum this i have to see fifteen first the fists then the rubber hoses then finally the screwdriver brought back into the act for a virtuoso encore won groote a name from nathans battered lips groote derived no pleasure from hurting others agony was a means to an end but two hours into the torture really tin soldier had done an impressive imitation of a hero holding out far longer than groote had figured he would hed screamed out a name for allisons shadowy partner michael raymond the mr in allisons cell five minutes later he got a physical description as well about six two strong build brown hair brown eyes groote called a friend immediately back in california a friend who made his living piercing firewalls to test the security of the cellphone provider his friend assured of a generous payment spent the day hacking and then late wednesday afternoon gave groote a home address and a work number for the account groote dialed the work number got a womans voice welcoming him to joy garrison gallery on the worldfamous canyon road listing the employees and giving a number to reach their voice mail for michael raymond press four the computerized voice intoned groote hung up gotcha asshole groote stood in the compact kitchen on the sangre de cristos top floor and drank a glass of ice water he dumped the ice into the sink and scrutinized his hands nathans blood had crusted underneath grootes nails and he needed to give them another hard scrub he shuddered you did what you had to do for amanda for all the other poor sick bastards out there who need to be unchained from their nightmares even if nathan ruiz was one of those same poor bastards doctor hurley sleepless frazzled a scared rabbit in a forest full of foxes unlocked the door stepped inside the kitchen locked the door back behind him quantrills on the phone he sounds unhappy imagine this isnt my fault not at all i asked quantrill for additional security and he balked he should have sent you earlier i wont be held responsible groote hit him not hard but enough in the stomach to shut his mouth he sagged to the floor vomited up a splash of coffee i can hit you next time in the nose just so doctor hurley and send a splinter of bone right into your brain its no sweat off my back you understand me hurley nodded real fear in his eyes so shut up im in charge now youre not you dont have to worry your overstuffed head about responsibility but i cant abide whining he helped hurley to his feet you you should take his call in my office hurley said in a daze ill do that he walked back to hurleys office and thumbed the phones button groote tell me you have frost back groote kept his voice calm cut the drama if i had it id have already called i need you and hurley to keep your heads on straight you got me he heard quantrill take a calming breath so whats the situation i have a theory she takes on exposing you its natural to assume she had help and nathan says she asked this michael raymond guy for help raymond works at an art gallery which doesnt make sense in terms of how he could help her but say nathans telling the truth michael raymond realized your drug was going to go for a premium price so he uses allison to get frost then he gets rid of allison a bomb who would use a bomb quantrills voice held a sudden fear in it that replaced the impatience of a minute ago we dont know it was a bomb could have been he rigged a gas explosion we dont know shit about this guy except his name and he works in an art gallery he paused both mentioned another name sorenson nathan and raymond claimed sorenson was a guy who came to allisons house after she died but i never saw him so either theres another player working here role unknown or theyre lying to me i got to go with what i know quantrill considered in silence mr quantrill groote said i need you to be honest with me you got enemies im guessing other than this woman who might have been a whistleblower who knows about frost who might try to steal it from you a pharmaceutical another information broker the drug company so they could produce it the broker so he could sell the research or quantrill said slowly michael raymond might want a financial payment he doesnt blow the whistle the way allison would he sells me back the research copies for a price but then when i spoke to him he didnt want to set up a meeting he seemed confused but he did say he knew where frost was it would take time but hed call me back then hes wanting us to squirm to drive up the price if he goes public no drug company could produce a medication based on illegal testing quantrill said we have to bury how frost was tested it would kill the research in its tracks years before anyone would touch it again or bring it to market years amanda didnt have then the money has to be his motivation otherwise he would have gone public already find him say youll pay him five million for frost youll have to make sure he hasnt passed the information on to anyone else obviously you cant leave him alive ill get out the screwdriver he hung up and groote checked his gun and his watch first try the gallery for michael raymond then try the apartment a gallery it didnt fit a guy who allison vance would ask for help and that bothered groote he didnt like walking into the unknown he fitted his gun into his jacket holster and headed for the parking lot sixteen groote walked into the gallery he surveyed the art on the walls with indifference portraits of navajo and cowboy landscapes of burnished new mexico desert and wildflowerdotted fields he read the price tag on one landscape of a stonechoked creek eleven thousand dollars hed killed a man for less once he stopped and listened with care he guessed there were two people in the gallery from the murmur of voices a woman a man talking softly from the rear of the gallery he left his sunglasses in place no need to be easily recognizable he went back to the door flipped the open sign of engraved polished metal to closed turned the dead bolt he hoped he didnt have to kill everyone in the building hed prefer to get raymond out of the building get him alone but better to be prepared he headed for the back office listening to the mans voice unsure if it was raymonds he scanned the floor plan two exits off the hallway a set of stairs going up to another display room of art three more rooms to his left a short hallway and a set of french doors to his right he stopped at the back offices door a fiftyish woman brightly pretty and a man in his thirties stopped talking and both smiled at him ready to part him from his money for one of the paintings outside they were clearly mother and son the family resemblance was striking there was a third desk in the corner empty hi may i help you the woman asked yes maam i need to see michael raymond i promised to buy a painting from him the woman seemed to freeze for a second then said in a rush well im sorry michaels not here this afternoon im joy garrison the owner this is my son cinco may we assist you groote glanced at cinco who opened his mouth as though to interrupt the woman then shut it mom cinco its fine joy said in a tone that brooked no discussion the phone rang cinco picked it up said hello and started answering a question about the gallerys operating hours which painting were you interested in joy asked the woman must want to scoop the commission groote thought the landscape by the front door how odd michael told me he would be here today but id like to talk to him about it make sure he gets the commission of course im sorry hes not here whens he expected back but then she snapped her fingers oh wait youre right he will be here today around six right before we close picking up his paycheck i forgot he told me groote nodded okay then i was sure id lost my mind he laughed politely ill check back with him around six did you want to leave a name sir cinco hung up the phone jason brown groote lied because to refuse a name would be suspicious the phone beeped and joy garrison punched a button yes she said of course i can get you that painting sir yes and started to nod jot words down on a notepad it still seemed wrong but he heard a rattling at the door another customer testing the knob in surprise at the early closing so he went back to the door flipped the sign and opened the lock keeping his back so cinco and joy couldnt see what hed done he said excuse me to two turquoisebedecked tourists slid past them headed for his car time for plan b go to michael raymonds home address see if he was there and if not search the place for an idea of who he was then come back around six for a private talk with michael raymond groote was ten blocks away when he realized his mistake and he powered the car hard around in a screeching uturn seventeen miles coming out of joys office up on the second floor saw the man saw him flip the sign and lock the door and thought hes here for me he took four silent steps back from the railing ducking behind a sculpture of a crouching cougar and wondering if this was the man who had chased him from allisons apartment the shooter then the man spoke to joy and cinco asking for him by name and miles was sure he had no weapon but he grabbed a small sculpture an iron figure of a sioux warrior the rider rose high above the horse a spear thrusting forward and miles decided hed hit the shooter in the temple where the bone and flesh were weakest he couldnt let the man hurt joy and cinco but then god bless joy who said he wasnt there cinco played along miles listened to the conversation heard her parry with and then lie to the guy then he crept back to the office thinking he wont kill anyone if he thinks theyre on the phone so he lifted the handset punched in the extension for joys desk heard it give off its internal buzz joy smart acted as if shed gotten an outside call and miles said to her get busy hell leave then a rattling on the door and he heard the footsteps of the shooter leaving heard him offer a polite excuseme to a customer at the door he counted to ten started down the stairs joy rushed past two women possibly ignoring a buyer for the first time in her life who was that she said you lied to him miles said in surprise i didnt like him the sunglasses the way he asked for you i know trouble when i see it you dont do sales so i knew he was lying she grabbed his arm hurried him to the back told cinco to go deal with the browsers she slammed the door behind her could a bad guy from your old life be hunting you he knew she meant the barradas but it was easier not to explain yes listen to me close the gallery right now leave in case he comes back at six and ill make sure he leaves you alone ill take you wherever you want to go no im not involving you further just go now his face burned thanks joy for being my friend you dont know how much you and this job meant to me dont tell cinco about me okay ill make up a good story tears in her eyes she tiptoed up and kissed his cheek then she opened the door announced to cinco and the ladies that they were closing immediately nicely shepherded the two women out of the door told cinco to go home what the hells going on cinco demanded get your mother home miles said now would you please tell me why were all panicking cinco asked michael let us give you a ride no go joy please joy squeezed his hand and then she hurried cinco to her car they drove off in a peal of tire the shooter knew his name andy seated on cincos desk said games over miles miles ignored him grabbed a university of new mexico lobos baseball cap from cincos desk pulled it low on his face and then ran around to the back of the building he needed to get back to his hotel the gallery next door was owned by three potters and he remembered that one always biked to work hed call her and tell her where the bike was later he still had his lockpicks in his pocket and he worked the bike lock open in ten seconds reduced to being a bicycle thief andy said shame on you miles jumped on the bicycle awkwardly he hadnt ridden one in ten years found his rhythm then sped around the buildings corner out onto the lot onto canyon road and saw the shooter behind the wheel of a car heading back up canyon veering straight toward him in a scream of rubber eighteen the buzz instead of a ring it was a setting on office phones the call cinco took when groote first walked in gave off a ring joyd gotten a buzz for that second call but shed pretended it was an outside call his instincts told him the woman had been lying the idea of michael raymond coming back at six was just to get him out of the gallery so he veered hard ignoring the horns laid down around him as he narrowly missed clipping a truck vroomed back down paseo de peralta and took the hard right onto canyon and right ahead of him an idiot on a bike a baseball cap practically covering his eyes riding and balancing awkwardly in the middle of the street groote just missed him as he steered the car hard into the parking lot for the collection of galleries groote saw the closed sign hanging crooked in the garrison gallerys door he ran up to the door tested the knob locked he broke the pane of glass closest to the knob an alarm wailed he opened the door drew his gun ran through the gallery upstairs and down no sign of anyone the police would arrive within minutes he tucked his gun into his holster under his jacket went out the back saw a woman standing with hands on hips frowning at the noise im a friend of joy and cincos he said to her before she could speak is something wrong my bikes gone she gestured toward the gallery door the shrieking whine is it a breakin or a false alarm the guy on the bike outmaneuvered by an art hippie lady and a guy on a fricking bike he ran past the woman and hurried to his car groote bolted onto canyon then paseo de peralta had to choose and took a hard right he drove two minutes running red lights looking for the guy on the bike wheeled hard around and went the other way cursing he backtracked tore up side roads at eighty miles an hour his heart caught in his throat he pounded the steering wheel in fury i was this close to him to finding frost no bike on the street no bike anywhere michael raymond was gone nineteen miles carried the stolen bike up to the hotel room with him washed his face the cache of money and equipment he kept at the bus station in case he ever needed to flee town on his own now was the time to go fetch it but if the shooter was prowling the roads of central santa fe riding the bike was a risk he couldnt outrun a car a fist pounded his door deshawn ordering him to open up he answered and deshawn pushed in franticfaced slamming the door behind him were moving you to a new city getting you a new identity right now grab your bag why youve been disclosed miles your covers blown the police found a laptop in allisons car trunk it contained a scanned copy of your entire psychiatric file from allison including the fact that youre a federal witness and your real name he shook his head it omitted the fact that you lied to me of course deshawns urgency had nothing to do with the shooters appearing at the gallery i youre done in santa fe lets go miles rocked on his feet the news a punch in his gut how would allison know my real name you sure you didnt tell her no i never did i dont believe you you told me you didnt even tell her you were a witness deshawns voice was cold you lied to me miles she knew your name she knew where you were from she knew what you were and now shes dead i never told her the confession signed with his real name was still in his pants pocket you said a scanned file like a paper file scanned for a computer yes sorenson opening and closing the file cabinet yesterday afternoon hed taken something miless file but it had apparently been full of information hed never given allison jesus and mary miles said you done lying miles your face you werent in a fight you were close to her office when it exploded no you tried to call her pager right after the explosion i got the records explain that timing she wanted to talk to me you were supposed to be there when the office blew miles werent you you were supposed to die with her dont you see it no you told her who you were and then she started digging into your past to understand you to help you and she tipped off the barradas maybe by accident but if youd kept your mouth shut that you were miles kendrick shed be alive right now miles shook his head i never told her my real name and even if i did why kill her why hurt her you dumb shit deshawn yelled do you know how many people want you dead the barradas sure then all the crime rings you screwed over spying for the barradas they want your ass the razor boys the duartes the ghj ring miles she knew and she died and she left behind a record of your old name thats all that matters youre compromised welcome to your next exciting new life miles went and picked up his bag his mind raced no he couldnt leave now he couldnt get on that plane what if i say no to relocating deshawns voice went cold now i speak as your inspector witsecs voluntary miles you can walk away from our protection anytime you want but as your friend youre dead meat if you stay the press will get hold of this eventually her death is too big a story here as your friend im worried youre not thinking straight that you remain mentally unbalanced and unable to make a cogent decision and i will knock your ass out and put you on a plane to save your life thats all off the record of course of course i nothing to keep you here andy said from the corner shes dead and gone quit being helpful miles people get killed whats the matter deshawn said nauseous miles went to the sink jetted water into a glass first you fail her now you run andy said youre an aone piece of work miles miles drank his water ignored deshawn and andy both no he wasnt going anywhere not until he knew the truth about allisons death she needed him he had failed to help her in time he had failed to be the man she needed him to be what had living a lie gotten him nothing hed lost this new life as easily as hed lost his last one the decision was clear and strong in his head crowding out his fear silencing andys murmurs escape was the only answer he had to avoid deshawn at least for a few days hide out in santa fe find the shooter uncover the truth the witsec higherups might very well boot him out of the protection program for running but he thought they might not he was a mental patient and critical to their remaining cases against the barrada ring he had saved two fbi agents from certain death but he was breaking a cardinal rule of witsec disobeying an inspector running on his own ill go with you but first i need to talk to joy please miles said you can call joy from your new location i want joy and cinco protected did you tell them your real name too no i guarantee you theyll be safe make the call now i want deputy marshals staked at joys house at cincos at the gallery deshawn saw it was miless price of compliance okay man ill make the call he dialed spoke softly into the cell phone while miles shoved his few belongings back into his bag deshawn clicked off the phone the garrisons will be protected my guarantee thank you miles hoisted the bag onto his shoulder lets go deshawn walked ahead of him opening the door and miles drove hard into him miles dont try it deshawn yelled as he slammed into the door he howled in pain his hand caught between the frame and the latch miles hammered a fist into the back of deshawns neck once twice and then deshawn got his feet anchored freed his hand from the doors trap and cannonballed into miles major mistake deshawn said drawing back his fist a hard punch to the chest to the jaw two hard blows to the stomach left miles heaped on the bed goddamn you hurt my hand deshawn stood over him shaking the sting out of his fingers what the hell got into you miles didnt answer closed his eyes told himself to ignore the pain he made his breathing labored assaulting a federal officer deshawn said never mind you were supposed to be my friend miles kept his eyes closed he heard the soft clink of handcuffs quit playing possum deshawn said grabbing miless wrist open up your eyes and stop miles pivoted and kicked out with both feet hard one foot caught deshawn in the nose the other in the throat and he staggered back miles spun off the bed pain fueling him because he couldnt lose now deshawn would rightly beat him senseless he grabbed deshawns hurt hand and twisted two finger bones popped and deshawn sucked in breath and cussed miles reared back and punched him hard twice grabbed the hoteldesk alarm clock and brought it down hard on the back of deshawns head once twice deshawn went down to his knees trying to pull miles close to get him in a neck lock and miles swung the lucite clock again into deshawns temple deshawn went down eyes closed im sorry miles said im really sorry he knelt down checked the pulse present and steady he wouldnt be down long and hed be real pissed when he woke up miles ripped the cables from the tv from the lamp he bound deshawn with them took a sheet from the bed tied it to the two cables holding deshawns hands and feet immobilizing deshawn miles tore a pillowcase tucked a wad of it into deshawns mouth careful not to block his breathing he took deshawns car keys from his pocket left his badge gun and wallet alone he put deshawns cell phone on the bed then he gently dragged deshawn into the closet closed the door jimmied the desk chair hard up under the knob his face and his ribs hurt deshawn had pulled his punches but miles ached as if hed been sideswiped by a car he had at most a few minutes most likely deshawn had logged that hed been heading to pick up miles at the hotel and if he didnt report back in a few minutes witsec and the fbi would start calling and come straight to the hotel im sorry deshawn he said to the closed door please forgive me but ive got to make things right he hung the do not disturb notice on the door and walked away from life as michael raymond twenty miles hoped andy would stay behind in the hotel room haunt it as a ghost keep deshawn company but no miles was andys haunted house and now he had to drive fear pounded his stomach a fist burrowing past skin and muscle to braid his guts the barradas were famous for wiring the ignitions of those they hated and miles told himself as he walked toward the car that the fear was false the barradas would not be able to wire deshawns car wouldnt be able to find deshawn of course they could wire deshawns wheels andy hurried to walk beside him i mean allison knew your name the barradas could know deshawn was coming to fetch you theyd just need a few seconds to attach the bomb no miles said shut up blow up you and deshawn together thats justice to the barrada boys wire up the ignition while youre fighting with deshawn upstairs miles kept walking toward the car you dont seriously think youre driving do you miles stopped andy danced ahead jumped atop the hood of deshawns car did an improvised twist i better be careful i might set the fucker off hes not there theres not a bomb its perfectly safe youre just adding theft to your crime load today too scared to drive andy dropped down to the hood rested his feet on the bumpers miles ran unlocked the car sweat pouring down his back his hand trembled as he shoved the key into the ignition twisted it kaboom andy screamed from the other side of the windshield twisting his face into a contortion pressing hands and lips against the glass but the engine didnt explode it just started miles gripped the wheel better stop andy said better stop right now miles shot him the finger gritted his teeth and jerked the car forward andy fell off the hood and then started his low whisper again from behind miles this isnt going to work andy said in a low hiss all i need he thought a backseat driver you killed me and now youve killed allison andy said who will die next for your sins miles the scar on his chest burned he closed his eyes slipped into the steam of a miami morning andy smiling at him and then a shocked andy pulling his gun in sudden resolve aiming it the bullet hitting miles and then he was in a hospital under heavy security the government telling him he couldnt be miles kendrick anymore why was there this blot of snow in his memory in his head the sting went wrong andy reached for his gun andy knowing that miles had gone government a blot where he couldnt see the past he could hear the voices of the two undercover agents saying you did the right thing man youre a hero but he didnt know why now focus on now the cache of money and a gun at the santa fe bus station in case he needed it he rooted in the duffels side pocket and found the locker key he drove over to the bus terminal on st michael slowly circled it twice if witsec knows i rented the locker would they routinely check on such things when they settled a witness in a new city see if he rented a mailbox or a locker or a storage unit would witsec look for me here worse would the shooter no major airport in santa fe you want out of town quick and got no car you take the bus he would have to risk it the shooter wouldnt know or guess he didnt have a car unless he spotted you on the bike plan b he drove back to paseo de peralta searching for homeless joe hed give him a twenty to retrieve the duffel the shooter would ignore joe and the feds if they knew about and surveilled the locker would grab joe but let him go when it was clear he knew nothing but no sign of his friend on the streets so miles reluctantly wheeled back to the station he had to take the risk he walked inside the terminal was busy on a late afternoon a departure to albuquerque and el paso booming over the loudspeakers he glanced around no sign of the shooter no one who stood with the iron spine of a federal officer he grabbed the green duffel out of the locker shouldered it hurried back down the street to his car miles opened the duffel his worldly possessions now in addition to his few clothes consisted of the id and credit card in his deceased fathers name a loaded beretta and a thousand in cash hidden in the duffels false bottom think youre smart andy said next to him miles stopped yes he said slowly in a whisper barely above a breath i do im smarter than you youre dead and im not andy went silent miles needed a place to hide he drove fast sticking to side roads until he got to blaine the pains house off old santa fe trail he parked deshawns car behind the house next to blaines car and knocked on the door no answer blaine the pain was still in marfa with his friend reigniting his painters inspiration he fished around in the flower pots on the porch of the adobe and in the third one his fingers found the shape of a key he slid it home in the lock unlocked the door praying blaine was still gone praying there was no beeping chime of an alarm system he slipped inside closed the door listened to the silence home sweet home for now twentyone thursday morning miles watched from behind a heavy curtain blaines neighbors driving off to work then he drove deshawns car to a grocery parking lot and abandoned it unlocked and keys dangling in the ignition and hiked the mile back to blaines house he had slept atop the covers on blaines bed his mind cracked with exhaustion and when he woke he realized trying to find nathan ruiz was the wrong tack hed sooner be able to find celeste brent who had left that strange message on allisons recorder about keeping her secret blaine the pain apparently had taken his laptop with him to texas miles found a santa fe phone book scrambled through the alphabet ran a finger down the listings no celeste brent no c brent okay she was a tv star fame was a critical currency in santa fe hed seen several celebrities who stopped by joys gallery on their jaunts through town it gave him an idea he dug into his bag and searched the pockets of pants hed worn tuesday he still had blaine the pains cellphone number scribbled on a note he picked up the phone and set it down blaines cell would likely show him calling from blaines house using his own cell phone was a risk the feds could trace your location if the phone was on hed heard but he couldnt use blaines phone so he took the risk he flipped open his cell phone and dialed yeah blaine answered sounding his usual grumpy self hi mr blaine its michael raymond at the gallery i may have found a buyer for emilia oh man mike thats great blaine sounded happier than he ever had and miless chest twisted in guilt well sir nothings set i have a woman who indicated serious interest but she didnt leave a phone number i guess she forgot shes local and shes famous so i thought you might know her her names celeste brent yeah i dont know her no one knows her but i know who she is i guess i dont well i never watched castaway i prefer pbs whats castaway that reality show where they dump a dozen people on a godforsaken island and they compete to be the last one standing for five million dollars he snorted in disgust a popularity contest on steroids miles now recognized the shows title most of his work for the barradas had been done at night so he didnt follow many television programs but her name had sounded familiar and a drop of the shows incessant coverage must have seeped into his brain she was on this game show won the five million a couple years back fifteen minutes of fame for running around in a limegreen bikini a vicious backstabbing game and she was the queen bee on the island id be surprised to know how she saw the emilia shes a total recluse she makes a hermit look like a social butterfly why her husband was murdered and she went how do i say it kindly nuts thats awful miles said nuts how agoraphobic is that what its called she wont leave her house not even to go into the yard but she must be recovering if shes out hunting art shes unlisted and now i see why miles said improvising do you know anyone whod know her address she asked in the voice mail for me to bring the emilia by for a private viewing and she didnt leave an address or a number for you thats weird sir miles said if shes been a recluse for so long she might not be smooth in her dealings with folks true let me make a couple of calls and ill call you back at the gallery actually call me on my cell phone he gave blaine the number im not at the gallery but i can run by there as soon as i know where ms brents address is okay ill call you back in a few thanks michael yes sir miles hung up nuts maybe posttraumatic syndrome just like him two minutes later his cell rang and miles answered i called the top realtor in santa fe blaine said she knows everyone of a certain net worth celeste brent lives on camino del monte sol he gave him the street number she sold celeste the house she said celeste never leaves it i mean never ever she has a woman who does all her shopping runs her errands she doesnt have any visitors inside unless its her doctors or this caretaker isnt that the craziest thing you ever heard yeah crazy i guess she found the emilia on the web site crazy money is still as good as sane money okay he felt real regret about the necessary trick he was playing dont get your hopes up mr blaine let me know what happens talk to you soon thank you sir miles clicked off the phone and started thinking about how he might talk his way into a total recluses house twentytwo the sheet felt cool on celestes face she lay in her bed like a corpse in the morgue the crying was done no tears left inside allison was dead the past twentyfour hours had been full of numbing grief shock denial celeste kept a gun in the house and shed gone and picked it up twice and then eased it back into its drawer i cant allison would kill me then shed cry and then shed laugh the good memories of allison plowing through the grief she slipped out from under the sheet and sat at her vanity in the bathroom and very lightly touched the razor she could cut herself just a tiny nip she knew cutting was a slide backward shed felt stronger in the past week more sure of herself than she had in many months the razors edge gleamed a perfect line like the line drawn in her life before brian was murdered before she died on the inside and she didnt know how to resuscitate herself she pressed the tip down into the flesh of her upper arm the pain kicked up rose a bud of blood what are you doing allisons voice rang in her ears you really want to have a sharp edge be your answer to pain she put the razor down stared at the blood saw the dead face of her husband the dead face of his killer in the crimson bubble allison would be ashamed of her she stopped the blood dabbed antiseptic on it covered her weakness with a bandage she put the razor back in its sheath tucked the sheath between two folded twenties in her purses billfold and slid a fresh rubber band onto her wrist she called it her cutting condom the bit of rubber that was supposed to ease her off an addiction to pain she started snapping the rubber hard against her wrist again and again until fatigue seeped through her and nausea claimed her stomach but the urge to cut was gone she curled back under the sheets call the police and say what the afternoon before my doctor died she showed up acted odd used my computer well so what all it would do would be to bring the medias attention swinging back toward her a blinding inescapable light she could imagine the headlines former tv star linked to shrink death she knew nothing there was nothing to tell she stayed in her room when nancy baird who did all her shopping and errands for her came by with the twiceaweek grocery run celeste you okay nancy called from the kitchen yes ive got a cold so im just staying in my room nancy opened the door i aint scared of no cold germs you want me to run to the pharmacy and get you medicine no celeste said from the sanctuary of the sheets nancy fiftyish and nononsense came into the room and put a hand to celestes forehead not hot or clammy no its in my throat let me see oh honestly nancy let me alone you got too much leaving you alone nancy said get up and out of bed girl just leave me alone celeste screamed just unload the groceries and go theres no need for shouting nancy said unruffled you want me to call doctor vance no she said not adding shes dead you must not read the papers no im just sad and lonely nancy said you want to come home with me have dinner with me and tony an invitation always extended no thank you celeste fought back fresh tears nancy doctor vance is dead shock blossomed on nancys face celeste told her the news accounts my god nancy sat on the edge of the bed so the paper said it might be a gas explosion but what if it wasnt what if someone wanted to kill her celeste got up out of bed started pacing the floor she showed up unexpectedly she acted weird she asked me to keep her secret from the hospital but she couldnt tell nancy about allisons request nancy would call the police they would come then the press no never again but she should call the authorities tell them what allison had said what if it was important what if allison had been murdered that thought one shed been keeping at bay rushed at her like an avalanche honey listen to me nancy put an arm around her it was an accident im sure no one would want to hurt doctor vance she works with crazy people were dangerous celeste paced the floor youre not crazy dear yes i am i am crazy nancy celeste stumbled to the curtains leaned against the wall the price i pay for not saving my husband nancy steered her back to the bed did you stab brian no no then you didnt kill him banish that thought from your mind youre not responsible nancy shook her head youre not nuts nuts is thinking that how youre living is normal and you know its not now youre not going to hurt yourself are you no she said i wont nancy glanced at the fresh bandage on celestes arm i better stay tonight no you have a life go live it im staying i wont hurt myself id rather be alone really please ill call you if i need you youre alone too much have you eaten today breakfast before i saw the news then im going to make you a pot of vegetable soup before i go ill get you a plate of cheese and crackers to snack on while its cooking stop being so nice stop acting like you dont deserve it nancy gave her a hug and celeste let her although she didnt much like being touched thanks nancy i dont mean to sound insensitive to doctor vance nancy said but it might be wise to find another therapist i dont think i can face a new psychiatrist right now doctor vance wouldnt want your therapy to end youre right she wiped the tears from her cheeks i think ill go check my email you spend too much time on the computer one day im gonna unplug that monster and wheel it to the street might get you out of the house nancy squeezed her hand and went off to the kitchen celeste sat down at the computer allison had sat here shed seemed nervous skittish now she was dead under extraordinary circumstances maybe one didnt have anything to do with the other just because you had a weird day then you died it didnt necessarily mean anything but the day brian died had been off kilter the coffeemaker broke it gurgled in protest and wouldnt brew she dropped the egg carton pulling it from the refrigerator spilling shells and yolks across the tile so brian said ill run to the store and ill swing by starbucks babe because now she got recognized everywhere she went in atlanta there was a checker there who always wanted to make a big deal about seeing the winner from castaway so brian was gone when the disturbed fan she believed was a friend knocked on the door with his easy grin and she let him into the house because she trusted him he was her fan clubs president and then he pulled the knife and the gun and told her she and brian were going to die just as soon as brian got home with the dozen eggs and hot coffee she closed her eyes steadied herself in the chair brian walking in her tied up and the disturbed fan starting to tuck the fabric between her lips brian calling babe i got sumatra i hope thats okay and then it all ended her life wadded up and thrown away she swallowed past the mountain in her throat she hit the space bar on the keyboard awakening her computer from sleep she could dig around the system see what allison had done before brian died celeste had been an accomplished programmer now her computer was her only friend aside from nancy she checked the sent items folder in her email program nothing unusual there allison hadnt emailed anything from celestes account next she dived to her web browser and checked the history the list of sites the browser had visited yesterday scrolled down the screen odd celeste had spent much of wednesday morning on amazon shopping for new books on ptsd and those pages were cleaned from the browsers history but the sites shed visited after allisons visit victor gambys blog and discussion board for ptsd sufferers cnn and ebay those sites addresses remained in the history list which meant wherever allison had gone on her web browser shed then erased the entire history she hadnt wanted to leave a trail celeste opened the various microsoft office programs surveying the listing of recent files to see if there was a file name she didnt recognize none so allison had not opened a word document or spreadsheet or she had cleaned out the history of files opened in those programs what had allison said celeste frowned trying to remember i have all the programs i need on this disk celeste your snack is ready nancy called come sit in here with me while i finish making your soup all right she wondered if there was a way to recover the cleanedout history file shed have to research that once nancy left the kitchen smelled of broth and chiles and she sat down to a plate of wheat crackers and grapes and havarti cheese food she needed this more than hours of crying in bed although allison deserved grieving thank you youre welcome sweetie youre right about finding another therapist celeste said allison mentioned a doctor hurley at sangre de cristo ill call him and set up an appointment nancy told her that was a good idea and took her leave celeste ladled out the simple soup into a bowl it tasted wonderful hot spicy with green chiles she ate two bowls of it and felt better she opened the yellow pages found a number for leland hurley she dialed the hospital got connected to his voice mail and left a message asking him to call her regarding a doctor to take over her therapy then she added allison acted oddly the day she was here tuesday and i need to talk to you about it she felt disloyal but she knew nancy was right she couldnt let her therapy stop she wanted distraction so she flopped on the sofa powered on the tv settled in to pass the time with an old bob hope comedy the doorbell rang she clicked the tv to the channel that fed into the security camera on her front door she didnt know the man standing at her porch he held up a sign to the camera handwritten in block letters on white cardboard it read i know allisons secret she gaped at the screen in disbelief the man gave the camera a polite wave she pushed the intercom button who are you hi my name is miles kendrick what do you want i believe you may have information relevant to why allison died he never let his eyes drop from the camera i dont talk to people she said go away i know you prefer to be alone i understand but i believe youll want to talk to me how did you know allison she finally said she asked me for help he produced another note held it up to the screen she read it she knew allisons tight neat handwriting how do you know what information i have she asked because allison told me he said that she was in trouble and that i could trust you she studied his face for five minutes her hands trembling celeste got her gun its weight unfamiliar in her hand and opened the door twentythree groote didnt want to use the screwdriver again but he didnt have a choice michael raymond hadnt run home he hadnt run back to the gallery he wasnt answering his phone wednesday night groote had called the mr number listed on allisons cell using a hospital phone but there was no answer hed left a message that simply said you and i need to talk mr raymond ill call you when your phones on hed called every hotel in town checked flights outbound from albuquerque he had found where joy garrison lived and driven twice past her house a santa fe police car sat outside no help there he drove on both times to avoid attracting notice of course michael raymond might have abandoned his bike and left town by car but and the thought nagged at groote if the guy had killed allison and taken frost had the research worth millions in his pocket why stay in town on wednesday working at the gallery hed stayed a full twentyfour hours when he should have disappeared if he had the drug research but the dink had gone back to life as normal he must have had a damned good reason to stay in town i dont have frost but i might know where you can get it michael raymond had said perhaps the guy hit a delay in putting his hands on frost nathan ruiz might know the reason groote found nathan heavily sedated he steered hurley to nathans bedside i need him talking groote said hurley pulled his arm away from grootes grip i need him not screaming his throat raw the other patients can hear him who gives a crap tell them hes having a nervous breakdown weve got another avenue to pursue hurley said with an irritating level of confidence back in his voice i got a phone call from one of allisons patients celeste brent she used to be famous she won a reality tv show a ptsd patient i think so given her recent past he gave groote a brief background on celeste brent the news accounts after she moved here say shes agoraphobic has made her house a fortress she said allison visited her tuesday afternoon acted oddly groote considered presume she took the research tuesday when she left allison either hands off the research to someone else or hides it she wouldnt leave it in her office because there and her home are the first places youd search say she hid it and michael raymond knows she hid it but he hasnt found it groote said then its the best explanation for why he hadnt left town yesterday hurley nodded so where would she stash it put yourself in her shoes she had the research she didnt take it straight to the fda or to the press so she had a reason to keep frost secret at least for a few hours best if she could hide it in a place where she could get access to it but others couldnt at least not easily perhaps mr raymonds problem is one of access hurley saw where his idea was going she wouldnt leave it at a patients house but hiding something at a recluses house where only you and a couple of others have regular access is an interesting idea you said she lives in her house like its a fortress we need to talk to her this is all speculation i used to work in speculation all the time groote didnt add that it had been part of his job at the fbi trying to figure out connections between players to build the bigger case hurley blanched you cant go over there and bully her she called me i can find out what she knows all right go hurley left groote checked his watch california time was close to four amanda would be in her room he dialed the number the nurse got amanda and brought her to the phone hey daddy hey sunshine hows your day im not sunshine today whats the matter amanda banana he realized he talked to her as if she were a small child but he couldnt help himself the undamaged child was the daughter he saw in his minds eye not this broken sad teenager who needed more than he could give her i miss you his heart tightened i miss you too angel but this is an important trip for daddy dare he raise her hopes hope was the greatest medicine of all if it wasnt dead in her heart daddys working with nice folks that have a new way to help you what way she sounded suspicious its a pill honey a magic pill magic pill she said dully oh please dad it kills all the bad memories in your brain but a very very bad man stole the magic pills and daddys going to catch him youre making this up she said no i got to go slay dragons now and get that magic pill back i think he hid it under a hundred mattresses a princess sleeps on now she laughed indulging him the sweetest music in his world youre such a geek dad i love you amanda banana i love you dad she said after a pause as though she had to find the words recognize the emotions go slay a dragon for me i will baby i will he clicked off the phone pinched the bridge of his nose took a deep breath he couldnt fail her he couldnt let her rot in that hospital not when she could be fixed groote went back down to the soundproofed room where nathan ruiz lay handcuffed to the bed he wore a bloodied scrubs shirt and underwear four vicious gouges dotted his leg where groote had made his cuts and twisted his screwdriver groote closed the door behind him nathan opened his eyes and cringed he leaned over to nathans face youre gonna tell me the truth now youre gonna tell me everything you know about michael raymond you tried to protect him you went all those hours without giving me his name which suggests to me that you know more than youve told me so far nathan spat at him but the glob just landed on his own nose and lip groote gently wiped the spittle from nathans face nice defiance piss me off and were moving on to power tools im im not afraid of you nathan said i know fear youre drowning in it son but youre about to be drowning in pain instead he lowered his mouth close to nathans ear where did allison hide frost i told you i dont know anything about her taking your stuff groote didnt want to go through hours more of torture he wondered if the boys relatively strong courage was proof that frost worked on him so change tactics i dont have to hurt you if you help me celeste brent tell me about her who she was one of the last people to see allison alive nathan closed his eyes dont know her a knock on the door announced hurley groote noticed he didnt look at nathan what am i supposed to do if allison did leave frost with ms brent call me ill deal with her people commit suicide when they lose their therapist sometimes groote said unfortunate but it happens twentyfour miles heard six soft clicks dead bolts unlocking then the door opened put the note down a voice whispered step back ten steps from the door count the steps aloud he did as he was told the door creaked open another few inches a hand reached out swept the note inside the door slammed closed he heard the locks turn three more minutes he peered up at the moon showing its face from behind a heavy cloud its light silvering the wildflowers that graced the beds the dead bolts all six of them clicked and the door opened again now the hand held a gun a sleek glock he could see her only part of her face visible standing there in a tshirt with a batman logo faded jeans her hair pulled into a thick ponytail you can come in she said guns make me nervous hed left his own in the car everything makes me nervous celeste said explain why she wrote you a note why not just ask for your help he saw no reason to lie she might slam the door in his face but she might equally decide to trust him she didnt want another person in the room to know she was asking for help who a man named sorenson he said he was a doctor but hes not she passed me the note in a vial of pills pills white pills her voice rose empty shells no medicine in them ten seconds passed well talk but by my rules hands on your head step inside he obeyed she eased back keeping a healthy ten feet between them neither her voice nor her hand holding the glock was particularly steady shut the door she said dont lock it keep your hands on your head just shut it he did easing the front door closed with his elbow he waited okay he said can we talk sit she gestured with the gun to a heavy armchair in the corner he sat she remained standing on the other side of the room the gun trained on him i understand your caution but thats not necessary why did allison turn to you i used to be a private investigator she believed i could help her used to be im retired she gave you pills were you a patient yeah whats wrong with you im dealing with issues dont be vague i dont leave the house what do you do he swallowed a friend of mine tried to kill someone i killed him he follows me around i prefer my life to yours she said allison asked me for help she asked you to keep a secret she got killed we should compare notes its too late to help her i cant walk away from it i cant may i put my hands down no ill tell you why allison was in danger if you tell me her secret why should i care shes dead i can see you care youve been crying but mrs brent celeste you might be in danger the same way she was a sick sad frown twisted her pretty face ive already survived attempted murder its generally a onceinalifetime experience me too but you and me were beating the odds he told the events of the past two days meeting sorenson allison asking him for help finding out sorenson wasnt a doctor the confrontation and chase at allisons apartment the shooter coming to the gallery looking for him he left out that he was in witsec and hiding from the authorities he didnt want to scare her she listened without interruption this man thats hunting me he thinks ive got this research that allison stole im wondering if she gave it to you or talked about it to you backtrack a minute youre saying allison was a thief i know how it sounds but shes dead nathan ruiz has been in this hospital and if hes telling the truth she was helping him escape he was part of this frost research he had frost on his hospital bracelet allison was trying to get him away from the research nathan ruiz could be lying people chased and shot at us after a moment she lowered the gun and he found it easier to breathe fair enough but why would she bring this research here because if they were suspicious of her she could only go places where she could be expected to go she stole something of great value she cant keep it in her house or her office this man or this sorenson guy might be after it she needed another hiding place one that she can reach easily yet doesnt arouse suspicion and you think she hid this secret in my house how long since you left your house thats none of your business she snapped youre right but say she had to hide it in a hurry if she showed up unexpected she could be sure you were home because youre always home celeste started to argue but saw his point she crossed her arms under the batman logo this is crazy whatever frost is its got to matter hugely to these people but what would it be this man she seemed afraid of sorenson he mentioned a new therapy said it could deaden the effects of traumatic memory maybe frost relates to his project but you said sorensons not a doctor how does he connect to sangriaville i dont know but nathan said theyd fixed him if you forgot your trauma or it didnt ruin your life anymore would you say you were fixed you cant just make trauma go away anger in her voice if he was helped by a new therapy lets say for the sake of argument and allison was sneaking him out of the hospital it suggests to me that she needs to show hes better to support the research she stole hes human proof he saw from her frown she was considering his theory from different angles you think this is about drug tests if so theyre secret tests or illicit he noticed a rubber band circled her thin wrist and she snapped it slowly against her skin an unconscious twiddling of thumbs she seemed to be trying to make a decision gauging him youve got two facts on your side you dont know about or im as crazy as you are she let out a tense breath the day she died she came by to borrow my computer hers was on the fritz after she left i couldnt find a bottle of white pills she gave me a couple of weeks ago to take before our sessions and they were missing from my purse i had the insane idea shed taken them but i couldnt really believe it he remembered the message shed left on allisons office phone you took these pills before your therapy yes she said it would make it easier for me to talk about my trauma i wasnt a cooperative patient he said could you talk about your trauma freely with her celeste ran a tip of tongue along her lip yes much more so lately are you stronger or less affected by the memories since you started taking the pills i dont know i cut myself she kicked at the floor but ive been cutting less but that doesnt prove she fed me experimental medicine whatd she do on your computer theres nothing new on my system but she erased the internet history logs let me see i have a question first you find out what she stole or why she died what then we blow these people out of the water expose what theyve done that they killed allison get nathan away from them if they still have him if they know that allison came here on the day she died they might come for you oh shit i called the hospital today told them i needed a new counselor that allison visited me the day she died acting weird have they called you back no we may not have much time miles started and a beep sounded my frontyard sensor celeste said the doorbell rang you expecting anyone he whispered the door was still unlocked he remembered she insisted he not lock it when he first came inside she shook her head no one but my friend nancy and shes already left she aimed a remote at the tv clicked on the camera view of her front porch a man wearing a white lab coat over a rumpled suit stood on the stone tiles peering up at the camera you know him miles asked never seen him talk to him on the intercom see who he is i dont take orders in my own house miles sorry please she pressed a button on an intercom yes ms brent who are you im leland hurley im an associate of doctor vances from sangre de cristo you called me and i wanted to be sure you were all right may i come in miles stood close to celeste he could tell us what we need to know what he just spills the beans or let me guess you go all nuclear on his ass neither but he cant see me or know im here i cant risk he knows what i look like if theyre hunting me i can hide and listen and you can talk to him i wont let him hurt you no i cant a sudden terror strained her voice you can he said please celeste please help me for allison she put her hands over her face as the doctor blinked uncertainly at the camera twentyfive a man is here to see whoevers in charge the guard stood in the fourthfloor hallway swallowing looking at a point to the left of grootes shoulder theyre afraid of me groote thought a pleasant discovery like learning a woman thought you were attractive i dont see anybody hed closed the door behind him but he wondered if the guard had spotted nathan said he had absolutely to see whoever was in charge whats this guys name sorenson interesting and unexpected groote kept a poker face on for the guard is he a suit or is he trouble trouble big guy he knows how to handle himself ill talk to him downstairs in the conference room you stay close outside in case i need backup the guard complied groote went back into nathans room he lay there listless staring at the ceiling your buddy sorensons here groote said nathan looked at the ceiling so im supposed to think you and michael raymond were telling me the truth now about this third guy i told you i didnt know why he came to allisons hes downstairs we can ask him if you capped him on the head ill invite him to bash you in return describe sorenson again nathan repeated the description and groote took the stairs down to the ground floor it gave him time to think he had been convinced that sorenson was a ruse agreed to by michael raymond and nathan to put suspicion on a nonexistent third party but maybe the two guys had told the truth and this sorenson he was allisons real partner maybe groote went out into the lobby and found sorenson waiting the man matched nathans description big blond with a wellcut suit and a rough face that preferred shadow im groote director of security at the hospital he offered a hand sorenson shook it but groote saw that he braced himself as though he suspected groote might try to yank his arm throw his balance sorenson jerked his head at the guard seated at the reception desk i need to talk to you privately regarding allison vance whats your interest thats best discussed alone groote led him back to a quiet conference room on the first floor shut the door he decided not to say hed heard the mans name before let the guy talk spin his web see what story sorenson had to peddle i acquire projects for aldistate groote knew the name a big international pharmaceutical and and we were interested in buying research from mr quantrill that hes testing at this hospital im just a security guy i think not sorenson said you were at allison vances house on tuesday shooting at people i observed you from the bathroom door you missed them i made you for a much better shot this was a guy he could deal with groote raised an eyebrow ill be damned they told me the truth they ruiz and raymond they said you were at her house i didnt believe them sorenson shrugged i went there to talk with allison vance i woke up badly tied with sheets sitting in a tub with a migraine that im still nursing why are you here mr sorenson allison vance approached one of our research directors a college friend of hers about a prototype drug being tested here called frost i dont think i could comment she offered to sell the frost research to us i think now she must have made that offer under the table sell it quantrill had been worried shed publicize it destroy their chances of getting it to market the bitch had been a mercenary it almost restored his faith in human beings as creatures of profit did you accept her offer no so why are you here now because weve received another offer to buy frost sorenson said groote said those would be stolen goods i suspect so goods that allison vance was murdered for michael raymond had killed her for frost and this was it confirmation of his theory so why not just buy it from him why come to me because were not going to buy stolen research mr quantrill despite loving the shadows is a known quantity and i believe knowing that aldistates coming to you with this information we can strike an accommodation on the pricing of frost before the auction auction yeah sorenson said whoever took the frost files from allison is staging an auction in four days i told quantrill this yesterday didnt you know heat built in his face in his chest sorenson noticed odd i figured your boss would have told you ive been told the opening bid is half of what quantrill would have asked its going to gut him the thief selling frost at cut rate but the drug would still get produced right if aldistate acquires the research frost would be the top priority for us i dont know about the others theres a certain amount of smokescreening to be done to cover up the researchs origins but if we work directly with quantrills team as opposed to buying it from a murderer and a thief with whom we could never consult on matters of research or testing frost could be produced faster sorenson shrugged you want me to make you a deal for frost a year or two of life for amanda were willing to pay mr quantrill quite well for frost but he cancels his auction you close down this thiefs auction and were the exclusive buyer youre a real humanitarian patients will get it sooner and i prefer not to deal with a murderer like michael raymond how do you know so much about him allison identified him as a patient who was helping her in acquiring the research i got the impression he was a very dangerous man a patient it wasnt what groote had expected to hear about michael raymond but your deals worthless if hes conducting an auction mr quantrill puts the word out to the other buyers that the research is flawed the buyers lose interest the deal is then between us and mr quantrill michael raymond needs to be dead so he doesnt tell the media or the fda frosts dirty secrets but i expect you can drop him i can help you i could arrange a meeting you could show up in my place michael raymond solved michael on a plate jesus that sounded sweet lets you and me make a deal of our own mr sorenson you want frost i want a reputable drug company that will get frost on the market i dont want to put my life on the line anymore just to make a bigger profit for quantrill and hurley sorenson kept an amused expression on his face im listening im just tossing out an idea ill deny it if you take it to quantrill but if you help me make sure michael raymond cant blow the whistle on the testing here aldistate gets frost ill give you the research myself if quantrill wont play sorenson smiled youre a bad boy screwing over your boss but i like you mr groote when aldistate starts the legitimate testing groote lost his voice for a second coughed his throat clear there is a person i would insist be involved if you can guarantee she gets frost not the placebo not a damn sugar pill sorenson nodded ill consider your proposition and ill keep it private one request while im here might i see nathan ruiz why allison was supposed to provide him as an interview subject to our researchers forget he attacked you he was scared i dont wish him ill but id like to examine a patient whos benefited from frost all right hes upstairs he ran from us but got roughed up so hes not the picture of health right now let me said sorenson be the judge of that a knock sounded on the door groote opened it the frontdesk guard stood there frowning leaning close in worry you have another visitor his name is deshawn pitts and says hes a federal marshal and he wont leave until he speaks to someone in charge the feds he glanced at sorenson wait here for a minute sorenson stood i dont need the hassle of the feds ill leave wrong theyd come in force if they were in arrest mode this is one guy let me find out what he wants and ill be back in a few sorenson gave the slightest of nods and groote closed the door he knew he was doubleflipping on a tightrope cutting a deal without quantrill and now a fed showing up after business hours he sauntered into the lobby hand out for a hearty shake saying hi im dennis groote exfbi im the security director what can i do for you today twentysix celeste answered the door telling herself pretend youre back on the island playing the game get him to open up you can do it find his weakness and play against it hello ms brent he said im sorry to show up without warning but i picked up my phone messages while i was close to your home and thought id stop by i appreciate it celeste nodded come in he stepped into her fortress and celeste gestured him to the sofa let the shrink sit on the couch for a change she settled in a leather chair she wanted the power position in the room she put on a blank smile celeste brent had played dumb and helpless while manipulating her fellow players across a sandstrewn chessboard letting the alpha males thump their chests and strut their way out of the competition letting the bikiniclad nubiles claw each other spicing the competition with rumor and innuendo that never caught up with her rising above the backbiting to win the votes necessary to walk off with five million dollars she wanted to put a gleam in her eye show her guts show her resolve but not now she wasnt sure she could play the game fool this capable man she forced herself not to look toward the bedroom where miles was listening how are you he asked shocked by her death but coping his neutral expression didnt change im sure the last thing allison would want is for your treatment to be adversely affected by this tragedy do the police know what happened yet he shook his head it takes time i suspect a gas leak hurley leaned forward with an air of grave concern that was designed she decided to steady her you were one of the last people to see doctor vance we found her appointment schedule on her computer at the hospital did you make that appointment or did she celeste decided on the truth she stopped by here on her own is that an expectation you have of a therapist impromptu visits no she wanted to check on me she decided to put miless theory to the test weve been trying a mix of new ideas in my therapy and i seem to be handling the stress of my memories better naked surprise crossed his thin face and then he blinked and it was gone thats great ms brent what was she trying in your therapy i hate taking pills celeste said but she had me on a new antidepressant before our therapy sessions and the new pills definitely helped wonderful and she came by to monitor your progress with this new medicine a chill filled his voice i suppose she took the pills back from me did she say why she said i didnt need them anymore celeste lied then we talked sort of an abbreviated session did these pills have a name she called it some kind of compound but i dont recall the name he took a deep breath celeste guessed to collect his thoughts this will sound odd but did she seem nervous or frightened well she wasnt herself i wonder if she might have asked you for a favor what kind this is awkward to keep information safe for her perhaps on a computer disk celeste forced herself to frown in surprise why would she that day allison removed sensitive data from the hospital what kind of data id rather not say celeste let two beats pass i cant see allison doing anything unethical allison might have gotten involved with very bad people they might have forced her to take the data she lobbed a test at him then call the police he failed wed prefer not to of course hospitals hate scandal they hate dirty laundry he gave her a frown that suggested hed underestimated her sangre de cristo has nothing to hide and weve already reported the theft he backpedaled if she stole it what reason would she have to leave it here i dont think youve thought this through doctor hurley he leaned back from her pride clearly stung he was not a good poker player may i call you celeste i feel as if i know you from your tv days he dumped sugar in his tone now i must know if she left anything with you for safekeeping youre not betraying her trust if you help me no she brought nothing but her briefcase celeste kept her voice steady she sat in the same chair youre sitting in and we talked and she left celeste decided to play the trump card see how he reacted it would either prove or disprove miless theory wait i was finishing up a late lunch when she stopped by and she asked to borrow my computer she was expecting an important email and wanted to check her account on the web were you with her i dont stand over peoples shoulders while they read their email she was alone for about five ten minutes while i finished eating his face paled his lips tightened and he seemed to be steadying himself for an unwelcome task i appreciate your honesty celeste but i suspect i have unwelcome news those pills she took back from you were they white yes im afraid youll need to come to the hospital with me no im agoraphobic i dont leave my house you were given medications that could have interacted badly with your other meds he said we need to get you tested no i can sedate you if you prefer but i must insist for your own good no a shift in his eyes and she was afraid of him now he wore the simmering glare of a child unused to refusal he stood tented his hands celeste this is a medical emergency and i can compel you to come with me i said no you cant take care of yourself at home youre not better youre worse just imagine and he took a step toward her you started cutting yourself again really bad and just imagine i found you bleeding suicidal and then the soft click of a gun miles stood behind hurley celestes gun at the doctors head and just imagine you sit down and start talking hurley froze miles shoved hurley back onto the couch do no harm is supposed to be your motto its sure as hell not mine youre making a mistake hurley said it doesnt feel like a mistake miles said you okay celeste nodded if youre interested in the white pills miles said i can help you hurley said i hope we can work out a deal the deal is you answer my questions i dont blow your brains out miles said celeste got up from the chair retreated toward the kitchen thats the deal doctor dolittle you already have frost if youre allison vances partner hurley said im not sure what else you can negotiate for tell me the truth about frost he put the gun close to hurleys head medicine to tranquilize those suffering from ptsd it makes the trauma bearable so therapy can be more effective miles glanced at celeste these white pills they make you sleepy she shook her head not sleepy calm allison had you take one before therapy right hurley said celeste nodded thats right it dulls the traumatic memory so that the person can talk about the trauma more easily hurley said but celeste and nathan ruiz didnt know they were being tested hurley didnt answer and miles prodded him with the gun no one knows i didnt know she was giving it to celeste where is nathan ruiz he he escaped from us weve had no word from him i suppose hes hiding or dead he raised an eyebrow hes dangerous you know to himself to you if he gets a chance the medicines not helping him hurley shrugged whos the guy whos hunting me ill tell you hurley said if you give me frost listen you want to take down that guy ill give you a bonus hes crazy no offense none taken miles said youre trying to tell me hes not on your side hurley nodded ill help you so you can get rid of him ill set it up but you give me frost hurley attempted a smile an awful frightened flex hes not going to let you walk hell kill you for it i dont have frost hope lit hurleys eyes were the files burned up with allison i dont know whats on these files all the research notes the chemical formulae videos of the patients during the testing everything to prove frost is effective hurley shook his head if you really dont have frost then you played the wrong bluff with him hes sure you do who is he i dont have a reason to help you now miles frowned celeste please go into the other room close the door ill use the silencer it shouldnt be too bad he winked at her her eyes wide celeste shook her head dont kill him please dont have to he wont tell me what we need to know she shook her head not understanding his bluff then he winked twice again and she got quiet if you have to she hurried into the kitchen you and i are not sitting across from a negotiating table doctor miles said im sitting with a gun at your head now answer my questions whos hunting me twentyseven my name is deshawn pitts the tall man said shaking grootes hand im with the us marshals service and i need to talk to you regarding a person of interest groote noticed pitts wore finger braces on his left hand two fingers broken and his bruised face announced hed been on the losing end of a recent fight happy to help where were you with the bureau pitts asked fifteen years in the los angeles office now youre for hire the parent company of the hospital retained me he realized he was talking too much but he always did when he was around other feds old habits his colleagues had always made him nervous hyperaware as though they could see the shadow hed become after cathy died and amanda got sick he brought pitts to hurleys firstfloor office two doors down from the conference room where sorenson waited you said you wanted to talk about a person of interest pitts took a seat yes and youll forgive me if i skimp on details a person of interest that were trying to locate his name is michael raymond received a call on his cell phone from this hospital two days ago i need to know who tried to call him groote kept his face impassive but thought oh hell when i tried to call mr back again and got no answer michael raymond the names not familiar to me who is this michael raymond and why is he screwing everything up for me groote cleared his throat and typed on the computer keyboard in hurleys office let me check the visitor logs he collected his thoughts while he scanned the log he hasnt visited us i can email the staff ask if anyone knows him not quite yet his psychiatrist was allison vance have you heard about this explosion hes a patient of hers nathan was telling the truth of course its a tragedy and you thought he might seek help from us hes delusional he believes that he needs to right doctor vances death groote raised an eyebrow does he believe he bears responsibility deshawn pitts pointed to doctor hurleys nameplate on the door hurleys your psychiatric chief i think i should wait and discuss this mans mental state with the doctor you understand of course i didnt mean the question in a medical context but in terms of security if this man is a danger to the hospital i want to know what kind of threat he is i dont think hed hurt anyone but if he shows up i want you to call me immediately at this number detain him if you can call you and call the police no just call me its critical that i locate him without a lot of public fuss groote raised an eyebrow again i could be of much greater help to you if i knew exactly who this man was im sorry i cant go into details searching for a man but you cant say that youre searching for him interesting groote thought more than interesting a situation with very few plausible explanations is this man wanted by the marshals service is he a fugitive as i said hes a person of interest and we dont want to make a big production this man knows the truth about my target groote realized and he measured on an internal scale the risk of confrontation with pitts your boy doesnt believe the fire was caused by a gas leak no and this investigation its part of his delusion possibly hes suffering from severe posttraumatic stress disorder you know its possible that your guy called doctor hurley hurley knew doctor vance the psychiatric community heres not that big perhaps the call was hurley returning a call from your guy he tapped fingertips against the table pretended to think hurley mentioned an odd call the other day then i need to speak with doctor hurley you and he could help me bring this guy in groote seized the opening im not in the business of laying traps for people legally im in quicksand if mr raymond shows up i detain him and call you and you have no just cause pitts clicked tongue against teeth you said you were exfbi yes whyd you leave family tragedy deshawn said excuse me but i need to make a phone call certainly theres a private room next door he ushered deshawn into the room an interview room used in consulting with patients walls are padded deshawn said a hint of distaste in his voice yes groote said without comment and closed the door hit the door twice when youre done then he hurried back to the computer in hurleys office activated the hidden camera in the soft fabric of the wall every room had these cameras ready for use when hurley needed them a mike paired to the camera and he snapped a window on the computer open adjusted the sound jimmy i need background on dennis groote former fbi field agent in los angeles pitts said the mike wasnt powerful enough to pick up the response deshawn waited on the phone groote already knew the answer would be glowing his record was clean pitts was asking first to ensure that groote was who he said he was and second that please god please groote could be trusted they want to find him but they dont want the locals to know a manhunt is on so hes one of their fugitives but he slipped the leash doesnt make sense a fugitive wouldnt be working at an art gallery wouldnt be seeing a psychiatrist regularly no michaels not a fugitive so what is he a marshal hunts fugitives but why hunt a fugitive and not let the cops know why protect the bad guy that way protect the word echoed in grootes head michael raymonds not a fugitive hes a witness uhhuh pitts said into the phone he was now wearing the bored expression of someone getting a record read to him meanwhile inspiration struck groote he opened another window feed on the rooms camera jumped back on the digital tape watched deshawn hit a speed dial the number flashed on the phones screen groote scribbled the number down on a postit note and slipped it into his pocket he killed the second window on the live camera deshawn pitts said uhhuh okay three more times groote picked up the phone and dialed the number he got routed to another marshal since deshawn pitts was already on jimmys line us marshals service groote made his voice a hoarse whisper jimmy need jimmy right now need help whos speaking please ill only talk to jimmy only to a witsec inspector hes got to help me hold on sir and groote clicked off the phone a witness michael raymond was a federal witness one they had lost one they needed to find hes suffering from severe posttraumatic stress disorder find him without a lot of publicity a witness who had run but guys who walked away from the program were on their own except this one who must still be of particular value on the camera screen deshawn pitts closed his phone he pounded the flat of his hand against the fabric twice groote went to the door let pitts out led him back into the office everything okay yes you check out outstanding service record call gomez at your old field office hell vouch for me and this operation you wont be at legal risk thank you could you give me doctor hurleys number now i want to arrange a meeting with him pitts said if you think hell help hes very civicminded groote said ill call him for you he flipped open his own phone hurley would soil himself trying to get celeste brent back to the hospital sedated and ready to talk if a federal agent phoned him he dialed hurleys number smiling politely twentyeight hurley coughed dried his mouth against the back of his wrist the mans name is dennis groote hes from california whos he work for miles jabbed the gun harder against hurleys skull a man named quantrill whos quantrill hes my boss where do i find him santa monica california whats the connection with sorenson i dont know any sorenson lying is a bad idea doctor i shot a man its easier i suspect the second time nice of you to share andy said leaning against the wall shoot him miles hes useless kill again it wont make you better or worse miles took his finger off the trigger but dug the barrel of the gun harder into the back of hurleys head the pressure spilled the words faster from hurley i dont know any sorenson i swear to god the cell phone in hurleys pocket rang playing a bach toccata im supposed to be checking in i dont groote will come straight here miles believed him you buy us time play dumb answer it hurley gently dug the flip phone from his pocket opened it yes hello miles kept the gun close on hurley knelt so he could hear doctor hurley its dennis groote i spoke with celeste brent she knows nothing understood there is a gentleman from the federal government in the lobby he wants to speak to you about a patient of doctor vances a man named michael raymond i know youre very busy right now miles prodded hurley with the gun mouthed tell him no i cant see anyone hurley said not now tomorrow i strongly suggest you should make time now doctor this takes precedence we could be of service to the authorities they need to find mr raymond hurley froze miles mouthed no again tomorrow hurley said not today i cant my hands are full a pause miles could hear grootes frustrated sigh all right ill set up a meeting for tomorrow tell the officer thankyou for his patience understood i have to go now hurley said goodbye bye groote hung up miles closed the flip phone celeste edged back into the room i know you wont want to celeste but you need to leave miles said isnt that for me to decide she said quietly these people are dangerous you cant stay but i dont know anything i dont have what they want allison stole computer files then used your computer there has to be a reason might be she thought they were monitoring her system but theyre not going to leave you alone until they find out if you have frost celeste sank into a chair your friend you mentioned could you call her have her come pick you up and put her in danger no this is a matter for the police i have to do this make it right for allison i promised her celeste stood up say she took the research and hid it on my computer or sent it to someone else or to herself in case she got caught or killed there will be an electronic trace up miles ordered hurley jabbing the gun into his back celeste please show me your computer the two men followed celeste down the hall pictures covered the walls celeste and a handsome young man on the beach on a patio clicking margarita glasses together celeste giving the man a kiss on the cheek and on the other side were a montage of photos he guessed from her brief television career she and nine other people standing on a beach her in a modest limegreen bikini looking alternately pensive crafty overjoyed chopping palm wood hauling herself over a stone barrier holding a check for five million dollars a dazzling smile as bright as summer he and hurley followed celeste into her study her computer a new highend number sat on a maple table in the corner the room smelled of cleanser and celestes tangerine shampoo and miles wondered if she washed her hair a lot if she scrubbed her skin till it ached cleansing herself of guilt it had not occurred to him andys blood seemed as permanent as a tattoo on his hands the faint odor of antiseptic hung in the air like a womans perfume celeste sat at the computer and started to type i want you to know i had nothing to do with allisons death neither did groote hurley said what about sorenson he planted a bomb there celeste paled how do you know ill explain later he put the gun back on hurley while she hunts you tell me about quantrill there are consultants off the payrolls who find promising research for the drug companies to develop further quantrill is one how long have you worked on frost a year the refinements to frost are my ideas you know youre stealing my ideas i dont think she used an email program celeste said she erased the browsers history file possibly she used an ftp program ftp hurley asked file transfer protocol a kind of program used to upload files from one system to another people use them all the time in building web sites moving the web sites files from their computer to the host system ive got one celeste opened a folder here every upload creates a log entry itll list any files uploaded to another system from this computer silence while celeste hunted she did use it heres a whole series of files uploaded to a remote web server heres the address she hit a keyboard command the printer spooled out the log for her we need to find who has that ip address celeste went back to typing querying the servers url against an internet database its registered to a mercury mountain hosting but theres no information as to where the servers located i know how to trace the server but i need additional software miles said you know mercury mountain doctor no ive never heard of the company but ill make you a deal we contact them we get frost back together ill get groote off your ass one word from me to quantrill and he leaves you alone you stay silent you get the drug first you get your heads straight forever miles jabbed him with the gun im not shutting up hurley gave him the glare of a man emptied of patience you arent very smart at playing hero you dont want to go there not the two of you not two fuckedup messes who cant talk without waving a gun in a face or dont dare step outside because your fear cripples you he practically spat his words at celeste i can give you your lives back free of the nightmares free of the trauma all we need is your silence miles thought of sorensons strange promise echoing in his head what if you could forget the worst moment of your life hurley said celeste im sorry i frightened you but frost could cure you isnt that what you want miles stepped back from him celeste is there any copy of what she uploaded to this remote server still on your system im searching the hard drive but no not so far i dont want the good doctor to see anything else we find okay her voice was steady and she took her hands off the keyboard you say you wont be silent are you going to kill him no he said then he added a lie but i wont let him hurt us either hurley said youre making a grave mistake michael surprise spread across celestes face you said your name was miles it is he thinks its michael long story hes lied to you celeste his names michael and theres a federal cop at the hospital asking for him hurley said you cant trust him ive only tried to help you to protect you how did you know my name miles said he thought back to hurleys arrival he had never spoken his fake name or his real name and neither had celeste realization hit hurley had lied you do have nathan yes the fed wanting to talk to hurley about michael raymond why what had groote said we could be of service to the authorities what did that mean one thing setting a trap for miles one designed by the feds and executed by groote and hurley had put groote off for no real reason and knowing how badly hurley and groote wanted miles groote would be suspicious celeste he hollered we got to go we have to leave groote could be heading here right now so could the feds but he didnt say that she would argue to stay and he couldnt leave her alone celeste shook her head no i cant we have to go now she shook her head her hands began to tremble no no i cant i cant leave ill take you to my friend deshawn he said he got up and moved past hurley screw this hed give himself up to witsec he couldnt see her trembling and broken and hurt they knew enough for the police to expose allisons killers and this medical research shed died to stop he was crazy to think he could set the world back to rights for the lost allison for himself for anyone a needle slid into his neck he wrenched his head away from hurley miles tumbled over a chair grabbed at his throat fumbled fingers over the syringe pulled it free from his flesh he fell back in the chair miles screamed as hurleys thumbs gouged into his eyes with calm surgical precision he tried to kick away from the doctor but hurley dug a nail into the soft corner of miless eyes intent on popping the orbs from his skull he tried to aim the gun past the agony in his face and one hand went from his eyes seized the gun from his hand miles closed his hands around hurleys wrists lifted and pushed the barrel pressed against his lips in a cold kiss as he heard celeste screaming then the barrel jerked away from his mouth miles pulled his knees between himself and hurley with a mighty effort kicked back tore his face free of hurleys claws he couldnt see his eyes blinded in pain his head loose and light as a stringless balloon then the gun boomed celeste screamed then sudden silence twentynine groote didnt like the conversation with hurley not a bit it made no sense passing up an opportunity to help find raymond raymond maybe raymond was there with hurley at celestes house but how would he know about celeste because allison had told him jesus he had been in it with allison he called hurleys cell phone again it rang and rang no answer their plan was off the rails and crap groote had sorenson in one office this fed in the other caught between them hurley would have to fend on his own for a few minutes groote gave deshawn pitts a shrug im sorry you know doctors they always leave you waiting doctor hurleys dealing with a suicidal patient he may not be available until tomorrow then ill check back with him in the morning groote walked the officer out with hearty handshakes and then stood at the window pittss car remained in the lot the officer sitting behind the drivers wheel talking on his phone just hurry up and go please finally pitts drove away he tried hurleys cell phone again no answer he went back to the conference room sorenson sat there drinking coffee wheres your fed sorenson asked gone why the visit its nothing to concern you i still want to see ruiz i have some other very pressing business to attend to right now our deals based on me seeing ruiz sorenson said ive helped you you help me it wont take but a few minutes groote decided but lets make it quick follow me thirty brian miles curled on the floor focus blinking back into his eyes pain speared his head and the voice was hardly above a whisper he raised his head from the tile scuffed leather soles lay inches away from his face he blinked again past the salt of the tears jerked to his feet forcing his eyes to stay open hurley lay sprawled on the floor throat an open wound breath a gurgle the sounds of the gunshot echoed in his bones made him want to close his eyes surged bile into the back of his throat but celeste was more important than his fear celeste lay crumpled before him the gun in her hands he spoke and his tongue weighed like lead in his mouth its all right celeste give me the gun brian he wont hurt you he wont hurt you anymore i promise i promise i promise celeste said miles crawled to hurley fumbled at the mans wrist the pulse faded then stopped brian were safe all right were safe from him i never should have let him in the house celestes voice down to a trickle miles lurched away from her away from the dead man leaned over the sink threw cold water in his face he tasted blood in his mouth and thought if he tore out my eye there would be more pain right or would i just be in shock his fingers probed at his face blood oozed in the skin between his eyes and the bridge of his nose he rinsed it away he managed to open his eyes inspected his face in the mirror of a hutch that sat in the breakfast nook his eyes were bloodied but both whole brian now celestes voice rose again she flinched at him as he came out of the kitchen mopping at his face with a dish towel holding out his hand celeste im not brian im miles remember miles he knelt by her and held out his hand give me the gun she crawled away from the dead man youre not brian no im miles i my house my husband its okay celeste let me help you its now not then celeste stopped shivering nodded put her face in her hands he came into my house she said he came into my house and he killed brian he made me wait with him waiting for brian to come home so he could kill him in in front of me her voice was low and guttural as though it belonged to a shadow not a person im so sorry she gestured at hurleys body i got the gun to make him stop just to stop but i really killed him miles picked up the syringe hurley must have had the injection in his lab coat a perfectly good place to hide one probably to sedate celeste bring her to the hospital for he didnt want to think hurley hadnt gotten the whole dose in him but enough to make him numb and sick and to clog his head celeste listen his voice sounded thick in the air the man who hurt you who killed your husband hes not here hurley was trying to kill me you saved me do you understand he forced himself to speak slowly and calmly now she nodded will you give me the gun she clutched the gun close to her tshirt never again i swore the cameras the locks never again fort celeste i made this place fort celeste she wasnt listening to him we cant stay here groote could be on his way we have to go now celestes voice started to break i have a dead man on my floor i want him gone i want you gone and my home back i know you do but here youre a sitting target please give me the gun she handed him the pistol along her arms a web of paperthin scars scrolled toward the elbows she saw him notice i dont cut myself anymore she said im better thats great celeste thats wonderful he tucked the gun in the back of his pants tried to think through the sedative haze what are you going to do now she asked im going to get you safe and then im going to get nathan ruiz out of that hospital how he went and searched in hurleys pocket found an electronic passkey a set of regular keys walk in and take him who is he to you the key to finding out the truth but they still have him locked up but this grootes at the hospital not necessarily hes out hunting for me with the key and a gun i can walk in get nathan out thats absolutely crazy she said she shook her head and i cant leave the house she spoke as though hed just informed her the world was flat you were brave enough to help me youre brave enough to walk through a door its just a door walk the hell out of it i cant ill hold your hand miles said you can sit on the floor of the car keep your eyes closed stay away from the windows pretend the worlds not there he closed his hand around hers he will come here hell kill you she crawled to her purse dug out a bottle of antidepressants swallowed one dry ill try he slowly got to his feet bringing her to her feet as well she stepped around hurleys body with a choked moan dont trust him lady andy called from the corner bad idea miles shot andy the finger behind celestes back and opened the door for her he leaned out scanned the street first empty its okay celeste cringed at the world beyond the open door theres my car he had found a set of spare keys and driven blaines car to celestes home forty steps ill walk with you ill count just hold my hand she said and she closed her eyes and made the first step the spring breeze rustled in the cottonwoods ten steps she moaned he kept his eyes fixed on the street expecting a car to speed toward them and screech to a stop carrying groote carrying death youre doing great he said dont talk to me like im a toddler learning how to ride a freaking bike she started breathing in panicked hitches and he steadied his arm across her shoulders twenty steps the wind danced across her face and she flinched youve done this before he tried as a joke not knowing what the hell else to say celeste kept her eyes clenched shut been outside i used to love the outdoors brian and i and she swayed on her feet ive got you she took another step and another celeste made a low moan in her throat and walked faster stumbling her eyes clenched shut and miles guided her to blaines car he had left it unlocked and she stretched out on the backseat she folded her arms over her eyes he gritted his teeth and slid the key into the cars ignition if she could get out of the house he could drive the car again at least the sedative shot made him less panicky he just hoped he didnt drive the car into the ditch he started the car no boom he steered out onto the mud road where will you take me she asked a friends house well he doesnt know im hiding there hes out of town for a couple of days go to the hospital she said ill wait in the car now for allisons sake he floored the accelerator testing his reaction the haze from the drug seemed to fade overwhelmed by fear and adrenaline he wheeled left onto the first street he passed heading back toward the hilly rise leading to the hospital praying that groote was hunting him in the night far away from sangriaville thirtyone miles drove past a set of quiet homes past empty lots past the sangre de cristo hospital to canyon roads dead end an audubon society complex he uturned at the audubon gate and headed back down the road toward the hospital he went past the clinic giving it a curious scouting wondering if eyes in the building were watching him there was no security that suggested this facility housed anyone dangerous no wire only a high adobewall enclosure no guard posted waiting for that next chess move andy said show me the brilliance he wanted to tell andy to shut up but he didnt want celeste to hear him he uturned again wheeled blaines car into the hospitals parking lot parked near the back how will you find him inside she asked nathan mentioned the top floor when i saw him at allisons he said so im going straight to the top can you drive oh sure she said drivings easy compared with shooting if youre approached security guards anyone run go straight to the police or a friends house dont wait for me miles she said if allisons giving me frost i think it works i should be in a fetal position right now i killed a man i left the house but im coping nevertheless her voice shook and she swallowed struggling to steady it maybe its frost hurley acted surprised when i told him shed given me new pills or youre just strong he said she blinked at him ill be back as quickly as i can can you bear to sit in the front keep the engine running she nodded she climbed over the seat squirmed low in the passenger seat i should get out more often she said trying to joke she shivered ill be back in a minute he said run if you have to she nodded celeste she raised her eyes to his thank you you saved us both she swallowed go leave me your cell phone if i have to drive off call me ill come back for you he shut the door waited for her to click the locks and headed toward the hospitals rear parkinglot entrance every step made him want to run in the opposite direction a mental hospital the place hed feared the most as his mind started to play tricks on him as andy began to chime into his days and nights the place he was afraid allison would send him he kept walking toward the building if he could drive he told himself he could do this just walls just floors just people it wasnt a horror introduce me to the guard andy said thatll get you in real fast the main building was large with an adobe exterior four stories tall two smaller buildings stood behind it a gravel trail of roads snaking between them and the main house it had the air of an exclusive club more than the clinical lines of a psych hospital he guessed there were cameras on him right now surely they showed who came and went in the parking lot he ducked his head down most of the main buildings windows were darkened lights gleamed in the windows on the first floor he held the electronic passkey up to the reader on the door the panel light flicked from red to green and the door unbolted with a click he stepped inside at the end of this short hallway was a door with a conventional lock and he tried the three keys on hurleys ring the last one worked he expected to see a guard with a gun aimed at him when he opened the door miles cracked the lock went through the door and closed it behind him the hallway was empty the lights dimmed he took three deep breaths trying to clear his head of hurleys junk late night in the hospital his heart hammered in his chest he pulled out his gun stiffarmed it in front of him watched the steady red light of a mounted camera eyeing him down the hallway despite the sangre de cristos elegant architecture and immaculate grounds he wondered if every asylum wasnt designed by the same cracked architect immured behind bars deep inside one of his own creations locks at the end of every hallway bends and twists to confuse anyone who might risk a run light that had never been born of the sun hard and white and ugly he turned a corner and a guard was waiting for him ready a baton swinging hard at miless neck miles jumped back the baton smacked with bonecrushing force into the wall the backswing caught his shoulder and agony burst up from the well of nerves at the joint miles fell to the floor and the guard young with heavy features rammed the baton hard against his throat miles closed hands around the batons ends tried to push back the guard grinned and gritted teeth and shoved the baton bolstered by his own weight against miless windpipe darkness danced on the edge of miless vision but then miles thought of staying inside this place the doors closing and locking behind him faceless men strapping him to a bed confinement as sure as a coffin here forever locked up fear surged in his muscles and miles shoved back using the floor as leverage for his shoulders and arms the baton popped hard into the guards mouth then miles hit him again in the nose the guard reeled away from miles gasping miles fought him for the baton the guard wouldnt let go made a choking yell for jimmy and dwayne past the blood coursing from his mouth and nose miles powered the guards head into the wall bit the fingers holding the baton the guard let go miles dropped him with a blow on the back of the head the guard collapsed to the floor unconscious miles glanced up and down the hallway deserted he guessed these were offices and administration no patients or caretakers here a crackle and a buzz cut through the sudden silence a voice calling for robert he leaned over the guard an earpiece gleamed in the young guards ear cabled to a walkietalkie clipped to the shirt pocket miles removed the earpiece and walkietalkie and clipped them on himself robert you got him miles thumbed the button and spoke in a whispery rush that might camouflage his voice no he broke free from me headed to the elevator he found the elevator its doors open pressed four the top floor nothing four must be a secured floor he waved the electronic passkey over a panel above the buttons and a green light lit he tried again pressing four and this time the button glowed in answer then he stepped out of the elevator the doors slid shut and the elevator started its climb robert the other guards voice repeated through the earpiece i think hes headed to four on the elevator the diversion might leave the fourth floor stairwell clear for him he headed for an exit sign found the stairwell stairs were good elevators were bad the well was dimly lit he headed up the stairs expecting to see groote on the landing or a guard who hadnt bought his story but there was no one radio silence from the guards sweat slid down his cheek coursed down his back he forced himself to take each step andy stood at each turn of the stairs smirking miless breath tightened in his chest he reached the top floor tried the door locked he slid a key home worked the lock the door opened hello nathan sorenson said nathan opened his eyes tried to focus who my name is sorenson im a colleague of doctor vance we met oh so very briefly at doctor vances house nathan said nothing you hit me its okay i dont think you realized i was there to help you id like to talk to you for a minute sorenson took a step into the room groote followed him a step behind are you better nathan than you were when you first came to sangriaville nathan nodded glancing at groote thats wonderful to know sorenson said and in one brutal move he grabbed grootes arm wrenched it up while slamming groote into the steel door groote yelled and sorenson deftly twisted his arm groote screamed sorenson pounded his elbow twice into grootes face breaking the nose hammering the back of his head into the steel door groote collapsed to the floor sorenson kicked him once in the ribs then in the jaw groote went still sorenson leaned down seized grootes gun and raised it at nathan what have you told them i dont know what you mean i dont know anything ten seconds to rethink sorenson said what names did you give them i dont know what you mean please dont nathan yelled the soft buzz nearly made miles jump out of his skin then he realized the stairwell door was set to give off a ping when opened he closed the door quickly aware he was without cover but no one stood in the darkened hallway no guards at the elevator awaiting him the lift had already arrived and the doors closed again and he saw on the digital indicator the elevator had returned to the first floor probably set to do so automatically maybe the guards on the floor had seen the empty elevator and ridden down to help the battered robert he moved from the door close against the wall crouching low he inched down the hallway glancing through the wirereinforced glass in the doors beds with men asleep in them mostly younger guys but a scattering of men in their fifties and sixties none was nathan ruiz miles tested the doors all locked in for the night or perhaps to keep the patients out of the line of fire when the guards stepped out and mowed him down two rooms held women also asleep an office with a computer and a set of cameras empty the screens showing more deserted rooms he heard a soft choked cry from behind a metal door it read virtual reality treatment on the plate he pushed the door locked he tried hurleys passkey and the door clicked open he started to push and a technician was at the door reaching for the knob the other hand pulling a headset off his ears eyes widening in surprise as he saw miles miles hit him a solid punch in the jaw then another the guy folded miles eased him to the floor his hand stinging glancing over his shoulder sure someone had heard he shut the door he stepped into a darkened control room with a heavy pane of tinted glass beyond the glass a man floated suspended in midair on white cables jerking slightly his eyes covered by a heavy awkward visor his ears hidden under sleek silver headphones on the screen a computer game played out with sharp angles with televisionfalse colors with a muted soundtrack of soldiers moving through narrow alleys and broad dusty streets he peered at the picture men moving at night into an abandoned building fake stars in a vault of sky above them lights dimmed then bursts of light the world gone in flame and dust soldiers running and fighting the blasts of rocketpropelled grenades painting the sky the man jerked on his tethers a frown setting on his face a cry erupting from his throat the man wasnt nathan too short too blocky war miles thought but not a game what the hell was this place he stepped backward and the cord closed over his neck the pressure was sudden and strong miles tried to work his fingers under the cable to give himself breath and couldnt the technician twisted the cable tighter using his weight to force miles to stumble black dots shimmered in the air before him miles drove his foot hard on the technicians instep and heard a howl of pain he tried to lurch free of the cables grip kicked at the desk hit a keyboard and a mouse as he struggled trying to wrench the choking cord from the technicians hands his injured shoulder throbbed as he fought for leverage the blank monitors above him blinked to life paused computergenerated tragedies began to play similar to the war scene playing on the main monitor a crashing car cartwheeling across an interstate slamming into a big rig a plane flying into the world trade center a school bus erupting into flame miles spun and jerked hard to one side pulled the technician off balance the technician lost his grip miles felt sweaty hands abandon the cord and grab at his neck miles kicked back hard slammed the technician into the wall of screens miles threw back his head in a vicious ram connecting with the technicians face glass shattered and the tech cried out in pain the gripping hands around his throat eased and he jerked free he dropped to his knees grabbed the police baton hed dropped when hed tried to free himself from the cord he swung the baton up and buried it into the techs stomach the technician collapsed and miles carefully dealt him an extra blow on the back of the head he steadied his breath stepped away from the monitors and their looping horrors bile climbing into his throat a chill kissing his skin he tucked the walkietalkies earpiece back into place and heard the guards talking searching the first floor finding the unconscious robert in a hallway theyd be back here in a minute he had to find nathan ruiz and get out or theyd have him locked in here forever hooked up to that machine reliving his private hells horrible miles stepped back into the hall closed the door then heard the brief brutal sounds of a fight the clang of a body striking metal then a scream please dont he ran the door was partly open and in the thin shaft of light he saw a man sprawled on the floor another man standing his back to miles miles opened the door sorenson with a gun he started to pivot to fire and miles tackled him piledriving them both into the wall miles grabbed sorensons arm slammed it hard once twice three times against the wall trying to break sorensons grip on the gun he saw nathan ruiz with one arm handcuffed to a bed trying to move out of the aim of the wavering gun miles fought streetdirty he drove a knee into sorensons groin leaned down and bit hard on the bridge of sorensons nose sorenson screamed again and clubbed miles with the gun they toppled onto the bed nathan pounded sorensons head with his unbound fist miles wrenched the gun free from sorensons grip kill him nathan yelled miles put the gun on sorensons forehead who are you sorenson didnt speak who are you ive read all about you miles sorenson said and i dont think you can shoot in cold blood not again he knew his real name miles dragged sorenson off the mattress and cracked sorensons head once against the tile floor how do you know my name who the hell are you your only hope of staying alive sorenson said bullshit you killed allison you put the bomb in her office i saw you i didnt kill her i can explain but not here this is quantrills turf i know what i saw you see a lot of things miles you see andy sorenson grinned past the blood in his teeth you dont need to fight this war not alone let me help you andy he knew about andy who the hell are you he screamed sorenson jerked a thumb at nathan ask mr explosives about who really planted the bomb nathan shook his head in horror no hes lying i never hurt her he fell to the floor still handcuffed by one arm and closed his free hand around sorensons throat tightened the grip youre lying miles heard running in the hallway he ran to the door saw two guards approaching he fired high and the bullet creased the ceiling shattered a light and the guards fell back to the elevator he heard the gasps of strangulation behind him nathan and sorenson gripped each others throat sorenson gaining leverage and nathans face purpling miles yanked sorenson free from nathan but kept his throat in a grip move and ill shoot you sorenson went still pull the cuff tight miles ordered nathan nathan obeyed and miles aimed the gun on the narrow length of chain fired the link shattered and nathan ran for the door he started kicking the unconscious groote miles hauled sorenson to his feet pushed him against the wall last chance miles said who do you work for i can give you everything you want miles everything you need im not your enemy come with me and i can prove it kill him andy purred in his ear i dont believe you miles smashed the gun across sorensons face threw him into the wall the man collapsed eyes rolling into whites miles grabbed nathan did you hurt allison nathan shook his head i didnt i swear i didnt if i had i would have killed you when you stepped into her house who you gonna believe miles chose i believe you he heard the sliding hiss of the elevator doors the guards trying again the adrenaline surge was still high warring with the pain the guard and the tech had dealt him with the sedative hurley had dumped into him he fought down panic how many guards two or three most of the staff isnt allowed on this floor of course the fewer eyes to see the easier to illegally test drugs and if there were only three hed already downed one but two were still too many he risked a glance down the hall barely putting his head into a possible line of fire easing the gun out with him a guard stood five feet away pistol out leveled at miless head miles ducked back as the bullet hammered into the door frame throw your guns down miles yelled or i kill groote and sorenson silence for a moment slide the guns down the hall now they got ten seconds ten nine eight he wondered what the hell he would do if they called his bluff a gun slid along the tile stopped in front of him both of them another gun joined the first hope they only had the two miles thought he stuck his head out again two guards stood in the dimmed hallway murder in their eyes miles stepped out collected the guns flicked on the safeties crowded them into the back of his pants come on nathan he said quietly he kept his gun leveled at the guards nathan stepped out into the hallway in his hands he held the police baton miles had stolen youre not going to get out dumbshit one guard said were in lockdown then youre going to come with me and unlockdown it miles said i cant youll damn well figure it out miles grabbed the guards arm pushed him along mister please i got kids the guard said shut up nathan stepped past them and cracked the baton into the second guards stomach he bent double vomited moaned they hurt me nathan said in a distant whisper hurt me hurt me we didnt the first guard said groote did not us okay not us miles could hear patients yelling and hitting fists against their doors roused by the ruckus screaming questions miles handed nathan the passkey and nathan bolted ahead opening the stairwell door miles hurried the guard past the doors and down the stairs at a run are the other patients in immediate danger i dont think so nathan dashed ahead of him leaping five stairs at a time get behind me miles yelled but the younger man paid him no heed recklessly barreling down the four flights of stairs miles half sliding down the metal railings to keep up the haze from hurleys dope burned away his fear fueled him but he didnt know how long the energy would last they hit the parkinglot exit door at the bottom of the stairwell the passkey no longer worked locked trapped miles thought his heart would burst through his skin sorenson shook off the pain and the dizziness and stepped out in the hallway he saw the guard still retching from the blow to his stomach he tightened his grip on his gun he could kill the guard kill groote but he didnt want to waste a moment or a bullet which way he asked the guard the hurt guard stopped heaving his guts long enough to point at the stairwell then he handed sorenson an electronic key itll override locks sorenson grabbed the passkey and ran how do we open the doors miles yelled into the guards face control panel lobby miles shoved the guard through the hallway exit from the stairwell all of them running and as they rounded a corner into another hallway leading to the lobby he glanced back and saw the stairwell door opening then sorenson in the dim light miles shoved nathan and the guard forward and a bullet screamed from the doorway hot as a devils finger as it rocketed past the nape of his neck he dived for the cover of the corner as a second bullet pocked the wall an inch above where his head had been the guard broke into a run for the lobby door nathan launched himself into the guard with all the grace of a zombie a screaming raving fury they fell to the ground and miles pulled nathan off the man shoved them both toward the door keeping the gun trained on the corner you unlock the doors nathan screeched at the man waggled his tongue and his fingers as though all sanity had abandoned him or i will kill kill kill you the guards face paled they ran into the lobby nathan shoved the guard to the computer he with trembling hands entered in a key miles heard the locks click miles shoved the guard to the floor told him to lie flat and be still the guard obeyed please jesus let us out be open his fear was like a fire on his skin they hit the doors stumbled into the brisk cool of the dark night ran hard toward the parking lot sorenson advanced carefully to the lobby listened heard only the rattle of breathing of the frightened guard he stepped into the lobby front door the guard said they went through the front door there ought to be another gun in this drawer sorenson ran past the man tested the door decided they wouldnt be waiting on the other side to ambush him and ran after them he saw them fleeing in the low gleam of the lights and ran as silently as he could his pistol stiffarmed in front of him keeping nathan ruizs head in his sights this way miles pointed to the rear of the parking lot and they weaved along hunkering low behind them an alarm shattered the quiet you got a car yes weve got to be gone before the cops get here they wont call the cops nathan said trust me a bullets whine pierced the air and nathan fell frantic a scream choked in his throat miles whirled and saw sorenson two rows of cars away aim pivoting toward him miles fired in answer and sorenson dropped but not like he was hit the parking lot was a maze of cars some slots filled others empty miles grabbed nathan who probed at his hair at his scalp for evidence of a hit and shoved him below the line of car windows im okay nathan mumbled stay low they worked their way through the cars miles panicking that sorenson could simply step out into the row at the same time that they did and pick them both off if sorenson was close enough hed hear them run into the parking aisles open space kill them with two rapidfire shots and if celeste saw them coming if she stood next to the car sorenson could gun her down he put a hand over nathans mouth listened to the silence the nights quiet fell on them he fought back the surge of fear i cant let sorenson just kill this kid he forced himself to wait to listen past the drumming of his own heart eleven seconds later he heard a scrabble of stone against a shoe two cars to his right miles dropped to the pavement fired under the cars into the blackness he heard a yell of fury a body leaping onto a car in retreat miles shoved nathan and they ran miles turned and fired he saw sorenson drop off the trunk of a car either hit or diving for cover miles stumbled but nathan caught him pulled him up to his feet miles spotted blaines car in the low dazzle of the lots lights the car stood empty celeste was gone celeste he screamed celeste the trunk opened she peered out at him what the hell he yelled its nicer in here she whispered out now now now we got to go and the crack of a bullet broke above him demolishing a window in the car parked next to them he whirled saw dark figures sorenson and two guards approaching a blaze of fire from the barrel of two guns bullets pocketing the trunk of the car next to him shooting to kill miles dropped to a knee trying to remember to breathe aimed his hand shaking blinking past andys face and pulled the trigger once twice three times laying down a round of fire he heard himself screaming a crazy man behind him blaines old car roared into life miles flinched but no bomb nathan was behind the wheel celeste ducking into the backseat miles kept his wavering gun aimed at the darkness he saw one guard running toward them miles shot out the window of the car closest to the man and the guard ducked and stayed down miles followed celeste into the backseat nathan powered the car out of the slot miles fired at their pursuers until the clip emptied they roared past sorenson and the guards through a sputtering hail of bullets ricochets flying off the car roof miles covered celeste with his body protecting her nathan swung the car out fast and hard onto the narrow winding trail of canyon road he hit sixty in ten seconds crouched low next to the wheel who are you man miles kendrick his old name didnt seem to fit him right anymore like a shirt worn once ill fitting and ugly not to be worn again he sat up pulling up celeste looking behind him no pursuit not yet your drivers license said your name was michael it needs updating my names miles but i really am a patient of doctor vances so is this woman her name is celeste nathans gaze flickered to celeste in the rearview whyd you come get me i need you i want to know the truth about why allison died ill drop you off but the car stays with me i got to get far away from them wrong we should stay together miles said i dont like nathan andy said from the other side of celeste i like him even less than i like you go ahead and shoot him before he hurts you you think you can trust this guy you better find out what the hell sorenson meant by mr explosives nathan veered onto cerro gordo the road that led past allisons house and miles expected to hear the scream of police sirens but nothing and the road behind them was black and empty the night lay quiet closing its dark fist around the car stay together nathan said why we can fight better together i dont want to fight he started then stopped but i dont want to hide the rest of my life either i have a place we can hide where we can decide how to stop these people stop them from what killing us nathan shook his head i cant go to the police my folks theyll just send me to another loony bin i dont need it anymore neither do we i dont know how groote and sorenson connect but theyll be after us we know what allison stole from the hospital and i think we know how to find it before groote and sorenson do we do that they cant hurt us theres another guy doctor hurley we know he tried to kill me celeste stopped him permanent stop permanent nathan gave her a thumbsup honey i could kiss you she shuddered but dont worry nathan said i wont his grin ecstatic at his freedom went wide and manic so where do we go dude were free birds free free free miles wondered in helping nathan what dangerous genie hed let out of the bottle thirtytwo you hit sir the guard asked he missed me sorenson said barely he imagined he could feel the heat where the bullet had just missed his ankle i think i hit one the guard said huffing for breath he was the one whod taken the blow to the guts the window i got him we should you should have aimed for the tires hed emptied his own clip too soon and was furious with himself is the alarm system keyed to the police absolutely not the guard said were under orders not to call the police ever mr quantrill doesnt want them around not calling the cops made sense sorenson had no desire to bring unwelcome official attention to the hospital it had served its purpose he turned from the guards without another word and headed toward his car hey mister wait a goddamn second one of the guards caught him by the arm and sorenson swiftly stopped levered his arm free brought his elbow back into the guards face the nose gave way with a sickening crack and the man collapsed with a howl sorenson glanced at the other guard whod raised his gun your clips empty sos mine he grabbed the brokennose guard by the throat hes a big boy but i can break the neck with a strong twist before you take two steps so drop the gun and i drive away and then you go get your friend a doctor the second guard looked into sorensons eyes he slowly set the gun down kicked it away without being told sorenson kept his grip on the guards throat until he reached his car then he shoved the man to the asphalt in contempt groote knew he was an enemy now and nathan remained a threat and he was with miles kendrick who despite being mentally ill had the skills and apparent guts to fight back sorenson wheeled out hard into the night kendricks car was gone he had to find kendrick and ruiz now or failing that set a trap for them one that they wouldnt see coming thirtythree nathan drove the car behind the adobe wall at blaine the pains house his hands gripped the wheel as though fused to the plastic nathan be cool miles started nathan pulled trembling hands free from the wheel suddenly he seized the rearview mirror tried to wrench it free from the ceiling miles leaned forward and grabbed his arms what the hell calm down can we go inside now please celeste shivered as though shed fallen into snow nathan aimed the mirror away from his face miles helped celeste out hurried her under the shelter of the porch nathan followed them miles opened the front door and held his breath tried to imagine the explanation he would give if blaine was back from texas mr blaine its michael from the gallery miles called no answer blaine was still out of town miles flicked on a kitchen light leaving the other lamps doused if the neighbors knew blaine was out of town he didnt want to increase suspicion celeste collapsed on the couch pulled her knees close to her chest nathan scanned the room as if he were stepping on enemy territory miles shut the front door behind him we can stay here at least for tonight is it safe nathan ran from room to room as though he expected a shambling horror to lurch out from a dark corner miles followed him were fine i promise is this your house how many doors how many windows nathan went into the hallway bathroom and a few seconds later miles heard a sudden sharp crack he pushed past nathan what the hell the mirror stood broken a vicious crater in its center cracks radiating outward nathan dropped a heavy soap dish to the floor i hate mirrors nathan retreated from the shattered glass why miles took him by the shoulders kept his voice calm you can tell me his jaw trembled his eyes held a haunting fear they they look at me from the mirrors my friends your friends that died in iraq how do you know nathan lurched away from him running down the hall i dont want them to see that im here miles caught him at the bedroom entrance staring at a mirror atop a bureau they cant see you they cant but i see them they went away for a while but theyre coming back they live in the mirror and its not my fault it wasnt my fault miles steered him away from the mirror well cover the mirrors okay celeste help me miles took nathan into the messy kitchen dirty dishes piled the sink a sour odor rising from the trash nathan sank to the floor find towels or blankets cover every mirror you can find please miles said to celeste she seemed much steadier with four walls around her and she nodded and left the room nathan pull it together man youve come so far tonight you cant lose it stay steady its like withdrawal i was better now im worse nathan startled with a jerk as a car rumbled in the street frost theyd been feeding him frost and probably hed gotten his last dose on tuesday maybe the drugs effects started fading without a daily dose nathan shrugged miless hands off his shoulders closed his eyes steadied his breathing celeste ran back into the kitchen i covered all the mirrors she knelt by them youre bleeding your legs and miles saw spatters of blood dried and fresh on the scrubs he wore nathan ignored her he reached a finger out toward her face and she flinched back you were on castaway holy smoke she nodded so you killed hurley he was a bad guy bad doctor bad breath bad hair nathan laughed a broken giggle you did a good deed maam now if someone would kill groote for me if i dont get to do it myself no ones killing anybody miles said celeste reached for nathans face no nathan backed away from her dont touch me just let me check celeste spoke in a soft voice quiet and reassuring he stopped his retreat across the kitchen nathan tensed while celeste touched his jawline inspected his face a swollen lip a slight cut on the cheek with a bruise rising underneath it they punched you just once or twice his voice shook then hoses on my back let me see celeste eased up the back of nathans shirt a quilt of vicious bruises covered his spine groote stuck a screwdriver against my bones it hurt tears came into his eyes and he shuddered he shoved up his sleeves pulled bandages off his arm and showed them the constellation of welts deep bloodied punctures cut down to the bone jam the screwdriver against the bone then turn they did it on my legs too patch me up then do it again he gritted his teeth oh my god celeste said ill see if theres a firstaid kit she ran from the kitchen i cant go crazy again nathan said in a hoarse whisper i cant i wont let that happen miles said and nathan laughed a short broken giggle you got spare sanity in your pocket nathan asked i know what you survived nathan miles said in a low voice you dont know anything man not a thing about me you dont want to celeste ran back into the room carrying gauze and bandaids and an antiseptic gel get the scrubs off miles helped nathan stand grimacing from the pain nathan shucked the scrubs down to his knees purple dominated the back of his legs where groote had whipped the hoses four brutal gouges marred his leg celeste medicated and bandaged the wounds these wounds are deep he needs a doctor no nathan said youre risking infection celeste said no nathan said again no doctors we cant let groote find us miles rummaged in the cabinet found aspirin poured a palmful into nathans hand got him a glass of water nathan ate the aspirin like candy a few at a time he wiped the white dust from the tablets onto his shirt finished the water thank you his eyes went glassy with exhaustion when was the last time you ate miles asked him tuesday miles rummaged in blaines nearly bare refrigerator found a fancyseeded bread and jam cracked open a new jar of peanut butter and made them all sandwiches nathan devoured his dinner in seconds shivering with hunger miles sat on the floor across from nathan you know what frost is yes allison told me its medicine to cure your trauma she told me when she got me the passkey said i had to run nathan wiped a hand across his mouth at first i thought frost was the code name for the virtualreality treatments they give us he explained how the vr treatments worked confirming what miles had seen in the tech room they made you relive the bombing miles said bombing celeste asked im a war hero nathan sat up straighter iraq i volunteered after i wanted to fight the good fight protect the country i love brave of you celeste said softly he ducked his head in embarrassment during the invasion i was with a battery company thirty miles out of baghdad we launched our missiles right after midnight on target for a palace of saddams but a us jet pilot got confused got bad info he believed we were republican guard he fired a heatseeker he paused swallowed kept his gaze on his feet killed four of my buddies nearly killed the rest of us im sorry man miles said parts of my friends hit me i got a broken nose from a leg flying into my face miles and celeste said nothing because words had no power now i got hurt in the blast just burns he pointed to the peppering of scars on his cheek and nose but it messed me up inside i couldnt i couldnt do my duty anymore ptsd celeste said its not your fault pathetic terrible stupid disorder nathan said thats what i call it i got freaky id go nuclear in two seconds flat beat up an orderly at the psych ward in germany they sent me to but i got the honorable discharge got the medal for standing ten feet further away from the battery than my friends and then you ended up at sangriaville miles said when i didnt get any better my folks were good to me but after a couple of years theyre saying nathan get over the sadness now stop whining stop seeing dead people in the mirrors stop being this freak be our son again tried selling furniture at their place in albuquerque went from supporting missile systems to futons he tried to laugh i wasnt good at moving the merchandise off the floor i punched a guy when he couldnt decide between two recliners jesus its not a lifeordeath decision pick after thirty minutes of shopping and sitting and fricking reclining so the folks found a vets program in phoenix that got me free treatment then my folks found out about hurleys program and moved me to santa fe i read about those virtualreality treatments celeste said but theyre considered promising and they dont involve drugs i didnt sign up to test drugs none of us did i signed up to test the virtualreality treatments nathan closed his eyes miles put a steadying hand on his shoulder the trembling stopped i didnt know about the drugs till allison told me its all cool just tell us what you know about allisons death miles said start at the beginning sorenson hes lying nathan took another bite of sandwich a dribble of strawberry jelly lay near his lip i didnt kill her you got to believe me i would never i believe you ththank you for getting me out of the torture chamber he clenched his fists pressed them into his face i thought i was fixed but now i feel worse than ever allison was the only person who helped me i swear ill help you nathan miles said but you have to help us help you what find justice for her nathan laughed how high and mighty justice nathan cleaned the jelly off his chin with his thumb the way a child would sucked the jelly off the nail she was our friend celeste said our doctor you cant help a dead person nathan said theyre dead end of story not end of story she tried to help you miles said nathans mouth went into a thin slash i want to know what im getting into i still dont know why you use two names id like to know why too miles celeste said quietly which name do you prefer he could unfold the confession he kept in his pocket let them read it but he wouldnt he needed nathan to trust him but he wasnt sure yet he could trust nathan he knew the attitude was wrong when he preached cooperation to a scared beaten kid but he couldnt help himself so he kept the explanation edited my dad died he owed three hundred thousand dollars to a crime family in miami they forced me to work with them to pay the debt they had me spy on their rivals i finally cooperated with the feds testified and went into the witness protection program the government moved me to santa fe and named me michael but im not in witness protection anymore tell them the whole story andy hissed from the kitchen table im waiting celeste as though she heard andys whisper put a hand on miless arm thats your trauma nathan said jesus thats fricking nothing man stop it celeste said this isnt a competition im just saying i dont see how being in witness protection would drive you nuts nathan said i killed a man miles said suddenly he tried to kill me and two undercover cops who had infiltrated the ring i shot him what caused him to go postal nathan asked i dont remember miles said we were just talking to him and he pulled his gun and he tried to kill me nathan glanced at celeste be careful what you say dont joke you owe this man your life she said nathan shut up theres my truth nathan your turn finish your story allison was getting you out yeah i was supposed to get to her house wait for her we were going to disappear go where no one could find us she said she said we had to run tuesday night i dont know what made tuesday special what about groote miles asked never saw him or sorenson before tuesday you ever hear of a man named quantrill miles asked no allison should have just called the state board on hurley and quantrill miles said why run why hide she could have simply gone to the police she asked me for help she sounded like she was making a stand to fight but then she tells you she was running nathan said maybe she wanted your help in hiding herself and me since you know all about it miles shrugged but the explanation didnt ring true to him part of the story was bent a piece was missing nathan creaked to his feet with a wince washed his face in the sink if frost was fixing you why would you want to leave celeste asked nathan dragged a finger across his lips allison said hurley was going to do extra experiments on me because my trauma was so bad eventually take apart my brain to show how frost worked on it celeste said oh god theyll kill all the patients no they couldnt risk so many people dying without explanation but i was supposed to meet with an accident allison said nathan put a hand across his eyes i need to sleep answer one more question do you really think frost helped you i used to not be able to function at all but i can now so i guess im better but lately i cant always think straight i get panicky same with you celeste miles asked she shrugged nathan do you feel i dont want to talk anymore he nearly screamed he threw his plate into the sink please just i need to sleep let me sleep miles helped nathan walk upstairs to a guest bedroom nathan eased himself down on the sheets grabbed miless arm if you try and hurt me while im sleeping ill kill you dial it down a notch man i saved you were on the same side no nathan said no ones on my side nathan fell asleep in five minutes miles stood in the doorway watching the slow rise and fall of nathans chest hes dangerous andy said you cant trust him youre one to talk miles said and went back downstairs celeste had brewed a pot of decaffeinated coffee and sat at the kitchen table do you believe him she asked yes and no we know she stole frost and sent it to this mercury mountain host allison doesnt use her own computer or one at the hospital or a public one in an internet cafe or a library she uses yours she takes the pills she tested on you she told me frost was an antidepressant medical samples so i didnt have to bother with a prescription since i dont didnt get out much i dont much like being a guinea pig she might have been giving you the pills purely to help you if she was sure they would help miles said and then she took them back to protect you in case the hospital got suspicious its unethical i wont disagree but youre out of your house youre functioning true i dont doubt allisons good intentions but i dont understand why allison didnt go straight to the police especially if hurley planned to carve into nathans brain hes lying celeste said you think i do but i dont know which part of his story isnt real i just get the vibe hes not being entirely honest i get one vibe from him he wants to be a soldier again strong capable confident they sipped coffee in uncomfortable silence i killed a man today she said the words dont fit right in my mouth killed is ugly you saved me did i youre a big strong guy you kicked hurley away into me the gun fired it wasnt as though i fortified my courage and aimed to kill i could have waited if you stopped him with your fists no need for my gun you did what you had to do yes she said thats the problem andy sat across from him at the kitchen table celeste caught his quick squint at empty air your invisible friend hes here embarrassment flooded him no she took a birds sip of coffee you told me you killed your friend you didnt say he tried to kill two cops too miles shrugged it doesnt change the fact that i killed him if you saved lives you did the right thing no matter how devastating i disagree with her andy said what does she know miles was quiet not wanting to listen to either of them tired to his bones we have to have a plan miles we cant hide here forever celeste said he put down his coffee cup we find frost its the only way first to prove were not crazy and second to exonerate what weve done me running from witness protection you shooting hurley celeste hugged herself as if cold ill like jail since i love being indoors youd hate it have you been no but witsec when they take you into the program they put you in a facility where you cant leave for several days you dont see other people no bars but its jail i did the same thing you did she said walked away from my life put myself away from the world the silence between them grew awkward and he said i need to tell you about what i found in the hospital sorenson had beaten the crap out of this groote guy and was trying to kill nathan he suggested nathan killed allison that he knew about explosives now maybe he was just trying to create doubt in my mind but nathan was in the army and we dont know details of his service but why would he kill allison when she was helping him dont know lets say allison stole frost then sorenson stole it from her or killed her i understand why sorenson would face off against groote but why would sorenson attack nathan how is nathan a threat to him he pretends to be a doctor he kills allison he then tries to kill nathan i dont get how this all connects well get nathan talking tomorrow right now im going to find a bed to sleep in she got up pulled a knife from a storage rack whats that for he asked you dont need to cut its not for me she said for protection in case the bad guys come in the night ill stand guard you cant miles you got drugged youve been through hell this isnt a horror movie sitting around the campfire waiting for the boogeyman to jump out we bring our boogeys along with us she thumbed the edge of the knife good night miles good night celeste im sorry i brought all this trouble to you you didnt she went up the stairs miles put his hands flat on the table my god he just wanted his old life back his imperfect dumb but wonderful old life him and his dad running the private investigation agency no andy gone mob no crime rings extorting him to work off his fathers debts no reasons to hide no hallucinations he drank another cup of coffee choose a next step his head buzzed with a dozen questions trying to fit together the mismatched pieces of the jigsaw that was the battle for frost but he knew with clarity that the only way to beat groote to beat sorenson to take the fight to them was to locate the stolen frost research the bad guys didnt want it public their fear was their only weakness he could exploit he would find frost and destroy them with it so the next step was to find mercury mountain allisons recipient of the stolen research if he couldnt find anything out from that angle then he had to find this quantrill guy in california he was the chief the money behind frost follow the money it had been his one rule in spying for the barradas and it never failed him except hed never had to bring two innocent people in tow when he followed the money his stomach twisted at the responsibility of protecting them but he had no choice he would simply have to keep them safe and try not to think about how he had failed andy and allison ill make it right he said to himself to the empty air to andy he fell asleep across blaines unmade bed the beretta under his pillow the way he had slept in miami a lifetime ago thirtyfour a camera eyed him under the eaves of celeste brents porch and groote frowned he had on his sunglasses and a cap pulled over his battered face to fend off the early light of friday morning but he didnt like his picture being taken he yanked the camera loose from its mount and smashed the lens under his heel reaching up to grab the camera made his arm hurt hell his whole body ached his left arm throbbed his head pounded his broken nose was taped he looked as if hed been in a car crash frost was gone sorenson had betrayed him all the deal making was for nothing the man had just wanted a shot at killing nathan ruiz for whatever unfathomable reason nathan ruiz and michael raymond had vanished hurley was missing a fed named pitts had nipped at his heels the previous night life was bad but if he thought of amanda he could push on he tried the doorbell no answer knocked waited if celeste brent was a psycholevel recluse she might not answer the door he slid a lockpick into the door tested it eased the tumblers the door opened no alarm chimed he stepped inside closed the door behind him he left the lights off he nearly tripped over hurleys body sprawled on the floor dumbass he said under his breath he drew his weapon borrowed from an offduty guard at the hospital with a grimace of pain did a search the house was empty he checked hurley without touching him but he didnt need to touch him to see that the man was dead the man who had been a pain in the ass but could have helped his amanda i told you i should have come with you he said to the dead body he searched the house no one there if the cameras ran constantly they could tell him a story he found a computer in the bedroom with a massive external hard drive attached and video cables that fed into the walls he fired up the computer no login password not a surprise no one ever used this system other than celeste brent he searched the external drive she kept the cameras images in digital form for only a few days then reused the drives real estate he accessed the video files starting with yesterdays the camera was motionactivated saving frames when people neared the front door an older lady matronly probably a caretaker arriving letting herself in with a bag of groceries letting herself out then michael raymond showed up held up a sign i know allisons secret holy mother of god grootes stomach churned he fastforwarded michael waits then steps in nothing then hurley arrives waits goes inside more nothing then michael and a woman clearly frightened as though she were unexpectedly walking on the moon sticking close to michael stumbling out of frame damn no sign of a car no plates to trace he jumped back to the video files from tuesday the day allison died fastforwarded through the day until allison appeared on the doorstep fastforwarded until she left nothing else celeste brent had been in league with allison vance and so had michael raymond i know allisons secret four words to chill the bone he had to figure out where they had gone because from the datetime stamp on the image he guessed they had gone from here to the hospital but first deal with hurley he couldnt leave the body celeste brent was a hasbeen celebrity but she was still a known name to many people a body found inside her house would earn national attention the caretaker woman might come back tomorrow hurley dead might be more of a problem than hurley missing he stripped apart the computer system maybe there would be helpful information on the hard drives to tell him where miles and celeste might run he carried the hard drives out to the car put them inside the backseat of the rental now the trunk for hurley then the desert he closed the door and there on the other side of the low adobe wall that separated the yard from the dirt road stood deshawn pitts hello groote said calm you can talk your way out of this man you have to for your daughter what happened to you mr groote an accident at the hospital my own fault i slipped and fell down a flight of stairs you okay yes howd you find me here he put a laugh in his voice i parked down near the hospital wanted to grab doctor hurley for a talk saw you leaving saw your face all beaten made me curious followed you too much suspicion from the guy it saddened groote this your place pitts asked i wish no its a patient of doctor hurleys thats doctor hurleys car parked there his plates i checked he normally spends the night with his patients no but last night was a special case i get the feeling hurleys avoiding me is he here or not groote weighed the options life or death i really have to insist mr groote at the least doctor hurley can step outside and talk to me for five minutes groote decided with regret he slammed the car door closed and tried to seem embarrassed under his bandage hurley talked to your person of interest hurley was the one at the hospital who called him hes been calling all of allison vances patients a mild form of ambulance chasing excellent groote jerked his head toward the house why dont you come on in and well talk thirtyfive miles awoke to screams he lurched out of bed unsure if he had actually slept he had no morning aftertaste of nightmares no andy dying crumpled on concrete no cries of horror echoing in the dreamy cave of his brain no office of allisons blasting into flaming rubble the screams were from anothers throat thrashing cries of terror he ran up the stairs nathan lay in a tangle of bedsheets fists clenched against air kicking in a rage of shock nathan wake up wake and nathans fist closed around his throat fingers of iron digging into miless windpipe i didnt i didnt i didnt break it nathan screamed his voice crumbled into a ragged moan i fixed it i fixed it i swear nathan nathan jumped up from the bed drove miles hard into the wall staring into his face its miles let go he managed to say sucking in the scarce oxygen nathan stop it celeste ordered from the doorway nathan released miles stumbled back wordlessly and sat on the bed bad dream miles said just a dream man youre okay an anger close to hate gleamed in nathans dark eyes i dont dream dream and scream i been there nathan went into the bathroom the mirror shrouded with a towel and splashed water onto his face miles saw nathans hands were shaking i dont dream nathan said again whatever miles rubbed the finger marks out of his throat screw you i served my country i was a soldier what were you a mobster miles so dont talk down to me miles said i wont as long as you dont try to strangle me more than once a day nathan started rummaging in the guest closet for spare clothes miles listen thanks for getting my ass out of the hospital appreciate it but you and me were settled i told you everything i know time to part ways where do you think youre going dont know yet i need your help help we believe allison sent the frost research to a web hosting company called mercury mountain probably to hide it from sorenson or to give it to someone else who could access the web server we need to find out where this server is nathan stopped at the door groote and sorenson will want you dead theyll want us all dead our only chance is to get frost prove what theyve done to the world you do expose them you ruin any chance for you or celeste or me or anyone else with ptsd to use frost to get better you think any drug companys going to produce a drug that the world knows was based on illegal experiments hell no you expose frost then you cut our own throats man well be broken forever his fists clenched i agreed to the vr testing because i wanted to help my fellow soldiers that matters more to me than some sad pointless revenge we get frost we can help every soldier coming back from the war every child thats traumatized by abuse everyone who needs frost miles said a legit company could do the research ethically build on what hurley did theres nothing unethical about the chemical formula of frost nathan nodded his head but groote and quantrill and sorenson theyll be hunting us nathan they will kill us if they find us we cant recover if were dead and allison asked you and me and celeste in different ways to help her im not inclined to let the people who killed her get away with murder are you kidding me youre a mobster the feds are hunting you not just groote and she doesnt want to step outside nathan gave a jagged laugh i can do plenty to get it back but i cant have the two of you tripping me up i suggest you guys lay very low for the next few days he turned to leave you want to be a hero then be one miles said quietly we shouldnt work apart work with us nathan took five steps then stopped he rested his head against the doorjamb im not good with people you dont really want me around you cant have a life on the run alone nathan no money no prospects no help we dont even know what the longterm effects of frost might be you cant run off on your own help us you knew more about what allison was planning i know you must have trusted her cared about her nathan weighed the words for several moments he dropped his bag on the floor raised his head nodded all right im in so whats the next step find frost miles said and take the fight right back to these bastards breakfast was stale bagels made edible through toasting and a thin coating of jam and a pot of industrialstrength coffee normal morning routine except their routines usually included antidepressants precious pills that they didnt have and miles wondered if the three of them would lose focus the power of clear thinking without their meds so you just look up this mercury mountain on a computer and call them nathan asked around a mouthful of bagel i dont think we call we go see whoever has access to the ip address where allison sent the research he glanced at the clock am he needed a computer on which he could make an online purchase and install new software and he figured he wouldnt be able to do that on a coffeeshop computer but he could on the gallerys computers if the locks hadnt been changed joy was in early often but six in the morning was too early for her he wondered if there would still be the police protection at the gallery hed asked deshawn to provide well all go celeste said you dont have to you can stay inside no lets all go she said quietly ill be okay they found a pair of illfitting jeans and a flannel shirt for nathan along with tennis shoes celeste put on dark glasses and a ball cap and a windbreaker she took the windbreakers hood and pulled it over her head too big for her it shielded her face you gonna be okay miles asked her at the door yes lets do it the three of them drove to the gallery miles driving more confident behind the wheel the lot was empty no police car miles hurried them to the gallerys door noticing a plywood cover where a pane of glass had been he tried his key fed his code into the alarm system the red light changed to green celeste slid the windbreakers hood from her head stepped inside shivering she and nathan examined the art on the walls what lovely pieces she said touch nothing he said giving nathan a hard look nathan shrugged they followed him upstairs to joys office miles fired the computer up opened a browser hunted in google for the name mercury mountain no web site for a hosting service so not a hosting service that wanted customers just a name to attach to a server miles jumped to a software vendor who sold ip address tracking software dug out the visa card hed opened in his fathers name for emergencies i used this software when i had to track for the mob who really owned certain porn sites miles said its gotten a lot harder to find out who has certain web domains they could be bought with a stolen credit card or paid for ten years with a money order but id find which of my bosses rivals owned porn sites and my boss hired hackers to bring down the sites cut into the rivals profits you knew all the charming people celeste said miles bought the software entered in his visa number prayed the transaction would go through waiting and then he got a confirmation thank god he said he downloaded and installed the software entered his license key and entered in the ip address celeste had found on her system a map of the united states displayed tracking the ip address and finally pulsed on a location in northern california miles clicked the ip address belonged to a server in fish camp california owned by an edward wallace google him celeste said miles did conscious now that they might only have minutes left joy at deshawns request could have put an alert on the alarm system to let him know if the gallery was accessed after hours just in case miles came back he hoped not most of the google results offered links to articles written by edward wallace a few years out of date mostly on posttraumatic stress disorder and the gist seemed to be that the government was moving too slowly in addressing the growing problem of traumatic stress especially among soldiers he clicked through them edward wallace was a neurobiology researcher in ptsd affiliated with a university in san diego at least he had been four years ago she sent it to edward wallace for analysis maybe celeste said miles clicked on the nexttolast link it summoned a local news story in a smalltown paper from fish camp california an edward wallace of fish camp had been injured in a hiking accident he was new to town recently relocated from fresno his wife renee was on an extended teaching fellowship in psychiatry at a medical school in the united kingdom so he had been hiking alone when he fell odd they dont mention the name of the school celeste said leaning over his shoulder where exactly in california is fish camp miles clicked and searched and found a map just a couple of miles south of yosemite national park we should call him say we know allison and need to know how hes involved nathan said miles clicked on the last link an archived notice from the fresno bee there was a wedding picture of edward bookish and tall and his bride renee smiling intelligent confident blond hair pulled back in a ponytail renee wallace was allison vance thirtysix groote cleaned off the screwdriver under a jet of water at his feet on the kitchen floor lay deshawn pitts groote believed a man bent broken and without hope was a tragic sight groote ran a finger along the edge of the screwdriver hed learned the technique in laos from a moralschallenged detective when groote briefly worked with their police force on an exchange program make a slight cut where the skin lay shallow over the bone drive the screwdrivers tip to the bone twist and shred the flesh let the subject hear the sound of metal grating against their own skeleton keep the subject gagged and you had quiet and a minimum of mess one last time groote said or well let mr screwdriver explore fresh new territories above the eye socket the pubic bone base of the spine he lowered himself down to deshawns eye level listen why protect this guy he screwed you over he ran didnt give a thought to your career your professional standing my job deshawn managed to say his voice was barely above a whisper to protect him im not with the pieceofcrap drug dealer youre hiding him from groote said i dont give a rats ass what he did before im a now kind of guy i need to know how to best bring him to the surface deshawn closed his eyes wheres he from originally he started to undo deshawns pants no please no tell me this isnt pleasant for me either youll kill me i have no quarrel with you my quarrels with michael raymond who ran away from you deshawn closed his eyes never never is such an outdated concept groote said reaching for the knife imagining a blue surgeons line in his craftsmans eye on the tender skin it took twenty more minutes and his answers came in a broken flood as he played the knifes edge against an open nerve miles kendrick miami he knew the name jesus hed heard the guys name before talking with a couple of other old fbi hounds talking about the barradas clever spy hed never seen a picture but hed heard the name no telling how many crime rings that guy put a fucking dent in man the barradas own cia who ever knew mobsters would get creative and get themselves a spy thank you mr pitts groote said mr kendrick hurt a lot of criminal organizations do you know if he ever struck at the duartes in southern california deshawn nodded he helped take them down yeah but not down enough theyd still had the strength to come after his family blame the grootes for their misfortunes how did he take the duartes down think he stole spreadsheets when and god help miles kendrick groote thought if it was before the attack on his family deshawn didnt answer sliding toward unconsciousness groote controlled his sudden rage focus on what mattered now what do you know about frost what there was no deception left in deshawns eyes where would miles go back to miami no how hard is witness protection and the bureau searching for him deshawn passed out and groote slapped him awake repeated the question hard deshawn managed now youve been very helpful i really appreciate it thank you i need to consider my options deciding about how pitts made the best bait alive on the hook or limp in death no reason for miles kendrick to care about this dumbass groote stood checked his gun tucked a plastic trash bag under deshawns head fired once between the halfopen eyes the head jerked as the bullet funneled through bone and brain groote tried to step into allisons head she planned to run with frosts secrets expose quantrill and hurleys illegal testing she was going to vanish from her life and who better to help her than a man whod already vanished from his own a man who stole secrets as shed stolen frost except the plan went wrong for allison you couldnt tempt a criminal a mobster with a drug formula worth millions meat before the wolf and hed killed allison for frost groote was sure of it now hed thought first it might have been sorenson but he believed sorenson was just a hired muscle for a pharmaceutical making an attempt to steal the drug maybe nathan in league with allison knew about the deal and sorenson wanted his tracks cleaned the evidence suggested miles kendrick had frost he was keeping it for his own gain and he was keeping it from amanda and all the other people it could save he turned off the water flicked the last drop free from the flat edge now he knew his enemys face his name and he believed he knew how to defeat him there was a calmness in the knowledge hed thought killing the duarte accountant was the final step in justice for cathy and amanda but no fate and its engine of revenge had brought him full circle brought him to a man who could mean justice for his lost cathy and sanctuary for his lost amanda so miles kendrick needed nathan ruiz as an example of the drugs power to bolster the case made in the research files see nathan on video barely able to speak when he starts taking frost see him after months of it able to effect an escape from a mental hospital and take part in a conspiracy see folks this stuff works and works good step right up buy a bottle miles kendrick was running crazy with two other loonies weighing him down and groote was going to find him and get frost back the second auction for frost if sorenson spoke truth and he would have to confront quantrill with this information would be in three days kendrick had to be setting it up already pressed to profit from all of hurley and quantrills hard work so he had three days to find kendrick the answer was in celeste brents computer it had brought allison here it had brought miles here so start there and find them and kill them his watch said seven in the morning he had time before sunset to take the bodies out to the high desert and dispose of them his phone buzzed he answered quantrill sounding tense sounding bitter im on my way to santa fe we seriously need to talk that said groote is the understatement of the year this is a goddamned disaster quantrill started not on the phone just tell me where you want to meet quantrill did anger still in his tone groote clicked off and the phone buzzed immediately it was his hacker friend who had found the michael raymond address off the cellphone account i kept at that michael raymond problem for you nabbed a peek into the caller records finally wormed my way in do tell id like to know who hes been calling he made only one call on his cell phone yesterday to a cell phone owned by a guy named grady blaine there in santa fe you want blaines address i most certainly do groote said thirtyseven it cant be her celeste said it cant be miles traced his finger over the photo a woman smiling shyly into the cameras lens a casual photo taken during a run or hike outside she wore an athletic top and shorts stood atop a mountain full of vitality the kind of informal engagement photo favored by active couples the photo credit printed sideways next to the picture read edward wallace it listed their degrees edward a ph d in neurobiology and renee an md in psychiatry shed previously worked at both a university and a military clinic in san diego to help veterans recover from posttraumatic stress disorder she and her husband had moved to fresno to establish a similar clinic maybe its not her nathan sounded distant dream addled you cant see her face quite clearly miles swallowed the bile creeping into his throat you were supposed to help me in becoming a new person i had no idea you were already an expert its her she said she lied to us nathan said that bitch dont talk about her that way celeste said she lied nathan gritted his teeth and miles saw tears of fury rising in the young mans eyes nathan staggered to the office door lets go miles closed the browser shut off the computer and at the door reset the alarm they followed nathan out the gallery door and miles locked up the lot remained empty he hurried them into the car and drove out of the parking lot she lied nathan said and it caught up with her there has to be a reasonable explanation celeste said people always say that miles said when theyre about to get totally screwed nathan frowned names aside she stuck the research on a server could we access it not without the password miles said so we talk to her husband youre all idiots andy said from the backseat why dont you all deal with your real problems celeste killed a man nathans a walking meltdown and you miles youre a friend killer charming group truly you cant stand it miles whispered when you think i might win excuse me celeste said and nathan said what im talking to myself not you all sorry your friend she asked yes jesus you talk to him nathan said andy laughed awkward silence and miles thought im the one who didnt get frost they think im crazier than they are he steered into blaines driveway so thats why you used two names nathan said multiple personalities hey how many voices you got inside your head miles ignored him as he helped celeste hurry back inside blaines house shut up and let me think were you speaking to me nathan said i cant listen to this crazy bastard carry on a conversation with an imaginary friend miles closed the door behind them shut up and realize what were facing allison went to enormous trouble to set up her life in santa fe that wedding announcement said she went to oregon for her degrees the degrees on allisons wall were from rice and stanford and ucla she had to create a new history for herself and you cant easily fake a medicalschool transcript a medical license a new social security number a past spun of nothing it takes resources and time trust me she didnt do it on her own so who helped her someone with money and serious motivation why fake an identity why couldnt she be in santa fe as renee wallace she didnt do this alone she had to be working for someone nathan shook his head man this just got to be a bigger can of worms than i want to deal with you all should just hide or go to the cops were done we need to drive to california miles said find her husband drive to california celestes voice cracked you want me to ride in a car for several hours she turned and ran to the back of the house and miles heard blaines studio door slam miles slowing down for considered thought realized a car drive of hundreds of miles would be horribly frightening to her he went to her purse cracked open the bottle of antidepressants four were left all the meds they had and god only knew what kind of megadose nathan needed to keep him calm not enough pills for all three of them he slid the pills back into the bottle i know how to get her moving nathan flicked his fingers made a whooshing noise let me talk with her miles went through the house to the studio door closed he knocked no answer he opened the door groote sat on a paintsplattered stool one gun aimed at celestes head another aimed at miles celeste stood lip trembling not looking at the gun aimed at her tag groote said youre it his face was battered his nose was taped and his smile was cold and thin miles shut the door behind him how the hell he thought it didnt matter he had to get celeste away from this man no call nathan back here calmly i want to talk with him too what do you want frost we dont have it where is it i dont know dont lie to me you were in league with allison both you and mrs brent here no i just asked you not to lie to me what part of that dont you understand let her go and ill give it to you miles said celeste looked up at him nathan opened the door and boogied into the room problem solved i lit a fire under you celeste to get you going actually under the curtains and he stopped and frozen with fear stared with shocked horror at groote hey tin soldier how you doing groote started but then he saw what celeste did framed in the open door fire celeste said in a whisper pointing down the hall fire he set a fire then the smell of smoke sweet and awful and rising you crazy bastard groote yelled standing up you want frost its upstairs miles lied groote put the guns barrel on miless forehead show me let them go groote hesitated out both of you just go outside you run hes dead nathan grabbed celeste steered her toward the back door she started to scream as he pushed her into the yard groote turned miles dug the gun hard into the back of miless head give me frost now he strongarmed miles past the hallway and up the stairs in the kitchen the curtains above the sink blazed in the den heavy draperies a large cotton rug the entire couch burned brightly hell kill me when he figures i dont have frost miles thought he fell as groote pushed him on the stairs faster crazy dont hurt me miles pleaded and at the same time braced himself against the stair and dealt a savage backward kick his foot caught groote in the groin miles kicked again aiming for the broken nose but catching the chin groote staggered lost his footing and tumbled down the stairs landing in a heap on the tiles miles grabbed the gun away from his hand finding its fellow in grootes jacket pocket leave him run but the fire was spreading fast he couldnt abandon anyone not even a bastard like groote to die he dragged groote into the backyard dumped him into the cold water of a stone fountain groote gasped miles put one of the guns to grootes head he dumped the clip from the other put the clip in his pocket tossed the second gun into the water were leaving now dont follow us i lied to you i dont have frost i dont know where it is were not a threat to you were just going away where no one will bother us and we wont bother anyone tell quantrill you understand i understand youre a liar groote glared at him with hate stay in that fountain or ill shoot you miles backed away and ran he jumped over a lowlying fence headed for the front yard nathan was coaxing celeste once again into the car miles got into the front he spun into the street and powered the car away from the burning house groote was at the drivers window trying to grab the wheel from him and miles floored it broke free roared down the street and wheeled hard onto old santa fe trail what what do we do nathan said we dont stay here we cant we run he looked for groote in the rearview saw nothing we go where allison hid the files california celeste started to moan groote staggered down the street to his car a couple of neighbors stood in the road and watched the flames popping from the windows cell phones clutched to their ears they stared at him and he ran down the road to where hed left his car still with hurley and pitts dead in the trunk think where would they go where would they hide he had to change tactics flush them out figure their next step but best not to be here when the fire trucks and the other authorities arrived he had bodies to bury a plan to make these crazy people were ruining everything for him thirtyeight friday afternoon groote stopped at church on the way back from burying the bodies a shrine in chimayo north of santa fe claimed that the dirt from its foundations could work miracles smother the fire of aids in the blood corral cancer cells drive death into retreat groote drove past the cars lining the road that led to the old church steering slowly past the cameranecklaced tourists past an old woman in a wheelchair past a kid about nathan ruizs age with a fresh burr crutches and an empty camouflagedpant leg huffing himself toward the church as though he were competing in a race groote parked and watched the kid and wondered if a dash of that jesus dust would help amanda after all salvation might be close at hand frost in a form to fix his girl still seemed miles beyond his reach all that he decided was about to change he got out of the car and walked along the outside of the church toward the buildings back quantrill was waiting for him my god youre a horror quantrill said inspecting grootes nose brace the battered jaw thanks how was your flight quantrill lit a cigarette the peanuts were stale ice in his voice im not happy with the services youve provided so far im not happy with being lied to how have i lied to you dennis tell me the truth about what sorenson said is there a second auction of frost being set up quantrill blew out a frustrated sigh yes ive heard about it from two of my contacts very unfortunate you could have told me i didnt want you distracted two of my contacts said theyve been contacted by a guy willing to sell them the research at half my asking price he didnt give a rats ass about quantrills money i dont think sorenson is behind the auction i think its miles kendrick who groote explained what hed learned about miless background he left out that hed let miles and company escape he wasnt about to admit his own underestimation of miles kendrick quantrill considered then its just a sick coincidence the mobsters want him dead they kill allison it has nothing to do with frost thats what the feds are supposed to believe but not us miles kendrick had to know that when his shrink died in a bomb blast his past might come to light and hed be blamed for her murder it covers up that he stole frost because he must have known we wouldnt run to the cops i almost admire the guy he built a brilliant plan quantrill nodded you have to stop this second auction do i i want my kid to have the medicine a drug company buys the research cheap they produce it faster youre screwed true but im not quantrill didnt blink but what if its not miles kendrick running the second auction what if its sorenson groote said i dont get it and you say you admire clear thinking quantrill tossed his cigarette an inch from grootes toe i think you actually hate miles kendrick for a reason youre not telling me hes a goddamned mobster i used to put people like him in prison and now you put them in graves a few might be in urns quantrill shook his head revenge wont make amanda healthy but frost will dennis think with a clear head what were facing his threat is not that hell sell frost to someone consider what hes done and what that fed told you kendrick wants to bring whoever killed her to justice hes killed hurley hes broken into the hospital but the end result each time is to rescue a patient who was being tested with frost he doesnt want to sell it he wants to expose it what do you think will happen if kendrick and his psycho buddies go public about frost illegal testing of a drug on the traumatized including veterans no pharmaceutical will ever come near us no matter the drugs efficacy even a worthy drug might be buried for years until the pharmas dont have to worry about lawsuits or bad publicity quantrill lit a cigarette i can derail the auction doesnt matter if its kendrick or sorenson there are very few willing buyers to touch hot research a few wellplaced phone calls a suggestion that the stolen research isnt complete or if the second auction takes place i threaten to cut a plea bargain and name names for the fda it would be enough to stop the auction in its tracks but if miles kendrick is intent on exposing us because he wants to avenge his doctor then were dead in the water he hasnt exposed us yet you have to stop him before he does all right quantrill jerked his head at the crowds heading toward the church you see these people flocking toward dirt that if you buy the freaking hype cures every ill faith and hope are just commodities and everyone buys them and theyll buy frost if you and i can silence kendrick and his friends well have a world where trauma never leaves its footprints youre wrong about faith groote said im not everyone needs faith in people if not god profound talk from a killer quantrill couldnt hide his smirk youre not better than me oliver i do what youre not willing to what youre afraid to do so dont talk down to me i wont the smirk tried to evolve into a steeleyed stare but quantrill couldnt make it work heres what you need to do groote said change medical records to show that nathan ruiz was released from the hospital by doctor hurley the day before allison died then go back to california and put the brakes on the new auction all right quantrill said ill have to report hurley missing when he doesnt show for work on monday hopefully drag it out until tuesday plant an idea with the cops that hurley was distraught over allisons death he fits the part of the heartbroken loner and left town youre sure theyll never find his body they wont quantrill crossed his arms good so now for our other problem kendricks got two loony tunes under his wing he probably cant get far he may even still be in town draw him out use ruizs family they might be the first people ruiz contacts when this is all said and done groote said my daughter gets frost first of course dennis quantrill said but i cant do that can i if kendrick stays a problem he wont we done quantrill nodded groote walked back to his car he drove toward santa fe starved for sleep which he didnt see in his immediate future for food for a clear head he had reserved a hotel room near the plaza his cell phone rang it was the computer technician at the hospital who was examining celestes computer i found evidence that files large enough to be the frost research files were uploaded to a remote server via celeste brents computer wheres the server i traced it to a location in fish camp california a server belonging to a man named edward wallace the name meant nothing compare the files with hurleys files see if theyre the same name the same size i did already she uploaded one extra file hurley didnt have in his frost database whats the other one its a simple text file its called buylist buylist buyers list allison had gotten a list of the people lining up to buy from quantrill the underthetable consultants who could filter frost into a research department but why would that be in the research files the buyers were quantrills business not hurleys get me an address for edward wallace he hung up he dialed quantrill before you run back to california groote said did hurley have your list of contacts for your sale no of course not why either quantrill was lying or hurley had the list and quantrill didnt know it or scariest possibility allison had gotten the list from somewhere else someone else groote quantrill asked nothing just curious he hung up so she had uploaded the stolen data why why not simply hand it to kendrick if he was her partner because allison was hiding the data from kendrick as insurance she had good reason the second auction shed gotten the names of the buyers for the second auction somehow from quantrill how and why and his confusion over this angle brought forward a question that had nagged him through the night why would sorenson even mention the second auction to him why risk alerting him because he wanted to win your confidence lure you in get access to nathan ruiz kill ruiz kill you he can tell you anything if hes pretty sure youre going to be dead in ten minutes he didnt know why sorenson wanted ruiz dead but hey it didnt matter facts were facts he parked at the hotel lot got out of his car exhaustion making his head spin his nose throbbing from the break he needed sleep and a painkiller but first he had to call nathans family back up quantrills story about nathans release see if the family knew where tin soldier was the cell phone chirped i found your address for edward wallace the technician gave groote the address groote clicked off the phone tented his cheek with his tongue while he considered this new data he believed kendrick had come to celeste brents computer specifically to get this information he could be racing to california to get frost it was a chance groote couldnt take he could sleep on the plane he headed for the hotel and then he saw them federal agents he knew the stance standing near the doors lobby on the inside a blond talking on a cell phone a bald man with his back to groote pitts must have logged in mentioned that he was tracking down hurley following groote from the hospital and now pitts hadnt checked in for hours it wasnt a hard matter to call local hotels find a room rented to dennis groote he couldnt let the officers stop him for questioning giving a statement might burn hours he couldnt lose especially if pitts had mentioned any suspicions of grootes honesty to his team members he retreated toward the car walking normally praying with each step that the men didnt spot him if he drove to the albuquerque airport and took a flight to california the bureau would quickly know where he went and if he hid it would seem well like he was hiding neither was an appealing prospect he needed to lie low find frost then resurface back in los angeles where he could claim that his contract with the hospital having expired hed simply come home hed had no idea anyone was interested in talking to him santa fe a wonderful city he would have loved to share with amanda had gone very bad for him you get frost first and no matter what he told himself as he slid behind the wheel you get it for amanda even if they catch you he got back into his car started the engine and the fingers tapped against the window mr groote the man had the cleanscrubbed earnest face of an eager bureau agent hed been the blond talking on the cell phone near the hotel entrance yes groote powered down the window put a polite yet questioning expression on his face start lying he told himself and make it a great one and forget about the dna traces the two dead men left in the trunk of the car dont you sweat even a drop so this bastard cant slow you down any more than necessary hello groote said with the politeness of recognizing a colleague the man was equally polite almost apologetic hello sir fbi we need to talk to you for a few minutes thirtynine the mental defective league in formation nathan said name that movie miles having driven for the past twelve hours didnt want to play celeste sitting low in the backseat wearing a heavy pair of sunglasses wrapped in a blanket and with a dose of xanax in her didnt answer it was late saturday night the galaxy of lights of greater los angeles spread out on both sides of interstate one flew over the cuckoos nest after nicholson gets bzzzzzzt the shock treatments and he leaned into the backseat jabbed celestes head with his finger saying bzzzt bzzzt bzzzt they should have given you shock treatments she said now and then she stuck her head out from the blanket a turtle taking a measure of air but she seemed to be coping miles thought certainly better than nathan was dont need the voltage nathan said not when i got frost i saved our skins dont forget celeste said lets break for the night its still hours to yosemite i can drive nathan said bad idea miles said jesus man i know how to drive you seem slightly wound up miles said youre not going to let your imaginary friend drive i hope enough nathan celeste said from the back what do you call mr invisible nathan said guilt trip the shadow his name is andy well we cant have andy distracting you from your driving nathan made a playful halfgrab at the wheel miles veered into the right lane earning a honk and a finger from a driver hed nearly clipped im not letting you drive miles said because the mirrors bother you i dont want you to freak a long silence i dont freak nathan said lets find dinner and a place to sleep celeste said quietly we need to keep going miles said even though exhaustion rattled his brain we need to keep please she said please i need four walls around me dinner was takeout mcdonalds comfort was a worn but clean motel in the northern stretches of the city near santa clarita miles got two adjoining rooms nathan demolished three big macs downed a soda let out a satisfied belch excuse me he said celeste kept her back to them sitting on the edge of the bed picking at a salad you okay miles asked i cant believe i left my house she said i ought to feel free i dont i hope nancy didnt come to my house and find the body she shuddered i shouldnt have left she closed the salad box over the mostly uneaten mound of lettuce the shouldnthaves are the path to insanity nathan said you better eat that dinner celeste soldiers know you got to eat sleep and sh um go to the bathroom whenever you have a chance you might not get another she opened the box forced herself to eat again miles finished his hamburger we all need sleep well get up early tomorrow head out we should camp a day or two nathan said let celeste recover we go miles said youre not the boss of us nathan wiped his mouth i am until we get frost until we know were safe were not responsible for each other nathan stood funny thing for a soldier to say miles told him i would imagine you feel responsible nathan toward your fellow soldiers nathans hands tightened into fists what the hells that supposed to mean just that we have to take care of each other ah like they do in the mob im not a mobster i never was so you say why should we believe you enough nathan celeste stood sleep then we go nathan sat down on the bed celeste retreated to her own room and shut the door behind her theres no way to hang a blanket over the mirror just dont look at it miles said i wont nathan said to the ceiling miles washed his face slipped out of shirt and jeans crawled into the bed nearest the door hid the gun under his pillow you dont have to sleep with a gun with me around nathan said its in case groote finds us again yeah because im fresh out of matches miles didnt smile i know you and celeste are mad at me but the fire turned out okay it gave us an escape route you cant go setting houses on fire i could have talked celeste into leaving what you did was terribly unfair to her worked though well maybe so would a lobotomy nathan but its not the answer for any of us youre stashing that gun under your pillow to keep it away from me you could have a gun in your bag i dont forgot them in santa fe in the fire whyd you tell groote you had the goods so hed let you go that was stupid no more stupid than your fire nathan nathan said nothing for a moment then asked quietly what are celeste and i to you i i just dont want either of you hurt any more but why i dont know jesus just be grateful i am miles thank you miles switched off the lamp buried his face in the pillow he was close to sleep when he heard nathan say miles yeah if we get frost could we take it to the defense department i keep thinking about all the soldiers coming home from war brains screwed into new shapes from seeing all the horrors they need frost i want to be sure they get it that was the whole reason i volunteered for the vr treatments to help and you said we werent responsible for each other i meant and he searched for words we dont know each other why did you come back for me it wasnt to make you indebted to me miles said i get the sense you really dont want any responsibility toward anyone else when im better nathan said when im fixed when im good enough to be around other people soon itll be soon youre good enough now miles listened to the young mans breathing slide into the steadiness of sleep savored the quiet the wonderful seenothing dark sank his aching tired body into slumber dont get comfortable andy said from the darkness we need to talk miles closed his eyes shut out the voice you think you help them i go away now is that it you couldnt save allison so youll save them miles mouthed shut up into the pillow you didnt worry about saving me jesus known you since we were learning how to piss standing up and you worry about complete strangers i tried saving you was the whole point of the sting he said into the pillow afraid to wake nathan but afraid to not answer andy you shot me you shot me miles whispered back but it was all your fault andy hissed his voice sounding like flame shouldve kept your mouth shut you killed me with a word asshole miles pulled the blankets over his head a child burrowing into the soft sheets to escape a bad dream sweat coursed down his ribs i didnt you didnt save allison you wont save them andy said youll make another mistake and boom boom theyll be dead too after andys laughter faded the silence of the room pressed hard against his ears finally he closed his eyes prayed for the dreams to keep their distance and slept miles heard the door click shut total darkness he thought the sound was his imagination the click of the knob the final word of a dream you killed me with a word he searched under the pillow for his gun closed his fingers around the barrel silence he sat upright in the dark fear squeezing his chest the gun out steady in front of him shoot into the dark andy said great freaking idea he closed his eyes no sound of nathan breathing miles snapped on the light nathan was gone the clock read am miles pulled on jeans heard the reassuring jangle of the car keys in his pocket nathan hadnt taken the car at least miles pulled on his shirt tucked the gun in the back of his pants left the shirt hanging loose behind him to cover the gun he eased open the door to celestes room shed left a bathroom light on for comfort and he could see her sleeping the sleep of the exhausted he shut the door gently he grabbed the room key went out into the hall empty and quiet to the right was the lobby to the left was the parking lot he headed for the lot nathan was walking he decided planning to hitch a ride but the lot was empty he could hear the distant roar of scattered traffic on interstate he ran back down the hall into the deserted lobby nathan stood at a pay phone hanging up as soon as miles came into sight his expression was defiant what are you doing miles asked i called my folks i had to let them know i was okay you shouldnt have listen my folks dont have caller id or nothing man they wont know where im at and i didnt tell them but i had to let them know im okay ive always been tight with them theyre used to hearing from me every week man theyd freak if i didnt call no contact with him for six months its part of the treatment miles let the lie hang in the air between him and nathan wondering if another lie would follow okay miles said how are your folks great my mom she understands me always has shes always been real supportive of me youre lucky to have her okay nathan said he stepped away from the phone im sorry i upset you i cant sleep no more lets wake up celeste get going you said we should stay let celeste have indoor time i was wrong you were right wow me right he wanted to say stop lying tell me who you really were calling tell me why you were in such a hurry to hang up you didnt even say goodbye the diner down the service roads open in another hour or so nathan said if it doesnt have mirrors all along the walls some of em do you know we could eat there sure sure maybe he had been calling his parents but wed better get up and get on the road or hes called the police and in five seconds ill hear the sirens but there was only the quiet of the night and they went back to the room nathan averting his eyes from the mirror that hung over the sink counter stretching on the bed he wouldnt call the police not from the lobby not when i might catch him miles decided hed just run get clear away he let celeste sleep another hour the motel stayed quiet still until the sounds of showers rushing through pipes coughs in the hallway the distant thrum of a truck pulling out of the lot announced the new day they walked to the diner in the morning chill celeste huddled close to him and as they reached the glass doors he saw her face on the cover of the mornings usa today an old publicity photo from when shed won the five million grinning out at the world from a vending machine uhoh miles said what then celeste saw herself put her face into miless shoulder a couple coming out of the diner chatting smiled a good morning at them then the woman followed their gazes riveted on the newspaper dispenser miles steered nathan and celeste back toward the hotel he peeled out of the lot thinking those people didnt see her face and the picture they couldnt have but as they shot by the diner the couple were still standing there studying the front page of the paper theyd pulled from the machine forty andy rode with them talking murmuring all the way to fish camp the town lived up to its simple name highway wound high into the mountains and a few miles before yosemite the town stood before them a couple of modest stores a wide fishing pond a scattering of rental properties and modest homes a couple of bedandbreakfasts and restaurants on the mountains side a scruffy s motel called the yosemite gateway on the narrow ribbon of highway tall pines covered the landscape every trash can in the motel lots and along the roadside was metal with cover mechanisms to keep the bears from foraging in the garbage to miles who had spent his entire life in florida before that life ended the mountains and the forests reminded him of drawings from a german storybook hed had as a child miles checked them into the gateway two adjoining rooms with a connecting door between them wheres my room andy asked okay ill just stay with you all hes angry because youre close miles thought close to frost close to having a way to banish him from your head once and for all nathan landed on one of the twin beds in his and miless room and stretched out miles noticed nathan kept glancing at the digital clock i think nathan has an engagement on his calendar miles andy said now what do we do celeste asked find edward wallace but first were dyeing your hair miles said we cant have anyone recognizing you from the newspaper and if youre on the front page of usa today i bet youre on television too i dont think i can go out anymore she said i need walls right now i need i need to cut myself she swallowed braced her shoulder against the door frame miles went down to the motel office and asked for a rubber band he brought it back went into her room where celeste sat at the end of the bed knelt before her took her hand slipped it on her wrist we are so not engaged she said but thanks the urge passed he wished he had a rubber band to drive away andy then he heard the soft deliberate crack of glass oh goddamn he rushed back to his room nathan stood his fist covered by the rooms chipped and faded ice bucket the bathroom mirror fractured two jagged nathans frowning back at him from the glass cant you control yourself for just one blessed minute miles said nathan let the ice bucket fall to the floor walked past miles threw himself back on the bed ill remember that when you start talking to air we dont need trouble with the motel we dont need attention we cant have anyone remembering us do you understand sir yes sir nathan said into the pillow but i cant calm down i cant i need my meds man now desperation kicked in to his voice miles take it easy celeste said he cant help himself im sick of it sick of being sick miles stumbled outside the air in may was still chilly cooler than the high desert of santa fe and fingers of snow hid in the shadows of the heavy pines and furrows of land between the rental cabins the air was crisp in his lungs against his face he walked away from the car from the motel from the intermittent swoosh of passing cars heading the final two miles to yosemite i cant do this he thought i cant keep them calm and straight and focused he had no real plan after finding edward wallace and he didnt want to admit his uncertainty to himself or to the others how did you expose a conspiracy and have anyone believe you what if in bringing frost to light he killed the medicines chances for acceptance and production because of its illicit creation what if they got caught just because they went to get food and a television fan recognized celeste the whole enterprise was tottering ready to collapse in rubble and dust burying him under what he thought had been an impulse a need to do the right thing he stopped at the motels corner leaned his head against the brick he took a fortifying breath of mountain air he could do this he had to he had no choice celeste needed frost so did nathan they needed help they needed him no one really needs anyone allison said to him from the corner he raised his head and she was leaning against the bricks dressed in the clothes she had worn the last morning of her life his breath caught in his throat he shook his head closed his eyes counted to ten he looked again she was still there her arms crossed i i he started to say miles your path is clear its simple load the gun find a private place leave a note if theres anyone you want to say goodbye to such as deshawn and joy theyd miss you and she shrugged but they didnt really know you long enough to care about you he tried to speak nothing came but a harsh hiss of breath no one blames you for not wanting to hear andy bitching in your head for the rest of your life years and years of him talking no youre worried about failing your friends you worried over failing me but i failed you miles i gave you false hope he clenched his eyes shut ran his fingers along the even lines of the bricks a man from another room walked by him and miles felt the burn of his curious stare and thats all frost is allison said false hope you dont really think nathan is better do you hes not it doesnt work he whispered a prayer shes not real i know shes not real even if she was shed never say these things its the sickness he opened his eyes and ran into the space where shed stood but there was only the sierra breeze she was gone he pressed his palms against the brick wall nathan and celeste were real they were his responsibility he had to get a grip if he stayed strong celeste and nathan could stay strong so they could get the drug he craved it now strange to want something youd never had but he needed frost to be real so get moving he walked back to the room nathan sat on the bed watching a celebrity poker tournament on tv nathan im sorry i yelled ive got five hundred years of bad luck from mirrors nathan said you yelling doesnt scare me he shook his head at miles with a dawning fear i havent had frost in days man and im falling apart i got to have it man be straight with me was it your mom you called he nodded slowly you dont believe me i was under the impression you didnt get to talk to your mom at all when you were in the hospital so i know you didnt call her every week true but i did call her last night i told you shed be expecting to hear from me because i didnt want you to freak that id called her then i believe you try to rest miles yeah about your friend that died you cant stand there and let someone shoot you you just protected yourself theres a lot more to the story nathan how do you know if you dont remember i dont know window dressing are you sorry youre alive no im not theres your answer then nathan closed his eyes miles went to the open door of celestes room knocked on the frame she came out of the bathroom drying her face with a towel he closed the door behind him sorry he said nothing to apologize for she said he wanted to tell her hed seen allison but the words dammed in his throat and he swallowed you wanted to change my hair before we go she said lets get it done she went to a bag they had stopped in fresno bought clothing basics and knapsacks at a twenyfourhour walmart she pulled out a pair of nail scissors you cut my hair then well dye it i dont know how to cut hair he said i havent set foot in a stylists shop in forever celeste ran a hand through the thick mop of dark hair im not vain just cut it off ill chop away she grabbed his wrist cut not chop big diff so he wet her hair because when he got a haircut the stylist wet it and he started trimming off the length with hesitant snips almost afraid she would scream in horror if he cut too much at once taking it slow loving the heavy dampness of her hair between his fingers she sat on a chair in front of the mirror and he kept a wastebasket under where he cut off the lengths moving the basket with his foot to catch the falling tresses youre gonna bite through your lip she said he let his lip go from between his teeth he cut off a series of locks of her hair smoothed it back with his fingers gently rubbing her scalp that feels nice she said thank you he stopped a stirring awoke in his chest his mouth went dry how short do you want it cut she watched his face most pictures of me its at least shoulder length its how people remember me give it a pixie cut a what cut it boy short no worries miles i wont get mad even if you shave me bald so he cut it short diving the scissors close to her scalp leaving a couple of inches of growth gentle around her ears youre doing a good job she said im getting hair everywhere you dont have to be perfect why do you cut yourself he kept his eyes on the scissors poised above her damp hair better that than seeing dead people she said and then instantly added im sorry that was unfair its all right but i hate to see you hurt yourself i dont have an answer i hate it allison said i cut so i would feel again i hate just a paper cut doesnt it hurt yes dont you feel anyway i feel empty yet youre not miles you know that youre not because youd be dead if you were empty and you fought to save me to save yourself you feel miles but i bet its not emptiness she studied him in the mirror did you leave a woman behind in florida no ever married no i try not to be one for needing he smoothed out a length of her hair trimmed the end of it she ducked her head out from under his hands youve cut off enough of my mop she said absolutely horrible im completely unrecognizable thank you i love it he dusted her threads of hair from his hands into the wastebasket read the instructions on the hair dye slathered on the gunk to make her auburnhaired i wish you were giving me redred hair she said like lucille ball or carol burnett never sad watching them on tv he spread the concoction through her hair and she sat while he rinsed his hands if we dont find frost or edward wallace she said what do we do you and nathan go back to santa fe and tell the police what happened you cant hide forever what about you im out of witness protection i guess ill go make a new life for myself do you have another trial to testify in she asked he raised an eyebrow at her its a logical question she said witnesses are witnesses because they testify yeah im supposed to so youre not done no i still will testify then witsec will have to protect you again he would probably be in jail for fighting deshawn but he didnt want to admit it to her im done with witsec i broke their rules ill hide myself you cant hide you hid yourself just behind a wall ill do it behind a new identity or ill go far away cyprus india thailand it doesnt matter he sat on the corner of the bed she stayed in her chair when you killed that man she said did you have your breakdown right away he listened to the sound of his own breathing the walls were painted an awful beigegreen from the other room he heard nathans soft snore i only remember me speaking him drawing his gun me shooting him him falling me falling thats it no details its a silent movie with frames missing so how can you be sure it was so decidedly your fault he drew his gun he tells me it was my fault he told me i killed him with a word im afraid to remember hes a figment of your imagination no hes our disease given life and breath and voice if we had frost right now would you take it i i dont know you dont know because you dont want to remember it might be worse than what you think happened the confession was still folded in his pocket and you told me a minute ago you couldnt worry about what people thought she said im people quit worrying i never saw your show you didnt miss much tell me how you won the five million no when this is all over well rent the season one dvd i dont want to give away the ending i know the ending you win tell me so she did chewing up the thirty minutes with talk of secret blocs and voting and backstabbing and he checked the clock and said time to rinse your hair she stood he jetted on the faucet and she ducked her head underneath while he cupped the water and rinsed the dye from her hair she toweled her hair and made the wet cut spiky with her fingers she looked different enough from the woman in the newspaper photos to pass a casual inspection you can tell me about the shooting miles i wont hate you i couldnt hate you she turned and her face was inches from his i couldnt hate you ever you should know andy hissed in his ear that im never going to let you get close to another person again miles flinched we can talk about it later lets find edward wallace he pulled the thin phone book from the sidetable drawer it covered the scattering of communities near yosemite he ran a finger along the residential listings edward wallace hes listed not trying to hide we could just call him and ask him about allison no i dont want him shoving us off you and nathan stay here i want to come with you no it could be dangerous he said besides im experienced at getting information out of people youre not please the hurt shone in her face well sure since youre so experienced ill just sit in my disguise and talk to myself she crossed her arms and sat down ill come back with frost he said yeah great she said as he shut the door celeste stood at the window and watched him go then she went back inside and stood over nathan curled in quiet sleep gently she touched his cheek as if to reassure herself that he was still there then she found edward wallaces address in the phone book and wrote a note for nathan she put it by his bedside and he opened his eyes and reached out and grabbed her arm what are you doing he asked im going to help miles no celeste stay his voice was quiet not jagged let go of my arm nathan he didnt you need to stay this is over now celeste and youll be safe what do you mean she tried to free her arm nathan tightened his grip i did it for all of us hell be here soon what have you done she wrenched free from him hit him in the chest spun for the door she opened it and saw groote the man from santa fe running toward the room from the motel office his eyes lasered on hers she slammed the door fumbled to engage the chain lock missing and then groote powered against the door with all his muscle and fury and she landed hard on the worn carpet he leveled a gun at celestes head nathan threw himself at groote and groote whipped the pistol hard across nathans face cutting his cheek he kicked nathan piledriving him onto celeste groote closed the door threw the dead bolt aimed the gun at them hi nathan dont light any fires nice to see you again mrs brent dont scream his smile chilled celestes skin we need to talk fortyone edward wallaces windows needed a scrubbing the sides of the bungalow cried for a fresh coat of paint but a gleaming mercedes stood in the driveway at odds with the tumbledown air of the home not a home just a house where someone lived miles remembered allisons neat tidiness he couldnt picture her at this house but then shed lived a lie he didnt know the real allison at all miles went up to the porch knocked he heard a shuffle of footsteps the door opened a crack miles saw a sliver of face blue eye blond hair unshaven cheek mr wallace its doctor my apologies doctor wallace we need to talk i dont believe in god or fund raisers he shut the door miles leaned forward spoke low against the door frame allison sent me or i guess you call her renee four beats of silence then the door opened edward wallace matched the picture of the man in the wedding photo tall with a thin intellectual face and the lean build of a marathon runner he held a sleek automatic pistol in his hand aimed at miless stomach it trembled in his grip who are you miles kendrick i knew your wife at least i thought i did edward wallace bit his lip youre the federal witness miles kept his surprise off his face allison told you yes would you mind pointing your friend away from me doctor wallace wallace lowered the gun i would have missed i dont know anything about guns i have about a thousand questions for you miles said well i have only one answer you and i are both dead men wallace said unless we help each other fortytwo you gave me a chase man groote knelt down near nathan keeping the gun firmly aimed at celestes head now no more fighting okay it only hurts us both nathans mouth trembled no no thinking about the time we spent together groote said i dont enjoy hurting people but no pain for you no gain for me talk to me and i wont get out mr screwdriver again at least not on you he grabbed celeste who had wriggled free from under nathan dont nathan said dont hurt her then help me nathan he ran the gun barrel along the top of celestes new haircut but i want to know where frost and miles kendrick are miles is gone celeste said before nathan could answer where to get frost celeste said youre cooperative mrs brent groote said celeste swallowed i dont want you to shoot us when will he be back an hour not sure celeste said you were in a tearass hurry to leave when you came out of the door groote said i heard you loved the great indoors nathan works my last nerve she said he has that effect groote said but youre working my nerve you people chose the wrong guy to screw with the phone rang let it be groote ordered if its miles she said quietly hell expect me to answer hell wonder where we are i dont answer hell be on his guard groote shoved her toward the phone answer it you warn him i put a bullet in tin soldier he grabbed nathans hair jerked the young man close to him jabbed the gun hard against nathans temple she picked up the phone yes she could not believe how calm her voice was no answer she could hear breathing on the opposite end of the line yes were fine she said not wanting to say yes again wondering why doesnt miles speak is groote there a voice she didnt recognize said a mans voice with the barest hint of a boston accent yes she said again the line ended all right miles goodbye she hung up what did he say groote said letting me know how the search is going for edward wallace yes but wallace isnt at home miles is going to wait for him bring back food when hes done she sat down on the bed her skin prickled what the hell was that call who was that man we havent eaten for hours poor you groote scratched at the bandage covering his broken nose i saw you on castaway my wife loved that show i know you can be a tricky bitch i played fair and square she couldnt believe the sudden anger in her voice whatever your face is known youre going to be a problem for me terror filled her now that groote believed miles would soon return with the precious frost he would have no use for her or nathan he wasnt going to let her out of this room his gun wore a silencer and his hands were big enough to crush her throat his eyes smudged with exhaustion over the grimy nose bandage regarded her without mercy she could not sit in this grubby room and wait to die not again waiting choked with fear for a man to walk through those doors and watch him be murdered not again why are you doing this nathan asked groote my boss wants his property back groote said he prodded celeste with the gun you tell me does it work what she looked up from her lap frost does it work why would you care just curious his voice was flat but she saw heat fire his eyes at her question you mean does frost work so is it worth it to kill us well im too scared to tell you she put a waver in her voice if the panic hits me i start screaming no screaming groote said in a harsh bark you scream you die she shoved her palms against her mouth pretending to stifle a shriek two deep breaths and she lowered her hands i need my medicine please groote said forget it just shut up and sit there let her have her antidepressant man nathan said groote gave him a kick to the chest that floored him i dont want to hear your whining i am incredibly tired of you people my pills in my purse in the next room she slapped at her chest as if she were beating back a howl climbing into her throat i have sedatives too for nathan in his frown gone straight she saw groote make the decision she calculated he might he could force a pharmacy down their throats keep them under control groote put the gun on nathan hauled him to his feet come on tin soldier try anything and you get a bad dent she walked to the next room groote and nathan a step behind her she walked to her purse wrong groote said pick it up by the bottom mrs brent dump it on the floor no surprises she did as he asked and her junk tumbled in a pile on the greasy gray carpet lipstick the extra rubber bands miles had brought her her money clip a black notebook an empty pill vial wallet her cell phone switched off as miles had ordered so the wireless company couldnt get a reading on her location she crouched among the junk hands away from the cell phone kick it to me groote ordered she obeyed he crushed the phone under his heel breaking the keys and the screen she cranked open the pill vial empty oh she said im im out but she fidgeted put her knee over the money clip stupid groote said she stayed kneeling get up tin soldier on the bed im tying you two up she got up closing her fist around the clip she worked the money loose let the clip drop to the floor between the soft worn bills the sharp bite of her razor nipped at her finger she folded it in her hand groote didnt see he shoved her on the bed across from nathan if one of you moves you die groote said tie me first she thought please because nathan could help her fight him when groote drew close to her but he tied nathan first pulling the phone cord loose from the wall securing nathans hands and feet together ripping a pillowcase jamming a nearchoking length into nathans mouth she told herself dont flinch there wasnt another phone cord in the room so he snapped loose the curtain cord and came toward her she knelt on the bed and stuck her hands out in front of her as though prepping to be handcuffed and before he could reach her she said i have most of the five million that i won its yours just let us go and because he thought she was about to beg not fight he paused i dont give a shit about your money i cant be tied up because of what happened to me when my husband died not a problem to put fear into her voice but she was more afraid of what would happen if she didnt stop him dont tie me i know where frost is right now where she raised her chin i dont want nathan to hear she figured groote would steer her into the next room but he was too eager he leaned closer to her and she might not get close again so she slapped at him except the razor was tight and true between her fingers and the blade scored a garish red thread across his face along his cheek close to the eye he stumbled back in shock and she swung at him again but he clubbed her arm aside with a low animal grunt that rose into a scream she darted the razor toward his throat groote belted a fist into her temple and she tumbled off the bed he levered his foot hard on her wrist forced her fingers open and the razor slipped free of them date with pain his voice sounded broken thats right you cut me bitch it better not scar it better not scare amanda his voice stopped and she fought him biting kicking his hands clamping over her mouth and he carried her headfirst into the bathroom he held her upside down her feet brushed the plaster ceiling where is frost where is it i dont know she started to say and then she saw the open toilet rushing toward her face she managed a startled gulp of air before he drove her face into the shallow water celeste struggled but he pinioned her legs with his own her hands with one of his massive arms and held her head at a precise angle and her face rammed against the porcelain hes done this before she realized in shock you know tell me where is it he yelled all she could do was keep kicking make him fight to drown her the air exploded from her lungs as though seeking release and she choked breathed the water and then he let her go she fell to the cold tile spluttering coughing tasting her own blood from her lips mrs brent are you well the voice from the phone above her stood a fiftyish man hair dark as coal skin pale with the biggest gun shed ever seen pressed against grootes head fortythree why are we both dead men miles asked we know too much or rather people think we know too much edward wallace stepped aside and miles walked into the house he could see a back wall dotted with photos of allison wearing glasses hair lighter in color cut longer about frost do you have it cautious hope lit wallaces eyes no you do hope changed to surprise what allison hid the files on a server here the day she died oh jesus that explains it wallace sank against the wall not to me doctor wallace i dont have frost but you could access this system where she put the files no listen you have to go now you cant be here when dodd gets here whos dodd miles remembered having heard the name when sorenson spoke on the phone in allisons office dodd doesnt know and asking allison who dodd was as she hung up on him before she died dodd the missing piece of the puzzle you cant be here and you cant know who he is please just go no show me this system where she uploaded the files i dont have the frost files you erased them no i dont know what happened wallace said he set the gun down on the table ran a hand through his hair which stuck in clumps as though hed run his hands through it in unending worry for the whole day your wife asked me for help doctor i didnt help her in time and shes dead and the only way to help her now is to make sure whoever killed her doesnt get away with it wallaces half cough half laugh was a strange sound in the quiet of the bungalow you stop them i dont know which side killed her but you wont stop them listen dodd could arrive at any time we need to go if youre so afraid of this dodd why havent you already left miles wondered dodd wants frost why who is he if i tell you will you help me hide before they kill me the way they killed renee this didnt add up but the fear on the mans face seemed real and defined these people killed your wife why dont you just go to the cops i cant go to the police explain wallace took a fortifying deep breath dodd was in charge of the original frost project hurley and quantrill didnt create frost no they built on our findings i was on the original frost research team wallace said so was renee why was she living as allison vance she had no choice being allison was her cover story dodd forced her hes with the government what agency dodds group is codenamed shaman but you wont see them listed on a congressional budget they operate out of back rooms with money cleaned through legit projects hes in charge of clandestine scientific research for the defense department it clicked frost would be an immediate benefit to soldiers mentally devastated by the horrors of war so she was supposed to steal it for dodd returning his stolen property why didnt she just send it to dodd i dont know why did she send frost to your server i dont know id had no contact with her since she went to santa fe dodd forbade it wallace closed his eyes the the people on dodds team three years ago we developed the initial version of frost im a neurobiologist i worked on the beta blockers to prevent traumatic memories from consolidating allison was one of the psychiatrists but our prototype drug didnt work unless administered within two hours immediately following the trauma one soldier in the test group he went psychotic when his longterm trauma didnt go away he killed the other patients in the testing all of them wallaces voice broke we brought those people there to help them to cure them and they all were murdered one by one in their sleep dodd ended the project and killed the research renee blamed herself she knew about frost she knew what it was from the beginning miles said after dodd shut down the project his team drifted into other work renee and i moved up to fresno to open a ptsd clinic while i taught college and continued research we kept a low profile and then dodd showed up at our house a few months ago quantrill had got hold of the original research another researcher stole the original work and sold it to him and managed to take frost to the next level dodd found out probably from the researcher who sold the data to quantrill dodd can be convincing as in his way or its your funeral that researcher died in a car accident i dont believe much in coincidence miles remembered the news account you had a hiking accident a few weeks back dodd forced us to quit our jobs and we moved up here for a lower profile renee went to santa fe to do dodds spying for him she called me late one night on the phone from her office she missed me dodd must have been monitoring her office line he sent a message as to what happens when his rules are broken he came asked me to go on a hike with him so we could talk gave me a shove off a tenfoot bluff just enough to hurt to rough me up a warning nice wallace said renee blamed herself for the frost patients dying before she never got over it dodd covered up the deaths made the families believe the patients had died in a fire in the ward at a medical hospital in san diego where we did the work so dodd wanted a new and improved frost back he made allison his spy shed been a spy of sorts just like him miless chest tensed he remembered her words the last morning he saw her i think i understand you better than you know wallace nodded memory research its a small world quantrill couldnt know that shed worked on the original team she had to see if his version of frost had promise steal it if it did and then she could be renee again why didnt dodd just go to the authorities and let them handle it quantrill broke the law buying government secrets dodd didnt want the original project exposed the pentagon was doing secret drug testing on veterans i dont think dodd has a shadow the man doesnt see the light of day often connect the other players for me sorenson whos he wallace sat down in the chair mopped sweat from his forehead hes a mean bastard he worked security on dodds projects he was supposed to go to santa fe and protect renee help her if she needed to bypass security systems to steal the frost research sorenson killed her what he planted the bomb that killed her he told wallace about seeing sorenson enter and leave allisons office without his case return and speak on the phone about dodd wallace paled covered his eyes with his hand would sorenson have access to explosives he used to be in covert operations for the pentagon hes dodds security guy dodd called me early this morning in a panic because he knew shed sent the files to the server i dont know how he knew early this morning miles said oh jesus his mouth went dry nathan putting the payphone receiver down a sheepish look on his face a lie on his lips about a weekly duty to call his mother a call he could not risk in the same room even with miles asleep dodd was connected to allison allison tried to help nathan escape so maybe i think i know who called him dodd ever mention a guy named nathan ruiz no it didnt mean nathan didnt know dodd so dodd wanted the files she sent but theyre not there i use the server to run a small web hosting business and to hold my research database run powerhungry apps i use in my work i never saw any files never knew they were there you have to believe me dodd doesnt i gave him the access codes he checked it himself someone accessed the server this morning using the admin password renee and i used and ran a wiping program to destroy all the data on the drive everythings gone totally overwritten nothings recoverable and ive already tried the only other person with the administrative password who could have done that was renee unless she gave the password to someone miles thought it through sorenson allison wasnt hiding the files from him she was stashing them to deliver to dodd so the files would still be available to him or sorenson if quantrills people caught or killed her but she must have told sorenson the code or he found the password people are always writing that stuff down and he took the frost research off the server then wiped the server to destroy the files once hed retrieved them dodd doesnt believe me he thinks i have frost hes coming thats why i need to hide a tremble colored wallaces voice the picture wasnt fully clear and miles shook his head go back to sorenson wheres he dodd said sorenson went missing two days ago dodd thinks another man a guy named dennis groote who works for quantrill caught up with him probably killed him probably after our escape from the hospital miles thought this nathan ruiz i mentioned he was a patient of allisons sorenson went to a lot of trouble to try and kill him at sangre de cristo but i dont know why i never heard of him but youve heard of me she asked me to help her before she died if sorenson was supposed to protect her she sure didnt need me so she must have suspected he was betraying her he took frost but then why give him the key to the hideyhole for the files it made no sense unless shed given the password before she suspected him this is all dodds fault wallace said if hed left well enough alone one more question witsec vetted allison it did a background check on her so so allison vance isnt a real person she couldnt have passed the check under false name well clearly she did dodd would have handled ensuring her background was impeccable still it bothered miles why risk it though if she was there as a spy why take on a client who might expose her she must not have known at first that you were a federal witness but i dont know dodd ran her show listen all i need is your help to vanish ask dodd no wallace shook his head no way i want out no more miles said its not right what the hell do you mean she died on tuesday night you say that the server was wiped today sorenson cant be dead if he did the wiping wallace blinked nodded well yes how do you wipe a server like you would any hard drive you have to have the highenough account level and then you use a specialized program that overwrites all the files on the drive so why didnt he clean it off on tuesday it doesnt make sense i dont know wallace stood i cant stay wed better go he paced the floor talking to himself mexico not far enough i had to learn french and german for my doctorate in science so europe would be good timing miles thought days to notice the files hours to run yet wallace stayed the fresh widower the frightened lab geek waiting for dodds vengeance wallace was lying and miles reached for the gun in the back of the pants just as wallace seized his abandoned gun on the table and with a runners grace spun toward miles and fired fortyfour mrs brent the man repeated and celeste got to her feet shaking leaning against the wall my name is dodd do exactly what i say and youll be safe please untie nathan go wash your face sit on the bed with him do not leave the room do not make a phone call do not scream i will help you am i clear stunned she nodded dodd shoved groote out of the room pushed him against the wall started searching him his gun she thought and opened her mouth to speak i kicked his gun under the bed but caution made her be quiet dodd glanced back at her mrs brent do as i say please and everything will be fine she worked nathans gag free you okay he said she nodded and untied the knots binding nathans hands and feet she was so glad to be alive she shivered from head to toe as though shed plunged into freezing water sir nathan said to dodd thank you thank you youre all right nathan dodd asked yes sir crisply said as though he were back in the military ready to go fight the war all over again celeste washed her face her lips were swollen and shed bled from her mouth and her nose but not much the soap smelled of lemon and she scrubbed her skin hard who are you celeste asked as she dried her face hes my boss nathan said a clear pride in his voice boss dodd finished searching groote and shoved him facedown to the other bed put the cannon close to his back answer my questions or your spine will be gone you work for oliver quantrill who groote said i admire loyalty but only to a point wheres sorenson i have no idea dont lie mr groote sorenson broke my nose ask nathan if i knew where the bastard was id kill him but i dont interesting dodd said mr groote hurt you didnt he nathan with a screwdriver nathan scrambled to the floor and retrieved grootes gun handed it to dodd and celeste wondered what the hell is he doing she thought too late she should have retrieved the gun first want to take a screwdriver to mr groote nathan shook his head no isnt nathan a better man than you are mr groote dodd asked apparently hatred coated his voice nathan dodd said dont be alarmed by what im going to say to mr groote its only because we live in desperate times he leaned closer to groote i have an offer for you quantrills a dead end you need to come over to my side which side is that groote asked were the people who invented frost in the first place your boss stole it from me what celeste started to say and then nathan silenced her with a subtle shake of his head let me tell you how we can help you and help your daughter mr groote my daughter groote said in choked shock and celeste saw real fear light in the mans eyes real terror you dont go near my kid goddamn you only fearful men make threats mr groote confident men make promises heres my first promise to you im your new employer i dont recall looking for a new job breathe a sigh of relief youve had the shit kicked out of you since you signed on with quantrill now you work for me im buying out your contract im not for sale dodd produced a digital recorder from his pocket i know your price he clicked the button daddy a girls voice was quiet drugged blissed dad hi its me im supposed to say hi to you first theyre moving me to a new hospital this morning they said you were too busy to come see me during the move but that youd visit soon a murmuring womans voice sounded next whispering to the girl to say goodbye yes the girl slurred i love you daddy come see me soon the recording ended groote gasped in strained hitches and found his voice ill fucking kill you and what will happen to your amanda then groote said in a torrent jesus please dont hurt my kid god where is she who the hell are you that you can move her without my permission celeste felt chilled by the fear on grootes face the smug smirk on dodds the heartbreaking whisper of the girls voice she stood keep her still nathan please dodd said what the hell is this celeste started and nathan pulled her back to the bed made her sit do what he says hes the good guy celeste thought no hes not dodd said amandas simply insurance i just want to be sure you stay on my side youre going to betray quantrill for me mr groote but i want to be sure you dont pull a double cross on me your daughter is perfectly safe its up to you to see that she remains perfectly safe the government groote said suddenly youre with the government government sounds so large unwieldy inefficient im more of a back corner dodd said quantrill said frost was abandoned research groote said you saying he stole frost from the government dodd put his lips close to grootes ear heres the deal all you need to know is that if you get frost and kill quantrill and sorenson for me you get your daughter back safe and sound guaranteed youre not prosecuted for any of your freelance activities and dennis may i call you dennis your daughter gets frost just like how nathan gets frost and how mrs brent will get frost if she and i can come to an understanding dodd gave celeste a polite nod she wondered if she could reach the door before he fired eight steps two more out the door hed mow her down shoot her in the back she had no doubt groote swallowed ill do whatever you want understand this amandas safety depends on my safety you betray me she suffers no one wants an innocent girl whos already suffered so to endure additional pain give me no reason to doubt you dennis i wont groote said celeste could not feel sorry for him but the confident killer whod broken into their rooms was gone a confused hulk in his place sit up groote obeyed you came here first yes i figured they would go for the cheapest motel you followed them all the way from new mexico of course not i flew to fresno this morning i saw on celestes computer the frost files were transferred to a server owned by wallace but you havent been to see doctor wallace no i got delayed in santa fe answering questions from the fbi about kendrick the bureaus looking for him because hes a missing witness groote nodded you think kendrick has frost i believed he did did you kill allison hell no did you kill sorenson no but i would if i could they and nathan all worked for me at least they did sorenson killed allison tried to kill nathan ran off with frost i suspect dodd said to sell it celeste said and they all looked at her none of this is about helping people its just about the money its always money mrs brent dodd said i know i have nathans loyalty and i have enough of denniss to let me sleep with one eye closed youre the open question sir nathan said celeste is cool she killed hurley he cant talk about his work well thank you mrs brent dodd said you did me a great favor allison worked for you celeste said allison she and nathan were my spies one inside one outside on how quantrill and hurley were improving frost im sorry allison dragged you into this situation i assume she needed a way to hide frost from sorenson and she used you in that cause its regrettable are you going to kill me celeste asked in a whisper no nathan said no way she can stay quiet cant you celeste yes celeste heard herself say sure dodd flipped open a cell phone dialed a number waiting and then she saw a black fury cross his face as he asked who was speaking and his chest heaved in a disappointed sigh dodd raised the gun and aimed it straight at celeste fortyfive the bullet zoomed a good two feet left of miless head and he didnt shoot back he barreled forward stiff armed and jammed his gun against wallaces throat wallace dropped the gun and miles thought hes scared shitless doesnt know what hes doing stupid miles said very stupid please please he told me i had to kill you who dodd wallace said you wanted me to leave with you so you could bring me to him or to shoot you somewhere else not in my house im sorry im sorry my wife is dead i dont want to die too wallace started to cry tell me the truth do you have frost no god no if i had it id have given it to dodd immediately and id be a freaking hero to him id be safe be honest with me i found out allison was dead on wednesday dodd called me i was devastated ive hardly been out of bed the past few days i havent been working i havent hardly touched the server i didnt know the frost files were sitting there please dont kill me you didnt retrieve the files then cover your tracks by wiping the server i wouldnt be in league with the man who killed my wife wallace said jesus i gave dodd the server password as soon as he asked for it he found nothing hes coming to be sure im not lying to him to check please the phone rang miles tucked wallaces gun into his back he picked up the phone wallace residence whos this a quiet voice miles kendrick ah mr dodd yes i have your friends with me rooms twentyfour and twentyfive at the yosemite gateway miless skin went cold dont hurt them actually i saved them dennis groote was drowning your friend mrs brent in the toilet tell him that youre well mrs brent miles heard celestes voice a few feet from the receiver im okay but hes pointing a gun at me she sounded calm i dont want them hurt miles said neither do i dodd said we need to come to an agreement now miles im wondering what youre doing at doctor wallaces house hunting for frost same as you wallace says he doesnt have it should we believe him dodd sounded almost coy i dont think so but ill give him to you in exchange for my friends and you can figure out if hes telling the truth you know him better than i do wallaces eyes went wide but miles mouthed its okay its cool and raised an open hand to calm the doctor dodd said edwards a strong scientist but not a truly strong man i always thought renee married him because hed give her no trouble i dont mean your friends any harm nathan works for you you planted him at the hospital when you got wind of frost being tested and you left him there to die when it all went wrong i didnt know he was in danger bullshit i heard your name when sorenson was getting ready to kill allison i was in her office hiding i heard him on a phone say dodd doesnt know that would mean that i didnt know what sorenson planned dodd said i wonder who he was talking to dont you i dont know his hired help i suppose i came to bring nathan back in from the cold and to help you and mrs brent you came to get frost and nothing else talk to me face to face ill come there no the wallace house was too remote too quiet dodd wanted silence around frost around how it had been developed and tested no i want public highly public to meet you he thought quickly public with limited access roads so if dodd had backups others with him they couldnt easily sneak up distance to thwart any lastminute plans dodd might put into place wallace seemed to read his mind inside the park bridalveil falls miles said bridalveil falls as soon as you can if you hurt nathan or celeste ill guarantee you never get frost and that everyone in the press knows about shaman we understand each other we certainly do dodd clicked off hurry miles hauled wallace to his feet were going now dodd could cut us off be here in minutes but goddamn you you said you would help me wallace sputtered i gave up the gun i told you what he wanted me to do i am helping you miles said do you want to stay and wait for dodd that doesnt make sense to me if youre so scared of him you should have run you didnt i cant hide from him not for long you were waiting to cut a deal with him and you dont want to cut a deal with me allison sent frost to you for protection or she wanted a scientific analysis of the work free from dodd now shes dead and youre desperate for a bargaining chip to stay alive i dont have frost i swear i dont im your best hope for walking out of this mess alive doctor wallace i can protect you if dodds pentagon maybe hed like to talk to my highranking friends in witness protection or a few hungry prosecutors i know in the department of justice im one of their favorite witnesses he hoped this was still true he could always tell the witsec inspectors and the federal lawyers that hed lost his mind when he ran from santa fe and throw himself on their mercies they still needed him to convict the remaining barradas but even if he was trash to the government now and he had no official allies left to help him deal with dodd he needed to bluff wallace so im going to play good citizen and im going to cut a deal with dodd youre crazy that would be the problem miles said ten feet into the heavy growth of pines that inched downhill from the wallace house the man watched kendrick and wallace hurry to kendricks car and wheel out onto the road he lowered the listening device the conversation between them had been about what he had expected he flipped open a cell phone pressed a speeddial number yes kendrick is taking wallace to meet dodd inside yosemite park at bridalveil falls shit wallace may crack can you handle it sorenson said sure it just got about twice as complicated price doubled no your choice id rather be home the man waited while sorenson considered the offer agreed sorenson said with a weary tone torch the house first the man clicked off the phone he broke a back window of the kitchen door sprayed lighter fluid all over the kitchen curtains and office floor lit a match and thumbed the flame toward the puddle he ran out back to the woods and grabbed his motorcycle it had taken him less than three minutes the man got on his motorcycle and peeled off after kendricks car he didnt have to hurry and catch up to them he knew where they were going and it was a beautiful day for a mountain ride fortysix dodd drove a lincoln navigator black spacious seating was difficult no one whom groote had tried to kill wanted to sit with him but groote sat in the back with celeste and nathan sat in the front seat dodd gave groote a piece of pillowcase from the motel room to stanch the flow of blood from the cuts celeste had given him celeste slumped in the seat and guessed that miles had worked out a deal with dodd had he found frost if he was trading frost for her and nathan she would have told him to keep running because dodd she believed wanted them all permanently silenced about his operation the spectacular scenery as they drove along the winding narrow road that led toward bridalveil falls sickened her valley and rock tumbled away to their left mountain rose on their right studded with evergreens the vastness of the blue sky the sheer openness nearly overwhelmed her god could see her brian could see her she closed her eyes tried to calm herself shed made it farther than she had thought possible she could cope she must i bet a week ago you wouldnt have thought youd be in california celeste nathan said excited now confident but not quiet manic no nathan i sure didnt think so the mountains the valleys all shaped from broken rock pushed and pulled over millions of years under unimaginable force beauty out of pressure just like us not like us celeste said if you need proof frost fixes you look at celeste nathan said yosemite would be an agoraphobes nightmare and shes holding it together you arent the guy i believed you were celeste said you misjudge nathan dodd said hes a hero he wants to be one and youve taken advantage of him she said shut up nathan said frost is going to help every soldier coming back from war for years no more suicides no more broken marriages no more inability to fit back into regular life none of what i went through the whole country will be grateful i know nathan celeste kept her voice steady but kidnapping and threatening to kill grootes kid is that heroic nathan he swallowed hard he saved your life celeste so you shut up now dodd said i never used the word kill mrs brent im not a monster and i resent the implication i have no desire to hurt you or amanda groote you get frost what happens to us you can be in a testing program a legitimate one we can make public when the drug works and i can arrange for you to reenter public life given your disappearance from santa fe well say you simply checked yourself into a clinic after allisons death it wont be hard if you can keep your mouth shut and if i dont you kill me you were much more diplomatic on tv dodd sounded amused are you going to speak out about how frost was born ruin it for millions of other people celeste ignored him groote she tapped his leg until he looked at her whats wrong with your daughter that she needs frost like you would care i might celeste said shes not you groote put his eyes back to the mountains rise the last slivers of snow still in shadow celeste could not pity him exactly but with his broken nose his bruised and razorsliced face and his frayed gaze groote looked as if he had gone to fight a hundred wars for his child and lost them all such a man did not stop he did not quit she was afraid groote still had more fight in him or perhaps he needed frost himself she thought with a jolt dodd might have forced groote into that hinterland of sanity where she had wandered after brians death lost alone with no map to guide her home groote ignored celeste brents question he would never discuss his baby girl with these nutcases and thought dodd doesnt know he doesnt know allison had both the research and the buyers list he thinks she just stole the research they dont know about the second auction sorenson mentioned they havent put the whole picture together on what that bastard sorensons doing the two crazies didnt seem to know either or seem to care he had a trump card value to trade for amanda and he knew he had to wait for the right second to play it a deal of sorts was brewing between miles and dodd and this was exactly the info that could change the deal in his favor in amandas favor dodd was nothing more than a smug bureaucrat who thought he was running the show dodd was dead wrong groote knew if he could just keep his nerve he promised himself hed bring amanda to this mountain paradise someday whole and healthy the fresh air would do her a world of good if she wouldnt be afraid of the winding roads miles drove through the amazing yosemite landscape with no eye for beauty rising jutting mountains clear sky huge pines spectacular but he wasnt in the mood to appreciate it wallace sat next to him tell me about her miles said she was tough its not what i expected you to say its what comes to mind wallace said miles edged over to the right as a motorcycle drew up to them passed them a young man with a heavy pack mounted behind him glancing at them as he sped past wallace said she grew up poor went to college on full scholarship had med and grad schools fighting over her bright beyond belief great at reading people telling them what they wanted to hear you didnt say anything about her helping people did she help you yes i thought for a while she was the only one would could she was good at making people think she was the cure all right wallace said staring out the window she wasnt no one doctor is the holy grail wallace said but patients want to believe it of their doctors and doctors indulge the fantasy she liked being needed a sign announced bridalveil on their left miles steered the car into a parking slot you stick close to me miles said i thought you didnt trust me i dont but the point is to come to agreement and all of us walk away no problems you included they got out of the car and started to hike toward the falls the trail to bridalveil led up a series of terraced steps white water cascaded in fury down a creek topped with froth the roar of the falls increased as they approached the snowmelt gave way in torrents under the early may sun now miles could see the top of the falls jetting down the mist rising from impact the water almost dancing with the strong wind that swept through the valley they headed right toward the falls themselves walking along the raging creek of cascading snowmelt there wasnt much of a crowd this early in the season miles saw a trio of japanese tourists an elderly couple with a decided spring in their step leaning on each other smiling a young couple staring up at the falls with worshipful rapture he saw nathan smiling jumpy excited then celeste her lips and nose bruised her face pale a tightness grabbed his chest groote stood next to her his face was a mess the tourists passing stared at him then put their eyes to the waterfall or the trail when groote returned their looks and an older man stood next to him the man was built tall and wiry balding with a thin intelligent face he wore jeans a black coat boots they waited at a widening in the trail a juncture where visitors could observe both the falls and the swollen rivulet that surged away from the falls base the roar of the falls increased and now miles felt bridalveils kiss on his face his hands he would be soaked if he stood in the mist for ten minutes hello miles its a pleasure to meet you the man said edward dodd edward said i dont have frost ive told you the truth theres a clearing where its not so damp id like to smoke a cigarette rocks to sit on natures boardroom dodd started walking as though assuming all would follow and they did are you okay miles murmured to celeste she nodded squeezed his arm he shot a look back at nathan who kept a worshipful stare locked on the back of dodds head they followed him down the soaked stone trail retreating from the falls nathan bringing up the rear miles glanced at groote groote met his eyes gave no expression no reaction as though miles werent there dodd led them across a bridge that spanned the snowswollen creek a flat area covered with boulders was to their right and dodd found a rock about chair height he sat gestured for miles and celeste to sit next to him nathan groote and wallace stood no other visitors were within hearing and the roar of the falls drowned their conversations from any passing ears a beautiful choice for a meeting place miles dodd said he lit a cigarette nature is so calming he talked miles thought as though he held every face card why is groote here hes working for me now not quantrill he kidnapped grootes kid celeste said blackmailed him into switching sides celeste is overdramatizing dodd said i made a job offer he accepted you clearly have a plan then miles said groote here goes back to quantrill and steals frost i find a place for you and your friends and doctor wallace to lie low when grootes got frost back then his daughter and you and nathan and celeste can be in a legitimate program to test frost and get the help you all need dodd smiled no strings attached miles asked a few id prefer you not get back in touch with other federal authorities and when youre feeling better miles maybe i can offer you a more rewarding life than witsec ever could youre resourceful under difficult circumstances you could come work for me what about celeste her face her name is known shes on the front page of the papers today ill help her resurface build a back story interest in her will blow over in another week no offense celeste dodd said with a wink we left a dead man behind in her house hurleys buried groote said suddenly i found him i took care of him he glanced at miles an odd look miles thought full of heat hey groote miles said groote looked him in the eye dodd thinks you killed his agent sorenson groote shook his head i dont care about sorenson dodd said you should if wallace doesnt have frost im sure sorenson does miles crossed his arms whats he doing with it if hes not delivering it to you if youre so concerned sorensons alive and well and wishing us harm dodd said go hunt him down i get frost i dont care miles said im not seeing the powers of persuasion it must have taken for you to talk nathan into betraying us i didnt betray you nathans voice shook shut up nathan you could have been honest with us at any point you werent you delivered us to this guy nathan said this was the only way for us to get frost be in legit testing move on with our lives miles shook his head at nathan are you really traumatized or you just faking everything nathan endured in iraq and afterward is true dodd said he volunteered he wanted a chance to help his fellow soldiers dont judge me nathan said im not a criminal i agree dodd said he stood celeste you killed a man albeit in selfdefense but you fled the scene miles i dont even want to think about how many laws youve broken in pursuit of frost help me and i can make sure none of your crimes haunts you he crushed his cigarette under his heel or you kill us quantrills not an idiot hell hide frost where well never find it miles stood now close enough to dodd to smell the cigarette smoke on the mans breath the question youre dodging is what is sorenson going to do with frost if he has it sit on it take it himself sell it back to you or to quantrill or hes right groote said that would be the question answer him miles said nathan said miles step back what youre a bodyguard now miles said you were a kid too scared to know what to do in allisons house crying and chained to a bed in that hospital afraid of mirrors too scared to be honest with me and celeste so shut the hell up nathan he decided to test dodd sorenson wanted nathan dead because he was afraid nathan knew about him im curious did sorenson go after nathan on your order do necessary housecleaning once your operation fell apart the only answer was the steady roar of the falls and the delighted whoop of a hiker heading up the trail finally dodd shook his head of course not i came to help nathan and to offer an arrangement to you so you two can either help me or i can make one call and have you and celeste under arrest and in jail for the foreseeable future not if we tell all we know im talking jail in a foreign country shaman was highly classified youre in possession of knowledge of topsecret government files if you had possession of frost thats called treason son i can render your asses to morocco or pakistan and thats all they wrote i dont think those are the kinds of walls you want surrounding you celeste he shrugged and offered a negotiators smile listen i dont want to pull out big guns but you either cooperate or you dont the choice is yours miles looked up at the boulder opposite him and andy and allison both sat as though theyd been hiking through the trails and needed to rest choice is interesting choice helps you pull and tug apart at a theory miles said why i wonder did wallace make the choice to stay and wait for you lets say he got the frost files when allison hid them and then covered his tracks and hes lying about the files being destroyed no reason for him to stay and take the heat from you he could run and vanish hes got a commodity worth millions innocent men dont run wallace said i gave him an order to stay dodd said yes and to shoot me hes scared shitless of you but i think someone else gave him an order to stay and to draw you close dodd turned to wallace and miles saw the blood spray first from dodds chest sudden and heartred then from wallaces throat across groote and celeste as the booms broke through the rush of the falls another boom and a third bullet chocked through wallaces chest in a puff of flesh and red miles shoved celeste knocking her behind the boulder as two more whistling shots pierced the air inches above his head nathan froze in shock and then miles barreled into him finding cover behind a rock eight more shots groote lay flat caught between two boulders and he tried to raise his head and a bullet pinged off the stone tourists and hikers near them scrambled in blind panic unsure where the shots were coming from a woman was screaming a man seized his young daughter and retreated behind an outcropping of boulders on the other side of the walk bridge then nothing miles counted to fifty listening to sounds of frantic running his own heart seeming to pound hard enough to crack bone he dragged wallaces body behind the boulder raised the dead mans head it didnt get shot off he eased wallace to the ground dodd lay in a dead sprawl eyes open his chest punctured by two rounds miles grabbed celeste come on we have to go nathan said stay with your boss miles spat no miles please dont leave me nathan pointed at groote who risked a dash running toward dodds body hell kill me come on nathan its okay celeste said but miles watched groote stop search dodds body a gun dodd must have a gun but what groote was pulling from dodds pocket was a cell phone groote celeste started he knows where my kid is he called someone to move her i got to have his call log i got to find her groote screamed but he stuck his hand back in dodds jacket gun miles thought he knocked groote down with a hard fist to the nose the weak point and groote brayed in pain miles wrenched the gun free and he and celeste and nathan ran miles sure another bullet would zoom from the snipers gun but no more shots the sniper was gone or simply waiting for them to reach the parking lot my kid wheres my kid nathan wheres my kid groote roared behind them they hurried down the nowempty path toward the parking lot past cowering hikers one of them screaming futilely into a cell phone useless in the confines of the valley the recent rainfall hadnt drained well from the parking lot and they raced through anklehigh water toward blaines car miles started the car peeled it out of the parking lot revved onto the road get down both of you he said they were in the backseat one road out he spun out onto it heading south the way theyd come he tried to think the gunshots had come from across the road close to the river where there was a stopping point to admire the grandeur of the sheer rock face of el capitan sorenson hed gotten wallace to get dodd running to fish camp probably planning to eliminate them both and then miles and company and groote were pulled into the trap as well a motorcycle wheeled up behind them and the back windshield exploded fortyseven to miless left rose mountain to his right the land fell away to valley either precipitous rocky drops or rolling meadows down to the merced river the road was two lanes one each way and now cars on the opposite side veered to the shoulder as miles swerved to shake the cyclist no cars ahead of him miles floored the accelerator the shooter on the motorcycle stayed close miles saw the mans face in the rearview not sorenson not a face he recognized raising a heavy pistol again stay down he screamed at celeste and nathan he had nowhere to go mountain on one side air on the other he couldnt shake the guy then he saw a black lincoln navigator powering up fast behind the motorcycle groote at the wheel the cyclist fired again and miles heard the bullet thwock into the back of the passenger seat and then in the rearview he saw groote nudge the navigator into the motorcycle hard the cyclist fought to steady himself swiveled his aim back toward groote and blasted at the navigator missed groote didnt retreat as miles hit the next curve groote rammed the navigator hard into the bike the cyclist getting airborne and landing on miless trunk he scrabbled for a onehanded grip sliding toward the frame of the back windshield the cycle smashed into a guardrail somersaulted and soared out into empty air grootes navigator kissed the railing sparks flying as he fought for control miles wrenched the car hard to the left screeching into the oncoming lane veering back just in time to avoid a honking pickup truck trying to throw the cyclist clear he glanced in the rearview the cyclist had managed to get a hold with his gloved hand on the lip of the shattered back window nathan pounded his fist down on the mans grip and miles saw the cyclists gun swerve and take aim not at nathan or celeste him kill him and the chase is over groote thundered up fast behind them the cyclist fired miless window shattered and in the rearview he saw nathan fighting with the cyclist struggling for control of the gun celeste looped her blanket over the shooters head tried to pull him offbalance then two shots boomed in fast succession and the cyclist screamed a tire blew and miles fought the wheel to keep the car from sliding into the opposite lane or into the railing and the sky beyond suddenly miles saw a sign service area to the left he swung hard into oncoming traffic driving on a rim and into a flat parking area grootes navigator followed nathan dragged the cyclist into the car started pummeling him with his fists celeste tumbled out of the car falling on her back onto the pavement grootes car screeched up close to her miles got his gun leveled it at groote truce groote yelled i saved your life man truce dont shoot me and groote dropped his gun to the pavement nathan dragged the cyclist out of the car sitting on him and miles could see the two shots groote had made neat bullet holes in the cyclists right hip and leg i saved you groote repeated after youve tried to kill us i thought you had frost my job is to get it back but i didnt kill allison you know sorenson did and dodd he has my daughter i dont know how to find her without him without people who know him know his operation please please miles ive got to find sorenson please tell me what you know please my kid i have nothing without my kid and groote stopped beneath the razor slashes the broken nose the bruised face miles saw the real pain in the mans eyes i have information you need to stop sorenson ill share if nathan or this bastard he gestured at the cyclist can tell me where my kid is miles kept the gun on him went to the cyclist celeste steered nathan back against the car let him talk to us nathan nathan miles said total honesty do you know where dodd put grootes daughter nathan shook his head no i dont you cant trust groote celeste said miles knelt by the cyclist pulled the helmet free you wheres sorenson the cyclist closed his eyes where do we find sorenson where do we find the rest of dodds people dodd doesnt have any more people not in the field the cyclist coughed blood why he didnt have protection you cant help sorenson now wheres he at groote said he picked up his gun and put it squarely on the mans forehead he started counting down five four austin hes in austin texas where in austin i dont know i just know austin is this where the auction is groote asked auction miles said what auction the cyclist ignored miles and nodded at groote do you know where my daughter is groote asked no three groote started the count again i dont know i dont but sorenson hed know he worked for dodd that we knew is my daughter with him groote said the man blinked and groote said two i dont know sorenson didnt tell me about her the cyclist spoke in a rush ill call sorenson tell him i did the hit on you all hell back off for a few days if you hide bull nathan said miles we have to go celeste said youre right groote said one and he shot the cyclist between the eyes goddamn it miles screamed he could have told us plenty more he shoved celeste and nathan back toward the car groote knelt took a cell phone and a wallet from the cyclists leather jacket he couldnt tell us more because we cant stay the forest service will be all over this side of the park in a few minutes we have to go whats this we shit truce groote said we both need sorenson the only reason i was after you all is because quantrill thought you had frost you dont sorenson does sorenson stole frost to sell it in a new auction he either knows where my little girl is or i can threaten his auction to get him to give me information on how i can find her im going to austin i dont want you getting arrested and telling the police about me i can either kill the three of you or we can help each other and i dont kill people on whims or for fun we cant trust you miles said im just a hired hand you know what thats like dont you miles groote said miles nodded we have a common enemy sorenson i just saved you miles and you saved my life back in the hospital when you beat up sorenson he would have killed me after he killed nathan you didnt let me burn to death at that house your cars undrivable we can take the navigator but you have to decide right now miles no way nathan said celeste took miless arm squeezed tight miles we get frost we part ways not as friends im sure but we all have what we want and sorenson goes down hes just tried to kill all of us hell try again but i couldnt let his dink call him and report in that we survived miles decided get in grootes car no way nathan yelled no way man no he hurt me hurt me bad nathan groote said i never tried to kill you sorenson did youre a sick bastard i wont go with him miles miles caught celestes hand shock and confusion played across her face if we stay were going to be questioned and probably go to jail youve just gotten out of one prison celeste i dont want you in another one he tried to kill me you tried to slice my face open groote said in an even tone but we all know the truth now and we can either argue until the police come or we can help each other i assure you my kid matters far more to me than hurting you get in the car miles said celeste took a deep breath and did nathan jerked back from miles nathan i wont let him hurt you kid groote said i could have killed you i could have done much worse to you im sorry nothing personal i wont let him hurt you miles repeated nathan his jaw trembling with rage got into the backseat with celeste you hurt them miles said and ill kill you i know you will groote said they got back into the navigator groote driving easing back into the traffic virtually no traffic appeared to be coming from the direction of bridalveil miles wondered if the road had been closed in the chaos after the shooting groote gunned the navigator south toward the park exit silence as they drove all thats happened groote said my actions were nothing personal i just wanted frost for my daughter she needs it really bad he told them an abbreviated story of the attack on his family amandas survival her fight against ptsd he left out murdering most of the duartes they were silent for several moments the cutting celeste said frost made my urges to cut nearly go away so it might help her not hurt herself thats why you had the razor groote touched at the dried blood on the shallow cuts on his face yes it really helped you please dont lie to me please it really helped me celeste said but i dont give a rats ass about you feeling better this is a truce not friendship no one is forgetting what youve done or what you are im a shitload of things same as you groote said but first im a father celeste didnt answer him find the registration groote said to miles we may have to talk our way out if the cops have thrown up blocks he was right a roadblock had been laid near the wawona resort close to the southern entrance of yosemite the park police were stopping cars heading out of the park checking ids talking to people oh god nathan said what do we do stay calm miles said the cars fed through the line and after ten minutes groote pulled up to the officer good morning groote said sir drivers license and registration please sure groote handed him the registration not in dodds name but in the name of a company called horizon investments based in california and his own drivers license miles supposed horizon was a front for dodds operations the officer took all this in without comment writing down the license number and checking the registration carefully so much depended miles thought on how good a description anyone gave of us if they know were in this suv yet what happened to your face sir the officer said fell climbing yesterday made a mess of myself didnt i groote said was there a problem at bridalveil we were coming up from yosemite village and a lot of cars were driving out of there like maniacs in a damn hurry to get out and one of them banged into me good and roared off a shooting the officer said holy shit groote said in the park yes sir you folks see anything no miles said but thats why we need incredibly strict guncontrol laws i believe because violence is just starting to creep into every aspect of our lives dont you think officer and if were not safe in our national parks then were certainly not safe in our cities and the officer waved them through thanks folks groote drove forward with a friendly wave now what nathan said ive got to get out of the valley get into cellphone range groote said he tested his phone onehanded no signal ive got to call my daughters hospital see if shes really gone panic tinged his voice if dodd said he took her nathan said quietly from the backseat then its true groote exited the park accelerating onto the snakes back of highway head for fish camp miles said we shouldnt stop at your motel were not well see if theres a copy of frost hidden at wallaces house but i dont think well find it he would have destroyed it rather than let dodd get it he was taking his orders from sorenson miles said but id rather search than pass up the chance but sorenson killed allison why would wallace help him miles thought for a moment the pieces were slowly roughly fitting together he said i think sorenson and allison talked wallace into analyzing the research for them they dont want dodd to know what theyre doing so she doesnt use her office computer to send the files because she knows dodds monitoring her system and her phone but after shes sent the files and wallace has given them his analysis that frost is indeed good medicine allisons not useful to sorenson anymore he killed her celeste said hed always planned to if he killed with a bomb its not done on impulse without a doubt miles nodded and he must have wanted to keep wallace in his pocket so he tells wallace that quantrill or dodd killed her this is far more than wallace bargained for sorenson drops off dodds radar wallace is scared he cant let dodd know he helped sorenson if wallace runs doddll know hes guilty wallace cant have any evidence on his server that the frost files were ever there so he lied to me about sorenson wiping the server wallace obliterated the files to cover his own ass but he doesnt know that weve discovered the file transfer when nathan called dodd and dodd in turn called wallace wallace must have freaked he called sorenson and sorenson told him to stay put because now wallace is bait everyone whos after frost is rushing to fish camp its a golden opportunity for sorenson to eliminate everyone whos a threat to him all at once nathan paled and shook his head i didnt know it was a trap i didnt rat i believe you groote said you dont give info up easily i should know shut the hell up nathan said im still furious with you nathan miles said you werent honest with us you nearly got us killed dodd said he would protect us nathan said miles celeste put her hand on his arm he shrugged it off nathan thought he was doing the right thing dodd did save my life at the hotel let it go miles dodd came to me offered me a chance to make what happened in iraq right i couldnt say no nathan said if the bombing was an accident what did you have to make right nathan miles said what on earth would you have to fix nathan stared out the window nathan you could have told us from the beginning dodd put you in the clinic miles said he told groote to turn theyd reached the road to wallaces house for a normally quiet corner traffic was heavy onto the road that led to wallaces house smoke painted the sky bad sign groote said i promised to say nothing nathan put the flat of his palms on the side of his head how were you supposed to report to dodd through allison i had no idea allison and sorenson were working for dodd none i was supposed to go through the treatment and then report back to dodd about the testing thats all when you got me out of the hospital i decided to keep my mouth shut you didnt want to deal with authority and i knew dodd would help us but i would have to bring you to him i thought i was protecting the two of you they reached a bend in the road in the distance they could see fire trucks parked along the curb flames spouted from the shrunken wreck that was the wallace house oh hell miles said sorenson didnt want to risk a trace connecting any of today back to him groote said goddamn it he powered the car back toward highway we dont have anyplace to go nathan said yes we do celeste said head for orange county what groote asked in surprise orange county was where amanda had been how would she know i know a place we can go just drive fortyeight groote started calling as soon as his cell phone got a signal he first called amandas hospital in orange considering carefully what he would say if amanda was truly gone sweating thinking please let her be there for all my sins god dont punish her let her be there the conversation took five minutes doctor warner was not available but the kindvoiced woman in administration told him the transfer had gone without a hitch and she hoped amanda enjoyed the new hospital in phoenix gosh i left the hospitals number at my hotel do you have it groote said of course she did phoenix nathan said when groote told them what the woman had said dodd found me at a hospital in phoenix it lifted grootes hopes and his hand shook as he dialed miles took the phone from him dialed the number handed the phone back to him man groote thought dont be nice to me its gonna make it harder if i have to kill you he thought he had been clever in pulling them in with him but now the shock of battle fading he knew they outnumbered him and he didnt like the idea that he could lose control of the group the phoenix hospital had no record of an amanda groote or of any new juvenile patient being transferred to them in the last two weeks please check again please groote waited and the woman checked again im sorry sir he clicked the phone off shes not there dodd lied to her hospital falsified the records you could call every psychiatric hospital in the country celeste said we can download a list work the phones youd help me mrs brent groote said not you id help your kid if dodd normally lurks in a back corner of the pentagon miles said he doesnt have to rely on public hospitals he could have a secret clinic or a safe house to hide amanda shes not even necessarily in a hospital shes not nathan said dodd couldnt risk putting her in a hospital where she might give incriminating details to another patient give me dodds phone miles said let me check the call log might help us reach someone who works for dodd groote handed him the phone miles clicked checked swore under his breath no calls the phones been programmed not to record the numbers groote pounded his fist against the drivers wheel take it easy miles said youre no good to amanda too rattled to think ill take you all to orange county like mrs brent wanted groote said then im getting on a flight to austin were square i get frost ill call you and let you know i have it but getting it i dont need your help actually you might celeste said i know someone who can help us find sorenson and amanda a friend of mine she laughed a brittle nervous sound i told him i was too afraid to go on oprah with him wait till he hears what ive been doing the past two days fortynine tragic yet funny andy said from the backseat you didnt trust me enough to tell me you were betraying my ass to the fbi but youll trust a guy who shot at you and chased you off a cliff and tortured nathan and tried to drown celeste miles made no answer but if he could have spoken he would have said no i dont trust him not a bit so shut up miles waited for the time to pass and for groote to get calmer before he asked his questions the stress of the ordeal exhausted nathan hed fallen asleep leaning against celestes shoulder celeste stared at the cars ceiling lost in her own thoughts groote fiddled with the satellite radio found a news channel and they waited for the sniping spree in yosemite to make the broadcast the major news story was a bad tenement fire in new york that had killed a dozen people a man came to sangriaville asking for me miles said i heard you say it when you talked to hurley careful what you say andy said it got me killed he watched groote for a reaction a tightening grip on the steering wheel a frown that touched the mouth but grootes face betrayed no secrets ill bet his name was deshawn pitts yeah that was the guy groote said what did he tell you about me he was tight lipped told me you might come around asking questions or seeking counseling asked me to detain you and call him if you showed up that all he didnt tell me you were a federal witness i figured that out myself the fbis been very quiet in looking for me not putting my name my face on the news that wont last theyll do it he stopped do what miles repeated theyll do it you okay groote asked theyll do it as soon as we turn off the tape he said he put his hands to his face what tape miles miles fell silent took a long shuddering breath nothing im okay sorry what the hells wrong with you groote asked do you need medications im fine i just remembered something and he put his gaze to the window and said nothing more then the news shifted to the shooting in yosemite two people dead another body found a distance from the falls shot at close range but no suspects no motive no explanation yet groote let the news run its cycle of stories and thought if the fbi wants you miles my man they get you youre my bargaining chip once i get amanda back and she and i need to vanish i give you to the fbi i blow the whistle on dodds operations i get forgiven all my sins but he said the bureau doesnt want to expose you which means theyre not giving up on getting you back as a witness miles took a long time to answer whatever he had remembered when they talked about the fbi groote could see it rattled him to the bone miles said in a low voice you and i get them to safety and then we go on without them i dont want them in any more danger theyll be quiet about me what i did yes i guarantee it groote nodded it would he knew make his life so much easier one enemy in his pocket was easier to manage than three he hoped nothing was said on the satellite news about a missing witsec inspector life was complicated enough right now fifty they reached tustin in orange county late saturday night celeste could see miles was shaken she thought he was nervous about trusting victor gamby not to call the authorities on them this is a bad idea miles told celeste youve never met this guy face to face i know him she said i trust victor you know him through emails for gods sake victor has done more to help ptsd patients through his blog than anyone else i know he would be entirely in his right mind if he called the police none of us are in our right minds celeste said wait she walked up to the doorway of the modest house in a quiet stretch of tustin the jacaranda trees were heavy with bloom and the breeze knocked purple blossoms settling on her head as she walked up to the front door nathan said i still have a job to do getting frost for the soldiers miles put a hand on nathans shoulder you do this my way nathan dodd stuck you in an illegal medical testing program he took advantage of your disease and your guilt and hes dead and you dont owe him a thing im going to find frost nathans voice was unsteady nathan miles said well discuss it later miles saw the door opened by a fortyish man in a wheelchair celeste spoke to him and then the man opened his arms one of them a prosthetic and celeste leaned down to him and embraced him they talked for ten minutes celeste kneeling by his wheelchair the man listened intently he never interrupted celeste then he gestured at the car a welcoming wave miles and nathan walked toward them groote hung back near the navigator miles nathan this is victor gamby celeste said victor nathan ruiz miles kendrick back there is dennis groote hes um shy he shook hands with both of them and said you boys cmon in and well talk he motored the wheelchair around miles saw that his legs were missing as well the pants legs tidily tucked in under stumps and they followed him inside groote brought up the rear glancing around as though the house were a trap thanks for your hospitality mr gamby miles said youre welcome nathan forgive me but celeste says you dislike mirrors yes sir nathan said he hung back staying close to celeste victor said freddy company a young man in his early thirties came in from the back wearing wraparound sunglasses walking with a cane blind scar tissue inched out along the edge of the sunglasses you fought in iraq nathan that right victor said yeah so did freddy blinded by an ied outside tikrit freddy said hi as they all shook his hand freddy nathan doesnt care for mirrors which makes no sense because hes about ten times handsomer than i am would you go around hang sheets on the mirrors that nathan might see thats okay nathan said i can control myself no reason to be embarrassed if id known that groote whispered to him damn i wouldnt have used the screwdriver shut the hell up nathan said quietly and stay away from me miles stepped between them then when youre done with the mirrors freddy if youd make sandwiches for our guests victor said sure but the only bread we got is rye freddy had a surfer boys easy accent thatll do im sure thank you so much victor waited for freddy to leave the room put an unafraid gaze on miles celestes told me the basics of the trouble you all are in i appreciate your willingness to help us miles said i know you run a popular web site for people with posttraumatic stress disorder and you want to know if you can trust me with your secrets well its all right miles ive had my site for a couple of years now a million hits a month i do database consulting work for the government im an independent contractor dont worry im not a fed im not calling the cops on you all because celeste says youre after a medicine that could help every traumatized patient in the world including me including freddy is he um your boyfriend nathan asked victor shook his head no i find me a lost lamb let em stay till theyre on their feet always a ptsder like you like me i got my legs and arm blown off on victor was at the pentagon celeste said quietly before freddy i had a young lady staying with me saw her brother and her fiance gunned down in a gang war in compton before that another soldier from iraq before that a young father who lost his parents and his children drowning before his eyes in hurricane katrina never a shortage of pain in this world i help em get back on their feet best they can and then i send em out to help another soul you need to help us with eyes wide open celeste killed a man in selfdefense but we didnt report it im hiding from the witness protection program groote helped us flee the scene of a multiple homicide in yosemite victor gave groote a brief but appraising stare and miles wondered exactly how much celeste had told him about the man people want us dead and the government at least a slice of it no one acknowledges is involved in a major coverup over medical research victor gamby pointed at his eyes wide open start talking miles told him the entire story from his morning meeting with allison and sorenson to arriving on victors doorstep victor didnt interrupt freddy stumbled through the room and noisily assembled sandwiches and salad in the kitchen celeste stood to go help the blind soldier and victor grabbed her arm freddys got to cope let him be kindest thing in the world for him celeste sat back down and miles finished their account victor frowned first of all this medicine frost you understand theres ongoing research in this area how to minimize the impact of ptsd i dont know much about it i keep up with every ptsd research angle being pursued most shrinks dont have the resources to deal with traumatic memory dose us with antidepressant meds and pray for mercy because ptsds a bitch to treat with a smorgasbord of symptoms and onset that varies widely after the initial trauma rumor has it the chinese government experimented with beta blockers and memory diminishment on political prisoners back in the early nineties and got nowhere there are highly regarded teams doing legitimate research at harvard and at ucirvine but if frost can diminish traumatic memory long after the event takes place then frost is much much further along first to market miles said it meant millions to quantrill groote said if were looking at cold hard cash victor nodded profits in the billions if the research is already completed so the buyers at this auction sorensons staging will be very serious celeste said people will risk a lot for profits that big nice how they want to help us isnt it victor gave a low soft laugh if sorenson is expentagon miles said can your connections give us info on him or where dodd might have hidden grootes daughter you understand that the news is saying the bridalveil shootings was the work of a deranged exsoldier lost his mind nobody in the governments going to own up to your dead friend victor cleared his throat celeste said so someones already covering up for dodd and the pentagon victor shrugged ill see what i can find but i make no promises im not a hacker im not doing anything illegal to help you i can trade on connections on favors its the grease in washington but i may get every door slammed in my face im not a government employee my power base is dependent on my contractor connections and my fame in advocacy for ptsd patients so i may get nowhere my daughter ill do everything i can victor said but i have to tell you dennis that if i were dodd i would have gotten amanda out of the country on a government flight to a safe house in mexico or in the caribbean but off american soil finding her will not be easy understood miles said thank you victor we dont have a dinner bell but the quiet tells me that freddys got dinner ready lets eat then ill start working the phone and the computers and see if i hit any lucky numbers fiftyone we should rest celeste said youre right exhaustion seeped into miless whole body victor had excused himself into his office banned them from interrupting him groote sat on the quiet of the back porch watching the moonlight peeking out from the clouds miles observed him for a minute the first time leaving groote alone and followed her to the guest bedroom she had claimed and saw twin beds nathans sharing with freddy they can talk about the war groote can sleep upstairs assuming hes human and can sleep you dont mind do you she said of course not she lay down on one bed and he lay down on the other they faced each other across the space a side table a lamp separating them big risk to trust groote she said trust is too strong a word hes using us but were using him so its okay he looks at you celeste said in a way i dont like hes sweet on me dont joke he acts as if he still has a score to settle hes a hired gun miles said but hes off the job now its personal as they say in the movie trailers as long as he thinks we can help him get his daughter back hell work with us i know how to keep him leashed i imagine victor coming to tell us hes found amanda where she is and then groote kills us all and goes on his merry way i wont let that happen miles jostled the bed trying to get comfortable you remembered something no miles i dont know you that well i suppose but i can tell what happened he pulled his jacket close around him as if cold its warm in here you could take off your jacket no im comfortable i noticed you dont like to take off your jacket i get cold dont lie i keep something i meant to give allison in my jacket what he realized he had nothing to lose he would be leaving celeste soon enough probably to never see her again truth made for a good parting gift my confession of murdering my best friend the expression on her face didnt change your best friend yeah since i was three years old selfdefense you have nothing to confess he closed his eyes its not your fault miles yeah it is do you really know that in your head your guts your heart do you she asked andy stood on the far wall arms crossed blood on his shoulder on his throat three bullet wounds glistened in the lamplight its not your fault she repeated its not your fault he told me i killed him with a word then i remembered on the drive talking with groote about the fbi how i killed him is andy here now she asked yes ask him she said what he wants why does he stay hes not a ghost seeking vengeance miles said my head invented him then your heads trying to tell you information you need to know miles said what do you want andy he didnt feel embarrassed or stupid talking to andy with celeste in the room andy put his hands over two of the wounds i want you to know what you did miles i want you to know what you didnt do miles repeated the words to celeste she frowned show me the confession no why hes my burden to carry im not offering to carry andy for you just let me see what you remember and reading it will what make you respect me thirty seconds of silence passed i killed my best friend what kind of person am i i didnt save my husband i locked myself in a house for a year what kind of person am i miles she sat up from the bed she held out her hand give me the confession i can handle it he sat up pulled the paper from his jacket handed it to her she unfolded it and began to read allison i killed my best friend i was working with my dad in miami he owned a private investigations firm dad died cancer and my friend andy was an accountant for what i believed was an insurance company but the firm was a financial front for the barrada crime family dad lost three hundred thousand on gambling and he owed the money through a barrada bookie when he died i owed the debt the barradas threatened to take dads firm which was all dad left me but andy got me a deal he told me that i could work it off by doing clandestine work for the barradas andy wanted financial and logistical information on other crime rings spreadsheets payments dealer networks information on shipments into the country i wasnt a hit man or an enforcer i was their personal spy and andy gently told me that if i refused the barradas would kill me and he would not be able to stop them he wept as he told me and i believed him he was giving me a way out the barradas had me conduct eleven covert jobs against their competitors and i succeeded in every one of them i believed the debt was paid but they made it clear i couldnt walk away i approached the fbi in miami i told them i would testify about the barradas spying on the other crime rings if they would provide immunity to me and to andy he saved my ass so i was saving his but andy couldnt know they told me his loyalty to the barradas ran too deep he was engaged to a barrada cousin who owned the insurance front i would have to get information on andy leverage over him so that he couldnt run back to the barradas give him no choice but to cooperate i had to eliminate loyalty as a choice for him i set up a meeting with andy in a barrada warehouse the fbi gave me falsified data i could claim to have stolen from the duarte crime ring a group in los angeles wanting to expand and make alliances in south florida i had already lifted some minor stuff from them but this faked fbi info was designed to make andy drool names of dealers under their control bankaccount numbers people on their payroll i was to take two fbi undercover agents with me the undercovers pretended to be guys i had recruited to be my operatives and they planned to record what andy said about the spying operation and then immediately make the offer to him of immunity because i couldnt do it alone and andy might have to be physically handled i told the fbi i couldnt turn without andy he might not want to believe it but the barradas would blame him for my betrayal for bringing me into their camp and me selling them to the feds theyd kill him i was sure this was the only way to save andy were at the warehouse and this is all i remember i introduce andy to the guys and were talking were showing him the data i say i can get more on the duartes but its going to involve a substantial operation the sting i have in mind for them i cant do it alone i need the two guys with me i ask andy real specifically what kind of data he wants me to steal from the duartes and hes talking up a beauty feeding everything into the tapes that the fbi needs to put on the real pressure and he asks me when can you get started and then its all a blank then i see him pull a gun from under his shirt aims it at one of the feds head and ive got my gun and i never use a gun much but i shoot because i cant let him shoot a man in the head my bullet hits his shoulder as he shoots at me and hits my chest and we both scream and fall and i raise the gun at him again then its all a blank again the next time im aware of whats going on im in a safe house in jacksonville and theyre offering me the witness protection program and my best friend my brother for all intents and purposes is dead and i dont know what i did wrong why i killed him celeste folded the paper you remembered something else she said quietly yes the first blank when andy asked me when i could get started he stopped groote and i were talking about the fbi and when they would start naming me in the news it brought it back clear as day but dont shy away from it she said he asked me when me and the guys could get started on the project and i said theyll do it as soon as we turn off the tape you let him know he was being taped i said yes for that reason but for a joke to try and soften the blow we all laughed even andy but then he saw my eyes he panicked he realized it was a bust and he pulled his gun aimed it at the undercovers head if id kept my mouth shut told him a different way she took his hands in hers theres no good way to tell him is there miles shook his head she gripped his hands tightly but andy drew the gun he chose to fight you saved a life two lives your own you and i both saved lives wow were in a special club her voice broke and tears came to her eyes if god keeps a ledger dont you think our accounts are balanced i shot to wound him not to kill him i still dont remember the details he shot you in the chest did he show you the same consideration miles opened his mouth to speak then shut it i handled it wrong he panicked did he expect you to work for the mob forever when you were strongarmed into service i dont care if you knew him from when you were in diapers hes a horrible friend miles released her hands so what does andy want to tell me that hes sorry he never offers an apology what i did what i didnt do what the hell does that mean the tape the fbi made of the meeting did you ever listen to it they told me the tape failed andy died for nothing he sat down again god you must think im a terrible person she folded her legs under her on the bed i told you my husband went out to get eggs and coffee and a man i thought was a close friend and instead was stalking me i let him into my home and he tied me up and he waited for brian to come home he held a knife to my throat he didnt gag me he said he was going to hurt me because i hadnt loved him i didnt appreciate him all your standard stalker bullshit but he wouldnt hurt brian i believed him i was petrified with terror i couldnt think two seconds into the future she tapped the side of her temple the brain that outfoxed nine very smart people and won five million dollars frozen like ice i heard brian call to me as he opened the front door if i had screamed for him to run he would have had a chance he could have run saved himself instead with a knife at my throat i didnt scream out a warning and my husband came in and the disturbed fan tortured him to death in front of me so i could see every howl of pain every grimace every inch of agony a neighbor heard my brians screams and called the police and they busted in and killed the disturbed fan about three minutes after brian died the fan was smoking a cigarette before he started in on me and i was just lying there staring into my husbands dead eyes waiting to die wondering why didnt i scream and warn him why because you were afraid because you wanted to believe him that he wouldnt hurt brian well how stupid was i i wanted to believe andy would be happy about me getting us both out of the mob you wanted to believe brian would be safe if you followed orders do you think brian blamed you for one second she didnt answer if you had screamed do you think brian would have run hell no he would have run to you fought to save you the truth of what he said crushed her all because i wanted to be on a stupid tv show she buried her face in her hands so why cant we move past all the grief because we loved these people you dont shed them like a skin do you think if i kept taking frost i would forget what happened to brian her voice cracked if i forget the terror we experienced arent i awful brian wouldnt want you to carry that grief forever he sure wouldnt want you always cutting yourself she wiped at her eyes thank you for showing me the confession thanks for telling me what happened to you too the silence between them grew awkward almost as if theyd been physically intimate and didnt know what to say how to part how to step forward she came to his bed and she curled herself into his arms they lay tense barely touching each other and she closed her hand around his and he began to relax touch to touch her hair she had showered after they ate put on loose clothes victor gave her smelled of tangerine and he realized he had forgotten the perfection of holding a woman the yield of skin the beat of breath if he kept chasing frost he could be dead in a day or in prison this might be the last bit of happiness a final morsel in his life he closed his eyes and slept a hand touched his shoulder miles opened his eyes victor sat wheeled close to the bed bad news he mouthed lets talk fiftytwo victors office held a range of computers two linuxbased workhorses a gleaming apple macintosh four beigebox pcs one monitor displayed a picture of quantrill the next of sorenson then one of allison groote stood by one screen staring at the picture of sorenson i havent found your daughter dennis and im running into stone walls inquiring about government safe houses locations are closely guarded secrets im going to have to use a roundabout approach and that will take time if they kill her because dodds dead i doubt it dodds death will freeze them up theyll need to regroup you have to be hopeful victor said groote sat put his battered face in his hands then stood so what does it buy me a day two even if we get frost im not sure how to contact whoever dodd works for ive put a couple of bullets in your gun gentlemen or its evidence to help you decide either no way in hell you two move forward or you lay low or you go to the police right now were listening miles said victor gestured at sorensons face on the screen james sorenson but before he was pentagon he was posted with the foreign service in beijing before that the army now hes no longer on a government payroll at least not one anyone will admit i can find nothing else about him family academic background zilch those files are sealed hes quite the bureaucratic nomad usually a government lifer wriggles into a spot and holds on tight or hes the hot potato handed around because hes trouble miles said i have contacts in the army archives and at defense trying to find out more but nothing yet other than one pentagon friend telling me sorenson was and i quote a loose cannon crazy difficult to deal with sorry i dont have a bridge into the foreign service thats a brick wall to me okay quantrill i can tell you groote said hes a corporate spy more than that victor said a dotcom millionaire moved his money before the internet bubble broke he owns a consulting firm that once was accused of corporate espionage but the charges got dropped i smell a payoff hes also linked to a number of companies that own other companies that own specialty hospitals both here and overseas or have contracts with the veterans administration if hes illegally testing drugs at one hospital could he be doing it at another one groote said maybe he and dodd worked out a deal to get frost back from sorenson and amandas at one of his hospitals i can check but i dont think dodd and quantrill came to any understanding before dodd died victor said regarding the testing im almost sure if he tested frost at one he might have tested it at others his only healthcare scandal was a va hospital in minneapolis accused of testing unapproved cancer medications on patients two doctors and an administrator were prosecuted another doctor ducked on not enough evidence that doctor resigned from the va and took a job with a hospital that quantrills holding company owns in florida otherwise quantrill sticks to the shadows like sorenson has it occurred to you sorensons hunting just as hard for you hell know by now his hit in yosemite failed and better for him hell know the governments willing to lie to the media to cover up dodds involvement if youre caught by the police youre on the news you can wipe him out by going public unless he can reach amanda and she dies if we talk groote said even if he doesnt we go public and the government shuts us up or discredits us or we talk and we send frost to pharmaceutical purgatory miles said it would kill public acceptance of the research set it back for years no i have to get the formula and then get it to a company thatll develop it responsibly miles stared at the photo of sorenson on the computer screen a nagging tugged at the back of his brain the facts didnt click together in sweet harmony facts didnt always but he couldnt put his hand on what bothered him this is a lot man thanks groote said victor wheeled over to groote would you please excuse us dennis i need to speak with miles privately thank you groote stood and walked out the door without a word victor waited until he heard groote return to the backyard patio and close the sliding glass door you cant trust him i know but i need him i cant fight sorenson alone grootes exfbi he has a private security firm you already know hes not terribly interested in following the law despite his rough edges he still has that federal air its the only thing that gives me hope he might act decently in the end he might need frost victor said more than you or i do now i know youre angry with nathan for not telling you the truth about dodd but you need to know nathans story a bit of careful cajoling and a promise of ten free hours of highly expensive database work got me his file via the department of defense miles held up a hand stood dont tell me i dont care victor leaned forward tapped miles on the knee with his prosthetic arm you asked me to help you eyes wide open im telling you to listen ears wide open tell me cleopatra victor called to one of the computers play ruiz video file prompted by voiceactivated software the computer began to show a film a nervous nathan clean hair damp but his nose broken his eyes bruised his face pitted and bandaged sat staring into the camera the tape started with the interviewer identifying himself the date the location at a us military base in kuwait sergeant ruiz i want to talk to you about the events of april second yes sir nathan wiped a finger along his bottom lip caught himself sat upright yes sir the interviewer summarized the approach nathans artillery unit had taken as the american forces rolled toward baghdad nathan agreed with each point and then after youd fired your missiles you stopped to await further instructions yes sir and you performed an operational check to see if all systems were functioning properly nathan nodded yes sir as always and the results all was well nathan swallowed the infrared beacon that would identify you as american forces was working the interviewer said nathan nodded i need a verbal answer please sir yes sir the fireflies the infrared beacons were working his voice cracked at the end so then you stepped away from your post sir yes sir but just a few feet and during your absence the beacon failed yes sir nathans voice stayed steady i assume so the backup failed as well and how long were you away from the equipment only a few minutes sir then i returned you didnt notice the fireflies had malfunctioned silence did you hear the question sergeant sir yes sir i heard you i did not notice the beacon had failed do you only pay attention to the equipment during operational checks sergeant ruiz sir no sir but you failed to notice that the beacon failed and the appropriate alarm also failed four beats of silence and nathans military impassivity faded into pure pain he fought hard to put a calm expression back on his face sir yes sir but but out in the field sir the unexpected happens i dont know why the system failed it just did yet you were responsible for its repair thats true sir nathan swallowed sweat formed on his bruised and battered forehead and how many minutes before the friendly fire hit nine minutes after we launched our last missile sir nine minutes and you dont notice the beacon isnt transmitting sir yes sir nine minutes you had to save your company an awful heavy silence and nathan blinked hard into the camera the unseen interrogator continued according to captain cariotis during those nine minutes you were talking and laughing with your friends enjoying the success of your mission you thought your work for the evening was done with all your missiles successfully launched sir yes sir nathan closed his eyes and took a long breath sir yes sir tears formed in the corners of his eyes but the fire control could have confirmed for the pilot sir that we were american forces i dont understand how i alone youre right there on the scene with the broken beacon you could have noticed it you could have fixed it you could have alerted fire control there was a problem jesus miles said they blamed him for the entire accident his mouth went dry thinking of nathans nightmare back in santa fe crying out i fixed it i fixed it i fixed it cleopatra pause video victor told the computer and nathans face froze on the screen without the working infrared a us pilot could think nathans company were republican guard forces a pilot gets a bad confirmation from fire control after he sees missiles rise in the dark he fires and you have dead american boys all over the desert oh man miles said those poor kids yes nathan said behind him standing in the open doorway those poor kids i helped kill miles stood nathan i meant you as one of those kids i am so so sorry man you dont judge me nathan said i went to serve i went to protect im not a torturer like groote im not a screwup like you miles it was a genuine accident victor said they happen in war all the time i thought you were my friends stupid of me nathan said he wiped his nose with the back of his hand im getting the hell out of here nathan you have nothing to be ashamed of we understand what you must have gone through why you helped dodd stay with us turn off that tape nathan kicked his boot into the monitor you sure are a spy miles a much better one than me no secret is safe from you he stormed out through the house through the front door miles chased him grabbed his arm as he stepped off the lawn into the street you can help us find sorenson he pressed a gun against miless head miless gun let go miles let me go i wont youll have to shoot me miles please please youre not running off let us help you youre so full of shit you lectured me how we had to stick together youre dumping me and celeste to go off with groote a fucking animal who tortured me nathan shut up shut your goddamned hypocritical trap miles he hurt me jesus but i kept your goddamn name shut for hours because i thought it was the right thing to do i wanted to do right be strong again he started to sob nathan god im sorry i lost every friend i had in the army all of them i thought you would understand since you lost all your friends in florida i thought never mind what i thought he shoved miles away leveled the gun at him you only want me to stay because youre afraid ill call the cops tell them where you and celeste are that ill be the hero again dont worry ill treat you better than you treated me he walked backward into the quiet of the street this is crazy you dont have money you dont have a car ill keep my mouth shut about you and celeste unless you follow me then i talk till my throats sore you got me lowering the gun nathan walked away from him miles stepped into the street to follow him and the gun came back up miles watched him walk into the darkness and went back inside the house im sorry miles victor said he might be back in ten minutes or ten hours when he calms down miles said he thinks i hate him i dont but he doesnt understand what trust is how much of your plans do you think he heard enough to know i wanted to leave him and celeste with you he might have heard that in the car we thought he was asleep will he go to the police i dont know well the only law ive broken is harboring fugitives and if i havent had the tv on i cant know you were fugitives im sorry you and groote might need to head out just to be safe can celeste stay i cant put her in further danger shes been through too much as it is you better go while shes asleep otherwise shell fight you tooth and nail the faces connected to frost stayed frozen on the computer screens except for the computer on the far left it displayed victors web site for trauma patients he had a poll running a purely hypothetical question the one sorenson had asked him a lifetime ago if you could forget the worst moment in your life would you ninetyfour percent said yes that was the power the promise of frost so if you find frost can you find nathan again to help him miles watched celeste sleep lost in the heaviness of her own dreams he took the confession from his pocket left it propped against the lamp he leaned down and kissed the top of her head lets go miles said groote stood from his patio chair miles thought it best not to mention nathan had left groote would want to hunt him down maybe we can get a late flight to austin actually groote said i have an idea allison stole the buyers list from quantrill thatd be useful information miles saw where he was going we get details on the auction from a buyer we might get real close to sorenson without him knowing it and we can get that list tonight groote said youre not afraid of alarm systems and men with guns are you mr spy fiftythree nathan had a dollar fifty in quarters hed stolen from the blind soldiers room and he fed a few into the pay phone at the gas station stealing from a blind guy god he was classy he wiped the tears and snot from his face with his sleeve he had a wallet with five hundred dollars in cash and a photo id dodd had slipped him back in yosemite a ticket to reenter society after his mission at sangre de cristo but he had had no change to operate the phone and five hundred dollars might not be enough money to do what he knew he must do his legs hurt his back ached from the beating groote had given him back in santa fe and he didnt want to be alone but he would be until he finished his duty his mother answered on the third ring mama im out of the hospital im all fixed sweetheart oh thank god then a torrent of spanish he waited for her words to subside and he tried to laugh so she would believe he was happy i need a favor mama im not in santa fe they moved me to a different hospital near los angeles to finish the treatments i dont understand and she started in with the questions ratatat and he closed his eyes mama he interrupted her i got to have money to eat to get home but he wasnt going home no he had to finish being a hero first fiftyfour miles picked the kitchen door lock with a special attachment on grootes mr screwdriver not wanting to think about its being the weapon that had brutalized nathan the tumblers clicked into clear and miles gave the door the barest push groote stood behind him gun at the ready and they listened for the hum of the alarm none quantrill hadnt activated the system yet he hadnt gone to bed probably he was upstairs in his office trying to persuade the buyers not to attend sorensons auction assure them that all was well that he alone had the one and true frost miles slipped the screwdriverpick into his back pocket and followed groote into the house they heard the distant roar of gunfire then a billowing blast of artillery the scream of a jet then the rising pulse of an orchestra music thundering along with the battle all coming from a halfopen doorway off the living room guards groote mouthed to miles he gestured miles toward the upstairs mouthed office gestured miles to go up miles went up the stairs groote waited gun at the ready if the guards stayed put in front of their blockbuster no worries no need to kill them quantrill sat in the chair at his empty desk head back a redandblack smear on his forehead eyes half shut miles touched the dead mans throat still warm the mans computer was gone from the desk miles went into the bathroom next to the office grabbed a hand towel used it to slide open drawers search the closet that doubled as a supply cabinet no handheld computers that might have carried a backup of frost or the buyers list no cds or dvds no disks all cleared out sorenson was cleaning house eliminating every possible interference and they had just missed him or his hired killers he eased the dead man out of the chair and searched his pockets wallet full of cash untouched he found a cell phone folded shut he tucked the cell phone into his pocket miles came down the stairs groote was still in position the movie still playing miles walked past him and into the media room the two bodyguards were sprawled on the couch a bowl of buttered popcorn between them three bullet holes marring both faces well groote said i guess quantrill wont be writing me a paycheck we just missed him this happened about fifteen minutes ago sorenson just ended the buyers option of sticking with quantrill now hes the only game in town groote leaned down and took a handful of popcorn miles tried not to puke as the man munched assume he made efforts to contact buyers warn them away from the auction plead with them not to buy from a thief or even threaten them with exposure if they didnt boycott the auction miles held up the cell phone we might find a buyer he called i get a cell number i can find nearly anybody all we need groote said around the mouthful of popcorn is one they found an allnight coffee shop near the santa monica pier that offered internet access and miles started working after finding that quantrill had spent his final hours on earth calling a chinese restaurant his landscape crew and two numbers that groote believed to be those of the dead popcorneaters miles hit pay dirt on the fifth number he found it belonged to a greg bradley a google search of the mans name combined with pharmaceutical showed that bradley owned a consulting firm based in boston that advised aldistate one of the largest usbased drug companies thats our boy groote said sorenson pretended to be from aldistate when he came to the hospital the call log indicated the conversation between quantrill and bradley had been lengthy well over thirty minutes long conversations miles said suggest a detailed discussion and that means quantrill might have been persuasive about bucking the second auction groote frowned so you think bradley chickened out lets see if he did give me a second he dialed bradleys cell phone waited dont screw this up groote said in a low voice hello mr bradley yes hi sir this is corey with the creditcard security firm ironlock im checking on a charge cancellation that raised a red flag in our systems have you canceled an airline flight recently sir uh yeah today a flight to austin sir well yeah then a long awkward pause who are you again miles spoke with hyperbrisk efficiency sir we check any cancellation that raises a red flag as we insure the creditcard companies and we pay their charge cancellation insurance were investigating a couple of airlines that charge falsely then cancel immediately so we have to pay up but if its a genuine cancellation thats no problem and i thank you for your time he hung up i think he canceled he got frosty when i mentioned austin youre a good liar is there such a thing as that insurance i have no idea miles started trying the next numbers in the call log he got lucky three numbers later quantrill had called the same number three times in a row the first conversation lasting forty seconds the next two barely lasting ten seconds if its not a girlfriend groote said its someone who doesnt want to talk to quantrill he raised an eyebrow youre good at this the mans name was david singhal and he was a former vp of research at a swiss pharmaceutical now running a research consulting firm based in los angeles miles searched his name using googles images option and found a photo of singhal from his interview in a european business journal fiftyish cultured intelligent eyes a graying goatee miles tried the number hello mr singhal yes he had a clipped british accent miles said with shotgun delivery hi this is james with excelsior credit card security we work with visa and with amex and theres a question about your account did you recently cancel a flight reservation to austin singhal was more cautious than bradley im sorry who are you with miles repeated adding were assisting the creditcard companies with a database corruption the discrepancy is that one version of the credit database has you making a charge for an laxaustin flight the other rebuilt database has canceled that charge it sounds like i should call my airline singhal said im not going to give you my creditcard number over the phone uh yes sir very wise you should never do that he made a stab i can do the database fix so theres no confusion about your ticket status was your flight on southwest singhal hung up great miles said hell be calling the airline directly and theyll tell him alls well give me the phone groote took the phone dialed spoke quietly dialed another number gave a clearance code he hung up got them both refills on their coffee sat down his phone rang and he listened clicked the phone off david singhal is on the globewest flight tomorrow morning to austin ill get a call back if he changes his reservation howd you find that out a contact at the bureau the governments monitoring airline passenger lists not a surprise surely okay miles said now what sleep groote said they stopped at a twentyfourhour megastore and bought clothes and necessities groote gathered cash from an atm they checked into a hotel near lax same room twin beds groote said good night and switched off the lamp miles couldnt sleep he was afraid if he closed his eyes fell toward rest andy would come back groote yeah when we were driving down today you never said exactly who attacked your wife and daughter the silence was longer this time punks who were threatened by bureau attention to their ring thought i was involved in helping decapitate their operations misplaced revenge he wanted to ask what ring if it had been someone the barradas aimed him at but the only southern california ring hed targeted were the duartes and they were all dead now who were the punks drug dealers doesnt matter so whyd you leave the bureau i could no longer reach my career goals what goals wellplaced revenge groote said i dont want to talk anymore miles good night fiftyfive the next morning the second flight from lax to austin soared into the crisp blue sky and miles saw across the row where an elderly gentleman scanned a sunday newspaper the headline that read federal officer missing and below that a picture of deshawn pitts he couldnt read the article from where he sat and the gentleman read slowly every word never scanning an article groote dozed in the seat next to him five rows ahead of him sat david singhal dressed in a suit reading the wall street journal finally the man folded the paper tucked it into his seat pocket sir miles leaned over and spoke in a whisper excuse me might i see your paper if youre done sure the gentleman handed him the pages miles read the article with chills touching his skin deshawn pitts a federal marshal the story left out that he worked for witness protection had gone missing two days ago while on unspecified duty the fbi was asking anyone who had information to call them hurley died on thursday deshawn was at the hospital that day miles heard him on grootes call to hurley and he went missing on friday the day after groote had talked to him or maybe deshawn didnt give up kept questioning kept looking for miles he would if ordered if witsec accepted deshawns argument that miles wasnt capable of making a cogent decision given his disability and he ran into groote again groote was hunting miles so was deshawn imagine they intersected at a bad time be okay deshawn please be okay miles scanned the rest of the article no mention of him witsec still wouldnt compromise his new name but a mention at the end of it having been a difficult week for santa fe police a woman had been killed in an explosion at her office allison a celebrity had vanished from her home celeste four highschool kids critically injured in a car crash outside town a doctor and a tourist had also gone missing the hospital had reported hurley missing would that news or deshawns sheer persistence have brought deshawn back to sangriaville closing in on a connection back to groote miles suddenly wanted to be off the plane very badly he folded the paper handed it back to its owner with a thankyou got up went to the bathroom splashed water on his face tried to collect his thoughts weighed the inferences he returned to his seat groote was awake airsick groote said in a low voice youre pale no miles said im okay dont go mental groote said i said im fine good because were almost home free if you killed deshawn i will kill you miles thought yes i hope we are fiftysix miles sat in the austin four seasons hotel bar allison and andy and now deshawn sitting across from him an accusing retinue people dead from his mistakes he could not lose his grip now andys lightswitch presence on and off on and off made miles sure that his sanity was a matter of nuance and fluctuation but now with allison and deshawn haunting him he knew his mind was on the verge of breaking apart slipping into fragments that could not be easily pieced back together he couldnt let it show groote would kill him if miless mind broke and he became unneeded weight he put his gaze on the window watching the calm of town lake as it stretched past downtown think of your favorite things like that assortment of pleasantries julie andrews sang about in that old song he summoned good memories of austin miles had been to this bustling creative hothouse of a city once before to an austin city limits music festival with andy andy worshiped oasis and miles was a huge fan of the black crowes and theyd come drunk beer grooved to the bands andy scored backstage passes and miles remembered andy relentlessly flirting with a beautiful girl who was the girlfriend of a major bands drummer they got kicked out of the vip tent and laughed about it all the way back to the four seasons good times andy said yes miles answered under his breath now hush sweat broke out along his back what are you going to do if he killed me miles deshawn said i have a right to know if i can count on you dont talk to him in public allison said from the other chair theyll haul his ass to a hospital pump him full of antipsychotics and maybe he wont listen to us anymore you dont think a pill is going to make me go away do you andy said might as well trade a cow for magic beans miles you know you and i are a team forever permanent odd couple im the original fracture in your head these newbies are just hangerson im going to kill you again miles whispered and this time its selfdefense it wasnt the first time andy said not really deep in your brain is the truth dying to come out allison said shut up shut up miles said in a soft mutter he straightened his shirt you could appear scraggly yet hip in the four seasons and not attract undue attention austin was a film and music town and dress did not often equal actual wealth he was dressed unthreateningly in clean jeans and a tshirt that promoted a music group so obscure he might pass for austincool eleven minutes later he watched a man cross the lobby carrying a briefcase heading up to the elevators david singhal returning from a cab ride hed taken shortly after arriving at the hotel groote had followed him also in a cab then called miles to say the guy had simply gone to a restaurant for lunch groote hadnt gotten back yet and so miles followed singhal through the lobby miles got in the elevator next to the man folded his hands behind his back singhal had already pressed the button if you go to the frost auction today miles said conversationally youre going to be killed today singhal repeated in wideeyed shock the doors slid open at his floor ive no idea what you mean im not wearing a wire and dont act like you dont know what im talking about youre in deep trouble mr singhal and only i can get you out of it youve made a mistake singhal walked past him leave me alone or ill call hotel security you go ahead then ill call the fda miles followed him to a suite at the end of the hall you were going to buy frost from oliver quantrill now youre buying it from someone else whos willing to take a smaller profit its a mistake singhal kept a poker face again youre confused miles pulled the gun from the back of his pants hidden by his loose shirt aimed it at singhals stomach then lets talk privately and you can clear the air inside hands trembling singhal opened the suite door and miles followed him inside he ordered singhal to sit on the bed called groote told him to come to suite we have two minutes youre going to tell me where the frost auction is if you do then ill make sure your pharma client gets an opportunity to develop it for free ill give you the research all i care about is that sick people get the medicine but i have to know where sorenson is singhal bit his lip please take my offer if you think im scary wait till you meet my friend his daughters been kidnapped by the people running the auction not exactly accurate but it had the effect he wanted singhal swallowed i need to know where the auction is its an old private asylum east side of town abandoned but bought by sorensons people a month or so ago when six pm six hours away do you have a pass any special way to gain entrance to this auction no im the nice guy the completely ruthless man on his way up is the bad guy please reconsider your answer a knock on the door miles let groote inside who are you people singhal said if i know who im dealing with we can agree to an arrangement heres your arrangement groote grabbed the man by the throat pushed him smoothly up the wall then he started punching singhal precise stifffingered chops steady as a metronome in the kidneys in the space between ribs above the heart and miles thought that shouldnt hurt but suddenly singhals face purpled and he said my wallet god stop please miles pulled singhals wallet free from his jacket and found a slip of paper in the wallet an address in east austin and an access code xcd theres a fence around the property thats the electronic code to get past the locks what kind of security did sorenson promise miles asked he said wed be safe how many buyers coming i have no idea please i have a family so do i asshole groote said groote dont kill him tell me about security groote raised his fist i was just assured it would be safe i dont know honestly groote shook his head at miles he cant be calling and warning sorenson dont kill him miles said again yes no goddamn it you want to walk into a freaking ambush better him than us spittle flew from grootes mouth miles punched singhal hard singhals eyes rolled the guy collapsed good idea groote said he might start to scream us discussing his lack of a future the blow had hurt his hand and miles worked out the pain with a shake you kill him and we get caught then youll never see amanda again the guy in yosemite shooting him you saved lives and wed all swear to that in court but this would be coldblooded murder and im sure youre not into that gig it never pays groote shook his head he cant warn sorenson then help me miles tied up singhal with the curtain cord gagged him with a shredded pillowcase stuffed him in the closet he called the front desk told them he was singhal he was sick with a vicious stomach flu could they please be sure he wasnt disturbed today no housekeeping yes and please put no phone calls through i dont like this groote said we have six hours before the buyers are due miles said come on they got their rental car and headed for i they didnt see the car pull out after them staying back a half mile but never losing sight of them fiftyseven groote took the exit three left turns and drove along a street that held modest homes most immaculate a few slouching in disrepair at the far end of the street looming tall over the neighborhood was a gothic building of gray granite forbidding a stone sign that read yarbrough hospital est was worn with time bedecked with graffiti above it on wooden posts a weathered worn sign advertising a fundraiser halloween haunted house called nightmare hospital was covered by another smaller board that said horizon properties no trespassing horizon groote said same as the fake company that owned dodds car sorenson killed dodd and then uses his resources miles said nice and efficient groote said you clearheaded miles yes take this groote handed him a small gun and an ankle holster hed acquired a modest armory with a phone call after their arrival in austin good to have if it gets ugly and youre down or your clips empty thank you miles attached the holster let the cuff of his pants drop over the weapon surprised at the gift groote yeah groote switched off the cars ignition when this is done we walk our separate ways no need to hurt each other is there i cant think of one miles what will you do get my daughter where she cant be hurt again then you should probably give up your war on the duartes groote looked at him the people that hurt her and killed your wife it was the duartes wasnt it you know they did it even if the fbis not sure why do you think that we dont have time for subtlety dennis i dont want you putting a bullet in my back as soon as we get frost why would i be so rude miles back in la i asked you about the ring you blamed for hurting your family you dodged giving me an answer and it bothers me because theres no reason for you not to tell me unless it was the duartes because ive got a connection to them you know about my work for the barradas spying on rival crime rings including the duartes you were fbi of course youd know groote gave him a sidelong glance miles kept his gaze steady on grootes i am very sorry for your loss but i have never hurt your family i stole some financial information from the duartes and the fbi gave me fake files about the duartes to use in a sting against the barradas i didnt ever hurt the duartes enough to bring them to a boiling point i dont know what aimed them at your family but it wasnt me they were clearly already in the bureaus headlights you dont have a reason to blame me so if youve got revenge on your mind forget it grootes mouth twitched into a smile that died after a moment im going to go back into witness protection if theyll have me i still have to testify against the barradas whats left of them and then they want me to testify against other crime rings it puts a lot of trash out of business and its faster and easier than killing them off one by one groote looked straight ahead i have a friend in witsec to call you said you met him deshawn pitts yeah groote said his voice neutral miles watched him for a sign of reaction ill tell deshawn since hes a good guy where amanda is if sorenson knows so we can get her protection immediately get her to safety right away groote said thats a kindness miles you hurt my friends you hurt nathan you attacked celeste i wont forget it but i know you were trying to save your daughter groote coughed into his fist im helping your kid dennis and that evens any grudge youre thinking of carrying against me clear crystal groote said is there anything you want to tell me any reason i should have to be angry with you thinking did you kill deshawn i cant think of a single one groote said the silence hung between them like a curtain finally groote spoke we keep the plan simple if sorensons there we take him if not we take frost if its there or we hide ourselves in the hospital until sorenson shows up and then we take control simple most things are come on miles said lets end this fiftyeight miles entered the keypad number from singhals wallet the lock holding the ancient iron gate beeped disengaged and miles pushed the metal bars open left it unlocked they ran across the overgrown grass to the hospitals front door you first groote said since its your idea the door was locked miles knelt down tested the lock with grootes mr screwdriver worked it open they stepped into the silence of the abandoned hospital groote shut the door behind them both men held their guns out in front of them pointing into the dim light the opening foyer was dusty scattered with junk leftover papiermache monster masks bright orange flyers fading that promoted the hauntedhouse event and other longago october concerts in clubs discarded paper cups and beer cans a tattered banner torn in half that said to chamber of ho they stood and listened for a long minute the silence made miless ears ache ho groote mouthed pointing at the ripped sign horrors miles decided chamber of horrors groote tapped at his ear listen and in the hush he heard a quiet computerish hum from down the hall miles saw andy beckoning him along the hallway sweat broke out on his ribs in the hollow of his throat in his hair and he realized he was more scared than he had ever been in his life scared of what would happen scared of the psychopath standing next to him scared of what he was becoming groote gestured with his gun toward the hall they went past several deserted offices tattered curtains leftovers from the haunted house hung in the windows the rooms all empty in the last one a laptop sat on a folding table miles moved to read the screen it displayed a powerpoint presentation called research options on memory and trauma with a beta blocker approach all the bloodshed all the suffering all the millions at stake it came down to a powerpoint presentation miles put his mouth close to grootes ear to whisper were not alone sorenson wouldnt leave this behind trap us in the hallway groote mouthed he gestured down the corridor miles nodded and followed him a brick propped open a door at the end of the hallway a large room loomed beyond perhaps once it had been the cafeteria or a space for socializing now it wore false walls shaped into a twisty maze a setup of nightmarish paintings on black paint and mirrors arranged to confuse and frighten junk left behind by the halloween fund raiser probably with a thought to reuse it next year before dodd bought the derelict property miles could smell the dusty aroma that seems to permeate open spaces long neglected it had hung like a perfume in the fatal air in miami and panic seized his chest he could not flashback now no jesus dont lose control he told himself dont let your brain be a traitor groote nodded at him and miles went through the door first gun out arms level afraid to breathe to think to see no andy no allison no deshawn please he thought groote followed him the haunted housescape still stood in the large room monster faces leering at them from plywood and black paint howling ghosts shambling zombies bigfanged vampires all the playthings of manufactured false fear miles tapped groote on the shoulder they hadnt discussed what procedures to take if they needed to do a search groote jerked his head to the right pointed to miles jerked it to the left miles nodded he moved to the left groote moved to the right miles walked down a twisting passage black fabric hung to mask the operations of the haunted house hung in tatters silence again andy stood at the end of the passage and he frightened miles more than any fabricated monster you cant do this sorenson will kill you i mean you think youre really going to stand there and shoot another person miles glanced behind him allison stood watching him as though to see what he would do next he whirled back to andy but he was gone he pivoted again allison had vanished but the curtain moved and there was no hum of air conditioner to sway it he sensed movement behind him and spun as sorenson burst through the tatters of black fabric at the corner where andy had stood leveling a gun at him and firing the bullets needled through the meat and muscle of his arm and his leg miles screamed with agony and fell through the black curtain along the passageway trying to simply put cover between himself and sorenson two more bullets whistled above him ripping holes in the black cloth he went flat and he heard two shattering gunshots as he barreled headfirst to where a plywood wall met a wooden support pillar trapped no way to go forward or sideways miles rolled back out into the passageway bullets blazing above him as he tried to gain his footing and he saw groote take two shots chest and shoulder groote staggered back fell hard on the flooring eyes wide his teeth chomping into his own lip in pain and shock miles turned sorenson walked toward him the gun locked on miless head fiftynine miles fell back against the fabric a plywood dracula collapsing on him groote coughing and cussing behind him yelling at him to find his gun and shoot the bastard miles wriggled out from the fake monster as sorenson charged at him miles tried to aim but sorenson had shot him in his shooting arm and he fired and missed sorenson leveled a kick that nailed miless wrist knocked the gun past the curtains sorenson whipped his own gun across miless face i told you in allisons office that id end your pain sorenson said i keep my promises sorenson moved past miles put the aim of his gun on groote groote tried to crawl and sorenson shot him again in the leg he brought his gun up sorenson shot him in the hand he screamed miles sorenson said who else knows about today no one leave him alone wheres the rest of the nut squad after yosemite they all hid i went with groote you mean that piece of shit i sent after you all actually succeeded in frightening you wow ill have to send flowers to his grave miles shouted you knew i was a witness you wanted my death as camouflage for killing allison i was supposed to die when she did witsec everyone else would blame it on me especially when the police found my file on allisons computer you tricked me and allison you have to seize your opportunities when you can miles groote looked up at sorenson fighting for consciousness blood trickling from his mouth his nose from his hand amanda amanda god please help my girl where is she never hurt you please sorenson walked toward groote miles saw himself lying on a floor the smell of blood and concrete grit heavy as smoke in his nose and andy lay on the concrete bleeding footsteps walking past miles toward andy andy calling for miles calling for his mama but miles had shot him in the throat no he couldnt have not how it happened miles blinked sorenson leaned over groote groote moaned spoke pleading words but miles couldnt hear groote he only heard andy calling miles dont let them hurt me please im sorry andy clutching his shoulder where miles had shot him sorenson smiled at miles aimed the gun at groote the fed glanced at miles aimed the gun at andy not again amanda groote called to his absent child to the empty air miles help me andy screamed please miles heaved to his feet stumbled toward the two men the blood pouring from his leg ignoring the agony not again no sorenson fired two bullets into groote the hair puffed on grootes head he kicked once and lay still the fed fired twice into andys throat miles screamed the fed looked at miles tried to smile lowered the gun he tried to kill us all your fault miles you said the wrong thing and set him off your goddamned fault you should have shut up miles fell to the floor sorenson aimed the gun at miles miles youre going to talk his voice was calm again as though they were back sitting in the plush leather chairs in allisons office i dont have to kill you but i need to know what you know ill make sure you get frost ill trade you treatment for you telling me everything i need to know about whos coming after us i can set it up no problem i couldnt let a fuck like groote live but you we can make a deal please ill tell you he drew his knee to his chin groped for the small gun above his ankle putting a wince on his face as if pain were overwhelming him hed forgotten about it in the shock of being shot of running of groote dying of memory returning with the force of a bullet ill tell you he tucked his hurt leg close to him gripped under the cuff of his pants as though grimacing against the pain closed his hand around the small pistol sorenson leaned forward and miles sprang the gun up firing painting a neat hole in sorensons eye sorenson fell dead uhhh miles said he started to crawl back across the concrete slowly painfully aware of the blood oozing out of his leg and arm toward groote he checked grootes throat no pulse he dug in his pockets checking for a cell phone to call for help he flipped the phone open tried to make his thumb work the pad he heard footsteps approaching him sorenson had help backup miles was dead now nothing to be done this was death this would be peace he crawled waiting for the inevitable bullet to break his spine drill into his head a weight slammed into his head once then again and he knew no more sixty stone was cold and damp against his skin slowly he opened his eyes and sat up dried blood covered his face he wore only his tshirt and underwear rough bandages fashioned from his shirt covered the wound in his arm and in his leg pain pulsed under the wrappings as though fingers had dug around in his wounds and patched him up without care the room was narrow the air tasted dense and coppery in his mouth as though fear lived and grew in the dark corners and its essence had seeped over many years into the stone the abandoned madhouse he was still inside he tried to speak hello his voice sounded broken he cleared his throat hello several seconds passed he heard the clicking of locks more than one and the door to the room opened a person stepped inside the dim light of the room from the bright light of the hallway miles blinked and his voice died in his throat hello miles allison vance wore a suit her hair was lighter styled neatly as it had been in the pictures at edward wallaces house she stayed ten paces back at first he thought my minds still gone snapped and it shouldnt be he knew he had not killed andy no but then she said hello miles again and her quiet voice echoed ever so slightly against the stone instead of echoing in his head then she raised a gun the gun groote had given him that hed killed sorenson with and leveled it at him allison he managed to say allison my name is renee wallace she said your name is allison vance youre dead no youre dead unless you do exactly as i tell you you you asked me for help you set me up miles she cocked her head offered the gentle smile shed always used greeting him in her office as they prepared to sit and talk and she would try to pierce his past of secrets but there was no understanding no kindness in her face the concern was only a false expression painted on a mask im not the problem you are sorenson said in santa fe he didnt kill you i thought he was lying he coughed the auction miles there is no auction not now i have a buyer already shed set him up again singhal yes ill make you a deal miles you tell me what i need to know and ill make sure you have frost ill cure you youre a killer and its a better offer than anyone else will make you im not a killer i remember it now i didnt kill andy yes you did ive seen your government file miles two federal officers swear you shot him no fbi did they even told me the tape was botched blamed it on me she shook her head you killed him you killed groote you killed sorenson you killed hurley ill bet you even killed deshawn pitts thats a lie you you asked me for help miles all i have to say is that i told you about the frost program that you wanted in hurley said no after all its designed to help the innocent victims of violence people like celeste like nathan but not you you coldbloodedly murdered your best friend miles shook his head no so you snapped youve killed everyone who got in your way thats how the authorities will see it miles a mentally broken man denied his wish for help no you went after frost yourself first you wanted to get rid of me ill bet the bomb fragments they find at my office will be very similar in composition and design to bombs the barrada family used in the past you might know how to make one of those miles it wont be coincidence you cant explain away vanishing after the explosion i was on a business trip miles i didnt hear about the blast and you know i forgot my cell phone back in santa fe the woman who died was looking at office space i imagine i can step back into being allison vance long enough for the story to be over with then i just leave town again and no one cares he remembered the womans voice then before he picked the lock into allisons office a woman from denver asking about office space yesterdays paper mentioned a missing tourist in santa fe jesus i just need to know what you know she held up a white pill perfect as a pearl the answer to your prayers the cure for your pathetic madness all you have to do is tell me who else knows about me and frost and tell me where i can find them celeste and nathan she wanted them so singhals company could silence them no one else could gut her no one else was still alive who could hurt her i i cant the awful false smile disappeared in its place was a fury of cold resolve i wont kill you miles ill shatter you singhals company will buy sangriaville from quantrills estate ill hook you up to one of hurleys machines play every horrible nightmare and trauma into your head ill break your mind so bad it can never be fixed ill keep you locked up in a hospital forever no one will ever look for you the feds will give you up for lost or dead you and grootes brat ill just use your heads as my research playground unless you help me help me and were friends again ill cure you grootes daughter must be here as well locked elsewhere in the decaying madhouse no i didnt kill andy i didnt i dont need what youre selling youre not a hero miles youre a useless punk of a head case youll never be fixed without this and she showed him frost again a white oval pure as snow celeste nathan tell me where they are now you wont hurt them he clutched at the bandage on his leg as though twisted in doubt and agony they want frost too they want to be healthy and whole im sure i can reach the same deal with them as im offering you she would have them and victor too all killed he knew shed kill him as soon as they were confirmed dead his usefulness was over and she was gambling on his desperation believing that he couldnt think cogently i understand you a lot better than you think he said what you said that to me before i believed you died its true it works both ways i want help dont want to be this way no more so tell me she lowered her voice celeste had a total breakdown after the shooting in yosemite she and nathan both her tv agent wired her money they rented a house there in fish camp for a week she and nathan are still there far as i know he leaned against the stone wall hard for us to be out in the real world couldnt cope couldnt let her think he and the others were nothing useless help her put her guard down address he hesitated she knew the streets in fish camp he didnt he could hardly invent an address through the haze of pain he knew his only hope was that fish camp being remote whoever she sent to eliminate celeste and nathan would take hours to reach yosemite and he would be dead or free by then i dont know street address there were a cluster of rental properties behind a grocery theyre staying at one she flipped open her phone spoke softly into it repeating what miles had said giving him a property name to call she closed the phone you better not be lying ive got someone calling the rental office to check mistake he hadnt thought past the pain their presence could be disproved with a couple of phone calls he might have only a couple of minutes before she got a call back telling her hed lied no margin for error im not they slowed me down he loosened the bandage on his leg leave that alone youll bleed i want you conscious it hurts he stripped the whole bandage loose and grimaced at the bullet hole in his leg as though it were a picture in a book not a wound in his own flesh blood oozed out he held the strip of cloth between his hands i said leave it alone you shouldnt have killed groote he had to play her along get her to come close to him get her thinking there was another threat to her that only he could help defuse he collapsed on the floor as though standing drained him of all energy i did the world a favor now who did groote tell about frost fbi old buddies of his miles lied helped us find your buddy singhal tracked him here fear briefly shaded her face i need names he let his eyes go half closed mumbled come close he thought closer i only get one chance she took two steps and stopped she might not believe him but hed put an itch under her skin miles the names just three steps closer he tensed to jump at her then he heard a boom rumbling as if a tank had crashed hard into the front of the building the madhouse shuddered she turned and he leaped grabbing at her gun it fired powering the bullet past his head pinging off the stone wall she kicked him hard on his wound whirled and fled the room miles stumbled after her agony screaming in his leg she stopped at the top of the stairs miles saw they were on the top floor no more stairs rising beyond this floor she ran down the stairs allison allison he yelled and then he heard an answer over the clatter of her feet on the stairs miles nathan nathan get the hell out call the police allisons got a gun and then the awful final crack of two bullets miles limped down the stairs half falling half running the pain in his leg terrible but frantic for nathan in the foyer the smashed front of a sedan lay among the remains of the front door debris and dust crowning the h o o d and the starred windshield the drivers door was open the car empty nathan was gone miles heard footsteps and spun allison ran back into the foyer clutching the laptop from the office he and groote had passed the gun aimed at him allison she stopped steadied her aim took a step back you cant run you cant just keep running doesnt work shut up running is nothing he could taste his own blood in his mouth youll never get out never escape never ever if not me nathan will find you celeste any of our friends any of dodds followers it wont end for you ever youve thrown your life away youre the crazy one rage and fear contorted her face she fired at him and he dived through the open door of the wrecked car she emptied his small gun as she charged at the car he counted every shot she rushed the door aimed at him and he kicked through the open window with his good leg catching her in the chest as her finger clicked on an empty clip she staggered back lost her balance cracked her head on crumbling masonry on the floor and went limp as she hit the tiles he heard his name yelled miles miles nathan here miles stumbled to allison pulled the gun from her unconscious fingers nathans face appeared in the hole that had been the front door nathan holy god im not a screwup nathan said he steadied miles against the car i i followed you and groote here from the hotel i didnt know what to do so i waited until i had enough nerve when you didnt come out i couldnt just drive away so i rammed the rental car through the door then i ran to get help he gestured at the mess what the hell was i thinking no you did awesome nathan he grabbed nathans shoulder embraced him pounded his back i didnt do it for you miles nathan said his tone was cool you im still pissed at i did it for my friends i know im just glad you did what you did thank you he didnt know what to say and the words came drawn by his memory of nathans nightmare you fixed it man i did nathan gave him a thin smile the side mirror hung broken from its control cables and he carefully turned it to face the battered car is frost here if it isnt miles said shell tell us where it is we won nathan i ran when she shot at me to a house down the street theyre calling the police the guys a vet like me we need to call victor and celeste as soon as possible stay here dont let allison run nathan sat on allisons back she didnt respond miles climbed the stairs calling amandas name he heard a weak reply on the second floor the door was bolted shut he opened it saw a girl cowering in a corner dressed in hospital scrubs pale amanda who are you she trembled at his bloodied face the exposed wound in his leg a friend of your dads i want to go home the sounds the voices this place is full of ghosts no miles said the ghosts are gone its okay now theres nothing to be afraid of sixtyone does it work miles asked yes amanda

dont like the therapy part she said talking so much quiets nicer in the quiet i hear my moms and my dads voices they loved you very much miles said i know that she scratched at a starshaped scar at the corner of her mouth and he wondered how she had gotten it are you going to take the medicine miles i dont know he said sometimes pain makes us stronger sometimes it makes us weaker im not sure

think he might be ready soon so i better get it finished she went to work on her project miles watched a new arrival from the porch a young man with the bearing of a soldier but with haunted eyes got out of a van accompanied by one of victors newly hired counselors sangre de cristo had been seized by the government as part of its investigation of both quantrill and dodd victor and his army of lawyers had negotiated a contract after much arm twisting and gentle persuasion to run a program to test frost in participation with a respected pharmaceutical victor and celeste began quietly to contact people who were active on his ptsd web site exsoldiers from around the world survivors of abuse of rape of terrorism of natural disasters who could not shake the trauma of their devastating memories and two or three times a day a new person would arrive stepping out of a taxi or a rental car or brought by his or her family blinking up at the rise of sangre de cristo as if its walls held a final hope victor would bring them in for coffee and talk explain the theory and potential and risks of frost and they almost inevitably agreed to be part of the testing the government eager to bury dodds and quantrills work and promote a legitimate drug planned to seek a fasttrack approval allison sat in a federal prison cell awaiting trial miles found celeste walking on the edge of an artificial pond in the back of the property she tossed pebbles in the water she stood far from the blanket of walls she lifted her face to the wind to the sun what are you thinking he asked remembering not thinking just remembering i have two presents for you not my birthday surprise yes it is a new start a new life she pulled from her pocket the confession hed left for her theyd been back in santa fe for three weeks she had not mentioned the confession he had not asked for it this is yours i guess it made for a rotten gift he stared at his feet but its not the truth you know you didnt kill him i still screwed up if i hadnt panicked him you didnt kill him miles and the fbi will deal with the man who did she pushed the paper into his hands its not a confession anymore its the last chapter of your old life i would rather focus on the new he tore the confession into slow deliberate shreds cast the fluttering bits onto the calm of the waters you mentioned two presents he reminded her when he was done she answered im starting on the new frost today he said nothing i cant bear the memories of brian dying i need frost so i can move on she put her hand to his cheek the we unspoken so we can move on would you forget the worst moment of your life he knew he hadnt killed andy his worst moment was not of being a murderer but of being helpless to save his murdered friend he never wanted to be helpless again never so alone again he couldnt have his old life back but he would do whatever it took to have a new life he glanced at the opposite bank andy still stood there shaking his head frowning saying no dont do it miles dont make me go i want to stay always is he there she asked yeah and mad at me celeste opened her closed fist a white pill lay on her open palm white as the torn shreds floating like confetti on the water miles took the frost pill from her palm he slipped it into his mouth put it on his tongue celeste closed her fingers around his he swallowed and opened his eyes lets go have dinner she said he nodded and walked away from the pond with her not looking behind him because he hoped there was nothing for him to see
