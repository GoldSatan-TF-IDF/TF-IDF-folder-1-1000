field grey philip kerr chapter one cuba that englishman with ernestina she said looking down at the luxuriously appointed public room he reminds me of you senor hausner dona marina knew me as well as anyone in cuba possibly better since our acquaintance was founded on something stronger than mere friendship dona marina owned the best and largest brothel in havana the englishman was tall and roundshouldered with pale blue eyes and a lugubrious expression he wore a blue linen shortsleeved shirt grey cotton trousers and wellpolished black shoes i had an idea id seen him before in the floridita bar or perhaps the lobby of the national hotel but i was hardly looking at him i was paying more attention to the new and nearnaked chica who was sitting on the englishmans lap and helping herself to puffs from the cigarette in his mouth while he amused himself by weighing her enormous breasts in his hands like someone judging the ripeness of two grapefruit in what way i asked and quickly glanced at myself in the big mirror that hung on the wall wondering if there really was some point of similarity between us other than our appreciation of ernestinas breasts and the huge dark nipples that adorned them like mountainous limpets the face that stared back at me was heavier than the englishmans with a little more hair on top but similarly fiftyish and crosshatched with living perhaps dona marina thought it was more than just living that was dryetched on our two faces the chiaroscuro of conscience and complicity perhaps as if neither of us had done what ought to have been done or worse as if each of us lived with some guilty secret you have the same eyes said dona marina oh you mean theyre blue i said knowing that this probably wasnt what she meant at all no its not that its just that you and senor greene look at people in a certain way as if youre trying to look inside them like a spiritualist or perhaps like a policeman you both have very searching eyes that seem to look straight through a person its really most intimidating it was hard to imagine dona marina being intimidated by anything or anyone she was always as relaxed as an iguana on a sunwarmed rock senor greene eh i wasnt in the least bit surprised that dona marina had used his name the casa marina was not the kind of place where you felt obliged to use a false one you needed a reference just to get through the front door perhaps he is a policeman with feet as big as his i wouldnt be at all surprised hes a writer what kind of a writer novels westerns i think he told me he writes under the name of buck dexter never heard of him does he live in cuba no he lives in london but he always visits us when hes in havana a traveller eh yes apparently hes on his way to haiti this time she smiled you dont see the likeness now no not really i said firmly and was pleased when she seemed to change the subject how was it with omara today i nodded good you like her yes very much shes from santiago said dona marina as if this explained everything all of my best girls come from santiago theyre the most africanlooking girls in cuba men seem to like that i know i do i think it has something to do with the fact that unlike white women black women have a pelvis thats almost as big as a mans an anthropoid pelvis and before you ask me how i know that its because i used to be a nurse i wasnt surprised to learn this dona marina put a premium on sexual health and hygiene and the staff at her house on malecon included two nurses who were trained to deal with everything from a dose of jelly to a massive heartattack id heard it said that you had a better chance of surviving cardiac arrest at casa marina than you did at the university of havana medical school santiagos a real meltingpot she continued jamaicans haitians dominicans bahamians its cubas most caribbean city and its most rebellious of course all of our revolutions start in santiago i think its because all of the people who live there are related to each other in one way or another she twisted a cigarette into a little amber holder and lit it with a handsome silver tallboy for example did you know that omara is related to the man who looks after your boat in santiago i was beginning to see that there was some purpose behind dona marinas conversation because it was not just mister greene who was going to haiti it was me too only my trip was supposed to be a secret no i didnt i glanced at my watch but before i could make my excuses and leave dona marina had ushered me into her private drawing room and was offering me a drink and thinking that perhaps it was best that i listen to what she had to say in view of her mentioning my boat i replied that id take an aniejo she fetched a bottleaged rum and poured me a large one mister greene is also very fond of our havana rum she said i think youd better come to the point now i said dont you and so she did which is how it was that i came to have a girl in the passenger seat of my chevy as about a week later i drove southwest along cubas central highway to santiago at the opposite end of the island the irony of this experience did not escape me in seeking to escape from being blackmailed by a secret policeman i had managed to put myself in a position where a brothel madam who was much too clever to threaten me openly felt able to ask a favour that i hardly wanted to grant to take a chica from another havana casa with me on my fishing trip to haiti it was almost certain that dona marina knew lieutenant quevedo and knew he would have held a very dim view of my taking any kind of a boat trip but i rather doubted she knew he had threatened to have me deported back to germany where i was wanted for murder unless i agreed to spy on meyer lansky the underworld boss who was my employer either way i had little choice but to accede to her request although i could have felt a lot happier about my passenger melba marrero was being sought by the police in connection with the murder of a police captain from the ninth precinct and there were friends of dona marina who wanted melba off the island of cuba as quickly as possible melba marrero was in her early twenties although she hardly liked anyone to know that i suppose she wanted people to take her seriously and its possible that this is why she had shot captain balart but its more likely that she had shot him because she was connected with castros communist rebels she was coffeecoloured with a fine gamine face a belligerent chin and a stormyweather look in her dark eyes her hair was cut after the italian fashion short layered locks with a few wispy curls combed forward across her face she wore a plain white blouse a pair of tight fawn trousers a tan leather belt and matching gloves she looked like she was going riding on a horse that was probably looking forward to it why didnt you buy a convertible she asked when we were still a way short of santa clara which was to be our first stop a convertible is better in cuba i dont like convertibles people look at you more when youre driving a convertible and i dont much like being looked at so are you the shy type or are you just guilty about some thing neither just private got a smoke theres a packet in the glove box she stabbed the lock on the lid with a finger and let it fall open in front of her old gold i dont like old gold you dont like my car you dont like my cigarettes what do you like it doesnt matter i took a sideways glance at her her mouth always seemed to be on the edge of a snarl an impression that was enhanced by the strong white teeth that filled it hard as i tried i couldnt imagine anyone touching her without losing a finger she sighed and clasping her hands tightly pushed them between her knees so whats your story senor hausner i dont have one she shrugged its seven hundred miles to santiago try reading a book i knew she had one maybe i will she opened her handbag and took out a pair of glasses and a book and started to read after a while i managed to sneak a look at the title she was reading how the steel was tempered by nikolai ostrovsky i tried not to smile but it was no good something funny i nodded at the book on her lap i wouldnt have thought so its about someone who participated in the russian revolution thats what i thought so what do you believe in not much thats not going to help anyone as if that matters doesnt it in my book the party of not much beats the party of brotherly love every time the people and the proletariat dont need anyones help certainly not yours or mine i dont believe that oh im sure but its funny dont you think both of us running away to haiti like this you because you believe in something and me because i believe in nothing at all first it was not much you believed in now its nothing at all marx and engels were correct the bourgeoisie does produce its own gravediggers i laughed well weve established something she said that you are running away yes thats my story if youre really interested its the same story as always the flying dutchman the wandering jew theres been quite a bit of travel involved one way or the other i thought i was safe here in cuba no one is safe in cuba she said not any more i was safe i said ignoring her until i tried to play the hero only i forgot im not the stuff of which heroes are made never was besides the world doesnt want heroes theyre out of fashion like last years hemlines what is now required are freedom fighters and informers well im too old for the one and too scrupulous for the other what happened some obnoxious lieutenant of military intelligence wanted to make me his spy only there was something about it i didnt like then youre doing the right thing said melba theres no disgrace in not wanting to be a police spy you almost make it sound like im doing something noble it isnt that way at all what way is it i dont want to be the coin in anyones pocket i had enough of that during the war i prefer to roll around on my own but thats just part of the reason spying is dangerous its especially dangerous when theres a good chance of being caught but i dare say you know that by now what did marina tell you about me all she needed to i kind of stopped listening after she said that you shot a cop that pretty much brings the curtain down on the movie my movie anyway you speak like you dont approve cops are the same as anyone else i said some good and some bad i was a cop like that myself once a long time ago i did it for the revolution she said i didnt imagine you did it for a coconut he was a bastard and he had it coming and i did it for i know you did it for the revolution dont you think cuba needs a revolution i wont deny that things could be better but every revolution smokes well before it turns to ash yours will be like all the others that went before i guarantee it melba was shaking her pretty head but warming to my subject i kept on going because when someone talks about building a better society you can bet hes planning to use a couple of sticks of dynamite after that she remained silent and so did i we stopped for a while in santa clara about one hundred and eighty miles east of havana it was a picturesque unremarkable little town with a central park faced by several old buildings and hotels melba went off by herself i sat outside the central hotel and had lunch on my own which suited me fine when she reappeared we set off again in the early evening we reached camaguey which was full of triangular houses and large earthenware jars filled with flowers i didnt know why and it never occurred to me to ask parallel to the highway a goods train moving in the opposite direction was loaded with timber cut from the regions many forests were stopping here i announced surely it would be better to keep going can you drive no neither can i not any more im beat its another two hundred miles to santiago and if we dont stop soon well both wake up in the morgue near a brewery one of the few on the island we passed a police car which got me thinking again about melba and the crime she had committed if you shot a cop then they must want you bad i said very bad they bombed the casa where i was working several other girls were killed or seriously injured which is why dona marina agreed to help get you out of havana i nodded yes it makes sense now when one casa gets bombed its bad for all of them in which case it will be safer if we share a room ill say youre my wife that way you wont have to show them your identity card look senor hausner i am grateful to you for taking me with you to haiti but theres one thing you should know i only volunteered to play the part of a chica to get close to captain balart i was wondering about that i did it for the the revolution i know listen melba your virtue if there is anything left of it its safe with me i told you im tired i could sleep on a bonfire but ill settle for a chair or a sofa and you can have the bed she nodded thank you senor and stop calling me that my name is carlos call me that im supposed to be your husband remember we checked into the gran hotel in the centre of town and went up to the room i crawled straight to bed which is to say i slept on the floor during the summer of some of the floors i slept on in russia were the most comfortable beds i ever had only this wasnt as comfortable then again i wasnt nearly as exhausted as id been back then about two oclock in the morning i awoke to find her wrapped in a sheet and kneeling beside me what is it i sat up and groaned with pain im so scared she said what are you scared about you know what theyll do to me if they find me the police her nodding turned into a shiver so what do you want from me a bedtime story listen melba in the morning ill drive you to santiago and well get on my boat and by tomorrow night youll be safe in haiti all right but now im trying to sleep only the mattress is a little too soft for me so if you dont mind strangely enough she said i dont mind the bed is quite comfortable and theres room for two this was certainly true the bed was as big as a small farm with one goat i was pretty sure about the goat because of the way she took me by the hand and led me over to the bed there was something erotic and alluring about that or maybe it was just the fact she left the sheet on the floor it was a hot night of course but that didnt bother me i do some of my best thinking when im as naked as she was i tried to picture myself asleep in that bed only it didnt work because by now id seen what she had displayed in the window and i was about ready to press my nose up against the glass and take a better look it wasnt that she wanted me i can never figure why a woman wants a man at all not when women look the way they do it was just that she was young and scared and lonely and wanted someone anyone would have done probably to hold her and make her feel like the world cared about her i get like that myself sometimes youre born alone and you die alone and the rest of the time youre on your own by the time we got to santiago the next day the dark orchid of her head had been resting on my shoulder almost a hundred miles we were behaving like any young courting couple when one of them happens to be more than twice as old as the other who also happens to be a murderer perhaps thats a little unfair melba wasnt the only one of us whod pulled the trigger on someone i had some experience of murder myself quite a lot of experience as it happens only i hardly wanted to tell her about that i was trying to keep my thoughts on what lay ahead of us sometimes the future seems a little dark and frightening but the past is even worse my past most of all but now it was the very present danger of the santiago police i was worried about they had a reputation for brutality that was probably well deserved and easily explained by the truth of dona marinas remark that all of cubas revolutions got started in santiago it was impossible to imagine much else that got started there a start implied some activity movement or even work and there wasnt much sign of any of these tiring nouns on the sleepy streets of santiago ladders stood around idle and alone wheelbarrows sat unattended horses kicked their heels boats bobbed in the harbour and fishing nets lay drying in the sun about the only people who appeared to be working were the cops if you could call it work parked up in the shade of the citys pastelcoloured buildings they sat smoking cigarettes and waiting for things to cool down and warm up depending on how you looked at it probably it was too hot and sunny for trouble the sky was too blue and the cars were too shiny the sea was too much like glass and the banana leaves too glossy the statues were too white and the shadows too short even the coconuts were wearing sunglasses after a couple of wrong turns i spotted the coaling station of cincoreales which was a landmark for finding my way around the shanty town of boatyards booms quays pontoons dry docks and slipways that serviced the flotilla of boats in santiago bay i pointed the car down a steep cobbled hill and along a narrow street heavy brackets for trams that were no longer running hung over our heads like the rigging of a schooner that had long ago sailed without it i steered onto the sidewalk in front of an open set of double doors and peered down into a boatyard a bearded weatherbeaten man wearing shorts and sandals was manoeuvring a boat that hung from an ancientlooking crane i didnt mind when the boat clunked against the harbour wall and then hit the water like a bar of soap but then it wasnt my boat we got out of the chevy i fetched melbas suitcase from the trunk and carried it into the yard stepping carefully around or over tins of paint buckets lengths of rope and hose line pieces of wood old tyres and oil cans the office in a little wooden hut at the back was no less of a shambles than the yard mendy wasnt about to win the good housekeeping seal of approval any time soon but he knew boats and since i knew them hardly at all this was just as well once a long time ago mendy had been white but a lifetime on and by the sea had turned the part of his face that wasnt covered by a saltandpepper beard to the colour and texture of an old baseball mitt he belonged in a hammock on some pirate ship bound for hispaniola with a hornpipe in one hand and a bottle of rum in the other he finished what he was doing and didnt seem to notice me until the crane was out of the way and even then all he said was senor hausner i nodded back at him mendy he fetched a halfsmoked cigar from the breast pocket of his grubby shirt and plugged it into a space between beard and moustache and spent the next few minutes while we talked patting himself down for a light mendy this is senorita otero shes coming on the boat with me i told her it was just a crummy fishing boat only she and her suitcase appear to be under the illusion that were going sailing on the queen mary mendys eyes flicked between melba and me as if he had been watching a game of table tennis then he smiled at her and said but the senorita is absolutely right senor hausner the first rule of going to sea is to be prepared for absolutely anything thank you said melba thats what i said mendy looked at me and shook his head clearly you know nothing about women senor he said about as much as i know about boats i said mendy chuckled for your sake i hope its a little more than that he led the way out of the boatyard and down to the lshaped pontoon where a wooden launch was moored we stepped aboard and sat down mendy tugged a motor into life and then steered us out into the bay five minutes later we were tying up alongside a thirtyfivefoot wooden sportsfishing boat la guajaba was narrow with a broad stern a bridge and three compartments there were two chrysler engines each producing about ninety horsepower giving the boat a top speed of about nine knots and that was more or less everything i knew about her other than where i kept the brandy and the glasses id won the boat in a game of backgammon from an american who owned the bimini bar on obispo street with a full tank of fuel la guajaba had a range of about five hundred miles and it was less than half that to portauprince id used the boat about three times in as many years and what i didnt know about boats would have filled several nautical almanacs possibly all of them but i knew how to use a compass and i figured all i needed to do was point the bow east and then according to the thor heyerdahl principle of navigation keep going until we hit something i couldnt see how what we hit wouldnt be the island of hispaniola after all there were thirty thousand square miles of it to aim at i handed mendy a fistful of cash and my car keys and then climbed aboard id thought about mentioning omara and how it might have been better for me if he had kept his mouth shut only there didnt seem to be much point it would have risked incurring some of the brutal candour for which cubans are justly famous doubtless he would have told me that i was just another gringo with too much money and unworthy of the boat i owned which would have been true if you make yourself like sugar the ants will eat you as soon as we were under way melba went below and put on a twopiece swimsuit with a leopardskin print that would have made a mackerel whistle thats the nice thing about boats and warm weather they bring out the best in people beneath the battlements of morro castle which stands on the summit of a foothigh rock promontory the harbour entrance is almost as wide a long flight of crumbling steps hewn out of the rock leads up from the waters edge to the castle and i almost made the boat try to climb them two hundred feet of open sea to aim at and i still managed to nearly put us on the rocks so long as i was looking at melba it wasnt looking good for our chances of hitting haiti i wish youd put some clothes on i said dont you like my bikini i like it fine but theres a good reason columbus didnt take women with him on the santa maria when theyre wearing bikinis they affect the ships steering with you around theyd probably have discovered tasmania she lit a cigarette and ignored me and i did my best to ignore her back i checked the tachometer the oil level the ammeter and the motor temperature then i glanced out of the wheelhouse window smith key a small island once held by the british lay ahead of us it was home to many of santiagos fishing folk and pilots and its redtiled houses and small ruined chapel made it look very picturesque but it wasnt much next to the scene inside melbas bikini pants the sea was calm until we reached the mouth of the harbour where the water started to swell a bit i pushed the throttle forward and held the boat on a steady eastsoutheast course until santiago was no longer visible behind us the boats wake unzipped a great white scar in the ocean that was hundreds of feet long melba sat in the fishermans chair and squealed with excitement as our speed increased can you believe it said melba i live on an island and ive never been on a boat before ill be glad when were off this tub i said and fetched a bottle of rum from the chart drawer after about three or four hours it got dark and i could see the lights of the us naval base at guantanamo twinkling on our port side it was like staring at the ancient stars of some near galaxy that was at the same time a vision of the future in which american democracy ruled the world with a colt in one hand and a stick of chewing gum in the other somewhere in the tropical darkness of that yankee littoral thousands of men in white suits were engaged in the meaningless routines of their oceangoing imperial service in response to the cold imperative of new enemies and new victories they sat inside their floating steelgrey cities of death drinking cocacola smoking their lucky strikes and preparing to free the rest of the world from its unreasonable desire to be different because americans and not germans were now the master race and uncle sam had replaced hitler and stalin as the face of the new empire melba saw my lip curl and must have read my mind i hate them she said who the yanquis who else our good neighbours have always wanted to make this island one of their united states and but for them batista could never have remained in power i couldnt argue with her especially now that wed spent the night together especially now that i was planning to do the same again just as soon as we were installed in a nice hotel id heard that le refuge in the holiday resort of kenscoff six miles outside portauprince might be just the kind of place i was looking for kenscoff is four thousand feet above sea level and the climate there is fine all year round which is almost as long as i was planning to stay of course haiti had its problems just like cuba but they werent my problems so what did i care i had other things to worry about such as what i was going to do when my argentine passport expired and now there was the small problem of taking a small boat safely through the windward passage i probably shouldnt have been drinking but even with la guajabas running lights there was something about driving a boat across the sea in darkness that i found unnerving and fearing that we might hit something a reef or maybe a whale i knew i wouldnt be able to relax until it was light again by which time i hoped we would be halfway across the ocean to hispaniola and then there was something more tangible to worry about another vessel was approaching quickly from the north it was moving too fast to be a fishing boat and the big searchlight picking us out of the darkness was too powerful for it to belong to anything but a us navy patrol boat who are they asked melba the american navy i imagine even above our twin chrysler engines i heard melba swallow she still looked beautiful only now she looked worried as well she turned suddenly and stared at me with wide brown eyes what are we going to do nothing i said that boat can outrun us and outgun us the best thing you can do is go below climb into bed and stay there ill handle things up here she shook her head i wont let them arrest me she said theyd hand me over to the police and no ones going to arrest you i said touching her cheek in an effort to reassure her my guess is that theyre just going to look us over so do as i say and well be okay i throttled back and put the gear shift in neutral when i came out of the wheelhouse the blinding searchlight was in my face i felt like a giant gorilla on a skyscraper with the patrol boat circling me at a distance i went to the gently pitching stern had another drink and coolly awaited their pleasure a minute passed and then an officer wearing whites came to the starboard side of the gunboat with a bullhorn in his hand were looking for some sailors he said speaking to me in spanish they stole a boat from the harbour at caimanera a boat like this one i threw up my hands and shook my head there are no american sailors on this boat mind if we come aboard and take a look for ourselves minding very much i told the american officer i didnt mind at all there seemed to be little point in arguing a sailor manning a fiftycalibre machine gun on the foredeck of the american boat had the best way of winning an argument i could think of so i threw them a line put out some fenders and let them tie up alongside la guajaba the officer came aboard with one of his ncos there wasnt much you could say about either of them except that their shoes were black and they looked the way that all men look when you take away most of their hair and their capacity for independent action they were carrying side arms a couple of flashlights and a vague smell of mint and tobacco as if theyd just disposed of their gum and their cigarettes anyone else on board i have a lady friend in the forward cabin i said shes asleep on her own the last american sailor we saw was popeye the officer smiled a wry smile and bounced a little on the balls of his feet mind if we take a look for ourselves i dont mind at all but just let me see if my friend is dressed to receive visitors he nodded and i went forward and below the dampsmelling cabin had a closet a little cabinet and a double berth containing melba with a blanket drawn up to her neck underneath she was still wearing the bikini and i promised myself to drop anchor when the amis were gone and help her take it off theres nothing like sea air to give you an appetite whats going on she asked fearfully what do they want some american sailors stole a boat from caimanera i explained theyre looking for them i dont think theres anything really to worry about she rolled her eyes caimanera yes i can imagine what they were doing there the pigs just about every hotel in caimanera is a brothel the casas even have patriotic american names like the roosevelt hotel the bastards i might have wondered how she knew this but i was rather more concerned with satisfying their curiosity than the small matter of how they satisfied their sexual desires its what eisenhower calls the domino effect when some guys lay one down they like to make a big show of it i jabbed my thumb back at the cabin door look theyre outside they just want to check their men arent hiding under the bed or anything i said they could as soon as i checked you were decent thats going to take a lot more time than might seem reasonable she shrugged youd better show them in anyway i went back up on deck and nodded them below they shuffled in through the cabin door their faces pink with embarrassment when they saw melba still in bed and if i hadnt been enjoying that i might not have noticed the nco lay his eyes on her and then lay them on her again only the second time wasnt for the obvious reason that she belonged in a picture on a bulkhead above his hammock these two had met before i was sure of that and so was he and when the amis came back to the wheelhouse the nco drew his officer aside and said something quietly when their conversation became a little more urgent i might have got involved but for the fact that the officer unbuttoned the holster of his side arm which prompted me to go to the stern and sit in the fishermans chair i think i even smiled at the man on the fiftycalibre only the fishermans chair looked and felt too much like an electric chair for my liking so i moved again and sat down on the ice box which had room for two thousand pounds of ice i was trying to appear cool if there had been any fish or any ice in the box i might even have climbed in beside them instead i took another bite from the bottle and did my best to keep a grip on the thin line holding my nerves but it wasnt working the amis had a hook in my mouth and i felt like jumping thirty feet into the air just to try and get it out when the officer came back to the stern he was carrying a colt automatic in his hand it was cocked too it wasnt pointed at me yet it was just there to help make a point that i hero was no room on the boat for negotiation im afraid im going to have to ask you both to accompany me back to guantanamo sir he said politely almost as if there wasnt a gun in his hand at all and like a true american i nodded slowly may i ask why it will all be explained when we get to gitmo he said if you really think its necessary he waved two sailors to come aboard my boat and it was just as well he did because both of them were between me and the machine gun when we heard a pistol shot from the forward compartment i jumped up and then thought better of jumping any more watch him yelled the officer and went below to investigate leaving me with two colts pointed at my belly and the fiftycalibre pointed at my earlobe i sat down again on the fishermans chair which creaked like a chainsaw as i leaned all the way back and stared up at the stars you didnt need to be madame blavatsky to see that they werent looking good not for melba and probably not for me as things turned out the stars werent good for the american nco either he staggered up on deck looking like the ace of diamonds or perhaps the ace of hearts in the centre of his white shirt was a small red stain that grew larger the longer you looked at it for a moment he swayed drunkenly and then he dropped heavily onto his backside in a way he looked the way i was feeling now im shot he said redundantly chapter two cuba it was several hours later the shot sailor had been taken to hospital in guantanamo melba was cooling her high heels in a prison cell and i had told my story twice i had two headaches and only one of them was in my skull there were three of us in a humid office in the building of the us navy mastersatarms mastersatarms were what the us navy called the sailors who specialised in law enforcement and correctional custody policemen in sailor suits the three whod been listening to my story didnt seem to like it any better the second time they shifted their largish backsides on their inadequate chairs picked tiny bits of thread and fluff from their immaculate white uniforms and stared at their reflections in the toecaps of their shiny black shoes it was like being interrogated by a union meeting of hospital porters the building was quiet except for the hum of the fluorescent lighting on the ceiling and the noise of a typewriter that was the size and colour of the uss missouri and every time i answered a question and the navy cop hit the keys on that thing it was like the sound of someone me probably having his hair cut with a large pair of very sharp scissors outside a small grilled window the new day was coming up over the blue horizon like a trail of blood this hardly augured well since not unreasonably it was already clear that the amis suspected me of a much closer acquaintance with melba marrero and her crimes plural than id admitted clearly since i wasnt an american myself and smelt strongly of rum they found this relatively easy on a light blue formica table covered with coffeecoloured cigarette burns lay a number of files and a couple of guns wearing tags on their trigger guards as if they might have been for sale one of them was the little beretta pocket pistol melba used to shoot the petty officer third class and the other was a colt automatic stolen from him several months earlier and used to murder captain balart outside the hotel ambos mundos in havana alongside the files and the pistols was my blue and gold argentinian passport and from time to time the navy cop in charge of my interrogation would pick this up and leaf through the pages as if he couldnt quite believe that anyone could go through life being the citizen of a country that wasnt the us of a his name was captain mackay and as well as his questions there was his breath to contend with every time he pushed his squashed bespectacled face toward mine i was enveloped in the sour aura of his tooth decay and after a while i started to feel like something chewed up but only half digested deep inside his yankee bowels mackay said with illdisguised contempt this story of yours that you never met her until a couple of days ago it makes no sense no sense at all you say she was a chica you were involved with that you asked her to come away on your boat for a few weeks and that this accounts for the considerable sum of money you had with you thats correct and yet you say you know almost nothing about her at my age its best not to ask too many questions when a pretty girl agrees to come away with you mackay smiled thinly he was about thirty too young to find much sympathy for an older mans interest in younger women there was a wedding band on his fat finger and i imagined some wholesome girl with a permanent wave and a mixing bowl under her chubby arm waiting for him back home in some erectorset government housing on a bleak naval base shall i tell you what i think i think you were headed for the dominican republic to buy guns for the rebels the boat the money the girl it all adds up oh i can see you like the addition captain but im a respectable businessman im quite well off i have a nice apartment in havana a job at a hotel casino im hardly the type to work for the communists and the girl shes just a chica maybe but she murdered a cuban policeman very nearly murdered one of mine perhaps but did you see me shoot anyone i didnt even raise my voice in my business girls girls like melba theyre one of the fringe benefits what they get up to in their spare time is i paused for a moment searching for the best phrase in english hardly my affair it is when she shoots an american on your boat i didnt even know she had a gun if id known that i would have thrown it over the side and maybe her too and if i had any idea that she was suspected of murdering a policeman i would never have invited senorita marrero to come away with me let me tell you something about your girlfriend mister hausner mackay stifled a belch but not nearly well enough for my comfort he took off his glasses and breathed on them and somehow they didnt crack her real name is maria antonia tapanes and she was a prostitute at a casa in caimanera which is how she came to steal a side arm belonging to petty officer marcus thats why he recognised her when he saw her on your boat we strongly suspect she was put up to the assassination of captain balart by the rebels in fact were more or less sure of it i find that very hard to believe she never once mentioned politics to me she seemed more interested in having a good time than in having a revolution the captain opened one of the files in front of him and pushed it towards me its more or less certain your little lady friend has been a communist and a rebel for quite a while now you see maria antonia tapanes spent three months in the national womens prison at guanajay for her part in the easter sunday conspiracy of april then in july of last year her brother juan tapanes was killed in the assault on moncada barracks led by fidel castro killed or executed its not clear which when maria got out of prison and found her brother dead she went to caimanera and worked as a chica to get herself a weapon that happens a lot to be honest quite a few of our men use their weapons as currency for buying sex then they just report the weapon stolen anyway the next time the weapon turns up its been used to kill captain balart there were witnesses too a woman answering maria tapaness description shot him in the face and then in the back of the head as he lay on the ground maybe he had it coming who knows who cares what i do know is that po marcus is lucky to be alive if shed used the colt instead of that little beretta hed be as dead as captain balart is he going to be all right hell live what will happen to her well have to hand her over to the police in havana i imagine thats what she was worried about in the first place why she shot the petty officer she must have panicked you know what theyll do to her dont you thats not my concern maybe it should be maybe thats the problem youve got in cuba maybe if you americans paid a little more attention to the kind of people who are running this country maybe you ought to be a little more concerned about what happens to you this was the other officer who spoke now i hadnt been told his name all i knew about him was that dandruff fell off the back of his head whenever he scratched it all in all he had rather a lot of dandruff even his eyelashes had tiny flakes of skin in them just suppose im not i said not any more come again the man with the dandruff stopped scratching his head and inspected his fingernails before beaming a frown in my direction weve been over this all night i said you keep asking me the same questions and i keep giving you the same answers ive told you my story but you say you dont believe it and thats fair enough i can see the holes in it youre bored with it im bored with it were all bored with it only im not about to cash my story in for another what would be the point if it sounded any better than the original id have used it in the first place so the fact now remains that i cant see any point in telling you another and since i dont care to do that then youd be forgiven for thinking that i dont really care whether or not you believe me because it seems to me theres nothing i can do thatll convince you one way or another youve already made up your minds thats the way it is with cops believe me i know i used to be a cop myself and since i no longer care whether or not you believe me then it would be entirely lair for you to conclude that i dont seem to give a damn what happens to me well maybe i do and maybe i dont but thats for me to know and you to decide for yourselves gentlemen the cop with the dandruff scratched some more which made the room look like a snow scene in a little glass ball he said you talk a lot mister for someone who doesnt say very much true but it helps to keep the brass knuckles off my face i doubt that said captain mackay i doubt that very much i know im not so pretty any more only that ought to make it easier for you to believe me youve seen that girl she was every sailors hardon i was grateful whats the expression you have in english you dont look a gift horse in the mouth and if it comes to that then neither should you captain youve got nothing on me and plenty on her you know she shot the petty officer its obvious and it only starts to get complicated when you try to tie me in to some kind of rebel conspiracy me i was looking forward to a nice vacation with lots of sex i had plenty of money with me because i was planning to buy myself a bigger boat and theres no law against that like i already told you i have a good job at the national hotel i have a nice apartment on the malecon in havana i drive a newish chevy now why would i give all that up for karl marx and fidel castro you tell me that melba or maria or whatever her name is that shes a communist i didnt know that maybe i should have asked her only i prefer talking dirty when im in bed not politics she wants to go around shooting cops and american sailors then i say she should go to jail not very gallant of you said captain mackay gallant what does it mean gallant chivalrous the captain shrugged gentlemanly ah cortes caballeroso yes i see i shrugged back at him and how would that sound i wonder she was only trying to protect me give her a break captain shes just a kid the girl had a tough childhood all right if it makes any difference you know i really think the girl was scared like i already said you know what will happen when you hand her over to the local law if shes lucky theyll let her keep her clothes on when they parade her around the police cells and maybe theyll beat her with an oxdick whip only every other day but i doubt it you dont sound too upset about it said the cop with dandruff ill certainly pray for her maybe ill even pay for a lawyer experience informs me that paying is more useful than praying the lord and i dont get on the way we used to the captain sneered i dont like you hausner the next time i speak to the lord im just liable to congratulate him on his good taste youve got a job at the national hotel fuck you i never liked that damned hotel either youve got a nice apartment on malecon i hope a hurricane comes and wipes it out you argentine cock sucker you dont care what happens to you neither do i pal to me youre just another south american greaseball with a smart mouth you cant think of a better story then youre dumber than you look you used to be a cop yourself i dont want to know you piece of shit all i want to hear from you is an explanation for how it is that you were helping a murderer escape from this miserable fucking island you call home did someone ask you a favour if they did i want a name someone introduced you i want a fucking name you picked her off the sidewalk give me the name of the damned street you asshole its talk or lock pal talk or lock we went fishing tonight and we caught you hausner and i get to toss you in my ice locker unless you tell me everything i want to know talk or lock and i throw away the fucking key until im satisfied theres no information left in your lying body that you havent puked onto the goddamn floor the truth i dont give a shit you want to walk out of here give me some plain straightforward facts i nodded heres one for you penguins live almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere is that plain enough i pushed the chair back on two legs which was my first mistake and smiled which was my second the captain was surprisingly quick on his feet one moment he was staring at me like i was a snake in a bassinet the next he was yelling as if hed hammered his own thumb and before i could wipe the smile from my face hed done it for me kicking the chair away and then grabbing the lapels of my jacket and lifting my head off the floor only so that he could punch it back down again the other two each caught one of his arms and tried to pull him off but that left his legs free to stamp on my face like someone trying to put out a fire not that this hurt he had a right as big as a medicine ball and i wasnt feeling anything very much since it had connected with my chin humming like an electric eel i lay there waiting for him to stop so that i could show him who was really in charge of the interrogation by the time they got a ring in his pointy nose and hauled him off i was just about ready for my next wisecrack i might have made it too but for the blood that was pouring out of my nose when i was absolutely sure no one was about to knock me down again i got off the floor and told myself that when they hit me again it would be because i had truly earned a beating and that it would have been worth it being a cop i said is a lot like looking for something interesting to read in the newspaper by the time youve found it you can bet theres a lot thats rubbed off on your fingers before the war the last war i was a cop in germany an honest cop too although i guess that wont mean much to apes like you plainclothes a detective but when we invaded poland and russia they put us in grey uniforms not green not black not brown grey field grey they called it the thing about grey is you can roll around in the dirt all day long and still look smart enough to return a generals salute thats one reason we wore it another reason we wore grey was maybe so that we could do what we did and still think we had standards so that we could manage to look ourselves in the eye when we got up in the morning that was the theory i know stupid wasnt it but no nazi was ever so stupid as to ask us to wear a white uniform you know why because a white uniform is hard to keep clean isnt it i mean i admire your courage wearing white because lets face it gentlemen white shows everything especially blood and the way you conduct yourselves thats a big disadvantage instinctively each man looked down at the blank canvas that was his immaculate white uniform as if checking his zipper and that was when i collected a nose full of blood in my fingers and let them have it like jackson pollock you could say i wanted to express my feelings rather than just illustrate them and that my crude technique of flinging my own blood through the air at them was simply a means of arriving at a statement either way they seemed to understand exactly what i was trying to say and when they finished working me over and tossed me in a cell i had the small satisfaction of knowing that at last i was truly modern i dont know if their blood spattered white uniforms were art or not but i know what i like chapter three cuba and new york the drunk tank at gitmo was a large wooden hut located on the beach but for anyone who wasnt drunk when he was locked up in there it was actually positioned somewhere between the first and second circles of hell it was certainly hot enough id been imprisoned before id been a soviet pow and that was not so good but gitmo was almost as bad the three things that made the drunk tank nearly unendurable were the mosquitoes and the drunks and the fact that i was ten years older now being ten years older is always bad the mosquitoes were worse the naval base was not much more than a swamp but they were not as bad as the drunks you can stand being locked up almost anywhere so long as you can establish some sort of a routine but there was no routine at gitmo unless you could count the routine that was the regular dusktodawn turnover of loudly intoxicated american sailors nearly all of them arrived in their underwear some were violent some wanted to make friends with me some tried to kick me around the cell some wanted to sing some wanted to cry some wanted to batter the walls down with their skulls nearly all of them were incontinent or threw up and sometimes they threw up on me in the beginning i had the quaint idea that i was locked up there because there was nowhere else to lock me up but after a couple of weeks i started to believe that there was some other purpose to my being kept there i tried speaking to the guards and on several occasions asked them by what jurisdiction i was being held there but it was no good the guards just treated me like every other prisoner which would have been fine if every other prisoner hadnt been covered in beer and blood and vomit most of the time these other prisoners were released in the late afternoon by which time theyd slept it off and for a few hours at least i managed to forget the humidity and the fortydegree heat and the stink of human faeces and to get some sleep only to be awakened for chow or someone washing out the tank with a fire hose or worst of all a banana rat if rats these truly were at thirty inches long and weighing as many pounds these rats were rodent stars who belonged in a nazi propaganda movie or a robert browning poem at the beginning of the third week a petty officer from the mastersatarms office fetched me from the tank accompanied me to a bathroom where i could shower and shave and returned my own clothes youre being transferred today he told me to castle williams wheres that new york city new york city why he shrugged search me what kind of place is it this castle williams a us military prison looks like youre the armys meat how not the navys he gave me a cigarette probably just to shut me up and it worked there was a filter on it which was supposed to save my throat and i guess it did at that since i spent as much time looking at the cigarette as i did actually smoking it id smoked most of my life for a while id been more or less addicted to tobacco but it was hard to see anyone becoming addicted to something quite so tasteless as a filter cigarette it was like eating a hot dog after fifty years of bratwurst the petty officer took me to another hut with a bed a chair and a table and locked me in there was even an open window the window had bars on it but i didnt mind that and for a while i stood on the chair and breathed some fresher air than i was used to and looked at the ocean it was a deep shade of blue but i was feeling bluer a us military prison in new york felt a lot more serious than the drunk tank in gitmo and it wasnt very long before i had formed the opinion that the navy must have spoken about me to the police in havana and that the police had been in contact with lieutenant quevedo of cuban military intelligence the sim and that the sim lieutenant had told the americans my real name and background if i was lucky i might get to tell someone in the fbi everything i knew about meyer lansky and the mob in havana and save myself a trip back to germany and very likely a trial for murder the federal republic of germany had abolished the death penalty for murder in but i couldnt answer for the americans the amis had hanged four nazi war criminals in landsberg as recently as then again maybe they would deport me back to vienna where id been framed for the murders of two women that was an even more uncomfortable prospect the austrians being austrians retained the death penalty for murder the following day i was handcuffed and taken to an airfield where i boarded a douglas c skymaster with various military personnel returning home to their wives and families we flew north for about seven hours before we landed at mitchell air force base in nassau county new york there i was handed over into the custody of the us army military police on the main airport building was a board detailing the major units that were assigned to mitchell afb and a sign that read welcome to the united states it didnt feel as if i was air force handcuffs were exchanged for no less uncomfortable army ones and i was shut inside a paddy wagon like a stray dog with a bad case of fleas the wagon was windowless but i could tell we were driving west having landed on americas northeast coast there was nowhere else for our solitary wagon train to go one of the mps was carrying a shotgun in case we ran into red indians or outlaws it seemed like a wise precaution after all there was always the possibility that meyer lansky might be worried about the jam i was in maybe even worried enough to do something about it lansky was thoughtful like that he was the kind of man who always looked after his employees one way or the other like all gambling men lansky preferred a sure thing and theres nothing as sure as a bullet in the head ninety minutes later the doors of the wagon opened in front of a semicircular fortress that appeared to be built on an island the fortress was made of sandstone bricks and about forty feet high with three storeys it was old and ugly and looked as if it belonged properly in old berlin somewhere other than new york anyway an impression that was reinforced by the view of lower manhattans much taller buildings these stood gleaming on the opposite shore of a large expanse of water and resembled nothing so much as the walls of some modern troy this was my first sight of new york city and like tarzan i wasnt as impressed as maybe i ought to have been then again i was still wearing handcuffs the mps herded me up to an arched doorway unlocked my handcuffs and delivered me into the custody of a black army sergeant he fitted me with a new set of cuffs and tugging them led the way into a keyholeshaped courtyard where at least a couple of hundred men wearing green fatigues were milling aimlessly around a crooked brick tower higher than the castellated walls backed onto a series of concrete balconies where armed military warders watched us from behind a wide pane of wired glass the courtyard was open to the air but it smelt of cigarettes freshly cut timber and the unwashed bodies of convicted american soldiers who regarded my arrival with a mixture of curiosity and disdain it was warmer than russia and there were no pictures of stalin and lenin to admire but for a moment i felt i was back at camp eleven in voronezh that new york city was just a mile away seemed almost unthinkable yet i could almost hear the sizzle of hamburgers and french fries and immediately i started to feel hungry back in camp eleven we were always hungry each day and all day some men in prison play cards some try to keep fit but in voronezh our main pastime was waiting to be fed not that we were ever fed with food water soup kasha and chleb a dark moist breadlike stuff that tasted of fuel oil was what we ate these men in castle william looked better off than that they still had the look of resistance and escape in their eyes no pleni in a soviet labour camp ever looked like that just to look at an mvd guard with that amount of insolence would have been to risk a beating or worse and no one ever thought of trying to escape there was nowhere to escape to the sergeant led the way into the crooked tower and up a spiral steel staircase to the second level of the fortress were gonna give you a cell all to yourself he said given that youre not going to be with us for very long oh where am i going best you is in solitary he said ignoring my question best for you best for the men new shit and old shit dont mix well in this shithole especially when the new shit smells different i dont want to know what you are you maggot but you aint army so you is quarantined while youre our guest like you had yellow fucking fever one day and dysentery the next you hear me yes sir he opened a steel door and nodded me inside would you mind telling me what this place is castle william is a disciplinary barracks for the first united states army named after the commandant of the us corps of engineers who built it and the island we are on an island arent we governors island in upper new york bay so dont you get any foolish ideas about trying to escape new shit i wouldnt dream of it sir you dont just smell different new shit you sound different too where you from it doesnt matter i said a long way from here and a long time ago thats where im from and i wont be getting any visitors at least no one i want to see no family huh family i cant even spell it then its lucky for you we gave you a view of the city in case you get lonely i went to the window and looked across the bay behind me the door banged loudly shut like a cannon going off i let out a sigh new york was huge so huge it made me feel small so small it would have required a large microscope just to see me chapter four new york castle william was a military barracks until when it became a detention facility for confederate pows which to me made it seem like a home from home then in the castle was fitted up as a model prison for the us military in they even wired it for electricity and installed central heating all of this i was told by one of the guards who were the only men who ever spoke to me only it certainly wasnt a model prison any more crumbling and overcrowded the castle frequently stank of human excrement when the plumbing went wrong which was all the time it seemed that the drainage was poor the result of the castle being built on landfill brought to the island from manhattan of course i assumed this landfill was just rock back in russia landfill often meant something very different the view from my window was the best thing about castle william sometimes i could see yachts sailing up and down the bay like so much seagoing geometry but for the most part it was just loud wastecargo boats sounding their foghorns that i saw and the relentless growing city i had very little else to do but stare out of that window you do a lot of staring in prison you stare at the walls you stare at the floor you stare at the ceiling you stare at the air a nice view felt like a little bit of luxury when prisoners kill themselves or each other its usually because theyre short of something to do i gave killing myself quite a bit of thought because a city view will only keep you going for so long i figured out how to do it too i might not have had a belt or any shoelaces but most convicts manage to hang themselves perfectly well with a cotton shirt almost all of the prisoners i knew who killed themselves in russia it was about one a week hanged themselves using a shirt after this however i decided to keep a closer eye on myself in case i did something foolish and from time to time i would try to engage myself in conversation but this wasnt so easy for one thing i didnt like bernhard gunther very much he was cynical and worldweary and hardly had a good word to say about anyone least of all himself hed had a pretty tough war one way or the other and done quite a few things he wasnt proud of lots of people feel that way of course but it had been no picnic for him since then either it didnt seem to matter where he spread lifes tartan rug there was always a turd on the grass i bet you had a difficult childhood too i said is that why you became a cop to get even with your father youve never been very good with authority figures have you it strikes me that youd have been a lot better off if youd just stayed put in havana and gone to work for lieutenant quevedo come to think of it youd have been a lot better off if youd never been a cop at all trying to do the right thing has never really worked for you gunther has it you should have been a criminal like most of the others that way youd have been on the winning side a little more often hey i thought you were supposed to be talking me out of killing myself if i want someone to make me despair i could do it myself all right all right look this place isnt so bad three meals a clay a room with a view and all the peace and quiet a man of your age could ever wish for they even wash the dinner plates remember those rusty cans you had to eat from in russia and the bread thief you helped murder dont say that youve forgotten him or all the other dead comrades they had to stack like firewood because the ground was too cold and hard to bury them and maybe youve forgotten how the blues used to get us shovelling lime in the wind the way it used to make your nose bleed all day why this place is the hotel adlon next to camp eleven you talked me out of it maybe i wont kill myself i just wish i knew what was happening after all that talking i was as quiet as hegel for a spell maybe it was for several days weeks probably i dont know i hadnt been marking time on the wall the way you were supposed to with six marks followed by a seventh through their middle they stopped making those calendars after the man in the iron mask complained about all the graffiti on the wall of his cell besides the quickest way to do the time is to pretend its not there people pretend a lot when theyre in jail and just when youve managed to persuade yourself that theres something almost normal about being locked up like an animal two strange men wearing suits and hats walk in and tell you that youre being deported to germany one of them puts the cuffs on you and before you know it youre on your way to the airport again the suits were good the creases in their pants were almost perfect like the bow of a big grey ship the hats were nicely shaped and the shoes brightly polished like their fingernails they didnt smoke at least not on the job and they smelled lightly of cologne one of them had a little gold watch chain on which he kept the key to my handcuffs the other wore a signet ring that gleamed like a cold white burgundy they were smooth efficient and probably quite tough they had good white teeth of the kind that reminded me i probably needed to see a dentist and they didnt like me not in the least in fact they hated me i knew this because when they looked my way they grimaced or snarled silently or gritted their teeth and gave every sign of wanting to bite me for much of the journey to the airport there were just the white teeth to contend with and then after about thirty minutes when it seemed they could no longer restrain themselves they started to bark fucking nazi said one i said nothing whats the matter you nazi bastard lost your tongue i shook my head german i said but never a nazi no difference said the other not in my book besides said the first one you were ss and that makes you worse than a nazi murderer that makes you someone who enjoyed it i couldnt argue with him about that what would have been the point theyd already made up their minds about me john wilkes booth would have received a more sympathetic hearing than i was likely to get from these two but after weeks of solitary i had an itch to talk a little what are you fbi the first man nodded thats right a lot of ss were cops just like you i said i was a detective when the war started i didnt have much choice in the matter im nothing like you pal said the second agent nothing you hear me he poked me on the shoulder with his fore linger for good measure and it felt like someone drilling for oil you remember that when you fly home to your massmurdering pals no american ever killed any jews mister what about the rosenbergs i said a nazi with a sense of humour how about that bill hes going to need that when he gets back to germany mitch the rosenbergs thats very funny its just a pity we cant fry you gunther the way we fried those two they had lawyers and a fair trial and i happen to know that the judge and the prosecutor were jews themselves just for your information kraut that is reassuring i said however i might feel more reassured if id ever seen a lawyer myself i believe its not uncommon for someone in this country to have to appear before a court when theres a move to have him deported especially when it seems possible i might be facing a trial in germany i had the strange idea that civil liberties actually meant something to americans extradition was never meant for scum like you gunther said the fed called bill besides said mitch you were never legally here so you cant be legally extradited as far as the american courts are concerned you dont even exist then it was all a bad dream is that it bill put a stick of gum in his mouth and started to chew thats it you imagined the whole thing kraut it never happened and neither did this i ought to have been ready to sign for it their faces had been sending me telegrams ever since wed got in the paddy wagon i suppose they were just waiting for a chance to make the delivery and now it came in the belly hard right up to his elbow i was still hearing the bell ringing in my ears ten minutes later when we stopped the doors opened and they clotheslined me out onto the runway it was a real professional blow i was up the steps and onto the plane before i could draw enough breath to wish them both goodbye i got a good view of the statue of liberty as we took off i had the peculiar idea that the lady in the toga was giving the hitler salute at the very least i figured the book under her left arm was missing a few important pages chapter five germany id been in landsberg before but only as a visitor before the war lots of people visited landsberg prison to see cell number seven where adolf hitler was imprisoned in following the failed beer hall putsch and where he had written mein kampf but i certainly wasnt one of those i never liked biographies very much my own previous visit had occurred in when as a private detective working for a client in munich id gone there to interview an ss officer and convicted war criminal by the name of fritz gebauer the americans ran the prison and there were more convicted nazi war criminals locked up there than anywhere else in europe two or three hundred had been executed on the prison gallows between and and since then a great many more had been released but the place still housed some of the biggest massmurderers in history of these i was well acquainted with several although i avoided most of them during the times when we prisoners were allowed freely to associate there were even a few japanese prisoners from the shanghai war crimes trial but we had little or no contact with them the castle was from and unlike the rest of the historic old town was west of the river lech four white brickbuilt blocks were arranged in a cross shape at the centre of which was a tower from which location our steelhelmeted ironfaced guards could swing their white batons like fred astaire and watch us i remembered once receiving a postcard of hitlers cell and i had the impression that my own was not dissimilar there was a narrow iron bedstead with a small nightstand a bedside light a table and a chair and there was a big double window with more bars on the outside than on a liontamers cage i had a cell facing southwest and that meant i had the sun in my cell during the afternoon and evening and a pleasant view of spottingen cemetery where several of the men hanged at wcpn which was what the americans called it were now interred this made a nice change from my view of new york bay and lower manhattan the dead make quieter neighbours than wastecargo barges the food was good although not recognisably german and i didnt much like the clothes we were obliged to wear grey and purple stripes never suited me very well and the little white hat lacked the allimportant wide snap brim id always preferred and made me look like an organgrinders monkey soon after my arrival i had a visit from the roman catholic chaplain father morgenweiss herr doctor glawik who was a lawyer appointed by the bavarian ministry of justice and a man from the association for the welfare of german prisoners whose name i dont recall most bavarians and quite a few germans too regarded all of the inmates at wcpn as political prisoners the us army saw things differently of course and it wasnt very long before i was also visited by two american lawyers from nuremberg with their strongly accented german and their bullshit bonhomie these two were patient and very very persistent and it was only a relief in part that they seemed hardly interested in the two vienna murders which were nothing to do with me and not at all interested in the killings of two israeli assassins at garmischpartenkirchen of which i was undeniably guilty albeit in selfdefence what they were interested in was my wartime service with the rsha the reich main security office created by the mergers of the sd the security service of the ss the gestapo and kripo in several times a week we would meet in an interview room on the ground floor near the main entrance of the castle they always brought me coffee and cigarettes a little chocolate and sometimes a munich newspaper neither man was older than forty and the younger of the two was the senior officer his name was jerry silverman and before coming to germany hed been a new york lawyer he was hugely tall and wore a green gaberdine military jacket with pink khaki trousers there were several ribbons on his breast but instead of the metal bars most american officers wore on their shoulders to indicate their rank silverman and his sergeant had a cloth patch sewn on their sleeves that identified them both as members of the occwc the office of the chief counsel for war crimes the fact was they were wearing uniforms but they didnt belong to the us military they were pentagon bureaucrats prosecutors from the american department of defense only in america could they have given lawyers a uniform the other older man was sergeant jonathan earp he was a head shorter than captain silverman and had he told me in an idle moment when i asked him graduated from harvard law school prior to his joining the occwc both men had one or two german parents which was why they spoke the language so fluently although earp was the more fluent of the two but silverman was cleverer they came armed with several briefcases that were full of files but they hardly ever referred to these each man seemed to carry a whole filing cabinet in his head they did however take copious notes silverman had small very neat and distinguished handwriting that looked as though it might have been written by volundr the ruler of the elves at first i assumed they were interested in the workings of the rsha and my knowledge of department vi which was the office of foreign intelligence but it seemed they knew almost as much about that as i did perhaps more and only gradually did it become clear that they suspected me of something far more serious than a couple of local murders you see explained silverman there are some aspects of your story that just dont add up i get a lot of that i said you say you were a kommissar in kripo until until kripo became part of the rsha in september but you say you were never a party member i shook my head wasnt that unusual not at all ernst gennat was the deputy chief of kripo in berlin until august and he was to my certain knowledge never a nazi party member what happened to him he died of natural causes there were others too heinrich muller the gestapo chief he never joined the party either then again said silverman maybe he didnt need to he was as you say head of the gestapo there are others i could mention but you have to remember that the nazis were hypocrites sometimes it suited them to be able to use people who were outside the party system so you admit you allowed yourself to be used said earp im alive arent i i shrugged i guess that speaks for itself the question is how much you allowed yourself to be used said silverman its been bothering me too i said he was clever but he couldnt ever have played poker his face was much too expressive when he thought i was lying his mouth hung open and he shifted his lower jaw around like a cow chewing tobacco and when he was satisfied with an answer he looked away or made a sad sound like he was disappointed maybe youd like to get something off your chest said earp seriously i said you dont want me thats for us to decide herr gunther you could beat it out of me like your friends in the navy and the fbi it seems like everyone wants to hit you said earp im just wondering when you two are going to figure that its your turn were not like that in the chief counsels office silverman sounded so smooth i almost believed him well why didnt you say so before now i feel completely reassured most of the people in here have talked to us because they wanted to talk said earp and the rest sometimes its hard to say nothing when all your friends have ratted on you said silverman thats okay then i dont have any friends and very definitely none in this place so anyone who rats on me is probably a bigger rat himself silverman stood up and took off his jacket mind if i open a window he said the politeness was instinctive and he started to open it anyway not that i could ever have jumped out the window was barred just like the one in my cell silverman stood there looking out with his arms folded thoughtfully and for a second i remembered a newspaper photograph of hitler in a similar attitude on a visit to landsberg after hed become reich chancellor after a moment or two he said did you ever meet a man called otto ohlendorf he was a gruppenfuhrer a majorgeneral in the rsha silverman came back to the table and sat down yes i met him a couple of times he was head of department three i think domestic intelligence and what was your impression of him intense a dedicated nazi he was also head of an ss task force that operated in the southern ukraine and the crimea said silverman that same task force murdered ninety thousand people before ohlendorf returned to his desk in berlin as you say he was a dedicated nazi but when the british captured him in he sang like a canary for them and for us actually we couldnt shut him up no one could figure it there was no duress no deal no offer of immunity it seems he just wanted to talk about it maybe you should think about doing that get it off your chest as he did ohlendorf sat in that very chair youre sitting in now and talked his damn head off for fortytwo days in succession he was very matteroffact about it too you might even say normal he didnt cry or offer an apology but i guess there must have been something in his soul that just bothered him some of the guys here quite liked him said earp up until the moment when we hanged him i shook my head with all due respect youre not selling this idea of unburdening myself very well if the only reward comes in heaven and i thought americans were supposed to be good salesmen ohlendorf was one of heydrichs proteges too said silverman meaning you think i was you said yourself it was heydrich who brought you back to kripo in dont know what else that makes you gunther he needed a proper homicide detective not some nazi with an antisemitic axe to grind when i came back to kripo i had the unusual idea that i might actually be able to stop someone from murdering young girls but afterwards you mean after i solved the case you continued working for kripo at general heydrichs request i really didnt have much choice in the matter heydrich was a hard man to disappoint but what did he want from you heydrich was a cold murdering bastard but he was also a pragmatist sometimes he preferred honesty to unswerving loyalty for one or two people such as myself it wasnt so important that they stick to the official party line as that they should do a good job especially if those people like me had no interest in climbing the ss ladder oddly enough thats exactly how otto ohlendorf described his own relationship with heydrich said earp jost too heinz jost maybe you remember him he was the man heydrich appointed to take over from your friend walter stahlecker in charge of task force a when he was killed by estonian partisans walter stahlecker wasnt ever my friend whatever gave you that idea he was your business partners brother wasnt he when you and he were running a private investigation business in berlin in since when has one brother been responsible for anothers actions bruno stahlecker couldnt have been more different from his brother walter he wasnt even a nazi but you met walter stahlecker surely he came to brunos funeral in on any other occasions probably i dont remember when exactly do you think it was before or after he organised the murder of two hundred and fifty thousand jews well it wasnt afterwards and by the way he was franz stahlecker never walter bruno never called him walter but to come back to heinz jost for a moment the man who took over task force a when franz stahlecker was killed would this be the same heinz jost who was sentenced to life imprisonment and then paroled from this place a couple of years ago is that the man you mean we just prosecute them said silverman its up to the us high commissioner for germany whos released and when and then last month i said i hear it was willy sieberts turn to walk out of here now correct me if im wrong but wasnt he otto ohlendorf s deputy when those ninety thousand jews got killed ninety thousand and you people just let him walk out of here it sounds to me that mccloy wants his head examined james conant is high commissioner now said earp either way it beats me why you boys bother i said less than ten years served for ninety thousand murders it hardly seems worth it my maths isnt great but i think that works out at about a day of time served for every twentyfive murders i killed some people during the war its true but by the tally handed down to the likes of jost and siebert and that other fellow erwin schulz in january hell i should have been paroled the same day i was arrested that gives us a number to aim at anyway murmured earp to say nothing of the ss men who are still here i said ignoring him you cant seriously believe that i deserve to be in the same prison as the likes of martin sandberger and walter blume lets talk about that said silverman lets talk about walter blume now him you must know because like you he was a policeman and worked for your old boss arthur nebe in task force b blume was in charge of a special unit a sonderkom mando under nebes orders before nebe was relieved by erich naumann in november i met him no doubt you and he have had a lot to reminisce about since you came here and were able to renew your acquaintance ive seen him of course since ive been in here but we havent spoken nor are we likely to and whys that i thought it was free association do i have to explain who i choose to speak to and who i dont theres nothing free in here said earp come on gunther do you think youre better than blume is that it you seem to know a lot of the answers already i said why dont you tell me i dont understand said earp why would you speak to a man like waldemar klingelhofer in here and not blume klingelhofer was also in task force b ones just as bad as the other surely all in all said silverman it must seem like old times for you gunther meeting all your old pals adolf ott eugen steimle blume klingelhofer come on insisted earp why speak to him and none of the others is it because none of the other prisoners will speak to him because he betrayed a fellow ss officer asked silverman or because he appears to regret what he did as head of the moscow killing commando before taking charge of that commando said earp your friend klingelhofer did what you claim to have done he headed up an antipartisan hunt in minsk wasnt it where you were was that just shooting jews the same as klingelhofer maybe youll let me answer one of your questions at a time i said theres no rush said silverman weve got plenty of time take it from the beginning why dont you you say you were ordered to join a reserve police battalion number three one six in the summer of as part of operation barbarossa thats correct so how come you didnt go to pretzsch in the spring asked earp to the police academy there for training and assignment by all accounts nearly everyone who was going to russia was at pretzsch gestapo kripo waffenss sd the whole rsha heydrich himmler and several thousand officers said silverman according to previous accounts weve heard it was common knowledge after that what was going to happen when you all got to russia but you say you werent at pretzsch which is why the whole business of killing jews was such an unpleasant surprise for you so why werent you at pretzsch what did you get a sick note i was still in france i said on a special mission from heydrich that was convenient wasnt it so let me get this straight when you join battalion three one six on the polishrussian border in june its really your impression that your job will involve nothing more than hunting down partisans and nkvd right yes but even before i got to vilnius id begun to hear stories of local pogroms against the jews because the jews in the nkvd were busy murdering all of their prisoners instead of releasing them it was all very confused youve no idea how confused frankly i didnt believe these stories at first there were plenty of stories like that in the great war and most of them turned out to be false i shrugged in this particular case however even the worst most farfetched stories were nearly all true exactly what were your orders that our job was a security one to keep order behind the lines of our advancing army and you did that how asked silverman by murdering people you know being a detective in the police battalion i paid a lot of attention to my socalled comrades and it turned out that a lot of these murdering bastards in the task forces were lawyers too just like you guys blume sandberger ohlendorf schulz i expect there were others but i cant remember their names i used to wonder why it was that so many lawyers took part in these killings what do you think we ask the questions gunther spoken like a true lawyer mister earp by the way how come i dont have one here with all due respect gentlemen this interrogation is hardly consistent with the rules of german justice or i imagine the rules of american justice either doesnt every american have a fifthamendment right not to be a witness against himself this interrogation is a necessary step in determining if you should be tried or released said silverman this is what we german cops used to call an eskimos fishing trip i said you just drop a line through a hole in the ice and hope that you catch something in the absence of any clear evidence and documentation sometimes continued silverman the only way to gain knowledge of a crime is by questioning a suspect such as yourself thats usually been our experience with war crimes cases bullshit we both know youre sitting on a ton of documentation what about all those papers you recovered from gestapo headquarters that are now in the berlin document centre actually its two tons of documentation said silverman between eight and nine million documents to be precise and eight or nine represents our total staff at the occ with the einsatzgruppen trial we got lucky we found the actual reports that were written by the task group leaders twelve binders containing a gold mine of information as a result we didnt even need a prosecution witness against them even so it took us four months to put the case together four months with you it might take longer do you really want to wait here for another four months while we work out if you have a case to answer so go and check those task group leader reports i said theyll clear me for sure because i wasnt one of them ive told you i got an exeat back to berlin courtesy of arthur nebe out of the task area hes bound to have mentioned it in his report thats where your problem lies gunther explained silverman with your old friend arthur nebe you see the reports for task force a c and d were very detailed otto ohlendorf s were a model of accuracy said earp you might say he was a typical fucking lawyer in that respect silverman was shaking his head but there are no original reports written by arthur nebe from task force b in fact there are no reports from task force b until a new commander is appointed in november we think thats why walter blume took over from nebe because nebe was falling down on the job for whatever reason he wasnt killing nearly as many jews as the other three groups why was that do you think arthur nebe it had been a while since id really thought about the man whod saved my life and perhaps my soul and whom id repaid so unkindly effectively id murdered nebe in vienna during the winter of when hed been working for general gehlens organisation of old comrades but i hardly wanted to tell the two amis anything about that gehlens organisation had been sponsored by the cia or whatever they called it back then and possibly still was nebe was two different men i said perhaps several more than just two in nebe believed that the nazis were the only alternative to the communists and that they would bring order to germany by probably earlier hed realised his mistake and was plotting with others in the wehrmacht and the police to overthrow hitler theres a propaganda ministry photograph of nebe with himmler heydrich and muller that shows the four of them planning the investigation of a bomb attempt on hitlers life that was november and nebe was part of that very same conspiracy i know that because i was part of it too however nebe quickly changed his mind after the defeat of france and britain in lots of people changed their minds about hitler after the miracle of france even i did for a few months anyway we both changed our minds again when hitler attacked russia nobody thought that was a good idea and yet arthur did what he was told hed plot away and do what he was told even if that meant murdering jews in minsk and smolensk doing what you were told was always the best kind of cover if you were simultaneously planning a coup detat against the nazis i think thats why he seems like such an ambiguous figure i think thats why as you said he was falling down on the job as commander of task force b because his heart was never in it above all nebe was a survivor like you to some extent yes thats true thanks to him tell us about that i already did not in any great detail what do you want me to do draw you a picture really we want as many details as possible said earl when someone is lying said silverman its nearly always the case that they start to contradict themselves in matters of detail you should know that from being a policeman yourself when they start to contradict themselves on the small things you can bet theyre lying about the big things too i nodded so he said lets go back to goloby where you murdered the members of an nkvd squad the ones you claim had murdered all of the inmates at the nkvd prison in lutsk said earp according to the soviets that was just german propaganda put out to help persuade your own men that the summary execution of all jews and bolsheviks was justified youll be telling me next that it was the german army who murdered all those poles in the katyn forest maybe it was not according to your own congressional investigation youre well informed i shrugged in cuba i got all the american newspapers in an attempt to improve my english wasnt it the investigation when the maiden committee recommended that the soviets should answer a case at the international court of justice in the hague look its a story ive been interested in for a long time we both know the nkvd killed as many as we did so why not admit it the commies are the enemy now or is that just american propaganda i fetched a packet of cigarettes from the pocket of my prison jacket and lit one slowly i was tired of answering questions but i knew i was going to have to open the door of my minds darkest cellar and wake up some very unpleasant memories even in a room with bars on the window operation barbarossa felt like a very long way away outside it was a bright and sunny june day and although it had been a very similarly warm june day when the wehrmacht invaded the soviet union that wasnt the way i remembered it when i recalled names like goloby lutsk bialystok and minsk i thought of infernal heat and the sights sounds and smells of a hell on earth but most of all i remembered a cleanshaven young man aged about twenty standing in a cobbled town square with a crowbar in his hand his thick boots an inch deep in the blood of about thirty other men who lay dead or dying at his feet i remembered the shocked laughter of some of the german soldiers who were watching this bestial display i remembered the sound of an accordion playing a spirited tune as another older man with a long beard walked silently almost calmly toward the fellow with the crowbar and was immediately struck on the head like some ghastly hindu sacrifice i remembered the noise the old man made as he fell to the ground and the way his legs jerked stiffly like a puppets until the crowbar hit him again i jerked my thumb at the window all right i said ill tell you everything but do you mind if i put my face in the sun for a moment it helps to remind me that im still alive unlike millions of others earp said pointedly go ahead were in no hurry i went to the window and looked out by the main gate a small crowd of people had gathered to wait for someone either that or they were looking for the window of cell number seven which seemed a little less likely is someone being released today i asked silverman came over to the window yes he said erich mielke mielke i shook my head youre mistaken mielkes not in here he couldnt be even as i spoke a smaller door in the main gate opened and a short stocky greyhaired man of about sixty stepped out and was cheered by the waiting wellwishers thats not mielke i said i think you mean erhard milch sir earp told silverman the luftwaffe field marshal its him whos being released today so thats who it is i said for a moment there i thought it was a real war criminal milch is was a war criminal insisted silverman he was director of air armaments under albert speer and what was criminal about building planes i asked you must have built quite a few planes yourself if the state of berlin in was anything to go by we didnt use slave labour to do it said silverman i watched as erhard milch accepted a bunch of flowers from a pretty girl bowed politely to her and was then driven off in a smart new mercedes to begin the rest of his life what was the sentence for that then life imprisonment said silverman life imprisonment eh some people have all the luck commuted to fifteen years theres something wrong with your high commissioners maths i think i said who else is getting out of here i took a puff on my tasteless cigarette flicked the butt out of the window and watched it spiral to the ground trailing smoke like one of milchs invincible luftwaffe planes you were going to tell us about minsk said silverman chapter six minsk on the morning of july i commanded a firing squad that executed thirty russian pows at the time i didnt feel bad about this because they were all nkvd and less than twelve hours before they themselves had murdered two or three thousand prisoners at the nkvd prison in lutsk they also murdered some german pows who were with them which was a miserable sight i suppose you could say they had every right to do so given that we had invaded their country you could also say that our executing them in retaliation had considerably less justification and youd probably be correct on both counts well we did it but not because of the socalled commissar order or the barbarossa decree which were nothing more than a shooting licence from german field headquarters we did it because we felt i felt they had it coming and they would certainly have shot us in similar circumstances so we shot them in groups of four we didnt make them dig their own graves or anything like that i didnt care for that sort of thing it smacked of sadism we shot them and left them where they fell later on when i was a pleni in a russian labour camp i sometimes wished id shot many more than just thirty but thats a different story i didnt feel bad about it until the next day when my men and i came across a former colleague from the police praesidium at the alex in berlin a fellow named becker who was in another police battalion i found him shooting civilians in a village somewhere west of minsk there were about a hundred bodies in a ditch and it seemed to me that becker and his men had been drinking even then i didnt get it i kept on looking for explanations for what was essentially inexplicable and certainly inexcusable and it was only when i realised that some of the people becker and his men were about to shoot were old women that i said something what the hell do you think youre doing i asked him obeying my orders he said what to kill old women theyre jews he said as if that was all the explanation that was needed ive been ordered to kill as many jews as i can and thats what im doing whose orders whos your field commander and where is he major weis becker pointed at a long wooden building behind a white picket fence about thirty yards down the road hes in there having his lunch i walked toward the building and becker called after me dont think i want to do this but orders are orders yes as i reached the hut i heard another volley of shots one of the doors was open and an ss major was sitting on a chair with his tunic off in one hand he held a halfeaten loaf of bread and in the other a bottle of wine and a cigarette he heard me out with a look of weary amusement on his face look none of this is my idea he said its a waste of time and ammunition if you ask me but i do what im told right thats how an army works a superior officer gives me an order and i obey chapter closed he pointed at a field telephone that was on the floor take it up with headquarters if you like theyll just tell you what they told me to get on with it he shook his head youre not the only one who thinks this is madness captain you mean youve already asked for the orders to be confirmed of course i have field hq told me to take it up with division hq and what did they say major weis shook his head questioning an order with division are you mad i wont stay a major for very long if i do that theyll have my pips and my balls and not necessarily in that order he laughed but be my guest go on call them just make sure you leave my name out of it outside there was another volley of shots i picked up the field telephone and cranked the handle furiously thirty seconds later i was arguing with someone at division hq the major got up and put his ear to the other side of the telephone when i started to swear he grinned and walked away youve upset them now he said i slammed the phone down and stood there trembling with anger im to report to division in minsk i said immediately told you he handed me his bottle and i took a swig of what turned out to be not wine but vodka theyll have your rank for sure i hope you think it was worth it from what i hear this he pointed at the door this is just the smoke at the end of the gun someone else is pulling the trigger thats what you have to hold on to my friend try to remember what goethe said he said the greatest happiness for us germans is to understand what we can understand and then having done so to do what were fucking told i went outside and told the men id brought with me in a panzer wagon and a puma armoured car that we were going into minsk to make a report on the mornings antipartisan action as we drove along i was in a melancholy frame of mind but that was only partly to do with the fate of a few hundred innocent jews mostly i was concerned for the reputation of germans and the german army where would this end i asked myself i certainly never conceived that thousands of jews were already being slaughtered in a similar fashion minsk was easy to find all you had to do was drive down a long straight road quite a good road even by german standards and follow the grey plume of smoke on the horizon the luftwaffe had bombed the city a few days before and destroyed most of the city centre even so all of the german vehicles moving along the road kept their distance from one another in case of a russian air attack otherwise the red army was gone and wehrmacht intelligence indicated that the population of three hundred thousand would have left the city too except that our bombing of the road east out of minsk to mogilev and moscow had forced as many as eighty thousand to turn back to the city or at least what remained of it not that this looked like a particularly good idea either most of the wooden houses on the outskirts were still ablaze while nearer the centre piles of rubble backed onto hollowed out office and apartment buildings id never seen a city so thoroughly destroyed as minsk this made it all the more surprising that the uprava the city council and communist party hq had survived the bombing almost unscathed the locals called it the big house which was something of an understatement nine or ten storeys high and built of white concrete the uprava resembled a series of gigantic filing cabinets containing the details of every citizen in minsk in front of the building was an enormous bronze statue of lenin who viewed the large number of german cars and trucks with an understandable look of anxiety and concern as well he might have done given that the building was now the headquarters of reichskommissariat ostland a germancreated administrative area that stretched from the byelorussian capital to the baltic sea pushing a heavy wooden door that was so tall it might still have been growing in a forest i entered a cheap marble clad hall that belonged in a metro station and approached a locomotivesized central desk where several german soldiers and ss were attempting to impose some kind of administrative order on the ant colony of dusty grey men who were pouring in and out of the place catching the eye of one ss officer behind the desk i asked for the ss divisional commanders office and was directed to the second floor and advised to take the stairs as the elevator was not working at the top of the first flight of stairs was a bronze head of stalin and at the top of the second a bronze head of felix dzerzhinsky operation barbarossa looked like it was going to be bad news for russian sculptors just like everyone else the floor was covered with broken glass and there was a line of bullet holes on the grey wall that led all the way along a wide corridor to a couple of open doors that faced each other and through which more ss officers were passing to and fro in a haze of cigarette smoke one of these was my units commanding officer standartenfuhrer mundt who was one of those men who look like they came out of their mothers womb wearing a uniform seeing me he raised an eyebrow and then a hand as he casually acknowledged my salute the murder squad he said did you catch them yes herr oberst good work what did you do with them we shot them sir i handed over a handful of red identification documents id taken from the russians before their executions mundt started to look through the documents like an immigration officer searching for something suspicious including the women yes sir pity in future all female partisans and nkvd are to be hanged in the town square as an example to the others heydrichs orders understand yes herr oberst mundt wasnt much older than me when the war broke out hed been a police colonel with the hamburg schutzpolizei he was clever only his was the wrong kind of cleverness for kripo to be a decent detective you have to understand people and to understand people you have to be one of them yourself mundt wasnt like people he wasnt even a person i supposed that was why he had a pet dachshund with him so that it might make him seem a little more human but i knew better he was a cold pompous bastard whenever he spoke he sounded like he thought he was reciting rilke and i wanted to yawn or laugh or kick his teeth in which is how it must have looked you disagree captain i dont much care to hang women i said he looked down his fine nose and smiled perhaps youd prefer to do something else with them that must be someone else youre thinking of sir what i mean is i dont much like waging war on women im the conventional type thats the geneva convention in case you were wondering mundt pretended to look puzzled its a strange way of observing the geneva convention you have he said to shoot thirty prisoners i glanced around the office which was a good size for just one desk it would have been a good size for a sawmill in the corner of the room was a fitted cupboard with its own little sink where another man was washing his halfnaked torso in the opposite corner was a safe an ss sergeant was listening to it like it was a radio and trying without success to persuade the thing to open on top of the desk was a trio of differently coloured telephones that might have been left there by three wise men from the east behind the desk was another ss officer in a chair and behind the officer was a large wall map of minsk on the floor lay a russian soldier and if this had ever been his office it wasnt any more the bullet hole behind his left ear and the blood on the linoleum seemed to indicate he would soon be relocated to a much smaller and more permanent earthly space besides captain gunther added mundt it may have escaped you but the russians never signed the geneva convention then i guess its fine to shoot them all sir the officer behind the desk stood up did you say captain gunther he was a standartenfuhrer too a colonel the same as mundt which meant that as he came around the desk and placed himself in front of me i was obliged to come to attention again he had been spawned in the same aryan pond as mundt and was no less arrogant yes sir are you the captain gunther who telephoned to question my orders to shoot those jews on the road to minsk this morning yes sir that was me you must be colonel blume what the devil do you mean by questioning an order he shouted youre an ss officer pledged to the fuhrer that order was issued to ensure security in the rear for our combat forces those jews set their houses on fire when the local combat commander told them to make them available as billets for our troops i cant think of a better reason for a reprisal action than the burning of those houses i didnt see any burning houses in that area sir and sturmbannfuhrer weis was under the impression that those old women were being shot only because they were jews and if they were the jews of soviet russia are the intellectual bearers of the bolshevik ideology which makes them our natural enemy no matter how old they are killing jews is an act of war even they seem to understand that if you dont i repeat those orders must be carried out for the safety of all army areas if every soldier only carried out an order after having considered the niceties of whether or not it agreed with his own conscience then pretty soon there would be no discipline and no army are you mad are you a coward are you ill or perhaps you actually like the jews i dont care who or what they are i said i didnt come to russia to shoot old women listen to yourself captain said blume what kind of an officer are you youre supposed to set an example to your men ive a good mind to take you to the ghetto just to see if this is some kind of an act if you really are this squeamish about killing jews mundt had started to laugh blume he said i can promise you this captain said colonel blume you wont be a captain any more if you cant manage it youll be the lowest schutze in the ss do you hear blume said mundt look at these he handed blume the papers of the nkvd id executed at goloby look blume glanced at the documents as mundt opened them for him mundt said sara kagan solomon geller josef zalmonowitz julius polonski these are all jewish names vinokurova kieper he grinned some more enjoying my growing discomfort i worked on the jew desk in hamburg so i know something about these yid bastards joshua pronicheva fanya glekh aaron levin david schepetovka saul katz stefan marx vladya polichov these are all yids he shot this morning so much for your fucking scruples gunther you picked a jewish nkvd squad to execute you just shot thirty kikes whether you like it or not blume opened another identification document at random and then another misha blyatman hersh gebelev moishe ruditzer nahum yoffe chaim serebriansky zyama rosenblatt he was laughing now too youre right how do you like that israel weinstein ivan lifshitz it sounds to me like you hit the jackpot gunther so far youve managed to kill more jews in this campaign than i have maybe i should recommend you for a decoration or at the very least a promotion mundt read out some more names just to rub it in you should feel proud of yourself then he clapped me on the shoulder come now surely you can see the funny side of this and if you cant then that only makes it all the more funny said blume whats funny said a voice we all looked around to see arthur nebe the general in charge of task force b standing in the doorway everyone came to attention including me as nebe came into the office and walked up to the wallmap with hardly a look at me blume attempted an explanation im afraid this officer was exhibiting a degree of scrupulousness with regard to the killing of jews that turns out to have been somewhat misplaced general it seems he already shot thirty nkvd this morning apparently unaware that they were all jews it was the nice distinction between the two we found amusing added mundt not everyone is cut out for this kind of work murmured nebe still studying the map i heard that paul blobels in a lublin hospital after a special action in the ukraine a complete nervous breakdown and perhaps you dont remember what was said by reichsfiihrer himmler at pretzsch any repugnance felt at killing jews is a cause for congratulation since it affirms that we are a civilised people so i really dont see whats funny about any of this in future ill thank you to deal more sensitively with any man who expresses his inability to kill jews is that clear yes sir nebe touched a red square on the top righthand corner of the map and this is what drozdy sir said blume three kilometres north of here weve established a rather primitive prisonerofwar camp there on the banks of the svislock river all of them men jews and nonjews how many in total about forty thousand separated yes sir blume joined nebe in front of the map pows in one half and jews in the other and the ghetto south of the drozdy camp in the northwest of the city its the old jewish quarter of minsk he put his finger on the map here from the svislock river west on nemiga street north along the edge of the jewish cemetery and back east towards the svislock this is the main street here republikanskaya and where it meets nemiga that will be the main gate what kind of buildings are these asked nebe one or twostorey wooden houses behind cheap wooden fences even as we speak sir the whole ghetto is being surrounded with barbed wire and watchtowers locked at night of course i want monthly actions to reduce the number of byelorussian jews there in order to accommodate the jews theyre sending us from hamburg yes general you can start reducing the numbers now in the drozdy camp make the selection voluntary ask those with university degrees and professional qualifications to come forward deprive them all of food and water to encourage volunteers those jews you can keep for now the rest you can liquidate at once yes general himmler is coming here in a couple of weeks time so hell want to see that were making progress understand yes general nebe turned and finally looked at me you captain gunther come with me i followed nebe into the adjacent office where four junior ss officers were reading files taken from an open filing cabinet you lot said nebe fuck off and close the door behind you and tell those lazy bastards next door to get rid of that body before he starts stinking the place out in this heat there were two desks in this office overlooked by a set of trench windows and a poor portrait of stalin in a grey uniform with a red stripe down the side of his trouser leg looking rather less caucasian and more oriental than was usual nebe fetched a bottle of schnapps and glasses from one of the desk drawers and poured two large ones he took his own drink without a word like a man who was tired of seeing things straight and poured himself another while i was still sniffing and tensing my liver chapter seven minsk i hadnt seen nebe in more than a year he looked older and more worn than i remembered his previously grey hair was now the same silver colour as his war merit cross while his eyes were as narrow as his pillbox slit of a mouth only his long nose and prominent ears seemed much the same its good to see you again bernie arthur a whole lifetime spent arresting criminals and now ive become a criminal myself he chuckled wearily what do you think of that you could put a stop to it what can i do im just a cog in heydrichs death machine the machines in gear too i couldnt stop it even if i wanted to you used to think you could make a difference that was then hitler has the whip hand since the fall of france theres no one who dares to oppose him now things will have to go badly in russia for us before that can happen again which they will of course im certain of it but not yet people like you and me will have to bide our time and until then arthur what about these people you mean the yids i nodded he tossed back his second drink and then shrugged you really dont give a damn do you nebe laughed a wry sort of laugh ive got quite a lot on my mind bernie he said himmlers coming here next month what do you expect me to do sit him down somewhere quiet and explain that this is all very wrong explain that jews are people too tell the emperor charles the fifth and the diet of worms here i stand i can do no other be reasonable bernie reasonable these men himmler heydrich mtiller theyre fanatics you cant reason with fanatics he shook his head im already under suspicion after the elser plot if you dont youre no better than they are ive got to be careful bernie im only safe as long as im doing exactly what im told and ive got to be safe if theres ever going to be another opportunity for us to get rid of hitler he poured his third drink in as many minutes surely you of all people can understand that all i know is that youre planning mass murder in this town so go ahead and arrest me kommissar christ i wish you would right now id love to see the inside of a police cell back at the alex instead of this ghastly frontier town he put down his glass and held out his wrists here put the cuffs on and get me out of here if you can no i thought not youre as helpless as i am he picked up his glass drank it and started another cigarette exactly what did you tell those two bastards anyway blume and mundt me i said i didnt come to russia to kill old women even if they were jews unwise bernie unwise mundt is very highly thought of in berlin hes been a party member since thats even longer than me which counts for something with hitler you ought not to say such things again at least not to the likes of mundt he could make life very awkward for you you have no idea what some of these ss are capable of im beginning to have a clear idea look bernie there are others here in byelorussia and in germany who think the same way as me and you who are ready to move against hitler when the time is right well have need of men like you until then it might be best if you were to keep your trap shut keep my trap shut and shoot some jews is that it why not because you can take my word for it shooting the jews is just the beginning after all its hardly the most efficient method of killing thousands of people you wouldnt believe the pressure im under to come up with some other means of killing jews why dont you just blow them all up i said take all of the jews in byelorussia assemble them in a field with a couple of thousand tons of tnt under their feet and put a match to it that should solve your problem very nicely i wonder said nebe thoughtfully if that might work i shook my head in despair and at last downed the schnapps id like to be able to count on you bernie after all weve been through in berlin theres no one in this godforsaken country i can really trust you know certainly none of these other officers im not even sure i can trust myself arthur not now ive seen what ive seen not now that i know what i know nebe refilled our glasses hmm thats what i suspected you mad bastard he grinned bitterly youre just about capable of doing it arent you shooting your mouth off about the jews when himmler comes here to minsk next month some thing like that what am i to do with you i can be shot like some old jew if that was all there was to it said nebe then perhaps id make that happen but youre being naive just like always no german officer of the rsha gets shot without the gestapo getting involved especially not a man with your background who was close to heydrich who was close to me they would want to interrogate you to ask you questions that dont have a yesorno answer and i cant afford that you might tell them something about me about my past about our past i was shaking my head but i knew he was probably right nebe grinned and started biting his fingernails which i noticed were already right down to the quick i wish i could stop doing this he said my mother used to dip my fingers in cat shit to try to prevent me from doing it doesnt seem to have worked does it youve still got shit on your fingers arthur but i can see now it was me who was being naive about you i need you out of minsk before you open that stupid trap of yours when im not around to prevent it and get yourself arrested and possibly me too youre too old for frontline duty they wouldnt take you so thats out he sighed i can see its going to have to be intelligence theres precious little of that to go around in this war so you should fit in of course theyll think youre a spy so this will have to be a temporary attachment until i can think of something to get you safely back to berlin where you cant do any harm dont do me any favours i said ill take my chances but i wont thats rather the point ive been making he pointed at my drink come on get that down and cheer up and stop worrying about a few jews people have been killing jews since the emperor claudius ordered them expelled from rome what does luther say that next to the devil there is no more bitter more poisonous more vehement enemy than a real jew and lets not forget the kaiser wilhelm the second who said that a jew cannot be a true patriot that he is something different like a bad insect even benjamin franklin thought that jews were vampires nebe shook his head and grinned no bernie youd better pick another reason to hate the nazis there are any number of reasons but not the jews not the jews maybe if there are enough pogroms in europe theyll get their fucking homeland like that british idiot balfour promised and then theyll leave the rest of us in peace i drank the schnapps what else was i going to do with it people say all kinds of crazy things when theyve had a drink me included they talk about god and the saints and hearing voices and seeing the devil they shout about killing franzis and tommies and they sing christmas carols on a summers day their wives dont understand them and their mothers never loved them theyll say black is white up is down and hot is cold no one ever expects a drink to help you make sense arthur nebe had taken several drinks but he wasnt drunk even so what he said sounded crazier than any drunk id ever heard and ever hope to hear again i stayed at lenin house for two or three weeks sharing a seventhfloor billet with waldemar klingelhofer who was an ss obersturmbannfuhrer a lieutenant colonel in overall charge of the antipartisan hunts in the minsk area minsk was one place where german propaganda did not exaggerate the strength of local partisans who took advantage of the huge thick forests called pushcha that characterised the area most of these fighters were young red army soldiers but quite a few were jews whod fled from pogroms to the comparative safety of the forest what did they have to lose not that the jews were always welcomed with open arms some of the byelorussians were no less antisemitic than germans and more than half of these refugee jews were murdered by the popovs klingelhofer spoke fluent russian hed been born in moscow but he knew nothing about police work or hunting partisans real partisans i gave him some advice on how to recruit some informers not that my advice to klingelhofer really mattered because at the end of july nebe ordered him to smolensk to obtain furs for german army winter clothing and i was ordered to baranowicze about one hundred and fifty kilometres southwest of minsk to await transport back to berlin formerly a polish city until the soviets occupied it at the beginning of the war baranowicze was a small prosperous town of about thirty thousand people more than a third of them jews in its centre was a long wide suburbanlooking treelined street with twostorey shops and houses that the occupying german army had renamed kaiser wilhelm strasse there was an orthodox cathedral recently built in the neoclassical style and a ghetto six buildings on the outskirts of the city where more than twelve thousand jews were now confined at least those jews who had not escaped into the pripet marshes two whole regiments of the ss cavalry brigade commanded by sturmbannfuhrer bruno magill were searching the thousandacre marshland killing every jew they could find this left the city quiet so quiet that for a couple of days until a seat became available on a ju back to tegel airfield in berlin i was able to sleep in a proper bed in what formerly had been girsh bregmans leather goods and shoe store i tried not to consider the sudden fate that had overtaken girsh bregman and his family whose framed photographs still stood on top of an upright rheinberg sohne in the little parlour behind the shop but it was only too easy to think of them enduring the close privations of the ghetto or perhaps fleeing their persecutors who included not just the ss but also the polish police former polish army soldiers and even some local ukrainian clergy who were keen to bless these pacifications of course it was possible that the bregmans were already pacified which is to say that they were dead thats about as pacified as you could get in the summer of most of all i just hoped they were alive only it was the kind of hope that looked like a canary in a mine full of gas i wouldnt have minded a little gas myself just enough to sleep for about a hundred years and then wake up from the nightmare that was my life chapter eight germany at least you did wake up said silverman unlike six million others youre a funny guy are you always so quick with maths or is it just that one number you like i dont like anything about it gunther said silverman neither do i and please dont ever make the mistake of thinking i do its not me that makes mistakes gunther its you youre right i should have made sure i was born somewhere other than germany in that way maybe i could have ended up on the winning side twice how does it feel boys to sit in judgement on someone elses mistakes pretty good i imagine the way you two act anyone might think you americans really do believe that youre better than anyone else not everyone else snarled earp just you and your nazi pals you can keep telling yourself that if you like but we both know its not true or is it that occupying the moral high ground is more than an aspiration for you amis perhaps its also a constitutional necessity only i suspect that underneath all that sanctimony youre just like us germans you really do believe that might is right at this moment said silverman all that really matters is what we believe about you he tells a good story earl was speaking to silverman a regular jakob grimm this guy all it lacked was the once upon a time and the happily ever after we should get him some heated iron shoes and make him dance around the room in them like snow whites stepmother until hes straight with us youre quite correct said silverman and you know only a german could have thought of a punishment like that didnt you say you had german parents i said just a mother youre sure about i presume neither of us feels very proud of our german background said earp thanks to people like you for a while the three of us were silent then silverman said there was a gunther we heard about in that town you mentioned baranowicze he was an ss sturmbannfuhrer with one of the small killing units belonging to arthur nebes task force b a sonderkommando he organised one of the early gassings everyone in a mental hospital at mogilev was killed that wouldnt be you would it no i said but seeing that they were hardly likely to be satisfied with a straight denial i lifted my finger to indicate that i was trying to remember something and then i did i think there was an ss sturmbannfuhrer called gunther rausch attached to task force b in the summer of it must be him youre thinking of i never gassed anyone not even the fleas in my bed but it was you who suggested to arthur nebe the idea of mass killings using explosives wasnt it you admitted as much yourself that was a joke not a very funny joke when it comes to blowing people up i dont think anyone has ever managed that more efficiently than america i said how many did you blow up in hiroshima and nagasaki a couple of hundred thousand and still counting thats what ive read germany may have started the process of mechanised mass killing but you americans certainly perfected it did you ever visit the criminal technology institute in berlin yes i said i often went there in the course of my duty as a detective for forensic tests and results did you ever meet a chemist called albert wildmann yes i met him many times and hans schmidt also from the same institute i think so what are you driving at isnt it the case that you returned from minsk to berlin at the behest of arthur nebe not to join the german war crimes bureau as you told us but to meet with wildmann and schmidt in pursuit of your explosives idea i was shaking my head but silverman wasnt paying attention and i was gaining a new respect for him as an interrogator and that having discussed the idea in detail you yourself returned to smolensk with wildmann and schmidt in september no thats not true like i said i think you must be confusing me with gunther rausch isnt it the case that you brought with you a large quantity of dynamite and that you used it to rig a russian pillbox with explosives and that you then herded into it almost a hundred people from a mental asylum in minsk and that you then detonated the explosives isnt that what happened no thats not true i had nothing to do with that according to the reports weve read the heads and limbs of the dead were strewn across a quartermile radius ss men were collecting body parts from the trees for days afterwards i shook my head when i made that remark to nebe about blowing up jews in a field i had no idea he would actually try something like that it was sarcasm hardly a genuine suggestion i shrugged then again i dont know why im surprised given everything else that happened weve always thought it was arthur nebe himself who came up with the idea of the gas vans said silverman so maybe that was another of your jokes too tell me did you ever visit an address in berlin number four tiergartenstrasse i was a cop i visited a lot of addresses i dont remember this one was special the berlin gas works was somewhere else if thats what youre implying tiergartenstrasse number four was a confiscated jewish villa said silverman an office from where germanys euthanasia programme for the handicapped was planned and administered then im sure i was never there maybe you heard about what was happening there and mentioned it in passing to nebe as a little thank you for getting you out of minsk in case youve forgotten i said nebe was head of kripo and before that a general in the gestapo its quite likely he knew wildmann and schmidt for the same reason i did and i dare say he would have known all about this place in tiergartenstrasse as well but i never did your relationship with waldemar klingelhofer said silverman you were quite helpful to him with advice yes i tried to be were you helpful in any other ways i shook my head did you accompany him to moscow for example no ive never been in moscow and yet you speak russian almost as well as he does that was later when i learned in the labour camp mostly so between september th and october th you say you were not with klingelhofers vorkommando moscow but in berlin yes and that you had nothing to do with the murders of five hundred and seventytwo jews during that time nothing to do with it no several of them were jewish mink ranchers who failed to provide the prescribed quota of furs for klingelhofer never shot a jewish mink rancher gunther or blown one up in a pillbox no the two lawyers were quiet for a moment as if theyd run out of questions the silence didnt last long so said silverman youre not in moscow youre back on the plane to berlin a junkers you said any witnesses i thought for a moment fellow named schulz erwin schulz go on he was ss too a sturmbannfuhrer i think but before hed been a cop in berlin and then an instructor at the police academy in bremen after that something in the gestapo maybe in bremen too i dont remember but we hadnt seen each other in more than ten years when we both got on that plane out of baranowicze he was a few years younger than me i think not much i think hed been in the army during the last months of the great war and then the freikorps while he was at university in berlin law i think tallish fairhaired with a moustache a bit like hitlers and quite tanned not that he looked well when he was on that plane there were huge bags under his eyes that were more like bruises almost as if someone had punched him well we recognised each other and after a few moments we started talking i offered him a cigarette and i noticed the hand that took it was shaking like a leaf his leg wouldnt stay still either like it had st vituss dance he was a nervous wreck gradually it became clear that he was returning to berlin for much the same reason i was because hed put in for a transfer schulz said that his unit had been operating in a place called zhitomir thats just a shithole between kiev and brest no one in his right mind would want to go to zhitomir which is probably why the ss brass in the person of general jeckeln had established its ukrainian hq there jeckeln was never in his right mind as far as i could see anyway schulz said that jeckeln had told him that all of the jews in zhitomir were to be shot immediately schulz wasnt bothered about the men but he had more than a few qualms about the women and the children fuck that he said but no one was listening orders were orders and he should just shut up and get on with it well it seemed that there were a lot of jews in zhitomir christ only knows why that should be the case after all its not like the popovs ever made them feel welcome there the tsar hated them too and they had pogroms in zhitomir in and in mean you would think theyd have got the message and cleared off somewhere else but no not a bit of it there are three synagogues in zhitomir and when the ss showed up there were thirty thousand of them just waiting around for something to happen which it did according to schulz the first day the ss got there they hanged the mayor or perhaps it was the local judge who was a jew and several others then they shot four hundred right away for one reason or another marched them out of town to a pit had them lie down like sardines one on top of the other and shot them in layers well schulz thought that would be it hed done his bit and that was enough i mean four hundred he thought but no he said they kept on coming day after day and four hundred jews soon became fourteen thousand then schulz was told that they would have to do the women and children as well and for him that was the last straw fuck this he thought i dont care if almighty god has ordered this im not killing women and kids so he wrote to the personnel officer at rsha hq to a general bruno streckenbach and put in for a transfer which was why he was on that plane with me they were pretty pissed off with him apparently especially his co otto rasch he accused schulz of being weak and letting the side down he asked schulz where was his sense of duty and all that crap not that schulz said he was surprised about this he said that rasch was one of those bastards who liked to make sure that everyone officers included had to pull the trigger on at least one jew so that we were all equally guilty i suppose only he had another word for it one of those compound words that himmler used at pretzsch blood part i think it was anyway schulz didnt know what fate awaited him back in berlin he was nervous and apprehensive to say the least i suppose he was hoping his behaviour would be overlooked and hed get the okay to resume his police work in hamburg or bremen im not cut out for this kind of thing he said dont get me wrong he said i care nothing for the jews but no one should be asked to do this kind of work no one they should find some other means of doing it he said thats what he told me anyway so said earp are you telling us your alibi is another convicted war criminal schutz was convicted i didnt know that gave himself up in said earp he was convicted in october of crimes against humanity and sentenced to twenty years that was commuted to fifteen years in you mean hes here in landsberg well then he can confirm our conversation on the flight back to berlin that i told him what i already told you how i was sent back for refusing to kill jews he was paroled last january said earp too bad gunther i dont think hed have made such a great character witness for you anyway said silverman he was a brigadiergeneral in the ss when he gave himself up the reason bruno streckenbach went easy on schulz is obvious said earp because he participated in the murders of fifteen thousand jews before he sickened of the work probably streckenbach figured schulz had done more than his fair share of killing and i guess that must be why you let him go too i said i told you said silverman that was down to the high commissioner and the recommendations of the parole and clemency board for war criminals i shook my head i was tired theyd been nipping at my heels the whole day like a pair of ninetofive bloodhounds i felt like i was trapped up a tree with nowhere left to run have you considered the possibility that i could be telling the truth but even if i wasnt i might be tempted to put my hands up just to get you two off my back the way you hand out paroles around here id have to be hideki tojo to get more than six months we like things to be neat said silverman and you have got more loose ends than an old maids sewing basket added earp so that when we leave this job we can be sure that we gave it our best shot pride in the job huh i can understand that so said silverman were going to look into your story comb it through for nits that still wont make me a louse you were ss said silverman im a jew and youll always be a louse in my book gunther chapter nine germany it was easy to forget that we were in germany there was a us flag in the main hall and the kitchens which were seemingly always in action served plain home cooking on the understanding that home was six thousand kilometres to the west most of the voices we heard were american too loud manly voices that told you to do something or not to do something in english and we did it quickly too or we received a prod from a night stick or a kick up the backside nobody complained nobody would have listened except perhaps father morgenweiss the guards were mps deliberately selected for their enormous size it was hard to see how germany could ever have expected to win a war against this more obvious looking master race they walked the landings and corridors of landsberg prison like gunfighters from the ok corral or maybe boxers entering the ring with each other they had an easy way about them they were all big wellbrushed smiles and booming laughs shouting jokes and baseball scores for us the inmates however there were only stone faces and belligerent attitudes fuck you they seemed to say you may have your own federal government but were the real masters in this pariah country i had a cell for two to myself it wasnt because i was special or because i hadnt yet been charged with anything but because wcpn was half empty every week it seemed someone else was released but immediately after the war landsberg had been full of prisoners the amis had even incarcerated jewish displaced persons there from the concentration camps of nearby kaufering alongside prominent nazis and war criminals but forcing those same ragged threadbare jews to wear ss uniforms had perhaps demonstrated a want of sensitivity on the part of the americans that almost bordered on the comic not that the amis were capable of seeing the funny side of anything very much the jewish dps were long gone from landsberg now to israel great britain and america but the gallows were still there and from time to time the guards tested it just to make sure everything was working smoothly they were thoughtful like that no one really believed the german federal government was planning to bring back the death penalty then again no one really believed the amis gave a damn what the federal government thought about anything they certainly didnt give a damn about scaring the prisoners because at the same time that they tested the gallows they rehearsed the whole ghastly procedure of an execution with a volunteer prisoner taking the place of a condemned man these monthly rehearsals took place on a friday because it was an old landsberg tradition that friday was a hanging day a team of eight mps solemnly marched the condemned man into the central courtyard and up the steps to the roof where the gallows was and there they slipped a hood over the mans head and a noose around his neck the prison director even read out a death sentence while the rest of them stood at attention and pretended probably wished it was the real thing or so i was told it might reasonably be asked why anyone least of all a german officer would volunteer for such a duty but as with everything else in germany the amis got exactly what they wanted by offering the volunteer extra cigarettes chocolate and a glass of schnapps and it was always the same prisoner who volunteered to step onto the gallows waldemar klingelhofer perhaps the amis were unwise to do this given that hed already tried to open a vein in his wrist with a large safety pin then again its no good looking for a whole flock when youve only got one sheep it wasnt guilt about killing jews that made klingelhofer try to kill himself and volunteer for a practice execution it was his guilt over the betrayal of another ss officer erich naumann naumann had written a letter to klingelhofer instructing him what to tell his interrogators and reminding him that there were no reports for the activities of task force b which he himself had commanded after nebe but this advice also revealed the true depth of naumanns own criminality in minsk and smolensk klingelhofer who was deeply conflicted about the collapse of the german reich handed naumanns letter to the amis who produced it at the einsatzgruppen trial in and used it as prima facie evidence against him the letter helped convict naumann and send him to the gallows in june the consequence of all this was that none of the other prisoners spoke to klingelhofer no one except me and probably no one would have spoken to me either but for the fact that i was the only one currently being interrogated by the americans this made some of my former comrades very nervous indeed and one day two of them followed me out of the common room where we ate played cards and listened to the radio and into the courtyard captain gunther we would like a word with you please ernst biberstein and walter haensch were both senior ss officers and regarding themselves not as criminals but as pows persisted in the use of military ranks biberstein a standartenfuhrer equivalent to a full colonel did most of the talking while the younger haensch only a lieutenantcolonel did most of the agreeing its several years since i myself was interrogated by the amis said biberstein i think it must be almost seven years ago now no doubt these things are different from the way they used to be we live in rather more hopeful even enlightened circumstances than we did back then the americans no longer seem to be driven by the same sense of moral superiority and desire for retribution added haensch redundantly nevertheless continued biberstein its important to be careful what one tells them during an interrogation they sometimes have an easygoing way about them and can appear to be ones friends when in fact theyre anything but that im not sure if you ever met our late lamented comrade otto ohlendorf but for a long time he made himself very useful to the amis volunteering information without restraint in the misguided expectation that he might curry favour with them and as a result secure his freedom too late however he realised his mistake and having given evidence against general kaltenbrunner at nuremberg and effectively sent him to his death he discovered that he had managed to talk his way onto the gallows biberstein had a thoughtfullooking face with a broad forehead and a sceptical cast to his mouth there was something of the serious clown about him an authority figure and whitefaced straight man whose sour rising diphthongs and way of speaking at someone instead of to them reminded me that before joining the ss and the sd biberstein had been a lutheran minister in some northern peasant town where they didnt seem to mind that their pastor was a longstanding nazi party member probably they hadnt minded either that he led a murder commando in russia before being promoted and asked to take charge of the gestapo in southern poland a lot of lutherans had seen hitler as luthers true heir maybe he was i didnt think id have liked luther any more than i ever liked hitler or biberstein i wouldnt like you to make the same mistake as otto said biberstein so id like to give you some advice if you cant remember something then really you should just say so no matter how feeble that might seem or how culpable it might make you look when youre in any doubt at all remind the amis that this all happened almost fifteen years ago and that you really cant remember speaking for myself said haensch i have always maintained that any prisoner has the right to silence this is a legal principle known and respected throughout the civilised world and especially in the united states of america i myself was a lawyer in hirschfelde prior to joining the rsha and you can take it from me that there is no court in the western world that can force a man to give evidence against himself they managed to convict you didnt they i said i was convicted in error insisted the bespectacled haensch who had a lawyers slimy face to match his lawyers slimy manner and even slimier patter heydrich did not order me to russia until march by which time task force c had more or less completed its work quite simply there were no jews left to kill however all of this is beside the point as biberstein says this happened almost fifteen years ago and one cannot be asked to remember things that happened then he took off his glasses cleaned them and added exasperatedly besides it was war we were fighting for our very survival as a race things happen in war that one regrets in peacetime thats natural but the amis werent exactly saints in wartime themselves ask peiper ask dietrich theyll tell you it wasnt just the ss who shot prisoners it was the amis as well to say nothing of the systematic mistreatment of the malmedy prisoners of war that has occurred in this and other prisons haensch twitched nervously his were the kind of chinless weak features that gave war criminals and mass murderers a bad name not that the amis looked on haensch with any more disgust than anyone else that particular distinction was reserved for sepp dietrich jochen peiper and the perpetrators of the socalled malmedy massacre just remember this said biberstein that were not without friends on the outside you certainly should not feel that you are alone doctor rudolf aschenauer has represented hundreds of old comrades including walter funk our former economics minister he is a most ingenious attorney at law as well as being a former party member he is also a devout roman catholic im not sure what your religious affiliations are captain gunther but it cannot be denied that in this part of the country the catholics have the louder voice the catholic bishop of munich johannes neuhausler and the cardinal of cologne joseph frings are active lobbyists on our behalf but so is the evangelical bishop of bavaria hans meiser in other words it might be in your interests to find your christian faith again since both churches support the committee for church aid for prisoners i myself have had the personal support of the evangelical bishop of wurttemberg theo wurm said haensch as has our comrade martin sandberger and you neednt worry about paying for a defence the committee will take care of all your legal teams expenses the committee even has the backing of a few sympathetic us senators and congressmen quite so said biberstein these are men who have been most vocal in their opposition to jewishinspired ideas of vengeance he turned for a moment and waved his hand dismissively at landsbergs brick walls which is all this is of course keeping us here against all the rules of international law the important thing is that we all stick together said haensch the last thing we want now is any unnecessary speculation as to what some of us did or did not do do you see that would only complicate matters in other words it would be desirable captain gunther if your statements to the amis concerned only yourself now i get it i said and here i was thinking it was really my welfare you were concerned about oh but it is said haensch my dear fellow it is youve got a big pile of potatoes in the office of the parole and clemency board i said and you dont want anyone like me knocking it over naturally we want to get out of here said haensch some of us have families its not just in our interest that were released soon said biberstein its in germanys interest that we draw a line in front of what happened and then move on only then when the last prisoner of war has been released from here and in russia can we germans plan for the future not just german interest added haensch its in american and british interest too that good relations are fostered with a fully sovereign german government so that the real ideological enemy can be effectively opposed dont you think weve killed enough russians i asked stalins dead the korean war is over no one is talking about killing anyone insisted biberstein but were still at war with the communists whether you like it or not a cold war its true but a war nonetheless look i dont know what you did during the war and i dont want to know none of us do no one in here talks about anything that happened back then the important thing is to remember that every man in this prison is agreed on one thing that none of us is or was criminally responsible for his acts or those of his men because we were all of us following orders whatever our personal feelings or misgivings about the odious work we were tasked with it was a fuhrer order and it was impossible to disobey as long as we all stick to that story its certain we can all of us be out of this place before the decade is out and hopefully well before that added haensch i nodded which was misleading because it made me look as if i cared what happened to any of them i nodded because i didnt want any trouble and just because they were convicts was no reason they couldnt give me any the amis wouldnt have minded that at all unlike the parole and clemency board most of the mps in landsberg were of the opinion that we all deserved to hang and possibly they were right but most of the reason i nodded was because i was tired of not being liked by anyone including myself thats okay when you can go and put that feeling under several millilitres of alcohol but the bars in prison are never open especially when you need a drink the way i needed one now life in most prisons would be improved by the ration of a daily tot of liquor like in the british royal navy thats not a penal theory with which jeremy bentham would have agreed but you can take it to the bank most of all i could have used a drink at night just before i went to bed perhaps it was having to talk about and relive the summer of but while i was in landsberg sleep provided little respite from the cares of the world often i would awake in the unfocused gloom of my cell and find myself soaked in sweat having dreamed an awful dream and more often than not it was the same dream of earth shifting strangely beneath my feet turned not by any unseen animal but by some darker subterranean elemental force and as i watched closely i saw the black ground as it shifted again and the blankeyed head and spiderlike hands of some murdered lazarus selfraising from its own corpse gases appeared on the mysterious surface thin and white like a clay pipe the naked creature lifted its behind its chest and last of all its skull moving backwards and unnaturally the way a collapsed puppet might arrange its various limbs until at last it appeared to be kneeling in front of a cloud of smoke which cleared suddenly as it was sucked into the muzzle of the pistol in my steady hand chapter ten germany its one of lifes little jokes that whenever you think that things can hardly get any worse they usually do i must have fallen asleep again and for a moment i thought it was just another bad dream i felt several pairs of hands upon me turning me over onto my stomach and ripping the pyjama jacket off my back and then i was simultaneously hooded and handcuffed as the manacles pinched my wrists painfully i cried out and for this sound i received a punch on the head quiet hissed a voice an american voice or youll get another the hands which wore rubber gloves hauled me onto my feet someone pulled down my pyjama trousers and i was dragged and then marched out of my cell along the landing and down the stairs we went outside briefly and crossed the yard doors opened and slammed behind us and after that i quickly lost track of where i was beyond the obvious fact that i was still within the walls of landsberg i felt a hand push down on top of my hooded head sit down said a voice i sat and that would have been fine except that there was no chair and i heard several loud guffaws as i lay sprawled in pain on the stoneflagged floor did you think of that one all by yourself i said or did you get the idea from a movie i told you to shut up someone kicked me in the small of my back not so hard as to cause any damage but enough to shut me up speak when spoken to more hands picked me up again and dumped me onto a chair and this time it was there then i heard lots of footsteps leaving the room and a door closing but not being locked and i might have supposed myself alone but for the fact that i could smell the smoke from a cigarette i would have asked for one myself if i thought i could have smoked it with a hood over my head there was that and the chance i might get kicked or punched again so i stayed quiet telling myself that despite their threats this was the opposite of what they wanted unless youre going to put a man on a gallows trapdoor and hang him you hood him for only one reason to help soften him up and make him talk the only thing was i couldnt imagine what they wanted me to say that i hadnt already told them ten minutes passed maybe longer but probably less time starts to expand when they take your light away i closed my eyes that way it was me in control and not them even if they took the hood off now i wouldnt see anything i took a deep breath and let it out as steadily as i could trying to get a hold of my fear telling myself id been in tighter spots that after the mud of amiens in this was easy there werent even any shells bursting overhead i was still wearing four limbs and my balls a hood was nothing they wanted me not to see anything then that was fine with me id lived through black and sightless days before they dont come much blacker than amiens the black day of the german army ludendorff called it and not without justification what else do you call it when youre facing a force of four hundred and fifty tanks and thirteen divisions of anzacs with more arriving all the time i heard a match and caught the smoke of another cigarette a chain smoker perhaps or someone else i took a deep breath and tried to get a hold of some smoke in my own lungs american tobacco that much was clear from the sweet smell probably they put sugar in it the way they put sugar in almost everything in coffee in liquor on fresh fruit maybe they put sugar on their wives too and if the men were anything to go by they probably needed a little sweetening not long after my arrival at landsberg hermann priess the former commander of the offending ss troop at malmedy during the battle of the bulge had told me about this kind of rough treatment at the hands of the americans before their trial for the murder of ninety us servicemen priess peiper and seventyfour other men had been hooded and beaten and forced to sign confessions the whole incident had caused quite a stink at the international court of justice and in the us senate since i hadnt yet been beaten it was perhaps a little too early to say that the american military was incapable of learning a lesson in human rights but underneath my hood i wasnt holding my breath congratulations gunther thats the longest anyone wearing a hood in here has ever kept his mouth shut the man was speaking german quite good german too but i was sure it wasnt silverman or earp for the moment i kept my mouth shut and what was there to say yet thats the thing about being interrogated you always know that eventually someone is going to ask you a question ive been reading over the case notes said the voice your case notes the ones made by silverman and earp by the way they wont be joining us for the rest of your questioning they dont approve of the way we do things all the time he was speaking i was tensed for the blow i felt sure was coming one of the other prisoners told me the amis had beaten him for a whole hour in schwabisch hall in an effort to get him to incriminate jochen peiper relax gunther no one is going to hit you so long as you cooperate youll be just fine the hoods for my protection outside of this place it might be awkward for both of us if you ever recognised me you see i work for the central intelligence agency and what about your friend the other man in here does he work for the cia as well youve got good ears gunther ill say that for you said the other ami maybe thats why youve lived so long his german was good too yes im also with the cia congratulations that must make you both very proud no no congratulations to you gunther silverman and earp have cleared you of any criminal wrongdoing this was the first voice speaking now theyre satisfied that you didnt murder anyone at least not by the inflated standard of everyone else whos in here he laughed i know thats not saying much but there it is as far as uncle sam is concerned youre not a war criminal well thats a relief i said if it wasnt for these handcuffs i might punch the air they said you had a smart mouth and theyre not wrong theyre just a little naive perhaps about you i mean over the years said the other man youve caused us quite a few problems do you know that im pleased to hear it in garmischpartenkirchen in vienna as a matter of fact you and i have met before in the military hospital at the stiftskaserne you didnt speak german then i said actually i did but it suited me to let you and that american army officer roy shields think otherwise i remember you like it was yesterday sure you do and lets not forget our mutual friend jonathan jacobs how is he dead i hope no but hes still adamant you tried to kill him apparently he found a box full of anopheles mosquitoes in the back seat of his buick fortunately for him they were all dead of cold pity german winters can be brutal not brutal enough it would seem i said almost ten years after the war and youre still here its a different kind of war now were all on the same side sure i said i know that but if this is how you treat your friends im beginning to see why the russians went over to the other side it wouldnt be sensible to get smart with us gunther not in your position we dont like wise guys i always thought that being wise was a useful part of intelligence doing what youre told when youre told is of greater value in our work you disappoint me thats of no real consequence beside the fact that you dont disappoint us i can feel that i cant feel my hands but i can feel that but i should warn you i might be wearing a hood but ive seen your cards you want something from me and since it cant be my body it must be because you think i possess some information thats important to you and believe me it wont sound the same if youve just kicked my teeth in there are other things we can do to loosen your tongue besides kicking your teeth in sure and i can do fiction as well as nonfiction you wont even see the join look the war is over now im more than willing to tell you whatever you want to know but youll find i respond a lot better to sugarbread than to the whip so how about you take off these hand irons and find me some clothes youve made your point the two cia agents were silent for a minute i imagined one nodding at the other who was probably shaking his head and mouthing a very clear no like a couple of gossipy old women then one of them laughed did you see this guy bring a case full of samples in here a regular fuller brush man isnt he red skelton with a bag over his head still trying to make a sale not buying huh i said too bad maybe i ought to speak to the man of the house i dont think a bag over his head was enough its not too late for a noose maybe we should just hand him over to the ivans and have done with it aw look hes stopped talking now did we get your attention red you dont want brushes i said okay so why dont you tell me what you do want when were ready gunther and not before my friend here could tear a phone book in half but he prefers this as a demonstration of our power over you its a lot less effort and more than just seeing the power of the spirit you can feel it too we wouldnt want you walking out of here and telling all your nazi friends how soft we are we worked it out people were more afraid of the ivans than they were of us so you decided to be more like them i said to play just as rough as they do sure i get it thats right gunther which brings us back to brushes or rather one particular brush a name you mentioned to silverman and earl erich mielke i remember what about him they formed the distinct impression that you knew him weve met so what you must have known him quite well how did you figure that out you were looking out of a window at erhard milch when he was being released from the front gate how far is that sixty seventy feet you must have good eyesight gunther for reading i wear glasses i said you can have them when you sign your confession what confession the one youre going to sign gunther i thought you said that silverman and earp had cleared me they did this is our ohio casualty policy it adds fidelity and surety to whatever you tell us about erich mielke that means we own your ass gunther whats in this confession does it matter he had a point they could say anything they wanted and id have to like it all right ill sign it you took that in your stride i used to be a tall man in a circus besides ive been walking around for a while now and im tired i just want to go home and give my long legs a rest how about you give us a different act like mister memory you havent yet told me why youre so interested in him i said which means i dont know what to leave in or to leave out all of it said the other we want all of it every detail well get to why later you want the whole of leviticus or just mielke lets go back to the beginning genesis then sure darkness was upon the face of berlin for me at any rate and walter ulbricht said let there be some communist thugs and adolf hitler said let there be some nazi thugs too and chancellor bruning said let the cops try to keep these two sides apart and god said why dont you give the cops something a little easier than that to do because the evening and the morning were just one thing after another trouble and the name of the river was the spree and we were fishing bodies out of it every day one day a communist and the next day a nazi and some men looked at that and said that it was good as long as theyre killing each other then thats fine isnt it me i believed in the republic and in the rule of law but a lot of cops were nazis and were not ashamed from that moment on you might say berlin and germany were finished and all the host of them i sighed i forget didnt you know thats our national pastime in germany so remember give me a minute here this is twentythree years ago were talking about now you just dont cough that up like a fur ball an unlucky year for germany there were lets see how many four million unemployed in germany and a banking crisis austrian kreditanstalt had collapsed what yes a couple of weeks before i remember now that was may th we were staring ruin in the face which is all the nazis were waiting for i suppose to take advantage of that yes things were bad but not for mielke his luck was about to take a turn for the better got your notebooks handy like i was your girl friday chapter eleven germany it was a tuesday may rd i know that because it was my birthday you tend to remember your birthday when you have to spend it in tegel prison interviewing one of the men convicted in the eden dance palace trial an sa storm trooper by the name of konrad stief he was just a kid really not much more than twentytwo with a couple of convictions for petty theft and hed joined the sa the previous spring for the last years of the weimar republic his was a fairly typical berlin story on november nd stief and three other chums from sa storm had gone to a dance hall nothing wrong with that except that they werent going there to do the lindy hop and instead of ties and neatly combed hair they took some pistols you see the eden dance palace was frequented by a communist hiking club surprisingly communist hiking clubs used to do what everyone else did in dance halls they danced but not that night anyway when the nazis arrived they went straight upstairs and opened fire several of the happy wanderers were hit and two of them seriously wounded like i say it was a typical berlin story and probably i wouldnt have remembered many of these details except for the fact that the eden dance palace case at berlins central criminal court in old moabit was hardly a typical trial you see the defence attorney a fellow named hans litten called hitler to the stand and crossexamined him about his true relationship with the sa and its violent methods and hitler who was trying to sell himself as herr law and order didnt much care for that or for herr litten who happened to be a jew anyway the four of them were convicted stief was sentenced to two and a half years in tegel and the very next day i drove over there to see if he could shed any light on another case it was something to do with the murder of an sa man the gun stief had used in the eden dance palace was used to murder another sa man and my question was this had the sa man been murdered by communists because he was in the sa or as was beginning to seem more likely had he been murdered by the nazis because he was really a communist sent to spy on storm finally i got a name out of stief and a storm tavern in the old town that was frequented by storm reisigs tavern in hebbel street in the western district of charlottenburg which wasnt so very far from the eden dance palace so when i left tegel i decided to drop in there and take a look but as soon as i arrived outside i saw a group of sa men piling into a truck they were armed and clearly bent on some murderous mission there was no time to phone headquarters and thinking that i might for once prevent a homicide instead of merely investigating one i followed if this sounds brave or foolhardy it wasnt in those days a lot of cops used to carry a bergmann mp in the trunk of the car instead of a pistol the bergmann was a nine mill submachine gun with a thirtytwoshot magazine perfect for sweeping crap off the streets so i followed the gang all the way to felseneck colony in reinickendorfeast a communist party stronghold felseneck colony was just a series of allotments for reds who wanted to grow their own food and what with money being so tight a lot of them needed those vegetables just to live some of the reds actually lived there they had their own guards who were supposed to keep a lookout for nazis only they hadnt been doing their job theyd run away or been tipped off or maybe they were in on the attack who knows but when i got there the nazis were just about to lay down a beating on a young man of about twenty i didnt get a good look at him immediately there were too many storm troopers on him like dogs they probably figured to beat the crap out of the boy and then take him somewhere else and put a bullet in his head before dumping his body i swept the air over their heads with the bergmann marched them back to their truck and told them to beat it because there were too many of them to arrest then in case they decided to come back i told the boy to get in my car and said id drop him somewhere somewhere safer than where we were anyway he thanked me and asked me if i could take him to bulowplatz and that was the first time i got a good look at erich mielke in my car on the way to berlin he was about twentyfour years old five feet six inches tall muscular with lots of wavy hair and a berliner from wedding i think he was also a lifelong communist like his father who was a carpenter or wheelwright and he had two younger sisters and a brother who were also in the communist party or so he told me so its true what they say i said to him that madness runs in families he grinned mielke still had a sense of humour in those days that was before the russians got hold of him about marx and engels and lenin they never did have a sense of humour theres nothing mad about it he said the kpds the largest communist party in the world outside the soviet union youre not a nazi that much is obvious i suppose youre spd thats true i thought so a social fascist you hate us more than you hate the nazis youre right of course the only reason i helped you back there was because i want you to die of shame when you have to tell your lefty pals that it was a cop that supports the spd who took your pot off the stove better still i want you to go and hang yourself like judas iscariot for the betrayal of the movement brought about by a red being indebted to a republican who says im even going to tell them i guess youre right whats another lie on top of all the other lies told by the kpd i shook my head its a low dishonest decade thats ahead of us make no mistake dont think im not grateful polyp said mielke because i am those bastards would have cut my throat for sure they wanted to kill me because im a reporter for the red flag i was doing a story about the workers community at felseneck colony yeah yeah brotherly love and all that crap dont you believe in brotherly love polyp people dont give a damn about brotherly love they just want someone to love who loves them back everything else is bullshit most folk would give the keys to the door of workers paradise for a chance at being loved for themselves not because theyre german or workingclass or aryan or the proletariat nobody really believes in the euphoric dream thats built on this book or that historic vision they believe in a kind word a kiss from a pretty girl a ring on a finger a happy smile thats what people the individuals who make up a people thats what they want to believe sentimental rubbish jeered mielke probably i said thats the problem with all you democrats you talk such unutterable nonsense well theres no time for that kind of claptrap youll be giving that speech in the cemetery if you and your class dont wake up soon hitler and the nazis dont care for your individuals all they care about is power and things will be different when were all taking orders from stalin in some degenerate workers state you sound just like trotsky said mielke is he a social democrat too hes a fascist said mielke meaning hes not a true communist exactly our route back into the centre of berlin took us along bismarck strasse at a tram stop just short of the tiergarten mielke spun around in his street and said that was elisabeth i slowed the car to a halt and mielke waved over a handsomelooking brunette as she leant in the window of the car i caught a distinct whiff of sweat but i didnt hold that against her on a hot day i was feeling kind of warm myself what are you doing here asked mielke i was fitting a dress for a client whos an actress at the schiller theatre thats a job id like i said the brunette shot me a smile im a seamstress elisabeth this is kommissar gunther from the alex are you in any trouble erich i might have been but for the kommissars enormous bravery he chased off some nazis who were planning to give me a kicking can i give you a lift somewhere i asked the brunette changing the subject well you could drop me anywhere near alexanderplatz she said she climbed into the back seat of the car and we set off east again along berliner strasse across the canal and through the park at first i jealously supposed that the brunette was involved with mielke and she was although not in the way i had supposed it seemed that she had been a close friend of mielkes late mother lydia who was also a seamstress and following her death the brunette had tried to help mielkes widowed father to bring up his four children consequently erich mielke seemed to regard elisabeth more like a big sister which suited me just fine that year i was keen on handsome brunettes and there and then i resolved to try to see her again if possible ten minutes later we were approaching bulowplatz which was erich mielkes preferred destination being the location of the kpd headquarters in berlin occupying a whole corner of one of the most heavily policed squares in europe karl liebknecht house was a noisy indication of what all buildings might look like if the lefties ever got into power each of its five storeys decorated with more red flags than a dangerous beach and several bromide slogans in large white capital letters if architecture is frozen music then this was a partly thawed lotte lenya telling us we must die and not to ask why mielke slid down in the passenger seat as we entered the square he said drop me around the corner on linien strasse in case anyone sees me getting out of your car and thinks im a spy relax i said im in plain clothes he laughed you think that will save you when the revolution comes no but it might save you this afternoon fair enough kommissar if i sound ungrateful its because im not used to getting a square deal from a berlin bull pork cheeks is the kind of polyp im used to pork cheeks that swine anlauf i nodded captain paul anlauf was among the communists at least the most hated cop in berlin i pulled up on weydingstrasse and waited for mielke to get out thanks again i wont forget it polyp keep out of trouble yeah you too then he kissed the brunette on the cheek and was gone i lit a cigarette and watched him walk back onto bulowplatz and vanish into a crowd of men dont mind him said the brunette hes really not so bad i dont mind him as much as he seems to mind me i said well she said im grateful for the lift this is fine for me here she was wearing a bright print percale dress with a heartshaped button waistline a lacy collar and cute puff sleeves the print was a riot of red and white fruit and flowers on a solid black background she looked like a market garden at midnight on her head was a little white trilby with a red silk ribbon as if the hat was a cake and it was someones birthday mine perhaps which of course it was the smell of sweat on her body was honest and more provocative to me than some expensive cloying scent underneath the midnight garden was a real woman with skin on every part of her body and organs and glands and all the other things about women i knew i liked but had almost forgotten because it was the kind of day when girls like elisabeth were wearing summer dresses again and i remembered just what a long winter it had been in berlin sleeping in that cave with just my dreams for company come for a drink i said she looked tempted but only for a moment id like to but i should really be getting back to work come on its a warm day and i need a beer theres nothing like spending a couple of hours in the cement to give a man a thirst especially when its his birthday you wouldnt want me to drink alone on my birthday would you no if it really is your birthday if i show my identity card will you come all right so i did and she came immediately next to the police station on bulowplatz there was a bar called the braustubl and leaving my car where it was we went in there the place was full of communists of course but i wasnt thinking about them or about erich mielke although for a while elisabeth kept on talking about him as if i was interested which i wasnt but i liked watching her red lips open and close to show off her white teeth i was especially taken with the sound of her laughter as she seemed to like my jokes and that was really all that mattered because when we parted she agreed to see me again when shed gone i bought some cigarettes and heading back to my car i caught the eye of one of the uniformed cops on the square and stopped to chat with him in the sunshine bauer that was his name sergeant adolf bauer our chat was the usual splash on the wall the trial of charlie urban for a murder at the mercedes theatre brunings emergency decrees hitlers evidence at the court in moabit bauer was a good bull and all the time we were speaking i noticed how he had his eye on a car that was parked in front of karl liebknecht house as if he recognised it or the man waiting patiently in the drivers seat then we were both watching three other men come out of the braustubl and get into the car with this other fellow and one of the men was erich mielke hullo said bauer there goes trouble i know the kid i said the one with the quiff but i dont know the others the one driving is max thunert said bauer hes a lowranking kpd thug one of the others was heinz neumann hes in the reichstag although he doesnt limit causing trouble to when hes there i didnt recognise the other fellow i was just in that bar i said and i didnt see any of them theres a private room upstairs that they use said bauer its my opinion that they keep some weapons there just in case we decide to search karl liebknecht house also if the sa mounts a demo here they wont be expecting anything from the top floor of that bar have you told the hussar the hussar was a uniformed sergeant called max willig who was frequently about bulowplatz and almost as unpopular as captain anlauf ive told him didnt he believe you he did but judge bode didnt when we went to get a warrant said we need more evidence than an itch on the end of my nose think theyre planning something theyre always planning something theyre communists arent they criminals most of them i dont like criminals who break the law i said what other kind are there the kind that make the law its the hindenburgs and schleichers of this world who are doing more to screw the republic than the commies and the nazis put together you got that right my friend i might never have heard the name of erich mielke again but for two things one was that i saw a lot more of elisabeth and now and again shed say that shed seen him or one of his sisters and then there were the events of august th theres not a policeman from weimar berlin who doesnt remember august th the way americans remember the maine chapter twelve germany to say the least it had been a difficult summer in spite of some new laws that made political violence a capital crime nazis were killing communists at the rate of almost two to one following the march elections in which the nazis got more than three times as many votes as the kpd the communists became increasingly violent probably out of desperation then in early august there was a call for an election in the prussian parliament most likely this was something to do with the world economic crisis after all this was and we were in the middle of the great depression almost half the banks had failed in america and in germany we were still trying to pay for the war with almost six million men out of work and you can blame the french with their carthaginian peace for a lot of that prussian elections were always a barometer for the rest of germany and usually badtempered affairs for that you can blame the prussian character jedem das seine is a prussians motto literally it means to each his own but more figuratively it also means everyone gets what he deserves which is why they put it above the gates at buchenwald concentration camp and probably why given the peculiar character of the prussian parliament we got what we deserved when on the ninth of august the results were announced and it turned out that not enough people had voted to force an election at a national level with no quorum for a vote tempers all over berlin got even worse but especially on bulowplatz outside karl liebknecht house figuring that some sort of dirty deal had been done between the nazis and the prussian administration thousands of communists gathered there possibly they were correct about a deal but things turned ugly when the riot police showed up and started cracking red heads like eggs berlin cops were always good at making omelettes probably the rain didnt help either it had been warm and dry for several weeks but that day it rained heavily and berlin cops never did care to get wet something to do with all that leather on the shako helmets they wore there was a cover you were supposed to put on it when the weather was bad but no one ever remembered them which meant you had to spend ages cleaning and polishing the shako afterwards if there was one thing guaranteed to piss off a berlin bull it was getting his hat wet i guess the reds decided theyd had enough then again they were always shouting about police dictatorship even when the police were behaving with exemplary fairness the local police had been threatened before but this was different the talk was about killing policemen about eight oclock that evening shots were fired and a fullscale gun battle between police and the kpd kicked off in a big way the biggest wed seen since the uprising news started to come in to police headquarters on berlin alexanderplatz at around nine oclock that several officers including two police captains had been shot and killed we were already investigating the june murder of another cop id helped to carry his coffin by the time i and some other detectives reached bulowplatz most of the crowds had left but the gunfight was still very much in progress the communists were on the rooftops of several buildings and cops with searchlights were returning fire while at the same time they were searching apartment houses in the area for weapons and suspects a hundred people were arrested maybe more while the battle continued this meant that we couldnt get near the bodies and for several hours we traded shots with the reds one time a rifle bullet clipped off a piece of brickwork just above my head and more in anger than the hope of hitting anything i let fly with the bergmann until the magazine was empty it was one in the morning before we got to the stricken police officers who were lying in the doorway of the babylon movie theatre by which time one communist had been shot dead and seventeen others wounded of the three policemen in the doorway two were dead the third sergeant willig the hussar was seriously wounded hed been shot in the stomach and in the arm and his blue grey tunic was purple with blood not all of it his own we were set up he gasped as we sat with him and waited for the ambulance they werent on the rooftops the ones who got us the bastards were hiding in a doorway and shot us from behind as we walked past the officer in charge detective police counsellor reinhold heller told willig to save his breath but the sergeant was the kind who couldnt do anything until hed made his report there were two of them handguns automatics shot my pistol at them a full clip couldnt say if i hit either of them or not young they were tearaways twenty or so laughed when they saw the two captains hit the ground then they went into the theatre he tried a smile must have been garbo fans never much liked her myself the ambulance men arrived with a stretcher and carried him away leaving us with the two bodies gunther said heller go and speak to the theatre manager find out if anyone saw something more than just the movie heller was a jew but i didnt have a problem with that not like some he was bernard weiss the head of kripos golden boy which would have been fine but for the fact that weiss was also a jew i thought heller was good police and that was all that mattered as far as i was concerned of course the nazis thought differently the movie was mata hari with garbo in the title role and ramon novarro as the young russian officer who falls in love with her i hadnt seen it myself but the movie was doing well in berlin garbo gets shot by the treacherous french and with a plot like that it could hardly fail with germans the theatre manager was waiting in the lobby he was swarthy and worried looking with a moustache like a midgets eyebrow and to that extent at least rather resembled ramon novarro but it was probably just as well the blonde from the box office didnt look like garbo at least not like the garbo on the lobbycard her hair was frightfullooking like struwwelpeter everything around us was red red carpet red walls red ceiling red chairs and red curtains on the auditorium doors given the politics of the area it all seemed appropriate the blonde was tearful the manager merely nervous he kept adjusting his cufflinks as he explained loudly as if he was a character in a play what hed seen and heard mata hari had just finished seducing the russian general shubin he said when we heard the first shots that would have been at about ten past eight how many shots a volley he said six or seven small arms pistols i was in the war see i know the difference between a pistol shot and a rifle shot i stuck my head through the box office door and saw fraulein wiegand here on the floor at first i thought there had been a robbery that shed been held up but then there was a second volley and several of the bullets hit the cash window two men ran through the lobby and into the auditorium without paying and since they were both holding pistols i wasnt about to insist that they buy tickets i cant say that i got a very good look at them because i was scared then there were more shots outside rifle shots i think and people started running in here to take cover by now the projectionist had stopped the movie and switched on the lights and the people in the auditorium were going through the exit door onto hirtenstrasse it was plain from the noise and the crowd that the movie couldnt continue and before one of your colleagues came in here to tell me to stay inside almost everyone had left the auditorium through the back door including the two men with guns he left his cufflinks alone for a moment and rubbed his brow furiously theyre dead arent they those two police officers i nodded mmm hmm thats bad thats too bad how about you fraulein i said the two with guns did you get a good look at them she shook her head and pressed a sodden handkerchief to her red nose its been a great shock to fraulein wiegand said the manager its been a great shock to us all sir i went into the auditorium walked down the centre aisle toward the exit and pushed open the door now i was on a small red staircase i tapdanced my way down to another door and then out onto hirtenstrasse just as an underground train passed beneath my feet shaking the whole area as if it hadnt been shaken up enough already it was dark and there wasnt much to see in the yellow gaslight a few discarded red flags a couple of protest placards and maybe a murder weapon if i looked hard enough with so many cops around it didnt seem likely that the killers would have risked holding on to their guns for very long back in the movie theatre doorway they were establishing a crime scene gestalt which is to say they were hoping that the whole could be bigger than the sum of its parts captain anlauf had been shot twice in the neck and clearly had bled to death he was about forty heavyset with a full face that had helped earn the seventh precinct commander his pig cheeks nickname his weapon was still in his holster its too bad said one of the other detectives his wife died three weeks ago what did she die of i heard myself ask a kidney ailment said heller this leaves three daughters orphaned someones going to have to tell them said someone ill do that the man who spoke was in uniform and everyone straightened up when we realised it was the commander of the berlin schupo magnus heimannsberg you can leave that to me thank you sir said heller whos the other man i dont recognise him captain lenck sir heimannsberg leaned down to take a closer look franz lenck what the hell was he doing here this kind of police work wasnt his sort of thing at all every available man in uniform was summoned here heller said anyone know if he was married yes said heimannsberg no children though thats something i suppose look reinhard ill tell her too the widow lenck was also about forty his face was leaner than anlauf s with deep smile lines that were no longer being used a pincenez was still on his face just about and the shako remained on his head with the strap tight under his chin he had been shot in the back and like anlauf his weapon was holstered a fact that heimannsberg now remarked upon they didnt even have a chance to get their weapons out he said bitterly nodding at a luger by his boot he added i assume this is sergeant willigs gun he got off a whole clip sir said heller before they ran in here hit anything heller looked at me i dont think so sir i said mind you its a little hard to tell in there everythings red carpet walls curtains you name it hard to see any bloodstains they ran out the rear exit on hirtenstrasse sir id like a couple of men with torches to help me search the length of the street people have chucked away red flags and placards its possible they might have thrown the guns too heller nodded dont worry lads said heimannsberg who having started his career as an ordinary patrolman was enormously popular with everyone in the police well catch the bastards who did this a few minutes later i was walking along hirtenstrasse with a couple of uniformed men as we went further west towards mulack strasse and the territory of the always true a notorious berlin gang they started to get nervous we stopped next to fritz hempel the tobacconists it was closed of course i pointed my torch one way and then the other the two schupomen came towards me relaxing a little as in the distance a police armoured car pulled up on the corner this close to mulack strasse and the always true they must have figured they could hold on to their guns said one of the bulls maybe i started to retrace my steps along hirtenstrasse still searching the ground until my eyes caught sight of a drain cover in the gutter it was a simple castiron grate but someone had lifted it and recently the dirt was missing from two of the bars where someone might have grasped it one of the schupo men pulled it up while i was removing my jacket and then my shirt and then inspecting the cobblestones around the open drain i decided to remove my trousers as well he was a dancer at the hallerrevue before he was police said one of the cops folding my clothes over his arm versatile isnt he if heimannsberg were here i said hed make you do it so shut up id put my whole fucking head down that drain if i thought itd find the jew bastard who killed captain anlauf i lay down next to the drain and plunged my arm into thick black water right up to the shoulder what makes you think it was a jew i asked everyone knows that the marxists and the jews are one and the same said the schupo man i wouldnt repeat that in front of counsellor heller if i were you this town is sick with jews said the schupo man dont mind him sir said the other cop anyone with a hat and a big nose is a jew in his book see if you can find any war reparations while youre down there funny i said if i wasnt up to my shoulder in stagnant water i might fucking laugh now put the cork back in i felt a hard metallic object and fished out a pistol with a long barrel i handed it to the cop who wasnt holding my clothes luger is it he said wiping some of the filth off the gun looks like an artillerycorps version thatll put an extra keyhole in your door i kept on searching the bottom of the drain no commies down here i said just this i brought up the other gun an automatic with a curious irregular shape as if someone had tried to break the slide from the muzzle we carried the two weapons over to a street water pump and washed some of the filth away the smaller automatic was a dreyse i washed my arm and put my clothes back on and took the two guns back to the seventh street precinct station on bulowplatz back in the detectives room heller hailed my arrival with a verbal pat on the back well done gunther he said thanks sir meanwhile other cops were already gathering boxes of photofiles to take over to the state hospital for sergeant willig to look at when he came out of surgery and after a while i said you know thats going to take a while i mean before hes conscious again by then the killers will be out of the city maybe on their way to moscow got a better idea i might look sir instead of showing sergeant willig a picture of every red whos ever been arrested in this city lets just pull a few like who there are hundreds of these bastards the chances are the attack was orchestrated from kl house i said so how about we pull the records of just seventysix reds because thats how many reds were arrested when we raided kl last january lets stick to those faces for now yes youre right agreed heller he snatched up the telephone get me the state hospital he pointed at another detective get on to ia find out who was on that raid and tell the records boys in ed to find the arrest files and to meet us at the hospital twenty minutes later we were on our way to the state hospital in friedrichshain they were just wheeling willig into the operating theatre when we arrived bearing the kl house arrest files the wounded man had already received an injection but against the advice of the doctors who were anxious to operate as quickly as possible willig understood immediately the urgency of what was being asked of him and it took the sergeant no time at all to pick out one of his attackers him for sure he croaked that one pulled the trigger on captain anlauf for sure erich ziemer said heller and handed me the charge sheet the other one was about the same age and build and colouring as this bastard they might even have been brothers they looked so alike but hes not here im certain of it all right said heller he spoke some words of encouragement to the sergeant before his doctors took the patient away i recognise this man ziemer i said back in may i saw ziemer in a car with three other men they were outside kl house and according to sergeant adolf bauer who was on patrol in bulowplatz one of those others was heinz neumann the reichstag deputy i nodded and the other two one of them i dont know perhaps bauer will remember it yes perhaps he paused expectantly and the red that you do know i told him about the day i had saved the life of erich mielke from a troop of sa intent on killing him he was the fourth man in that car and its true what sergeant willig says he looks a lot like erich ziemer so you believe that were looking for two erichs yes i nodded again gunther id hate to be known around the alex as the man who saved the life of a cop killer i hadnt really thought about that sir then perhaps you should and from this moment on my advice to you is this that you make no further mention of exactly how you come to be acquainted with this erich mielke until he is safely in custody especially now this is the kind of story the nazis love to use to beat those of us in the police force who still count ourselves as democrats is it not yes sir we drove west and north of the ring to biesenthaler strasse which was the address on erich ziemers charge sheet it was a drearylooking building off christiana strasse and within snorting distance of the lowen brewery and the distinctive smell of hops that was always in the air over that part of berlin ziemer had rented a big gloomy room in a big gloomy house that was owned by an old man with a face like the turin shroud he was unhappy to be roused from his bed at such an early hour but hardly surprised that we were asking questions about his tenant who was not in his room and it seemed was unlikely to be returning to it but we asked to see the room anyway up against the window was a dilapidated leather sofa that was the size and colour of a slumbering hippo on the dampish wall was a print of alexander von humboldt with a botanical specimen on an open book the landlord herr karpf scratched his beard and shrugged and told us that ziemer had disappeared like fog the previous day owing three weeks rent taking his belongings not to mention a silver and ivory tankard worth several hundred marks it was difficult to imagine herr karpf owning anything valuable but we promised to do our best to recover it there was a police call box on oskar platz near the hospital and from there we telephoned the alex where another officer had been looking for a crime sheet and an address for erich mielke but so far without success thats that then said heller no i said theres one more chance drive south to the electricity works on volta strasse hellers car was a neat little creamcoloured dkw cabriolet with a small twocylinder cc engine but it had front wheel drive and held on to the corners like a welded bracket so that we were there in no time at all on brunnen strasse opposite volta strasse i told him to turn left on lortzing strasse and pull up give me ten minutes i said and stepping over the dkws little door i walked quickly in the direction of a loftylooking apartment building that was all red and yellow brick with windowbox balconies and a mansard roof that resembled a small moroccan fortress elisabeths shapeless landlady frau bayer was only a little surprised to see me at this early hour as i had got into the habit of visiting the dressmaker whenever i came off duty she knew i was a policeman which was normally enough to silence her grumbling at being got out of bed most berliners were always respectful of the law except when they were communists or nazis and when it wasnt enough to silence her grumbling i slipped a few marks into her dressinggown pocket by way of compensation the apartment was a warren of shabby rooms full of old cherrywood furniture chinese screens and tasselled lampshades as always i sat in the living room and waited for frau bayer to fetch her lodger and as always when she saw me elisabeth smiled a sleepy but happy smile and took me by the hand to lead me to her room where a proper welcome awaited me only this time i stayed put on the living room sofa whats the matter she said is something wrong its erich i said hes in trouble what kind of trouble serious trouble two policemen were shot and killed last night and you think erich might have something to do with it it looks that way are you sure yes look elisabeth i dont have much time his best chance is if i find him before anyone else does i can tell him what to say and more importantly what not to say do you see she nodded and tried to stifle a yawn so what do you want from me an address you mean you want me to betray him dont you thats one way of looking at it yes i cant deny that but another way is this that perhaps i can persuade him to make a clean breast of it which is the only thing that can save his life now they wouldnt behead him would they for killing a policeman yes i think they would one of the cops who was killed was a widower with three daughters who are now orphaned the republic would have no choice but to make an example of him or else risk courting a storm of criticism in the newspapers the nazis would just love that but if i am the arresting officer i might be able to talk him into naming some names if others in the kpd put him up to it then he has to say so hes young and impressionable and that will help his case she pulled a face dont ask me to turn him in bernie ive known that boy for half his life i helped bring him up i am asking it i give you my word i will do what i said and that i will speak up for him in court all im asking for is an address elisabeth she sat down in a chair and clasped her hands tightly and closed her eyes almost as if she was uttering a silent prayer perhaps she did i knew something like this would happen she said thats why ive never ever told him that you and i have been seeing each other because he would have been cross and im beginning to understand why i wont tell him that it was you who gave me an address if thats what youre worried about thats not what im worried about she whispered what then she stood up abruptly im worried about erich of course she said loudly im worried about whats going to happen to him i nodded look forget it well have to find him some other way sorry i bothered you he lives with his father emil she said dully stettiner strasse number twentyfive the top flat thanks i waited for her to say something else and when she didnt i knelt down in front of her and tried to take her hand to give it a comforting squeeze but she pulled it away at the same time she avoided my eye as if it had been hanging out of its socket just go she said go and do your duty it was almost dawn on the street outside elisabeths apartment building but i felt that something important had happened between us that something had changed perhaps for ever i stepped into hellers car and told him the address from my expression i guess he knew better than to ask how i had come by it we sped north up swinemunder strasse onto bellermann strasse and then christiana strasse twentyfive stettiner strasse was a grey tenement building around a central courtyard that would probably have collapsed in on itself but for several large support timbers although it could just as easily have been moss or mould a green rug was hanging out of an open window on one of the upper floors and it was the only spot of colour in that ghastly sarcophagus of raw brick and loose cobblestones even though this was fast becoming a bright summers morning no sun ever reached the lower levels of the tenements on stettiner strasse nosferatu could have spent the whole day quite comfortably in the twilight world of a ground floor stettiner strasse apartment we pulled on a bell for several minutes before a greyhaired head appeared out of a dirty window yes police said heller open up whats the matter as if you dont know i said open up or well kick the door in all right the head disappeared a minute or so later we heard the door open and we ran upstairs as if we actually believed there was a chance we might still apprehend erich mielke in truth neither of us thought there was much hope of that happening not in gesundbrunnen it was the kind of area where children were taught how to stay one step ahead of the cops before they learned long division at the top of the stairs a man wearing trousers and a pyjama jacket admitted us to a little flat that was a shrine to the class struggle every wall was hung with kpd posters notices of strikes and demonstrations and cheap portraits of rosa luxemburg karl liebknecht marx and lenin unlike any of them the man standing in front of us at least looked like a worker he was around fifty stocky and short with a bull neck a receding hairline and an advancing waist he stared at us suspiciously with small closeset eyes that were like diacritic marks inside a nought short of wearing a towel and a silk dressing gown he couldnt have looked any more rough and pugnacious so what does the berlin polenta want with me were looking for a herr erich mielke said heller his punctiliousness was typical you didnt get to be a counsellor in the berlin police without paying attention to detail especially when you were also a jew that was probably the exlawyer in him it was also the part of heller i didnt care for the punctilious lawyer the stocky little man in the pyjama jacket didnt seem to like it either hes not here he said barely concealing a smirk of pleasure and who are you his father when did you last see your son a few days ago so whats he supposed to have done hit a policeman no said heller on this occasion it seems that hes shot and killed at least one thats too bad but the mans tone seemed to suggest he didnt think that it was too bad at all by now the resemblance between father and son was all too obvious to me and i turned and walked into the kitchen just in case the temptation to hit him grew too strong you wont find him in there either i put my hand on the gas ring it was still warm a pile of halfsmoked cigarettes lay in an ashtray as if put there by someone who was feeling nervous about something no one in gesundbrunnen would have wasted tobacco like that i pictured a man sitting in a chair by the window a man whod been trying to occupy his mind with a book perhaps while he waited for a car to come and take him and ziemer to a kpd safehouse i picked up the book that lay on the kitchen table it was all quiet on the western front do you know where your son might be now asked heller i havent a clue frankly he could be anywhere never tells me anything about where hes been or where hes going well you know what young men are like i came back into the room and stood behind him you kpd he looked over his shoulder and smiled its not illegal is it yet perhaps you were in bulowplatz yourself last night while i spoke i turned the pages of the book he shook his head me no i was here all night are you sure after all there were several hundred of your comrades there including your son maybe as many as a thousand surely you wouldnt have missed something as funpacked as that no he said firmly i stayed at home i always stay at home on a sunday night are you religious i said you dont look religious on account of the fact that i have to go to work in he nodded at the little wooden clock on the tiled mantelpiece yes in just two hours from now any witnesses that you were here all night the geislers next door is this your book yes good isnt it i wouldnt have thought it was your taste he said oh whys that i hear the nazis want to ban it maybe they do but im not a nazi and neither is the police counsellor here all cops are nazis in my book yes but this isnt it i mean your book i turned the page and removed the ring bahn ticket that was marking the readers place this ticket says youre lying what do you mean this ticket is for gesundbrunnen station just a few minutes walk from here it was bought at schonhauser tor at eight twenty last night which is about ten minutes after two policemen were murdered on bulowplatz thats less than a hundred metres from the station at schonhauser tor which puts the owner of this book in the thick of it im not saying anything herr mielke said heller youre in enough trouble as it is without putting the brakes on your mouth you wont catch him he said defiantly not now if i know my erich hes already halfway to moscow not nearly halfway i said and not moscow either ill bet not if you say so that means it has to be leningrad which in itself means hes probably travelling by boat so the chances are hell be heading to one of two german ports hamburg or rostock rostocks nearer so hell probably figure to second guess us and head for hamburg which is what two hundred and fifty kilometres they might be there by now if they left before midnight my guess is that erichs probably on the gras brook or sandtor dock at this very moment sneaking onto a russian freighter and boasting about how he shot a fascist policeman in the back theyll probably give the little coward an order of lenin for bravery some of this must have touched a nerve in mielkes changeling body one minute his beerswilling trolls face was in ugly repose the next the jaw had advanced belligerently and growling abuse he took a swing at me fortunately i was halfexpecting it and i was already leaning back when it connected but it still felt like i got hit by a sandbag feeling sick i sat down hard on a soft chair for a moment i had a new way of seeing the world but it had nothing to do with berlins avantgarde mielke senior was grinning now his mouth a gaptoothed moongnawing rictus his big trenchmace of a fist already heading hellers way and when its orbit around mielkes body was complete it crashed into the surface of hellers skull like an asteroid sending the police counsellor sprawling onto the floor where he groaned and lay still i got to my feet again im going to enjoy this you ugly commie bastard mielke senior turned just in time to meet my fist coming the other way the blow rocked the big head on his meaty shoulders like a sudden bad smell in his nostrils and as he took a step backwards i hit him again with a right that descended on the side of his head like a borotra first service that lifted his legs off the ground like a planes undercarriage and for a split second he actually seemed to fly through the air before landing on his knees as he rolled onto his side i twisted one arm behind him then the other and managed to hold them long enough for a groggylooking heller to get the irons on his wrists then i stood up and kicked him hard because i wasnt able to kick his son and because i was wishing i hadnt saved the young mans neck i might have kicked him again but heller stopped me and but for the fact that he was a counsellor and i was still feeling sick i might have kicked him too gunther he yelled thats enough he let out a gasp and leaned heavily against a wall while he tried to recover all of his wits i shifted my jaw my head felt larger on one side than the other and there was something singing in my ears only it wasnt a kettle with all due respect sir i said its not nearly enough and then i kicked mielke again before i staggered out of the apartment and onto the landing and a minute or two later puked over the banister chapter thirteen germany i stopped talking my throat felt tight but not as tight as the handcuffs is that all there is demanded one of the two amis theres more i said a lot more but i cant feel my hands and i need to use the lavatory you saw erich mielke again several times the last time was when i was a pow in russia you see mielke was no no lets not get ahead of ourselves we want everything in the correct order of appearance thats the german way isnt it if you say so all right then you went to his home you had a police witness you found the murder weapons in the drain i take it those were the murder weapons a longbarrelled luger and a dreyse that was the standard police automatic back then yes they were the murder weapons look i really do need a rest i cant feel my hands yes you said that already im not asking for apple pie and ice cream just a pair of handcuffs off thats fair isnt it after what you just told us about kicking mielkes father when he was handcuffed and lying on the floor that wasnt very fair of you gunther he had it ordered on room service you hit a cop you get trouble i didnt hit you did i not yet with these hands i couldnt hit my own knees i yawned inside the hood no really thats it ive had enough of this now that i know what you want that makes it easier for me to keep my peep regardless of the legalities or illegalities of this situation you are in a place where there is no law we are the law you want to piss yourself then go ahead and make yourself comfortable then see what happens to you im beginning to understand i sure hope so for your sake you enjoy playing gestapo its a little bit of a kick for you doing it their way isnt it secretly you probably admire them and the way they went about extracting teeth and information they came close to me now raising their voices beyond what was comfortable to hear fuck you gunther you hurt our feelings with that remark about the gestapo i take it back youre much worse than the gestapo they didnt pretend they were defending the free world its your hypocrisy thats offensive not your brutality youre the worst kind of fascists the kind that think theyre liberals one of them started knocking at my head with the knuckle on his finger it wasnt painful so much as annoying when are you going to get it into that fucking square head of yours youre right i still dont understand why youre doing this when im perfectly willing to cooperate youre not meant to understand when are you going to understand that asshole we want more than your willingness to cooperate that implies you have some choice in the matter when you dont its up to us to assess your level of cooperation not you we want to know that when youre telling us the truth theres absolutely no question it could ever be anything else the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth which means that well decide when you need a rest when you need to go to the lavatory when you see the light of day when you breathe and when you fart so tell us some more about erich mielke did he go to hamburg or rostock with mielke senior safely in custody myself and another detective caught the first train to hamburg why you why not someone else why were you so central to the investigation why not leave it to the hamburg police i should have thought that was obvious or maybe you just werent listening yank id met erich mielke i knew what he looked like remember besides i had a personal stake in seeing him arrested i saved his life of course the hamburg police were alerted to pick up ziemer and mielke the trouble was someone inside the alex had tipped them off and by the time kestner and i reached hamburg kestner yes he was with the political police a detective sergeant we were old friends kestner and i later on when the nazis won the election of march he joined the party lots of people did the march violets or march fallen we called them anyway that was when we stopped being friends he and i later on i learned that mielke and ziemer had been taken to antwerp by agents of the comintern there they were given false passports and posing as crew members they were put on a ship to leningrad from there they were taken to moscow for training in the ogpu stalins secret police so there were communists as well as nazis in the berlin police yes eldor borck a retired police major i was friendly with he estimated that as many as ten per cent of the berlin police sympathised with the bolsheviks but there were never the red schupo cells that the nazis claimed existed most police were natural conservatives instinctive fascists rather than ideological ones anyway ziemer and mielke spent the next five years in russia how do you know that ill come to that of course even though we didnt have the perpetrators of the murders of anlauf and lenck in custody the nazis were not about to allow a little fact like that to stop them from making an example of people there was a lot of propaganda value in making arrests and securing convictions of other commies of course of other commies and it cant be denied that ziemer and mielke did not act alone indeed there was a strong case for believing that the whole riot on bulowplatz had been engineered for the purpose of luring anlauf and sergeant willig into a trap as i said before those two were really hated by the communists lenck was an accident more or less in the wrong place at the wrong time soon after i left the police to go and work at the adlon hotel an arrest was made fellow called max thunert very probably they put a bag over his head and persuaded him to name names and name names he did fifteen men went to trial in june among them several prominent communists who knows maybe some of them had put mielke and ziemer up to the killing after all four received a death sentence eleven were sent to a concentration camp but it was another two years before three of those death sentences were actually carried out that was typical of the nazis to keep a man waiting for years before they executed him i expect the nazis could still teach you ami bastards something about cruelty it was in all the newspapers of course may i cant recall their names the ones who went to the falling axe but i often wondered how mielke and ziemer safe in moscow felt about it how much they were told oddly enough it was the same month may when stalin decided that some of the many german and italian communists whod fled to moscow after hitler and mussolini came to power could no longer be trusted european communism was always too diverse for stalins taste too many factions too many trotskyites i suspect that mielke and ziemer were more worried about what might happen to them than what was already happening to old comrades like max matern yes i remember now he was one who went to the guillotine most of the german communists in moscow were lodged at a comintern hotel called the hotel lux there was a purge and some of the more prominent german communists kippenberger neumann ironically the very men whod ordered the murders of anlauf and lenck they were all shot kippenbergers wife was packed off to a soviet labour camp and never seen again neumanns wife also went to a labour camp but i think she survived at least she did until stalins nonaggression pact with hitler in at which point she was handed over to the gestapo ive no idea what happened to her after that youre very well informed how come you know so much about this gunther mielke the whole damned crew of german commies for a while he was my beer i said how do you say it my pigeon up to theres not much i dont know about erich mielke and then and then i hadnt really given him a thought until the lawyer from the office of the chief counsel used the name to be honest i wish id never heard it but you did so here you are the last time i saw him he was he was working for the ogpu after it became the mvd that was seven years ago have you heard of the east german secretariat for state security no some germans already call it the stasi your friend erich is the deputy chief of state security a secret policeman and probably one of the three most important men in the east german security apparatus if not the whole country hes survived stalin beria he even survived the downfall of wilhelm zaisser after last years workers uprising in berlin survival is your friend mielkes specialty i think im going to faint i said the allied control commission made an attempt to arrest him in february but the russians were never going to let that happen i had stopped listening i couldnt be bothered to pay attention only that wasnt quite right there wasnt anything to listen to unless you counted the singing in my ears from when erich mielkes father had hit me twentythree years ago only that wasnt it either something cold and heavy was lying on the side of my head and it was a moment or two before i realised it was the floor the numbness in my hands was spreading through my whole body like embalming fluid the hood over my head grew thicker and tightened as if there had been a hangmans noose around my neck it was difficult to breathe but i didnt care not any more i opened the bag and climbed inside then someone threw the bag off a bridge i felt myself drop through the air for twentythree years by the time i landed i had forgotten who and what and where i was chapter fourteen germany i felt myself being carried then i fainted once more when i came to again i was lying facedown on a bed and they had removed the manacles from one of my wrists and i could almost feel my hands again then they lifted me up and let me stand for a minute i was thirsty but i didnt ask for water i just stood there waiting to be shouted at or struck on the head so that i flinched a little when i felt a blanket on my shoulders and a chair behind my bare legs and as i sat down again a hand held on to the bag pulling it off my head i found myself in a larger more comfortably appointed cell than my own there was a table with a little sill around the edge that might have stopped a pencil from rolling onto the floor and not much else and on it a small potted plant that was dead on the wall above me was a mark where a picture had been hanging and in front of the double window which was barred was a washstand with a jug and a porcelain washbasin there were two men in that room with me and neither one of them looked much like a torturer they were wearing doublebreasted suits and silk ties one of them had a pair of hornrimmed glasses on his nose and the other had a cherrywood pipe clamped unlit between his teeth the one wearing the pipe in his face picked up the water jug and poured some water into a dustylooking glass and handed it to me i wanted to throw the water in his face but instead i tossed it down my throat the one with the glasses lit a cigarette and threaded it between my lips i sucked at the smoke like mothers milk was it something i said i grinned feebly out of the firstfloor window was a view of the garden and the conical roof of a little white tower in the prison wall as far as i knew it wasnt a view that any red jacket in landsberg was accustomed to seeing blinking against the sun streaming in through the window and the smoke streaming into my eye i rubbed my chin wearily and took the cigarette from my mouth maybe said the man with the pipe there was a moustache on his upper lip that matched the size and shape of his little blue bow tie he had more chin than would have made him handsome and while it wasnt exactly charles v there were some myself included who would have grown a short beard on it to make it seem smaller perhaps but in my eyes leprosy would have looked a lot better on him the door opened no keys were required to open this cell the door just swung open and a guard came in carrying some clothes followed by another guard bearing a tray with coffee and a hot meal i didnt much like the clothes since these were the ones id been wearing the previous day but the coffee and the food smelled like theyd been prepared in kempinskis i started to eat before they changed their minds when youre hungry clothes dont seem that important i didnt use the knife and fork because i couldnt yet hold them properly so i ate with my fingers wiping them on my thighs and backside i certainly wasnt about to worry about my table manners immediately i started to feel better its amazing how good even an american cup of coffee can taste when youre hungry from now on said the man with the pipe this is your cell number seven recognise that number the other ami the one wearing the glasses had short grey hair and looked like any college professor the legs of the glasses were too short for his head and the hooks stood off his ears so that they looked like two small umbrellas maybe the glasses were too small for his face or maybe hed borrowed them or maybe his head was abnormally large to accommodate all the abnormally unpleasant thoughts most of them about me that were swelling it i shrugged my mind was a blank of course you do its the fuhrers cell where youre eating your food is where he wrote his book and i dont know which i find more disgusting the thought of him writing down his poisonous thoughts or you eating with your fingers ill certainly try not to let that thought spoil my appetite by all accounts hitler had an easy time here in landsberg i guess you werent working here back then tell me gunther did you ever read it hitlers book yes i prefer ayn rand but only just do you like ayn rand no i think hitler would have liked her though he wanted to be an architect too of course only he couldnt afford the paper and the pencils not to mention the education plus he didnt have a large enough ego and i think youve got to be pretty tough to make it in that world youre pretty tough yourself gunther said the one with the glasses me no how many tough guys do you have breakfast with when theyre naked not many besides its easy to look tough when youre wearing a bag over your head even if it does get you wondering what it might be like to have nothing under your feet any time you want to find out for sure we can help you sure you can take klingelhofers place for the rehearsal we were here when they executed those five war criminals in june fiftyone ill bet youve got an interesting scrapbook they died quite calmly like they were resigned to their fate which was kind of ironic when you remember thats what they said about all those jews they murdered i shrugged and pushed away my empty breakfast tray no man wants to die i said but sometimes it just seems worse to go on living oh i think they wanted to go on living all right especially the ones who applied for clemency which was all of them i read some of the letters that mccloy received they were all predictably selfserving ah well i said thats the difference between me and them its just impossible for me to be selfserving you see i fired my own self a long time ago these days i try to manage on my own you say that like you dont want to go on living either gunther and you say that like i should be impressed with your hospitality thats the trouble with you amis you kick the shit out of people and then expect them to join in a couple of verses of the starspangled banner we dont expect you to sing gunther said the ami with the pipe was he ever going to light it just to go on talking the way youve been talking until now he tossed a packet of cigarettes onto the table where hitler had written his best selling book by the way what happened to that sergeant who zeimer and mielke shot in the stomach willig i lit a cigarette and remembered that he had lived three months after the shooting he had made lieutenant i forget you joined kripo again in september is that right i didnt exactly join i said i was ordered back in by general heydrich to solve a series of murders in berlin after the case was solved i stayed on again thats what heydrich wanted theres only one thing you have to understand about heydrich he almost always got what he wanted and he wanted you i had a certain reputation for getting the job done he admired that so you stayed on i tried to get out of kripo for good but heydrich made that more or less impossible tell us about that about what you were doing for heydrich kripo was part of sipo the state security police i was promoted to oberkommissar a chief inspector most of the crime by then was politicised but men carried on murdering their wives and professional criminals went about their business as normal i conducted several investigations during that period but in reality the nazis cared very little about reducing crime in the usual timehonoured way and most police could hardly be bothered to do what police do this was because the nazis preferred to reduce crime by declaring annual amnesties which meant that most crimes never went to court at all all the nazis cared about was being able to say that the crime figures were down in fact crime real crime actually increased under the nazis theft murder juvenile delinquency it all got worse so i carried on as normal at the alex i made arrests prepared a case handed the papers over to the ministry of justice and in time the case was struck down or dropped and the accused walked free one day in september not long after war was declared and sipo became part of the rsha i went to see general heydrich at his office in prinz albrechtstrasse i told him i was wasting my time and asked his permission to put in my papers he listened patiently but continued to write for almost a minute after id finished speaking before turning his attention to a rack of rubber stamps on his desktop there must have been thirty or forty of these he picked one up pressed it onto an inkpad and then carefully stamped the sheet of paper hed been writing on then still silent he got up and closed the door there was a grand piano in his office a ninefoot black bluthner and to my surprise he sat down in front of it and started to play and play rather well i might say while he was playing he shifted his large arse on the piano stool hed put on some weight since last id seen him and then nodded at the space hed made to indicate that i should sit beside him i sat down hardly knowing what to expect and for a while neither of us said a word as his thin bony dead christ hands rippled over the shiny keyboard i listened and kept my eyes on the photograph on the piano lid it was a picture of heydrich in profile wearing a fencers white jerkin and looking like the sort of dentist you might have nightmares about the kind who would have pulled all of your teeth to improve your dental hygiene ghuan zhong was a seventhcentury chinese philosopher heydrich said quietly he wrote a very great book of chinese sayings one of which is that even the walls have ears do you understand what im saying gunther yes general i said and looking around tried to guess where a microphone might have been hidden good then ill keep playing this piece is by mozart who was taught by antonio salieri salieri was not a great composer hes better known to us today as the man who murdered mozart i didnt even know hed been murdered sir oh yes salieri was jealous of mozart as is often the way with lesser men would it surprise you to know that someone is trying to murder me who himmler of course the salieri de nos jours himmler is not a great mind his most important thoughts are the ones im yet to give him he is a man who goes to the lavatory and probably wonders what hitler would like him to do while hes in there but one of us will certainly destroy the other and with any luck it will be him who loses the game to me he is not to be underestimated however and this is the reason that i keep you in sipo gunther because if by any chance himmler wins our little game i want someone to find the evidence that will help to destroy him someone with a proven track record in kripo as an investigating detective someone intelligent and resourceful that man is you gunther you are the voltaire to my frederick the great i keep you close for your honesty and your independence of mind im flattered herr general and rather horrified what makes you think i could ever destroy a man like himmler dont be a fool gunther and listen i said help to destroy if himmler succeeds and i am murdered it will of course look like an accident or that someone else was responsible for my death in those circumstances there will have to be an inquiry as head of kripo arthur nebe has the power to appoint someone to direct that inquiry that someone will be you gunther you will have the assistance of my wife lina and of my most trusted confidant a man named walter schellenberg of the ss foreign intelligence service you can trust schellenberg to know the most politic way to bring the evidence of my murder to the fuhrers attention i have enemies its true but so does that bastard himmler and some of his enemies are my friends i shrugged so you see he made it almost impossible for me to leave kripo and thats the real reason that nebe ordered you back from minsk to berlin said the ami with the pipe what you told silverman and earp about nebe being worried you might land him in the shit that was only half the story wasnt it he was protecting you on heydrichs personal instructions wasnt he i assume so yes it was only when i got back to berlin and met schellenberg that i was reminded of what heydrich had said and also of course when he was assassinated in lets get back to mielke said the ami with the illfitting glasses was it heydrich who made him your pigeon yes when did that happen following the conversation at the piano i said a couple of days after the fall of france so june thats right chapter fifteen germany i was summoned back to prinz albrechtstrasse where the scene was frenetic to say the least people were scurrying around with files phones ringing almost continually couriers running along corridors carrying important dispatches there was even a gramophone playing the song erika as if we were actually with the motorised ss as they drove on towards the normandy coast and most unusually everyone was smiling no one ever smiled in that place but that day they did even i had a smile on my face to defeat france as quickly as we did seemed nothing short of miraculous you have to bear in mind that many of us had sat in the trenches of northern france for four years four years of slaughter and stalemate and then a victory over our oldest enemy in just four weeks you didnt have to be a nazi to feel good about that and if im honest the summer of was when i came the closest to thinking well of the nazis indeed that was the time when being a nazi hardly seemed to matter suddenly we were all proud to be german again of course people were also feeling good because they thought we thought that the war was over before it had even begun hardly anyone was dead in comparison with the millions whod died in the great war england would have to make peace the russian back door was secure and america wasnt interested in getting involved as usual all in all it seemed like some sort of miraculous reprieve i expect the french felt very differently but in germany there was national jubilation and frankly the last person on my mind when i walked into heydrichs office that morning was a stupid little prick like erich mielke seated at a table beside heydrich was another uniformed ss man whom i didnt recognise he was about thirty slightly built with a full head of light brown hair a fastidious almost feminine mouth and the sharpest pair of eyes id seen outside of the leopards enclosure at the berlin zoo the left eye was particularly catlike at first i assumed it was narrowed against the smoke from his silver cigarette holder but after a while i saw that the eye was permanently like that as if he had lost his monocle he smiled when heydrich introduced us and i saw that there was more than a passing resemblance to the young bela lugosi always supposing that bela lugosi had ever been young the ss officers name was walter schellenberg and i think he was a major then much later on he became a general but i wasnt really paying attention to the pips on his collar patch i was more interested in heydrichs uniform which was that of a reserve major in the luftwaffe more interesting still was the fact that his arm was in a sling and for several nervous minutes i supposed that my presence there had something to do with an attempt on his life he wanted me to investigate oberkommissar gunther is one of kripos best detectives heydrich told schellenberg in the new germany thats a profession not without some hazard most philosophers argue that the world is ultimately mind or matter schopenhauer states that the final reality is human will but whenever i see gunther i am reminded of the overriding importance to the world of human curiosity too like a scientist or an inventor a good detective must be curious he must have his hypotheses and he must always seek to test them against the observable facts is it not so gunther yes herr general doubtless he is even now wondering why i am wearing this luftwaffe uniform and hoping secretly that it heralds my departure from sipo so that he might enjoy an easier quieter life heydrich smiled at his little joke come now gunther isnt that exactly what you were thinking are you leaving sipo herr general no im not he grinned like a very clever schoolboy i said nothing try to contain your obvious relief gunther very well general ill certainly do my best you see what i mean walter he remains his own man at all times schellenberg just smiled and smoked and watched me with his cats eyes and said nothing we had one thing in common at least with heydrich nothing was always the safest thing to say since the invasion of poland explained heydrich ive been volunteering as air crew on a bomber i was a rear gunner in an air attack on lublin it sounds rather hazardous herr general i said it is but believe me theres nothing quite like flying down on an enemy city at two hundred miles an hour with an mg in your hands i wanted to show some of these bureaucratic soldiers what the ss is made of that were not just a bunch of asphalt soldiers i assumed he was referring to himmler very commendable sir is that how you injured your arm no no that was an accident he said ive also been training as a fighter pilot i crashed during takeoff my own stupid fault are you sure about that heydrichs selfsatisfied smile stalled midflight and for a moment i wondered if id gone too far meaning what he said that it wasnt an accident i shrugged meaning only that i imagine you would want to find out everything that went wrong before flying again i was trying to back off a little from what unwisely perhaps id already put in his mind what kind of plane was it sir heydrich hesitated as if debating the idea in his own mind a messerschmitt he said quietly the bf its not considered a very agile plane well there are you i cant think why i mentioned such a thing i certainly didnt mean to imply that you arent a good pilot general im sure they wouldnt let you get in the cockpit unless they were quite satisfied the aeroplane was airworthy me ive never even been off the ground but i should still want to be quite sure it wasnt anything mechanical before i went up again yes perhaps youre right schellenberg was nodding now it certainly couldnt do any harm herr general gunthers right he had a curious highpitched voice with a slight accent i found hard to place and there was something very neat and dapper about him that reminded me of a butler or a menswear salesman an attractivelooking ss secretary what we used to call a grey mouse came in carrying a tray with three coffee cups and three glasses of water just like we were in a cafe on the kudamm and thankfully we were distracted from the subject of heydrichs accident schellenberg by the woman herself and heydrich by the sound of the gramophone that was coming through the open door for a moment he stamped his boots on the floor in time with the song and grinned happily thats a marvellous sound isnt it wonderful herr general said schellenberg who was still eyeing heydrichs secretary and the comment might just as easily have been about her as the music i could see his point her name was bettina and she seemed too nice by half to be working for a devil like heydrich when she went out again the three of us started to sing it was one of the few ss songs i didnt mind at all since it couldnt have had less to do with the ss or even fighting a war and for a moment i forgot where i was and who i was with on the heath there grows a little flower and its name is erika a hundred thousand little bees swarm around erika because her heart is full of sweetness and her flowery dress gives off a tender scent on the heath there grows a little flower and its name is erika we sang all three verses and by the end we were in such a jolly mood that heydrich told bettina to fetch us some brandy a few minutes later we were toasting the fall of france and then heydrich was explaining the real reason for my presence in his office handing me a file he waited for me to open it and said you recognise the name on the file of course i nodded erich mielke what about him you saved his life and then he and an accomplice murdered two policemen and then his arrest was bungled by the jew in charge of the investigation you mean kriminalpolizeirat heller i said yes i remember him wasnt it heller who successfully investigated the murder of that young sa fellow in the beussellkeitz the one who was stabbed to death by some communist thugs what was his name herbert norkus thank you for the history lesson gunther said heydrich patiently none of us is likely to forget herbert norkus this was hardly surprising as the murder of norkus had been the subject of the very first nazi propaganda movie about the hitler youth i hadnt seen the movie myself but i thought it unlikely that hellers part had even made it into the script all the same i thought it best not to push this detail any further with heydrich youll be glad to know that foreign intelligence has managed to keep track of mielke since you and heller allowed him to slip through your fingers he said walter why dont you bring the chief inspector up to date with what we have on him now id be delighted sir said schellenberg in moscow we know mielke attended the lenin school under the name of walter scheuer then he was given the name paul bach and we assume this was the same paul bach who gave evidence against many of the german communist cadres following the stalinist purge at the hotel lux in may naturally the gestapo was at the same time monitoring the mielke family home and soon after the murders of anlauf and lenck the family moved from the stettiner strasse apartment to an address in grunthaler strasse where in september mielkes younger sister gertrud received a postcard from madrid this seemed to confirm what we already suspected which was that mielke had gone to spain as a chekist during the civil war he was going by the name of captain fritz leissner and was assigned to a general gomez whom we know rather better as wilhelm zaisser another german communist it seems these bastards spent more time killing other republicans than they did killing any nationalists and its no accident that the th international brigade also known as the dabrowski brigade mutinied soon after the battle of brunete in july because of the appalling casualties inflicted on them as a result of the incompetence of their officers following the republican defeat in january mielke was one of thousands who crossed the border into france the french started locking them up almost immediately in october one of our agents who was posing as a member of the french communist party they were also interned in the same concentration camps as the german communists met a man he believed to have been erich mielke at the buffalo sports stadium in the south of paris which the french were using as a provisional camp for undesirable aliens he said that mielke told him hed been transferred from another provisional camp the roland garros tennis stadium soon after that mielke was transferred to one of two rather more permanent concentration camps in the south of france either the camp at le vernet in ariege near toulouse or else to gurs which is in the region of aquitaine we believe hes still in one of these camps he knows were looking for him so naturally hell be using a false name and while conditions in these camps are generally held to be abominable nevertheless since the soviet union signed the nonaggression pact with germany they might actually be the safest place for him stalin has already sent back here several german communists in order to demonstrate his good will toward the fuhrer and its quite likely he would do the same with erich mielke so with france now in the hands of the third reich this is our best chance in almost a decade to capture him and said heydrich since youre the only man in sipo whos ever had the pleasure to have met mielke that makes you uniquely qualified to go to france and make the arrest the french are already proving to be extremely cooperative in this regard theyre as anxious to get rid of some of their german undesirables as we are to get hold of them and you certainly wont find that youre the only police officer making the journey down there to arrest a fugitive from german justice merely one of the most important ones because make no mistake about it gunther erich mielke is very near the top of our wanted list i have some questions sir i said heydrich nodded first of all i dont speak french thats not a problem at all in paris you will liaise with hauptmann paul kestner whom i believe you know from your time together in kripo kestner is from alsace and speaks fluent french hes ordered to offer you any assistance that you require the two of you will report to my own deputy general werner best of the gestapo together with helmut knochen whos the senior commander of security in paris hell assign you some french police to assist in your mission codenamed fafnir i nodded fafnir right you are sir im glad you didnt say hagen it didnt happen very often but heydrich looked puzzled in the ring cycle sir i explained hagen kills gunther heydrich smiled well ill kill you if dont find mielke he said understand i was glad he was smiling yes herr general hell need a uniform sir said schellenberg have you a uniform gunther no herr general not yet i thought not good that gives us an opportunity to talk privately come with me and bring mielkes file with you youll need it he stood up collected his hat and walked to the door i followed him to the outer office where he was already telling bettina to have his car brought to the front door and collecting a briefcase from schellenberg he took the file from me and placed it inside the briefcase are we going somewhere i asked my tailor he said and marched towards the huge marble staircase as we came out of the building the guards on prinz albrechtstrasse came to attention and for a moment we waited for the car to appear heydrich permitted me to light his cigarette and then handed me the briefcase everything you need for operation fafnir is in that briefcase he said money passes travel documentation and more besides much more which is why i wanted to talk to you in private he glanced around at the two ss guards as if making sure they were out of earshot and then said the most extraordinary thing you see gunther we have something in common you and i years ago both of us were denounced as mischlings because allegedly we have a jewish grandparent nonsense of course but not unconnected with what i told you before you mean about how someone is trying to kill you yes having failed to persuade the fuhrer that there was any truth in these wicked rumours it is certainly himmlers intention to have me assassinated of course i am not without resources of my own certain records pertaining to my familys past in halle and which might be open to misinterpretation have been erased and the person who denounced me a naval cadet i knew at the academy in kiel that man met an unfortunate accident he was killed in the deutschland incident of when the republican air force attacked the port of ibiza thats the official version anyway the car arrived it was a large opentop black mercedes the driver an ss sergeant sprang out saluted and then opened the big suicide door and tipped the front seat forward what took you so long klein said heydrich im sorry sir but i was filling her up when your call came through where are we going holters the tailors sixteen tauenzienstrasse right you are sir we drove south as far as the corner of b u low strasse and then west that briefcase i gave you said heydrich it also contains a file about the man who denounced you gunther in fact that file is not unconnected with mielkes file as you will discover you see the man who denounced you was hauptmann paul kestner your former schoolmate and kripo colleague kestner i nodded i always thought that was someone else sir this girl i used to know who also knew mielke but you dont look surprised that it was kestner no perhaps im not herr general he was a member of the kpd before he was a nazi did you know that i shook my head it was kestner who tipped off his friends in the kpd that you and he were travelling to hamburg to arrest mielke after you left kripo he hoped to divert suspicion from himself by alleging that it was you who had tipped off mielke something that was easier to do if it turned out that you were part jew i shook my head oh its all in the file said heydrich no thats not it herr general im just disappointed thats all as you say ive known paul kestner since we were at the same gymnasium here in berlin its always disappointing when one discovers that one has been betrayed but in a sense its liberating too it serves as a reminder that ultimately one can only ever truly rely on oneself theres something i dont understand i said if you know all of this why am i meeting up with paul kestner in paris heydrich tutted loudly and looked away for a moment as we drove onto nollendorf platz there he pointed at the mozart hall movie theatre the four feathers he said a marvellous picture have you seen it yes quite right its one of the fuhrers favourites this is a movie about revenge is it not albeit a very british and sentimental kind of revenge harry favisham returns the four white feathers to the same men and woman who had accused him of cowardice absurd really speaking for myself i should have preferred to see my former comrades suffer a little more than they did and perhaps die although not without revealing myself as their nemesis do you follow me im beginning to herr general as your superior officer i should inform you that its no crime to have been a communist party member before one saw the light and became a national socialist i should also inform you that paul kestner is not without connections in the wilhelmstrasse and that these people have decided to overlook his dishonest role in the mielke affair frankly if we were to cashier every sipo officer with an unfortunate past there would be no one left to wear the uniform does he know i asked that his superiors are aware of what he did no we prefer to keep things like that in reserve for when we need to bring a man into line and persuade him to do what hes told however heydrich flicked his cigarette into the street and lifted his injured arm as you can see accidents happen especially in time of war and if some harm were to befall hauptmann kestner while he was in occupied france i doubt that anyone would be surprised least of all me after all its a long road between paris and toulouse and i dare say there are still a few pockets of french resistance it would be a tragedy of war just like the death of paul baumer reaching to protect a fledgling bird on the last page of all quiet on the western front heydrich sighed yes a tragedy but hardly a matter for regret i see well its entirely a matter for you haupsturmfuhrer gunther your chief inspector rank in kripo entitles you to the rank of ss captain the same as kestner it makes no difference to me if he lives or dies its your choice the car purred along tauenzienstrasse toward the stalagmite steeples of the kaiser wilhelm memorial church and came to a rumbling halt in front of a tailors shop in the window was a tailors dummy that looked like the torso at the scene of a crime and several bolts of pewtercoloured cloth pedestrians shot heydrich a curious look as he climbed out of the car and walked his bowlegged walk to the front door of wilhelm holters you could hardly blame them for that with all the medals and badges on his luftwaffe tunic he looked like an accomplished boy scout albeit a rather sinister one i followed him through the door with the shop bell ringing in my ears as if warning other customers of the plague we brought with us something fearful anyway an unassuming man wearing pincenez a black armband and a stiff collar came towards us washing one hand in the other like pontius pilate and smiling an intermittent smile as if he was functioning on half power only ah yes he said quietly general heydrich isnt it yes please come through he ushered us into a room that belonged in the herrenklub there were leather armchairs a clock ticking on a mantelpiece a pair of fulllength mirrors and several glass cases containing a variety of military uniforms on the walls were an abundance of royal warrants and pictures of hitler and goring whose fondness for wearing uniforms of all colours was well known through a green velvet curtain i could see several men cutting cloth or pressing halffinished uniforms with a hot iron and to my surprise one of these men was an orthodox jew it was a nice example of nazi hypocrisy to have a jewish tailor making an ss uniform this officer needs an ss uniform explained heydrich field grey and it has to be ready in one weeks time ordinarily i should send him to the ss quartermaster for an offthepeg hugo boss uniform but hell be travelling on the fuhrers personal train so hell need to look smart can you do it herr holters the tailor looked surprised even to be asked such a question he uttered a polite little guffaw and smiled with quiet confidence oh certainly herr general good said heydrich send the account to my office gunther i will leave you in herr holterss capable hands and make sure you get your men both of them then he turned and left holters produced a notebook and a pencil and began asking questions and noting the answers rank hauptmann any medals iron cross with royal citation great war participation medal with swords and wound badge thats it trousers or riding breeches i shrugged both he said dress dagger i shook my head hat size sixtytwo centimetres holters nodded well have hoffmanns in gneisenaustrasse send over a couple for you to try on until then perhaps youd like to slip off your jacket and ill take your measurements he glanced at a little calendar on the wall its always a hurry with general heydrich yes its never a good idea to disagree with him i said slipping off my jacket i do know that feeling where heydrich is concerned your black armband could be catching it was after id been measured and i was on my way out of the door that i bumped into elisabeth dehler who was coming into the tailors shop with a uniform box under her arm i hadnt seen her very much since that night in when shed taken offence at my turning up at her apartment and asking for mielkes address but she greeted me warmly as if all that was forgotten now and agreed to come and meet me for a coffee after she had delivered the uniform to herr holters i waited around the corner at miericke on ranke strasse where the chocolate cake was about the best in berlin when she arrived she told me that since the beginning of the war shed had little or no time for making dresses everyone wanted her for tailoring uniforms this war is over before it even got started i told her youll be back to dressmaking in no time at all i hope youre right she said even so i suppose thats why you were there at holters to get yourself a uniform yes i have a police job to do in paris next week paris she closed her eyes for a moment what i wouldnt give to be going to paris you know i was just thinking of you about an hour ago she pulled a face i dont believe you honestly its true i was why i shrugged i hardly wanted to tell her that i was being sent to paris to hunt down her old friend erich mielke and that this was the reason she was in my mind again oh i was just thinking that it would be nice to see you again elisabeth perhaps when i get back from paris we could see a movie together i thought you said you were going to paris next week i am then whats wrong with seeing a movie this week if it comes to that i said whats wrong with tonight she nodded pick me up at six she said and kissed me on the cheek we were on our way out of the coffee shop when she said i nearly forgot im living somewhere else now no wonder i couldnt find you as if you tried motzstrasse number twentyeight first floor my name is on the bell im already looking forward to ringing it chapter sixteen france at least it wasnt a black uniform but in the anhalter bahnhof waiting to board the reich railways train early that july morning i felt oddly uncomfortable dressed as a sipo captain even though almost everyone else was wearing a uniform it was as if id signed a contract in blood with hitler himself in the event the great mephistopheles chose not to visit the french capital by train the gestapo got wind of at least two plots to kill him while he was in paris and the word aboard the train was that hitler had already returned from a flying visit to the jewel in his crown of conquest via le bourget on june rd consequently although quite luxurious in many respects there were after all several senior wehrmacht generals aboard the train we travelled in was not the amerika which was the name of the special train carrying the fuhrer headquarters and by all accounts the last word in pullmanclass comfort that curiously named train possibly it was a pun based on the herms niel song i had sung in heydrichs office was it seemed back at the tempelhof repair depot in the southwest of berlin since meeting elisabeth again i rather wished i could have been there myself for although a small part of me was looking forward to seeing paris mostly i felt a distinct lack of enthusiasm for my mission a lot of people in sipo would have leapt at an allexpensespaid trip to the most glamorous city in the world and a little bit of murder along the way wouldnt have bothered them in the slightest there were some on that train who looked like theyd been murdering people since including the fellow sitting opposite me an ss untersturmfuhrer a second lieutenant i halfrecognised from police headquarters in alexanderplatz his little rats eyes got there ahead of me however excuse me sir he said politely but arent you chief inspector gunther from the homicide division have we met i was working vice squad at the alex when i think i saw you last my name is willms nikolaus willms i nodded silently vice isnt as glamorous as homicide he said but it has its moments he smiled without smiling the sort of expression a snake has when it opens its mouth to swallow something whole he was smaller than me but he had the ambitious look of a man who might eventually swallow something larger than himself so what takes you to paris i asked without much interest this isnt my first trip he said ive been there for the last two weeks i only came back to berlin to attend to a family matter you still have some work to do there theres plenty of vice in paris sir so im led to believe although with any luck i wont be stuck in vice for very long no willms shook his head he was small but powerful and sat with his legs apart and his arms folded as if watching a football match he said after the sd school in bernau i was sent on an exclusive leadership course in berlincharlottenburg it was the people who ran that course who organised this posting i speak fluent french you see im from trier originally so thats what i can hear in your accent french i imagine that comes in handy in your line of work to be honest with you sir its rather dull work im hoping for something a bit more exciting than a lot of french whores there are about five hundred soldiers on this train who would disagree with that lieutenant he smiled a proper smile this time with teeth only it didnt work any better the way a smile is supposed to work so what are you hoping for my father was killed in the war willms explained at verdun by a french sniper i was two when that happened so ive always hated the french i hate everything about them i suppose id like a chance to pay them back for what they did to me for taking my dad away from us for giving me such a miserable childhood my family should have left trier but we couldnt afford to go so we stayed my mother and my sisters we stayed in trier and we were hated he nodded thoughtfully i should very much like to work for the gestapo in paris giving the franzis a hard time sounds just about right to me cool a few if you know what i mean sir the wars over i said i should think your chances for cooling any french as you put it are rather limited now theyve surrendered oh i should think there are some left whove still got a bit of fight in them dont you terrorists well have to deal with them surely if you hear of anything in that line sir perhaps youd let me know im keen to get on and to get out of vice he smiled his reptilian smile and patted the briefcase on the seat next to him until then he added perhaps i might do you a favour oh how in this briefcase ive got a list of about three hundred paris restaurants and seven hundred hotels that are to be declared off limits because of prostitution and a list of about thirty that are officially approved not that anyone will take a blind bit of notice either way its been my experience of vice that all the law in the world wont stop a fellow whos intent on having a bit of mouse or a whore whos ready to give it to him anyway its my considered opinion that if a man was looking for a good time in paris then he could do a lot worse than go to the hotel fairyland on the place blanche in pigalle according to the prefecture of police in the rue de lutece the girls working in fairyland are free of venereal disease of course it might be asked how they know that and i think the simple answer would have to be that its paris and of course the police would know that he shrugged anyway i just thought you might like to know that yourself sir before the word gets around thanks lieutenant ill bear it in mind but i think im going to be too busy to go looking for any more trouble than i already have im on a case see an old case and i figure ive got my work laid out in front of me anything else gets laid out im liable to get even more distracted than seems reasonable even in paris id like to tell you more about it but i cant for security reasons you see the man im after got away from me before and i dont intend to let that happen again they could put hot and cold running michele morgan in my hotel bedroom and still id have to behave myself willms smiled his snake smile the one he probably used when he wanted to get some poor little snapper to give him one for free i knew what these bulls from vice were like but while he was loathsome i didnt doubt that he might actually have been useful to my mission and i suppose i could have offered him a job i had a letter from heydrich that would have compelled any mans commanding officer to offer me his full cooperation but i didnt make the offer i didnt because you dont pick up a snake unless you really have to arriving at pariss gare de lest in the late afternoon i presented my taxiwarrant to a wurstfaced nco who directed me to a military car already occupied by another officer petrol was scarce and since we were to be billeted in the same hotel across the river we were obliged to share a driver an ss corporal from essen who attempted to forestall our impatience at getting to the hotel by warning us that the speed limit was only kph and its worse at night he added then its just thirty which is really crazy surely its safer that way i said because of the blackout no sir said the corporal night time is when this city comes alive thats when people really want to get somewhere somewhere important like where asked my brother officer a naval lieutenant who was attached to the abwehr german military intelligence for example the driver smiled this is paris sir theres only one business of real importance here sir or so you might think from the number of staff officers i drive to their liaisons sir the only business in paris thats doing better than ever before sir is the business of male and female relations sir in a word prostitution this city is rife with it and youd think some of these germans coming here have never seen a girl before the way they go at it good god exclaimed the abwehr lieutenant whose name was kurt boger there will be plenty of german reinforcements on the way soon said the driver little germans that is my advice to you both is to find yourselves a nice little girlfriend and get it for free but if youre short of time the best brothels in the city are maison chabanais at number twelve rue chabanais and the onetwotwo on rue de provence i heard the fairyland was good i said no thats rubbish sir with all due respect whoever told you that is talking out of their arse the fairyland is a real knocking shop you want to keep away from there sir in case you wind up with a dose of jelly if youll forgive me for saying so maison chabanais is for officers only madame marthe runs a very classy house boger hardly a typical sailor was tutting loudly and shaking his head but youll be all right at the hotel lutetia said the driver changing the subject its a very respectable hotel theres nothing going on there im relieved to hear it said boger all of the best hotels have been taken over by us germans said the driver the general staff with red stripes on their trousers and the party big guns are at the majestic and the crillon but i reckon youre both better off here on the left bank security near the lutetia was tight a protective zone of sandbags and wooden barriers had been established around the hotel and armed sentries manned the entrance to the general bewilderment of the hotels doorman and porters all traffic save german military vehicles was forbidden the zone there wasnt much traffic however since the last thing the french army had done before abandoning the city to its fate was to set fire to several fuel storage depots to prevent them from falling into our hands but the paris metro was still running that much was evident you could feel it underneath your feet in the lutetia hotel lobby not that it was easy to see your feet there were so many german officers milling around ss rsha abwehr secret field police the gfp and all goosestepping on each others toes because there was no one i knew who could have told you for sure where the responsibilities of one security service ended and anothers began it wasnt exactly babel but there was plenty of confusion all round and in turning men from the fear of god to a constant dependence on his own power hitler made a convincing nimrod the lutetia staff were no less confused than we were ourselves when i asked the germanspeaking porter to identify the cupola i could see from my window he told me he wasnt sure he called a maid over to the window and they debated the matter for a couple of minutes before finally they decided that the cupola was the dome of the church at les invalides where napoleon was buried a little later on i discovered that it was in fact the pantheon in the opposite direction otherwise the service at the lutetia was good although hardly on a par with the adlon in berlin and i couldnt help but favourably contrast my current french accommodation with what id endured in the great war crisp clean sheets and a wellstocked cocktail bar made a very pleasant change from a flooded trench and some warm ersatz coffee the experience was almost enough to complete my conversion to being a nazi i wasnt fond of the french the war the great war was much too recent in my mind to make me like them but i felt sorry for them now that they were secondclass citizens in their own country they were forbidden the best hotels and restaurants maxims was under german management on the paris metro firstclass carriages were reserved for germans and the french for whom good food was virtually a religion found it was rationed and there were long lines for bread wine meat and cigarettes of course nothing was in short supply if you were german and i enjoyed an excellent dinner at laperouse a nineteenthcentury restaurant that looked more like a brothel than the brothels the next day paul kestner was waiting for me in the lutetia lobby as arranged we shook hands like old friends and admired each others tailoring german officers did a lot of that in especially in paris where fine clothes seemed to matter more kestner was tall and thin and roundshouldered like someone who had spent a lot of time behind a desk his head was almost completely hairless apart from the dark eyebrows that softened his solidly cut features it was a face engraved with integrity and it was hard to believe that a man with a jaw as square as the brandenburg gate could have betrayed the police service and then me with such impunity kestners was a head that belonged on a swiss banknote only id spent a large part of the rail journey from berlin considering the idea of putting a bullet in it heydrichs myrmidons had done their homework well the file hed handed me in his car contained a copy of the anonymous letter kestner had sent to the jew desk denouncing me as a mischling as well as a sample of kestners own identical handwriting which conveniently he had also signed there was even a photograph taken in march before hed joined the berlin police of kestner wearing the uniform of a communist party cadre and aboard a kpd election bus with a placard over his shoulder on which was printed you must elect thalmann at the very same moment i smiled and shook kestners hand and talked about the old times we shared i wanted to punch his teeth in and the only thing that seemed likely to stop me from doing it was the affection i still held for his little sister hows traudl i asked has she finished medical school yes shes a doctor now working for something called the charitable foundation for health and institutional care some governmentfunded clinic in austria youll have to give me the address i said so that i can send her a postcard from paris its the schloss hartheim he explained in alkoven near linz not too near linz i hope hitlers from linz same old bernie gunther not quite youre forgetting this pirate hat im wearing now i tapped the silver skull and crossbones on my grey officers cap that reminds me kestner glanced at his wristwatch we have an eleven oclock appointment with colonel knochen at the hotel du louvre hes not here at the lutetia no colonel rudolph of the abwehr is in charge here knochen likes to run his own show the sd is mostly at the hotel du louvre on the other side of the river i wonder why they put me here possibly to piss rudolph off said kestner since almost certainly he knows nothing about your mission by the way bernie what is your mission the prinz albrechtstrasse has been rather secretive about what youre doing in paris you remember that communist who murdered the two policemen in berlin in erich mielke to his credit kestner didnt even flinch at the mention of this name vaguely he said heydrich thinks hes in a french concentration camp somewhere in the south of france my orders are to find him get him back to paris and then arrange his transport back to berlin where hes to stand trial nothing else what else could there be only that we could have organised that on our own without your having to come here to paris you dont even speak french you forget paul ive met mielke if hes changed his name as seems likely i might be able to identify him yes of course i remember now we just missed him in hamburg didnt we thats right seems like a lot of effort for just one man are you sure theres nothing else what heydrich wants heydrich gets point made said kestner well shall we walk its a fine day is it safe kestner laughed from who the french he laughed again let me tell you something about the french bernie they know that its in their interest to get on with us fridolins thats what they call us quite a lot of them are happy were here christ theyre even more antisemitic than we are he shook his head no youve got nothing to worry about from the french my friend unlike kestner i didnt speak a word of french but it was easy to find your way around paris there were german direction signs on every street corner it was a pity i didnt have a similar arrangement inside my own head it might have made it easier to decide what to do about kestner kestners french was to my fridolin ears perfect which is to say he sounded like a frenchman his father was a chemist who disgusted by the dreyfus affair had left alsace to live in berlin in those days berlin had been a more tolerant place than france paul kestner had been just five years old when he came to live in berlin but for the rest of his life his mother always spoke to him in french thats how i got this posting he said as we walked north to the seine i didnt think it was because of your love of art the hotel du louvre on the rue de rivoli was older than the lutetia but not dissimilar with four facades several hundred rooms and an international reputation for luxury it was a natural choice for the gestapo and the sd security was every bit as tight as at the lutetia and we were obliged to sign in at a makeshift guardroom inside the front door an ss orderly escorted us through the lobby and up a sweeping staircase to the public rooms where the sd had established some temporary offices kestner and i were ushered into a tasteful salon with a rich red carpet and a series of handpainted murals we sat down at a long mahogany table and waited a few minutes passed before three sd officers entered the room one of whom i recognised the last time i had seen herbert hagen had been in in cairo where he and adolf eichmann were attempting to make contact with haj amin the grand mufti of jerusalem hagen had been an ss sergeant then and a rather incompetent one now he was a major and aide to colonel helmut knochen who was a lugubrious officer of about thirty about the same age as hagen the third officer also a major was older than the other two with thick hornrimmed glasses and a face that was as thin and grey as the piping on his cap his name was karl bomelburg but it was hagen who took charge of the meeting and came swiftly to the point without any reference to our former meeting that suited me just fine general heydrich has ordered us to provide you with all available assistance in visiting the refugee camps at le vernet and gurs he said and in facilitating the arrest of a wanted communist murderer but you will appreciate that these camps are still under the control of the french police i was led to believe that they would cooperate with our extradition request i said thats true said knochen even so under the terms of the armistice signed on june nd those refugee camps are in the nonoccupied zone that means we have to pay lip service to the idea that in that part of france at least they remain in charge of their own affairs its a way of avoiding hostility and resistance in other words said major bomelburg we get the french to do our dirty work what else are they good for said hagen oh i dont know i said the food at laperouse is quite spectacular good point captain said bomelburg we shall have to involve the prefecture of police in your mission said knochen so that the french may persuade themselves that they are preserving french institutions and the french way of life but i tell you gentlemen that the loyalty of the french police is indispensable to us hagen whos the franzi that the maison has put up as liaison he looked my way the maison is what we call the flics in the rue de lutece the prefecture of police you should see the building captain gunther its as big as the reichstag the marquis de brinon sir said hagen oh yes you know for a republic the french are awfully impressed by aristocratic titles theyre almost as bad as the austrians in that respect hagen see if the marquis can suggest anyone to help the captain hagen looked awkward actually sir were not entirely certain that the marquis isnt married to a jew knochen frowned do we have to worry about that sort of thing now weve only just got here he shook his head besides its not his wife whos the liaison officer is it hagen shook his head all in good time we shall see who is a jew and who isnt a jew but right now it seems to me the priority is the apprehension of a communist fugitive from german justice a murderer isnt that right captain gunther thats right sir he killed two policemen as it happens said knochen this department is already in the process of drawing up a list of wanted war criminals to present to the french and in the establishment of a special joint commission the kuhnt commission to oversee these matters in the unoccupied zone a german officer captain geissler has already gone down to vichy to begin the work of this commission and in particular to hunt for herschel grynszpan you will perhaps recall that it was grynszpan a germanpolish jew who murdered ernst vom rath here in paris in november and whose actions provoked such a strong outpouring of feeling in germany i remember it very well sir i said i live on fasanenstrasse just off the kudamm the synagogue at the end of my street was burnt down during that strong outpouring of feeling you were talking about herr colonel a representative of the german foreign ministry herr doctor grimm is also on grynszpans trail said knochen it seems that the little jew was here in paris in the fresnes prison until early june when the french decided to evacuate all of the prisoners to orleans from there he was sent to prison in bourges however he didnt arrive there the convoy of buses transporting the prisoners was attacked by german aircraft and after that the picture is rather confused as a matter of fact sir said bomelburg we rather think that grynszpan might have gone to toulouse if thats the case then whats geissler doing in vichy setting up this kuhnt commission said bomelburg to be fair to geissler for a while there was also a rumour that grynszpan was in vichy too but toulouse now looks like a better bet bomelburg karl correct me if im wrong said knochen but i seem to recall that this french concentration camp at le vernet where captain gunthers quarry may be imprisoned is in the ariege department in the midpyrenees thats near toulouse is it not quite near sir agreed bomelburg toulouse is in the neighbouring department of hautegaronne and about sixty kilometres north of le vernet then it strikes me said knochen that you and captain gunther should both get yourselves to toulouse as quickly as possible perhaps the day after tomorrow bomelburg you can remain in toulouse and look for grynszpan while gunther here travels further south to le vernet have the marquis find someone to go with gunther and kestner to smooth over any ruffled french feathers meanwhile i shall send a telegram to philippe le gaga in vichy and inform him of what is happening i dare say that by the time you get down there we will have a clearer idea of who to arrest and who to leave where they are any trains running down that way yet sir this was kestner im afraid not pity thats rather a long drive about six hundred kilometres you know it might be an idea to take a leaf out of the fuhrers book and fly down there from le bourget in a couple of hours we could be in biarritz where a motorised detachment from the ssvt or secret gfp could take us on to le vernet and toulouse agreed knochen looked at hagen see to it and find out if there are there any motorised detachments of ss operating that far south yes sir there are said hagen in which case the only question that remains is whether these men should be wearing uniforms when they cross the demarcation line into the french zone an officers uniform might lend us more authority sir argued kestner gunther what do you think asked knochen i agree with captain kestner in a surrender situation its as well to be reminded that the surrender began with a war after i think the french would do well to learn a little humility if theyd treated us better at versailles then we might not be here at all so i dont see any sense in trying to sugar coat the pill they have to swallow theres no getting away from the fact that they just got their arses kicked the sooner they recognise it the sooner we can all go home but i came here to arrest a man who murdered two policemen and i dont much care if some franzi doesnt care for my manners while im doing it since i put on a uniform i dont much care for them myself i can take the uniform off again and pretend to be something im not in order to get the job done but i cant pretend to be diplomatic and charming i never was one for french kissing so to hell with their feelings i say bravo captain gunther said knochen that was a fine speech maybe it was and maybe i even believed some of it too one thing i said was certainly true the sooner i went home the better i was going to feel about a lot of things especially myself mixing with antisemites like herbert hagen reminded me just why id never become a nazi and french victory or no french victory i wouldnt ever be able to overcome my instinctive loathing of adolf hitler that afternoon i went to see les invalides it was a very nazi looking monument the front door had more gold than the valley of the kings but the atmosphere was that of a public swimming bath the mausoleum itself was a piece of mahogany coloured marble that resembled an enormous tea caddy hitler had visited les invalides just a couple of weeks before and i cant have been the only person who wished that it had been he and not the emperor napoleon who was inside the six coffins that were contained in that overblown mausoleum following his escape from elba i suppose they were worried the little monster might escape from his grave like dracula maybe theyd even put a stake through his heart just to be on the safe side burying hitler in pieces looked like a better bet with the eiffel tower through his heart like every other german in paris that summer id brought a camera with me so i walked around and took some photographs on pare du champ de mars i photographed some german soldiers getting some directions from a gendarme when he saw me the gendarme saluted smartly as if a german officers uniform really did command authority but the way i saw it the french police had an attitude problem they didnt seem to mind the fact that theyd been defeated back in germany id seen cops look less happy when they failed to get elected to the prussian police officers association i enjoyed another solitary dinner in a quiet restaurant on the rue de varennes before returning to the lutetia the hotel was a mixture of art nouveau and art deco but the swastika flag that appeared on the sinuous brokenart pediment below the lutetias name was the clearest indication of the neo brutalism that afflicted its guests me included the bar was busy and surprisingly inviting a weltemignon pianola was playing a selection of maudlin german tunes i ordered a cognac and smoked a french cigarette and avoided the eye of the reptilian lieutenant whod been on the train from berlin when he looked like he was headed my way i finished my brandy and left i took the lift up to the seventh floor and walked along the curving corridor to my room a maid came out of another room and smiled to my surprise she spoke good german would you like me to turn down your bed linen for the night sir thanks i said and opening my door complimented her german im swiss i grew up speaking french and german and italian my father runs a hotel in berne i came to paris to get some experience then we have something in common i told her before the war i worked at the hotel adlon in berlin she was impressed with that which was of course my intention as she was not without her charms a little homely perhaps but i was in the mood to think well of home and homelylooking girls and when she finished her duties i gave her some german money and the rest of my cigarettes for no other reason than i wanted her to think better of me than i thought of myself especially the man i saw in the mirror on the front of the wardrobe in some pathetic little fantasy i imagined her coming back in the small hours knocking on my door and climbing into my bed as things worked out this wasnt so far from the mark but that was later on and when she left i wished i hadnt given her my last cigarettes well at least you wont fall asleep with a cigarette in your hand and set the bed on fire gunther i said with one eye on the brass fire extinguisher that stood in the corner of the room next to the door i closed the window undressed and went to bed for a while i lay there feeling a little drunk staring up at the blank ceiling and wondering if i should have gone to the maison chabanais after all and perhaps i might even have got up and gone there if it hadnt been for the thought of putting on my riding boots again sometimes morality is just a corollary of laziness besides it felt good to be back in the world of grand hotel luxury the bed was a good one sleep quickly came my way and put an end to all thoughts of what i might have been missing at the maison chabanais a deep sleep that became unnaturally deeper as the night progressed and almost put an end to all thoughts of maison chabanais and paris and my mission the kind of sleep that almost put an end to me chapter seventeen france i told myself i must have dreamed the whole thing i was back in the dugout had to be or else why could i smell winter green ointment we used it as a winter warmer for weathered or chapped hands in the colder months and in the trenches that was nearly all of them wintergreen was also an excellent chest rub for when you had a fever or a cough or a sore throat which because of the lice overcrowding and damp was nearly all of the time sometimes we even fingered a bit of the stuff inside our nostrils just to keep the smell of death and decay at bay i had a sore throat and i had a cough the cold was on my chest and so was something else only it wasnt wintergreen it was a nurse and she was on top of me and i was lifting her skirt so that she could mount me properly only she wasnt a nurse at all but a hotel maid a nice homely girl from berne and shed come to keep me company after all i reached for her breasts and she slapped me hard twice and hard enough to make me catch my breath and then cough some more twisting away from underneath her i retched onto the floor she jumped off the bed and coughing herself went to the window and threw it open and hung her head outside for a moment before she came back to me hauled me off the bed and tried to drag me towards the door i was still coughing and retching when two men in white jackets came and carried me away on a stretcher outside the hotel on boulevard raspail i started to feel a little better as i managed to haul some of the fresh morning air into my lungs they took me to the lariboisiere hospital on rue ambroisepare there they put a drip in my arm and a german army doctor told me id been gassed gassed i said wheezily with what carbon tetrachloride said the doctor it seems that the fire extinguisher in your room was faulty but for the maid who detected the smell outside your room door youd probably be dead the ctc converts to phosgene when its exposed to air which is how it puts the fire out it suffocates it you too very nearly youre a lucky man captain gunther all the same wed like to keep you here for a while to keep an eye on your liver and kidney functions i started coughing again my head felt like the eiffel tower had collapsed on top of it my throat felt like id tried to swallow it but at least i was alive id seen plenty of men gassed in france and this wasnt anything like that at least i wasnt bringing anything up youve got to see a man retching two litres of yellow liquid every hour drowning in his own mucus to know how appalling it is to die from a gas attack it was said that hitler had been gassed and was temporarily blinded and if that was so it explained a lot whenever i saw him on a newsreel yelling his head off gesticulating wildly beating his breast choking with his hatred of the jews or the french or the bolsheviks he always reminded me of someone who had just been gassed in the early evening i started to feel better well enough to receive a visitor it was paul kestner they said you had an accident with a fire extinguisher what did you do drink it it wasnt that type of a fire extinguisher i thought there was only the one kind the kind that puts out a fire this one was the type that smothers a fire with chemicals takes away all the oxygen thats kind of what happened to me someone catch you smoking in bed ive spent most of the day wondering that myself and not liking any of the answers such as what for instance i used to work in a hotel the adlon in berlin and i learned a lot about what they do and what they dont do in hotels and one of the things they dont do is to put fire extinguishers in the bedrooms one reason is in case a guest gets drunk and decides to hose down the curtains the other reason is that a lot of extinguishers are more dangerous than the fires theyre meant to deal with its a funny thing but when i arrived at the lutetia i dont recall there being an extinguisher in my room but there was one there last night if i hadnt been drunk myself i might have paid more attention to it are you suggesting someone tampered with it it seems so obvious to me that i wonder why you should sound surprised surprised yes of course im surprised bernie youre implying that someone tried to murder you in a hotel full of policemen tampering with a fire extinguisher is just the sort of thing a cop would know about besides none of us at the lutetia has a room key thats because were all on the same side you cant mean a german tried to kill you i do mean but why not a frenchman we did just fight a war with these people after all surely if it was anyone and im not convinced it was anything but an accident it would be one of them a porter perhaps or a patriotic waiter and among all of the bastards he could have killed he just chose me at random is that it i shook my head which seemed to provoke another violent fit of coughing kestner poured a glass of water and handed it to me i drank it and caught my breath thanks besides the kind of staff a grand hotel employs it goes against everything they believe in to kill a guest even a guest they might despise kestner went to the window and looked out we were in a thirdfloor room in the high mansard roof of the hospital you could see and sometimes hear the gare du nord just across the rue maubeuge but why would any german officer want to kill you they would have to have a damn good motive for a moment i considered suggesting one anyone who had already denounced me to the gestapo as a mischling would i thought have reason enough to kill me instead i said i wasnt always held in such good odour by our political masters you remember what it was like in kripo before well of course you do youre about the one person in paris i can talk to about this paul who i can trust im relieved to hear it bernie but just for the record i spent most of last night at the onetwotwo the brothel you forget i said everyone has to sign in and out of the hotel i could easily check if you were in the hotel last night yes youre right i did forget that you always were a better detective than i was he came away from the window and sat on the edge of my bed youre alive thats the main thing and you neednt worry about mielke im sure well find him you can tell heydrich that if hes in one of those french concentration camps well find him as sure as theres an amen in a church service you can go back to berlin confident in the knowledge that when we fly down there tomorrow well take proper care of it what makes you think im not coming with you your doctor said that it would be several days before you were fit enough to resume your duties said kestner surely youll want to get home and recuperate im working for heydrich remember hes a bit like the god of abraham its never a good idea to risk his wrath because retribution is often direct no ill be on that plane tomorrow even if you have to tie me on the undercarriage not a bad idea at that the doc says i need plenty of fresh air kestner shrugged all right if you say so its your luck thats as black as pitch not mine exactly besides what would i do here in paris except go to maison chabanais or onetwo or one of those other puff houses the car leaves the hotel du louvre for le bourget at eight oclock tomorrow morning kestner shot me an exasperated weary sort of look and smacked the side of his thigh with his cap then he went away i closed my eyes for a moment and submitted to a long fit of coughing but i wasnt worried i was in a hospital in hospital people get better all the time some of them anyway chapter eightteen france it was early the next morning when an ss staff car arrived to drive me back to the hotel to collect my things and then to the airport paris still wasnt awake but for any decent frenchman the city probably looked better with eyes closed a detachment of soldiers was marching along the champselysees german trucks were pouring in and out of the army garage that was located in the grand palais and in case anyone was still in any doubt about it on the facade of the palais bourbon they were erecting a large v for victory and a sign that read germany is everywhere victorious it was a sunny summers day but paris looked almost as depressing as berlin still i was feeling better at my request the hospital doctor had shot me full of dope to put some raspberry into my beer amphetamines he said whatever it was i felt like st vitus was holding my hand it didnt stop the pain in my chest and throat from all the retching id done but i was ready to go flying all i had to do was go back to the hotel get into my uniform and find a nice tall building for a takeoff the hotel manager was pleased to see me standing up hed have been glad to see me in a flower vase its bad for business when guests die in their rooms i was alive and that was all that mattered my old room was closed up because of the strong smell of chemicals in there and my clothes had been taken to a suite on another floor he seemed relieved when i told him i was going south to biarritz for a few days i said i was going up to my new room and that i wanted to thank the maid whod saved my life and he said hed arrange this immediately then i went upstairs and took my fieldgrey uniform out of the closet it carried a strong smell of chemicals or gas and brought on a strong feeling of nausea as i recalled breathing the stuff i opened the french window hung my uniform there for a minute and then rinsed my face with cold water there was a knock at the door and i went to open it with shaking knees the maid was prettier than i remembered her nose wrinkled a little when she caught the smell of chemicals on my uniform although it could just as easily have been the sight of it but in truth it probably was the smell in the summer of it was still only germans czechs and poles who had good reason to fear the fieldgrey uniform of an sd captain thank you mademoiselle for saving my life it was nothing nothing to you but quite a bit to me you dont look very well she observed i feel better than i look i think but thats probably down to what was in the needle i had for breakfast this morning which is all very well but whats going to happen at dinner time if i live that long ill let you know like i said my life means quite a bit to me so im going to do you a favour relax its not that kind of favour underneath this uniform im really not a bad fellow how would you like to get some real hotel experience i dont mean making beds and cleaning toilets i mean in hotel management i can fix that for you in berlin at the adlon theres nothing wrong with this place but it strikes me that paris is going to be fine if youre german and not so fine if youre anything else youd do that for me all i need from you is a little information she smiled a coy little smile you mean about the man who tried to kill you see what i mean i knew you were too smart to be cleaning toilets smart enough but also confused why would one german officer want to murder another after all germany is everywhere victorious i smiled i liked her spirit thats what i mean to find out mademoiselle matter renata matter she nodded all right major captain captain bernhard gunther maybe theyll promote you if they dont kill you first theres always that possibility unfortunately i think im a lot harder to promote than i am to kill i started to cough again and kept it going for the sake of effect at least thats what i told myself i can believe that renata fetched me a glass of water she moved gracefully like a ballerina looked like one too being small and slim her hair was dark and quite short and a little boyish but i liked that what i previously saw as being homeliness now looked more like a very natural girlish beauty i drank the water then i said so what makes you think someone tried to kill me because there shouldnt have been a fire extinguisher in your room do you know where it is now the manager monsieur schreider he took it away pity theres one the same on the wall along the corridor would you like me to fetch it for you i nodded and she went out of my room and returned a moment later carrying a brass extinguisher made by the pyrene manufacturing company of delaware it had an integrated handpump that was used to expel a jet of liquid towards a fire and contained about nine litres of carbon tetrachloride the container wasnt pressurised and was designed to be refilled with a fresh supply of chemical after use through a filling plug when i found you the filler cap had been removed she said and the extinguisher was lying beside your bed the chemical had poured onto the carpet beneath your nose in other words it looked deliberate have you mentioned this to anyone no ones asked me everyone believes it was an accident for your own safety it would be best if they continue to believe that renata she nodded did you see anyone enter or leave my room or hanging around in the corridor outside renata thought for a moment i dont know to be honest with everyone in uniform all germans look more or less alike but not all of them are as handsome as me surely thats true perhaps thats why they tried to kill you out of jealousy i grinned i never thought of that as a motive i mean she sighed look theres something i havent told you and i want your word that youll leave my name out of it whenever you do what it is youre going to do i dont want any trouble itll be fine i said ill look after you and who looks after you maybe you were a champion when you walked into this hotel but right now you look like youre in need of a good corner man all right ill keep you out of it you have my word as a german officer whats that worth after munich good point how about my word as someone who detests hitler and all that he stands for including this ridiculous uniform better she said and who might wish the german army had never crossed the rhine except for one thing whats that i wouldnt have met you renata she laughed and looked away for a moment she was wearing a black uniform and a little white pinafore hesitantly she put a hand in the pocket of her pinafore and took out a brass plug about the size of a champagne cork handing it to me she said i found this the missing plug from the fire extinguisher in your room it was in the wastepaper basket of the man in room good girl can you find out the name of the officer whos in fiftyfive i already did his name is lieutenant willms nikolaus willms she paused do you know him i met him for the first time on the train from berlin hes a cop specialising in vice hates the french face like a snake charmer only without the charm thats about all i know about him i cant imagine why he would want to kill me it doesnt make any sense perhaps he made a mistake got the wrong room a french farce by georges feydeau doesnt normally include murder what will you do now nothing for the moment i have to leave paris for a few days maybe ill have thought of something by the time i come back in the meantime how would you like to earn some more german money doing what keep an eye on him and what am i supposed to look for youre a smart girl youll know you found this top from the extinguisher didnt you just bear in mind that hes dangerous and dont take any risks i wouldnt like anything to happen to you i took her hand and a little to my surprise she let me kiss it if i didnt think id start coughing id kiss you then youd better let me do it she kissed me and in my weakened condition i let her but after a moment or two i needed the air then i said when he gave me that shot this morning the doc warned me that i might feel like this a little euphoric like i was napoleon i pressed myself hard against her belly youre too big for napoleon she kissed me again and added and way too tall chapter nineteen france le bourget was about ten kilometres north of paris and so was i its strange how physically and mentally restorative one or two kisses can be it felt like a new kind of fairy tale in which a sleeping prince gets himself rescued by a plucky princess then again that could have been the dope at the entrance to the aerodrome was a statue of a nude woman taking flight from her grey stone plinth it was meant to commemorate lindberghs flight across the atlantic but the only memory that was alive in my head was the feel of renatas body and what it might look like if ever i saw her out of that maids uniform there were three of us me kestner and bomelburg pinned in the back of the staff car like a collection of taupe coloured moths in the front was an ss driver and a handsome young chief inspector from the office of the paris prefect of police as we drove towards the airport building a fourengined fw condor was landing on the runway who do you suppose that is wondered kestner its doctor goebbels said bomelburg taking his cue from the fuhrer to see the sights of paris here to cause trouble no doubt we were obliged to remain in our car for reasons of security until the mahatma propagandi had left the airport in an enormous beige mercedes i caught a glimpse of him as his car swept past ours he looked like a malignant goblin on his best behaviour when goebbels had gone our car made for a smaller twoengined plane that was awaiting us id never flown before neither had kestner nor the frenchman and we were all a little nervous as we walked toward the planes passenger door inside the fuselage we found another frenchman waiting for us an older taller man with a lautrec beard pincenez and a quiet forensic manner he was a commissioner of french police and his name was matignon the younger frenchman was even taller than his commissioner he wore an extremely wellcut charcoalgrey summer suit and a pair of thick rose tinted glasses his name was philippe oltramare neither of the two frenchmen seemed to speak much german but that was hardly a problem with frenchspeakers like kestner and bomelburg on board the plane a siebel fh a started its engines as soon as we were all aboard and that was the cue for everyone except me to light a cigarette following the injury to my lungs the insult of cigarettes seemed too much to bear and it wasnt long before another fit of coughing look me which prompted the others politely to extinguish their tobacco so i enjoyed a smokefree flight down to biarritz without further irritation to my lungs i sounded like the audience at a dirty movie mostly the conversation was in french but there were several names i recognised among them rudolf breitscheid the former german minister of the interior and doctor rudolf hilferding the former minister of finance both men had fled germany after hitlers election i asked bomelburg about them we think the two rudolfs are staying at a hotel in aries he said the commissioner here has already applied for their arrest but he seems to be encountering some local resistance i was pleased to hear it the two rudolfs had been the leading lights of the german social democratic party which i had voted for myself arresting a thug like erich mielke was one thing arresting breitscheid and hilferding was quite another we trust the commissioners physical presence in aries will overcome any opposition added bomelburg and showed me a list he had compiled of other wanted men mielkes name was second from the top underneath willy muenzenbergs a former comintern agent and leader of germanys communist exiles other names were less familiar to me i cant help noticing that this plane has only five seats i told bomelburg how am i supposed to get my prisoner back to paris that all depends if we manage to pick up grynszpan and mielke and some of these others we may have to have the french deliver them first to vichy and then apply to have them extradited across the border at least thats what commissioner matignon thinks so hes arranged for a french lawyer to meet us on the ground in biarritz its already looking more complicated than we had supposed complained kestner it turns out that this damned kuhnt commission isnt supposed to go into the camps until the end of august of course if we wait that long these commie jew bastards might easily give us the slip so were treading on eggshells at the moment were not even supposed to be here the flight was more straightforward and for the last forty minutes of a journey that lasted just under two hours we hugged the coastline of france and the bay of biscay from the air the city of biarritz appeared to be exactly what it was a luxurious seaside town it was a hot day and the beach was packed with people intent on having a good time in spite of the new german government i hadnt enjoyed the flight from paris there were too many potholes in the air for me to feel entirely comfortable with the experience of air travel but when i saw the size of the waves rolling onto the banded agate that was the beach i felt very glad i hadnt travelled there by boat under the clifftops that adjoined the sand the ocean was like the milk in one enormous frothy cappuccino just looking at it made me feel seasick although in truth that probably had a lot more to do with what id just learned about the two rudolfs that really made me feel sick muenzenberg i can understand i said grynszpan too but why the rudolfs hilferding is one of these jewish intellectuals said bomelburg not to mention the fact that he was the finance minister who was in league with other bankers who helped bring about the great depression anyway its not our problem its a french problem a test of their vichy governments resolve to become a german ally itll be interesting to see what happens why do you have any objections to his being arrested for a moment the plane dropped like a faulty lift i felt my stomach rise in my chest i wanted to puke right in the majors lap he fumbled in his tunic and produced a hip flask me no im just an oldfashioned copper you know shortsighted i see all kinds of things and i never do anything about them bomelburg took a bite of the flask and offered it to me swallow thats the best thing ive heard since i got into this tin pigeon on the ground at bayonne airport there were four bucket wagons waiting for us six ss storm troopers and the french lawyer the ss were goodhumoured and full of smiles the way men are when theyve won a war in less than six weeks the lawyer had a big nose thick glasses and hair so curly it was almost absurd to me he seemed like a jew but nobody was asking either way he was jumpy and nervous he lit a cigarette inside the lapel of this jacket to keep the wind off his match and smoke billowed out of his sleeve it was a real bestiary that drove east from biarritz something from the pages of hesiod with me in the leading bucket and moving at speed as if the beauty of the french countryside meant not a thing to any of us on the road we saw demobilised french soldiers who regarded us with neither hostility nor enthusiasm we also saw piles of abandoned military equipment rifles helmets ammunition boxes even a few pieces of artillery just beyond the village of stpalais we crossed the demarcation line into what was vichy france not that there was much love for the french so close to the spanish border as chief inspector oltramare who spoke better german than i had supposed now told me the bastards hate us french even more than they hate you germans he said they dont speak much french they dont speak much spanish im not even sure they speak basque several times we overtook family cars heaped with luggage heading east along the main road to toulouse why are they fleeing i asked oltramare dont they know about the armistice oltramare shrugged but as we overtook the next car he leaned out of the bucket and asked the occupants where they were going and when these answered he nodded politely and crossed himself theyre from biarritz he said theyre going to lourdes to pray for france he smiled for a miracle perhaps dont you believe in miracles oh yes that is why i believe in adolf hitler hes the one man who can save europe from the curse of bolshevism that is what i believe i suppose thats why he signed a deal with stalin i said to save us all from bolshevism but of course said oltramare as if such a thing was obvious dont you remember what happened in august germany gambled on defeating france before russia could mobilise and declare war which didnt happen its the same situation now only the molotovribbentrop pact meant that attacking france was much less of a gamble than it was before and you mark my words captain now that france is defeated the soviet union the true enemy of western democracy will be next in the little town of navarrenx we saw some german tanks and a couple of truckloads of ss and stopped to say hello and share cigarettes oltramare went to a shop to buy some matches and found there were none to be had there was nothing to be had of anything no food no vegetables no wine and no cigarettes he returned to the bucket cursing the locals you can bet these bastards are hiding what theyve got and waiting for the prices to go up so that they can gouge us he said wouldnt you do the same i said while he and i were talking many women came out of the local town hall and it turned out that nearly all of them were german internees from the nearby camp at gurs where theyd been taken from locations all over france they were pretty bitter about the conditions there but also because theyd been ordered to leave the area or face internment again as enemy aliens and this was why the ss had stayed on in navarrenx to prevent this from happening a truckload of ss and one of the women agreed to guide us to the camp at gurs which we were assured was not easily found so that we might conduct our search for wanted persons meanwhile the french lawyer monsieur savigny began to argue with commissioner matignon and major bomelburg about the presence of these ss troops in the french zone in my opinion oltramare told bomelburg afterwards you should shoot that man yes i think that would be best frankly i am surprised you have not shot more myself i would have shot a great many people especially the people who were in charge of this country to punish them would have been a mercy to let them go was barbarous and cruel frankly i dont know why you bother to take prisoners back to germany when you could just shoot them here by the roadside and save yourselves a lot of time and effort i frowned and shook my head at this display of pragmatic fascism why are you here chief inspector im looking for someone too he said with a shrug a fugitive just like you captain during the spanish civil war i fought on the nationalist side and i have a few scores to settle with some republicans you mean its personal when it involves the spanish civil war its always personal monsieur many atrocities were committed my own brother was murdered by a communist he was a priest they burned him alive inside his own church in catalonia the man in charge was a frenchman a communist from le havre and if you find him what then oltramare smiled i will arrest him captain gunther i wasnt so sure about that in fact i wasnt sure about anything as we left navarrenx and headed south to gurs the ss troops in the truck now leading the way were singing sieg heil viktoria i was starting to have misgivings about everything my driver and the corporal in the buckets front passenger seat were more interested in the woman seated beside oltramare and me than in singing her name was eva kemmerich and she was extremely thin which seemed to make her mouth too wide and her ears too big under her eyes were shadows like bat wings and she wore a pink handkerchief around her head to keep her hair tidy it looked like the rubber on top of a pencil in gurs she and the other women had suffered a tough time at the hands of the french conditions were barbaric she explained they treated us like dogs worse than dogs people talk about german anti semitism well its my considered opinion that the french just hate everyone who isnt french germans jews spanish poles italians they were all treated equally badly gurs is a concentration camp thats what it is and the guards are absolute bastards they worked us like slaves just look at my hands my nails theyre ruined she looked at oltramare with illconcealed contempt go on she told him look at them i am looking at them mademoiselle well whats the idea of treating human beings like that youre french whats the big idea franzi i have no explanation mademoiselle and i have no excuse all i can say is that before the war there were almost four million refugees living in france from countries all over europe thats ten per cent of our population what were we to do with so many people mademoiselle actually its madame she said i had a wedding ring but it was stolen by one of your french guards not that it ever stayed on my finger after the diet ive endured my husband is in another camp le vernet i hope things are better there my god it could hardly be any worse you know something im sorry the war is over i just wish our boys could have killed a lot more frenchmen before they were obliged to throw in the towel she leaned forward and tapped the corporal and the driver on their shoulders christ im proud of you boys you really gave the franzis a welldeserved kicking but if you want to put the cherry on my cake youll arrest the criminal whos in charge of the camp at gurs and shoot him down like the pig he is here i tell you what ill sleep with whichever one of you puts a bullet in that bastards head the corporal looked at the driver and grinned i could tell that the idea was not without appeal for him so i said and i will shoot whoever takes this lady up on her generous offer i took her bony hand in mine please dont do that again frau kemmerich i appreciate that youve had a rough time of it but i cant allow you to make things worse worse she sneered there isnt anything thats worse than gurs the camp situated in the foothills of the pyrenees was much larger than i had supposed covering an area of about a square kilometre and was split into two halves a makeshift street ran the length of the site and on each side there were three or four hundred wooden huts there seemed to be no sanitation or running water and the smell was indescribable i had been to dachau the only differences between gurs and dachau were that the barbedwire fence at gurs was smaller and not obviously electrified and there were no executions otherwise conditions seemed to be much the same and it was only after a parade was called in the mens half of the camp and we went in among the prisoners that it was possible to see how things were actually much worse than at dachau the guards were all french gendarmes each of whom carried a thick leather riding whip although none of them seemed to own a horse there were three islets a b and c the islet c adjutant was a gabin type with an effeminate mouth and narrow expressionless eyes he knew exactly where the german communists were held and without offering any resistance to our requests he took us to a dilapidated barrack containing fifty men who paraded before us outside exhibited signs of emaciation or illness but more often both it was clear theyd been expecting us or something like us and refusing to submit to a rollcall they started to sing the internationale meanwhile the french adjutant glanced over bomelburgs list and helpfully picked out some of our wanted men erich mielke wasnt one of these while this selection was proceeding i could hear eva kemmerich she was standing in our bucket which was parked on the street and shouting abuse at some of the prisoners who were still held in the camp these and a few of the gendarmes on the womens side of the wire responded by laughing at her and making obscene remarks and gestures for me the sense of being involved in some nameless insanity was compounded when the inmates of another hut the adjutant said they were french anarchists began to sing the marseillaise in competition with those who were singing the internationale we marched seven men out of the camp and into the buckets all of them raised clenched fists in the communist salute and shouted slogans in german or spanish to their fellow prisoners kestner caught my eye did you ever see anything like this place only dachau well i never saw anything like it to treat people this way even if they are communists seems disgusting dont tell me i pointed at chief inspector oltramare who was marching a handcuffed prisoner towards the buckets at gunpoint tell him looks like he got his man anyway i wonder if ill get mine i said mielke not here i shook my head i mean this fellow im after almost ruined my career the bolshie bastard as far as im concerned hes really got it coming im sure he has they all have communist swine but you were a communist werent you paul before you joined the nazi party me no whatever gave you that idea only i seem to recall you campaigning for ernst thalmann in when was that dont be fucking ridiculous bernie is this a joke he glanced nervously in bomelburgs direction i think that phosgene gas has addled your brains really have you gone mad no and actually its my impression that im probably the only sane one here as the day wore on this was an impression that did not alter indeed there was even greater madness to come chapter twenty france it was late afternoon when our convoy took to the road again we were headed to toulouse about one hundred and fifty kilometres to the northeast and thought that we could probably make it before dark we took eva kemmerich with us so that she might look for her husband when we visited the camp at le vernet the following day and of course our eight prisoners i hadnt really looked at them they were a miserable malnourished smelly lot and little or no threat to anyone let alone the third reich according to karl bomelburg one of them was a famous german writer and another a wellknown newspaperman only i hadnt heard of either of them outside lourdes in sight of the river gave de pau we stopped in a forest clearing to stretch our legs i was pleased to see bomelburg extend the same facility to our prisoners he even handed out some cigarettes i was feeling tired but better at least my chest was no longer hurting but i still wasnt smoking i took another bite off bomelburgs flask and decided that maybe he wasnt such a bad fellow after all this whole area is full of caves and grottoes he said and pointed at an outcrop of rock that hung above our heads like a thick grey cloud we caught a glimpse of frau kemmerich disappearing into the rock after a minute or two bomelburg said perhaps you would be good enough to go and inform frau bernadette that we shall be leaving in five minutes instinctively i glanced at my watch yes herr major i walked up the slope to fetch her calling her name out loud in case she was answering a call of nature yes i found her sitting on a rock in a leaflined grotto smoking a cigarette isnt it lovely here she said pointing over my head i turned to admire the view of the pyrenees that she was enjoying yes it is sorry if i was a bitch back there she said youve no idea how bad the last nine months have been my husband and i were in dijon when war was declared hes a wine merchant they arrested us almost immediately forget it i said what happened back there you were justifiably upset and the camp did look bloody awful i nodded down the slope come on wed better go back theres still a long way to go before we get to toulouse she stood up how long will it take to get there i was about to answer her when i heard two or three loud bursts of machinegun fire none of them longer than a couple of seconds but then it takes only five seconds to empty an mps thirtytworound magazine the sound and smell of it were still hanging in the air by the time i had sprinted down the slope into the clearing two storm troopers were standing a couple of metres apart their jackboots surrounded with spent ammunition that looked like so many coins tossed to a couple of buskers as welltrained soldiers they were already changing the toylike magazines on their machine pistols and looking just a little surprised at their murderous efficiency thats the thing about a gun it always looks like a toy until it starts killing people a little further away lay the bodies of the eight prisoners we had brought from gurs what the hell happened here i shouted but i knew the answer already they tried to make a run for it said bomelburg i went forward to inspect the bodies all of them i said in a straight line one of the shot men groaned he lay on the forest floor his knees collapsed under him his torso lying back on his feet in an almost impossible position like some old indian fakir but there was nothing to be done for him his head and chest were covered in blood angrily i walked towards bomelburg they would have run away in several directions i said not all of them down the same slope a pistol shot bored another hole through the still air of the forest and the groaning mans head i turned on my boot heel to see kestner holstering his walther p seeing my expression kestner shrugged and said best to finish him i think back at the alex wed have called that murder i said well were not back at the alex are we captain said bomelburg look here gunther are you calling me a liar those men were shot while trying to escape do you hear there was a lot i could have said but the only thing that was true was the fact that i had no business being there it wasnt just the bodies of fallen heroes that the valkyries carried up to valhalla but also those of berlin chief inspectors who criticised their senior officers in remote french forests after i remembered that there seemed little point in saying anything but there was still plenty i could do for his face and my neck i even offered an apology to bomelburg when the toe of my boot would have seemed more appropriate in my own defence i should also add that the two mp machine pistols were now reloaded and ready for lethal business we left the bodies where they lay and took our places in the buckets only this time it was kestner and not oltramare who sat with me and frau kemmerich kestner could see i was upset about what had happened and after my earlier remarks about his membership of the kpd he was in the mood to press home what he now perceived to be some kind of advantage over me whats the matter cant bear the sight of blood and i thought you were a tough guy gunther let me tell you something paul although its none of your business ive killed people before in the war after that i thought the whole world had learned a lesson but it hasnt if i have to kill someone again im going to make sure i make a good start by killing someone i want to kill someone who needs killing so keep chirruping in my ear and see what happens comrade youre not the only man in this bucket who can put a bullet in the back of another mans head he was quiet after that the evening turned to dusk i kept my eyes on the trees above the road and if i stayed silent it was because the noise inside my head was indescribable i suppose it was the echo of those machine pistols i would hardly have been surprised to find the ghosts of the men we had slain sitting in the buckets beside us silent and motionless withdrawn into my own ego i waited for the nightmare that was our journey to end toulouse was called the rose city almost all the buildings in the centre of town including our hotel le grand balcon were pink as if we had been looking through the chief inspectors rosecoloured spectacles i decided to adopt this as a persona to help me achieve what i now needed to achieve and my breathing was easier now which also helped so the following morning at breakfast i greeted major bomelburg and the two french policemen warmly i was even courteous to paul kestner my apologies for yesterday i said generally but before i left paris the doctor at the hospital gave me something to help me carry out my duties and he warned me that after it wore off i might behave in a peculiar way perhaps i shouldnt have come at all but as you can probably imagine i was rather anxious to carry out the mission given to me by general heydrich at almost any cost to myself bomelburg was looking rather more thin and grey than the day before kestner might have spent the whole night polishing his bald head so shiny did it seem oltramare said something in french to the commissioner who put on his pincenez and regarded me with indifference before nodding his apparent approval the commissioner says you look much better said oltramare and i must say i agree yes indeed said bomelburg much better yesterday cant have been easy for you gunther all that travelling when you were clearly not yourself its commendable that you wanted to come at all under the circumstances i shall certainly say so to colonel knochen when i make my report in paris what with the good news i just had from commissioner matignon this is turning out to be a very good day dont you agree kestner yes sir what good news is that i asked smiling with toulousecoloured optimism why that weve got the jew who assassinated vom rath said bomelburg grynszpan he chuckled apparently he knocked on the door of the prison here in toulouse and asked to be let in oltramare was laughing too he said apparently he speaks very little french had no money and thought that we might be able to protect him against you fellows the stupid kike muttered kestner im on my way to the prison now with the commissioner and monsieur savigny to organise grynszpans extradition back to paris and then berlin the fuhrer wants a trial apparently said bomelburg at all costs there must be a trial in berlin i tried not to sound surprised why not in berlin said bomelburg its just that the murder took place in paris i said and it was my understanding that grynszpans not even a german citizen hes a pole isnt he i smiled im sorry sir but sometimes its hard for me to stop being a cop and thinking about little things like jurisdiction bomelburg wagged his finger at me youre just doing your job old fellow but i know this case better than anyone before i joined the gestapo i was with our foreign service in paris and i spent three months working on this case for one thing poland is now a part of the greater german reich as is france and for another the murder took place in the german embassy here in paris technically diplomatically that was german soil and that makes a big difference yes of course i said meekly that does make a big difference certainly it had made a big difference to germanys jews herschel grynszpans murder of a junior official in the paris embassy in november had been used as an excuse by the nazis to launch a massive pogrom at home until the night of november th kristallnacht it was almost possible to imagine that i still lived in a civilised country the trial was certain to be the kind the nazis liked a show trial with the verdict a foregone conclusion but if bomelburg was being honest at least grynszpan wasnt about to be murdered by the roadside leaving kestner matignon and savigny to go to the prison st michel in toulouse bomelburg and i accompanied by six ss men set off on the sixtyfivekilometre drive south to le vernet frau kemmerich did not come with us as it seemed her husband was after all in another french concentration camp at moisdonlariviere in brittany le vernet was near pamiers and the camp was a short way south of the local railway station which bomelburg described as convenient there was a cemetery to the north of the camp but he neglected to mention if that was convenient too although i was sure it would be le vernet was even worse than gurs surrounded by miles of barbed wire in an otherwise deserted patch of french countryside the many huts looked like coffins laid out after some giants battle they were in a deplorable state as were the two thousand men who were imprisoned there many of them emaciated and guarded by wellfed french gendarmes the prisoners laboured to build an inadequate road between the railway station and the cemetery there were four rollcalls a day each of them lasting half an hour we arrived just before the third explained our mission to the french policeman in charge and he handed us politely over to the care of a vilelooking officer who smelt strongly of aniseed and his yellowfaced corsican sergeant they listened as oltramare translated the details of our mission monsieur aniseed nodded and led the way into the camp bomelburg and i followed pistols in hand as we had been warned that the men of hut thirtytwo the leper barrack were considered the most dangerous in camp le vernet oltramare followed at a distance also armed and the three of us waited outside while several french gendarmes entered the pitchblack barrack and drove the occupants outside with whips and curses these men were in a disgraceful condition worse than at gurs and even worse than dachau their ankles were swollen and their bellies distended from starvation they wore cheap looking galoshes on their feet and the same ragged clothing theyd probably been wearing since the winter of when they had fled the advance of francos nationalist army some of them were halfnaked they were all infested with vermin they knew what was coming but were too beaten to sing the internationale in defiance of our presence it took several minutes for the barrack to empty and the men to line up again just as you thought the barrack couldnt contain any more men others came out until there were three hundred and fifty of them paraded in front of us the judgement line from purgatory to hell could not have looked more abject and with every second i was confronted with their gaunt unshaven faces the more i wanted to shoot monsieur aniseed and his fat gendarmes while the corsican called the roll bomelburg checked his clipboard looking for names that tallied and while they did that i walked between their ranks like the kaiser come to hand out a few iron crosses to the bravest of the brave looking to see if i could pick out a man i hadnt seen for nine years but i never saw him there and i never heard his name called out not that i put much faith in a name from everything id read about him in heydrichs file erich mielke was too smart to have been arrested and interned using his real name bomelburg knew this of course but there were others who had not been possessed of the same presence of mind as the german comintern agent and as these few men were identified they were led away to the administration barracks by the gendarmes hes not in this barrack i said finally the adjutant says theres another allgerman barrack in this section said oltramare this one is all international brigade and it would make sense for mielke to keep away from them especially now that stalin has closed his doors to them the men from barrack thirtytwo were driven back inside and we repeated the whole exercise with the men from barrack thirtythree according to the yellowfaced corsican he looked like a careless tanner these were all communists who had fled from hitlers germany only to find themselves interned as undesirable aliens when war was declared in september consequently these men were in rather better shape than their comrades from the international brigades that wouldnt have been difficult once again i walked up and down the lines of prisoners while bomelburg and the corsican called the roll these faces were more defiant than the others and most of the men met my eye with unshifting hatred some were jews i thought others were more obviously aryan once or twice i paused and stared levelly at a man but i never identified any of the prisoners as erich mielke not even when i recognised him as the corsican finished the rollcall i walked back to bomelburgs side shaking my head no luck no hes not there are you sure some of these fellows are a shadow of their former selves six months in this place and i doubt my own wife would recognise me have another look captain all right sir and while i looked at the prisoners again i made an announcement for the sake of impressing bomelburg listen i said were looking for a man called erich fritz emil mielke perhaps you know him by a different name i dont care about his politics hes wanted for the murders of two berlin policemen in im sure many of you read about it in the newspapers at the time this man is thirtythree years old fairhaired medium height brown eyes protestant from berlin he attended the kolnisches gymnasium probably speaks russian quite well and a bit of spanish maybe hes good with his hands his father is a woodworker all the time i was speaking i could feel mielke looking at me knowing id recognised him the way hed recognised me and doubtless wondering why i didnt arrest him straight away and what the hell was going on i holstered my pistol and took off my officers cap in the hope i might look a little less like a nazi gentlemen i make you this promise if any one of you identifies erich mielke to me now i will personally speak to the camp commander with a view to organising your release as soon as possible it was the kind of promise that a nazi would have made a shifting promise that no one would have trusted i hoped so because after what had happened to the prisoners from gurs in the forest near lourdes the last thing i wanted to do was help the nazis arrest any more germans even a german who had murdered two policemen i couldnt do anything about the other men who were on bomelburgs list but i was damned if i was going to finger any more germans for heydrich not now once again i met erich mielkes eye he didnt look away and i suppose he guessed what i was doing he was older than i remembered him of course broader and more powerful looking especially across the shoulders he wore a light beard but there was no mistaking the surlylooking mouth the watchful ruthless eyes or the coxcomb of unruly hair on top of his largish head he must have thought i was a beefsteak nazi brown on the outside red on the inside but he couldnt have been more wrong the murders of anlauf and lenck had been just about the most cowardly id ever seen and nothing would have pleased me more than to have snapped him for it and for the berlin courts to have sent him for a permanent haircut but much as i disliked him now i disliked the casual instinctive brutality of the nazi police state even more i almost wanted to tell him that but for the murders of eight men on a country road the day before hed have been on his way to a date with a man wearing white gloves and a top hat i turned away and walked back to bomelburg with a shrug it was worth a shot he said neither of us expected what happened next i dont know an erich mielke said a voice the man was small and jewishlooking with short dark curly hair and shifty brown eyes a lawyers face which could have been why there was a large bruise on his cheek i dont know an erich mielke he repeated now that he had our attention but i would like to become a nazi some of the other prisoners laughed some whistled but the man kept going i was arrested by the french because i was a german communist he said i wasnt an enemy of france then but i am now its true i really hate and despise these people worse than i used to hate the nazis i spend all day moving latrine bins and for the rest of my life im forever going to associate france with the smell of shit the corsicans eyes narrowed and he moved towards the man with his whip raised no said bomelburg let the fellow speak im glad france was defeated said the prisoner and since im declaring myself to be an enemy of france id also like to join the german army and become a loyal soldier of the fatherland and a follower of adolf hitler who knows i know the wars over but i might just get the chance to shoot a franzi which would really make me very happy his fellow prisoners started to jeer but i could see that major bomelburg was impressed so if you dont mind sir when you leave this shithole id like to come with you bomelburg smiled well he said i think youd better and he did but it said a lot about the rest of the germans in barrack thirtythree that there was no one else that followed his example not one chapter twentyone germany jesus christ gunther exclaimed one of my american interrogators are you trying to tell us that you had that communist bastard mielke in your power and you let him go yes i am what are you crazy thats twice you saved his bacon did you ever think about that jesus of course i thought about it i mean didnt you ever regret that i dont think i could have made myself clear i said even while i was doing it even while i was pretending i didnt recognise him i regretted it captain anlauf s murder left three orphaned daughters you see what youve got to remember is that for a while back there in the dog days of weimar the communists were every bit as loathsome as the nazis maybe more so after all it was the comintern that ordered the german communist party to treat the countrys governing spd as the main enemy not the nazis can you imagine it in the red referendum of july the kpd and the nazis marched together and voted together that was the nonaggression pact in miniature i always hated them for that it was the reds who really destroyed the republic not the nazis i helped myself to another of the amis cigarettes and if that wasnt enough theres my own experience of soviet hospitality to take into account as well for why i hate the communists well we all hate the reds said the man with the pipe no you hate the reds because youve been told to hate them but for five years they were your allies roosevelt and truman shook hands with stalin and pretended he was different from hitler which he wasnt i hate the reds because ive learned to hate them the way a dog learns to hate the man who beats it regularly during weimar during the war on the russian front but most of the reason i hate them is because i spent almost two years in a soviet labour camp and until i met you boys i thought that was about as much hate as i could have for any one race of people were not so bad the man with the pipe took it out of his mouth and started to refill it when you get to know us you can get used to anything its true i said the man with the glasses tutted loudly by now i vaguely recognised him from seven years earlier at the stiftskaserne hospital in vienna after all the trouble we had getting you this exclusive suite he said he started to clean his glasses with the end of his tie im hurt when youre done cleaning your glasses i said the windows in here could use a wipe too im particular about windows particularly when i know whos been breathing on them theres nothing about this cell i like now i know who was in here last the man with the pipe was finally lighting up hitler would have hated his pipe it looked as if id found one reason at last to like adolf hitler the ami sucked at the stem blew out some sweet smoke and said i watched an old newsreel the other day of hitler making a speech at tempelhof field in berlin there were one million people that day apparently it took twelve hours just to get everyone in there and another twelve to get them all out again i guess you were the only berliner who stayed home that night berlin nightlife was much better before the nazis i said thats what i hear people say it was quite something degenerate but lively all those clubs striptease dancers naked ladies open homosexuality what were you people thinking i mean no wonder the nazis got an in he shook his head on the other hand munichs kind of dull i think it has some advantages i said there are no ivans in munich is that why you lived there after you were in that pow camp instead of berlin one reason i suppose you were in and out of that camp relatively quickly he had finished cleaning his glasses and put them back on his head they were still too small for him and i wondered if american heads were like american stomachs and kept on growing faster than those in europe in comparison with a lot of other guys i mean some of your old comrades are only just coming home now i was lucky i said i escaped how mielke was involved then well pick it up there tomorrow shall we in here ten oclock youd better clear that with my secretary i said tomorrows the day when i start writing my book what did i tell you you know this is a great room for a writer maybe the spirit of adolf hitler will come and help you out with a few pages seriously though said the other ami if you need pen and paper to make a few notes about mielke just ask the guard might help to jog your memory if you wrote a few things down why now why not before because things are starting to become more important mielke starts to become more important so the more details you can remember the better i know one spirit that might help a lot i said and it isnt hitlers yeah im a little bit like goethe i said when im writing a book i find that a bottle of good german brandy usually helps is there such a thing as a good german brandy ill settle for some cheap vodka only a man needs a hobby when hes got his feet in the cement something to take his mind off the present and put it somewhere in the past about seven years ago to be more accurate all right said the man with the glasses well get you a bottle of something and i would like to catch up on my smoking id given up until i left cuba since i met you ive got a much better reason to kill myself they left me alone after that pencils and paper a bottle of brandy a clean glass a couple of packets of cigarettes and some matches and even a newspaper arrived and i placed them all on the table and just watched them for a while enjoying the freedom to have a drink or not have a drink its the little things that can make prison tolerable like a door key by all accounts theyd let hitler have the run of landsberg and hed treated the place more like a hotel than a penitentiary not that he was in any way penitent about the putsch of of course i lay down on the bed and tried to relax but it wasnt easy in that cell was this why theyd put me in here or was it just an american idea of a joke i tried not to think about adolf hitler but he kept on getting up from the desk and full of impatience going to the window and staring out through the bars in that pose he always had of a man chosen by destiny the curious thing was id never really thought about hitler for years when he was still alive i tried not to think of him at all dismissing him as a crank before he was elected chancellor of germany and after that happened merely wishing him dead but now that i was lying on the bed where for nine months he had dreamed his autocratic dreams it seemed impossible not to pay attention to the man with blue eyes at the window as i watched he sat down at the desk again picked up the pen and started to write covering the sheets of paper with furious scribbling and sweeping each page off the table and onto the floor as he finished so that i might pick them up and read what was written at first the sentences made no sense at all but gradually these became more coherent affording glimpses into the extraordinary phenomenon that was hitlers mind whatever he wrote was based on his own incontrovertible logic and served as a perfect guide for the commission of evil worked out to the most minute detail it was like sitting in the same asylum cell as the insane doctor mabuse together with the ghosts of all those he had exterminated and watching him write his last criminal testament at last he stopped writing and leaning back on the chair turned to look at me feeling this was my chance to put him on the spot i tried to frame a question of the kind that robert jackson the chief american prosecutor at nuremberg might have asked but this was more difficult than i might have imagined there wasnt any single question beyond a simple why that i could have asked and i was still wrestling with this realisation when he spoke to me so what happened next i tried to stifle a yawn you mean when i left le vernet of course we went back to toulouse i said from there we drove to vichy and handed our prisoners to the french then we drove to the border of the occupied zone bourges i think it was and waited for the french to deliver them back to us a ridiculous arrangement but one that seemed to suit the hypocrisy of the french these prisoners included poor herschel grynszpan from bourges we drove back to paris where the prisoners were locked up before being flown to berlin well you probably know better than me what happened to grynszpan i know he was in sachsenhausen for a while and there never was a show trial of course a trial was unnecessary said hitler his guilt was obvious besides it might have been embarrassing for petain just like the riom trial when that jew leon blum gave evidence against laval i nodded yes i can see that i didnt hear anything about what happened to him said hitler at any rate i cannot recollect at the end i had quite a lot on my mind himmler probably dealt with him i dare say he was one of those whose hash got settled by the ss at flossenburg in the last days of the war but you know grynszpan had it coming after all theres no doubt that he really did murder ernst vom rath no doubt at all the jew just wanted to kill an important german and vom rath was merely the unlucky man he killed there were plenty of witnesses to the murder who came forward and told the truth about what happened not that you would know the meaning of truth your behaviour at le vernet was a gross act of deceit and betrayal to me and your fellow officers yes it was i said but ill live with it did you go straight back to berlin no i stayed on in paris for a while pretending to make further inquiries about erich mielke a lot of other german communists and men from the international brigade had volunteered for the french foreign legion to escape from the gestapo in france the legion never paid much attention to a mans past you enlisted in marseille and served in the french colonies with no questions asked it was easy to suggest in my report to heydrich that this was how he had escaped us the truth is rather more interesting not to me said hitler what im more interested in is what you did about the officer who tried to murder you what makes you think i did anything at all because i know men go on admit it you got even with him didnt you this lieutenant nikolaus willms yes i did hitler was triumphant i knew it you sit there with your kangaroo court robert jackson questions but underneath youre no different from me that makes you a hypocrite gunther a hypocrite yes thats true so what did you do denounce him to the gestapo the same way you helped denounce that other fellow the gestapo captain from wiirzburg what was his name again weinberger i shook my head no thats not what happened of course you had heydrich take care of him heydrich was always very good at getting rid of people for a mischling he was an excellent nazi i suppose he felt he had to try that much harder to prove himself to me hitler laughed thats the only reason we ever kept him on no it wasnt like that either i didnt involve heydrich hitler turned his chair around to face me and rubbed his hands i want to hear it all every sordid detail i yawned again i was feeling tired my eyes kept on closing all i really wanted to do was go to sleep and dream of somewhere different i order you to tell me is that a fuhrer order if you like i gave a little jolt the way you do when sleep takes you for a ride and instead you get the crazy idea you just died this little death is a wonderful sensation it reminds you why it is that breathing feels so good chapter twentytwo france it certainly felt good in the summer of and there was no better place to be breathing air than paris especially when i had the little maid from the lutetia hotel to keep me amused not that i took advantage of her as a matter of fact i was rather scrupulous where renata was concerned it was one of the ways i had of convincing myself i wasnt as big a rat as the field grey said i was this wasnt onegins sermon i mean i wanted her and eventually i had her but i took my time about it the way you do when you like whats between a girls ears as much as you want whats between her legs and when it happened it felt like it was something shaped by a higher motive than simple lust it wasnt love exactly neither of us wanted to get married but it was romance courtship desire fear and dread yes there was fear and dread too because renata always knew i would go and slay my fireextinguishing dragon just as soon as i knew why hed sought to put me out for good while id been away in the south of france renata had searched willmss room and once or twice even followed him to discover that he ate at maxims almost every other night on a generals pay this would have been unusual enough but for a mere lieutenant it was nothing short of miraculous and i resolved to visit the restaurant myself in the hope that this might provide me with some clue as to why he had tried to kill me and in this respect it was fortunate for me that maxims was now run by otto horcher who owned a restaurant in berlinschoneberg in the spring of otto had been a client of mine when id been running a successful business as a licensed private investigator id worked undercover as a waiter in his place for a couple of weeks in order to find out who was stealing from him as it turned out everyone was stealing from him but one man the majordomo was stealing a lot more than all of the others put together after that we were friends and even though he was a nazi and a good friend of gorings which was how he came to be managing the most famous restaurant in paris i could always count on him for a table when i needed to impress someone because after borchardt horchers was the best restaurant in berlin maxims was in the rue royale in the eighth arrondissement and a shrine to art nouveau red velvet and grande cuisine parked outside were several german staff cars but you didnt need to be german to eat at maxims when i went along there with renata pierre laval one of vichys leading politicians was there and so was fernand de brinon all you needed was money quite a lot of money and some bismuth tablets in maxims was a good place for men and women who knew what they wanted and how to get it no matter what the price probably still is we went through the door and were shown straight to a table or at least as straight as the oleaginous and fawning waiter could manage can you afford this asked renata glancing over the menu with widening eyes it makes me feel young again i said that was the last time i felt this poor so what are we doing here looking for the one thing thats not on this menu information about your friend willms you know if you keep on calling him that even in the spirit of jest im going to have to show you how much i dislike him she shuddered visibly no please i dont want to know she glanced around the restaurant i dont see him in here she did a doubletake on laval all the same he should be there are more snakes in here than in the whole of africa i didnt know you were so well travelled no just travelled obviously you havent seen africa im beginning to think i made a mistake about you renata i had the quaint idea that you were the girl next door where my parents live in berne if youd ever met the girl next door you know why i came to paris the maitre d arrived with two menus and more attitude than a professor of aeronautics renata found him a little intimidating me id been intimidated before and usually by someone holding something more deadly than a wine list whats your name i asked him albert monsieur albert glaser well albert it was my impression that germany had stopped paying france war reparations but i can see from the prices on this menu that i was wrong about that our prices dont seem to bother most of the other german officers who come in here monsieur thats what victory does for nazis albert it makes them profligate careless arrogant me im just a humble german from berlin whos anxious to renew my acquaintance with a certain monsieur horcher do me a favour will you albert go and whisper in his ear that bernie gunther is in the store oh and bring us a bottle of mosel the nearer the rhine the better albert bowed stiffly and went away you dont like the french do you said renata im doing my best i said but they make it so difficult even in defeat they seem to persist in the belief that this is the best country in the world maybe it is maybe thats why they didnt have the best army if youre going to be a philosopher youre going to have to grow an enormous beard or a silly moustache those are the only people we take seriously in germany horcher arrived bearing a bottle of mosel and three glasses bernie gunther he said shaking my hand well ill be otto this is fraulein renata matter a friend of mine horcher kissed her hand sat down and then poured the wine so this is you teaching the hen to be as clever as an egg is it otto you mean me here in paris horcher shrugged he was a big man with a face like a german generals bavarian or viennese by origin i forget which he always had the air of a man in search of a beer and a brass band if fat hermann asks you to do something for him then you dont say no right he chuckled he likes this place a lot its the snooty french waiters hes got a problem with which is why im here to make him and the red stripes feel at home and to cook some of their favourite dishes im interested in one of your lowerranking customers i explained lieutnant nikolaus willms know him hes one of my regulars always pays cash you cant get many lieutenants in here did he win the german lottery must have been the south german and the sachsen with a firstclass ticket at these prices otto horcher looked around and leaned toward me this place gets a lot of joygirls bernie highend courtesans they call them here in paris but theyre whores just the same your pardon miss matter its not a subject to discuss in front of a lady dont apologise herr horcher she said i came to paris for an education so please speak frankly thank you miss this fellow willms seems to know an awful lot of these girls bernie so i ask some questions i mean i like to know the customers thats just good business anyway it seems this willms has the power to close down any maison de plaisir in paris apparently he used to be a vice cop in berlin and can bounce the ball off all the cushions the word i heard was that the ones that pay he leaves open and the ones that dont he closes down a good oldfashioned shakedown thats a nice little gold mine i said theres more said horcher you see theres a diamond mine too have you heard of the onetwotwo and the maison chabanais sure theyre highclass houses that only the germans can go to i guess they paid up horcher nodded like it was the winter relief but willms was clever theres a third highclass house where you need a codeword to get through the door and which is by invitation only and willms is printing the stationery horcher nodded guess who got an invitation when he was on a flying trip to paris the mahatma propagandi thats right horcher sounded surprised that i had guessed you should have been a detective do you know that surely willms cant be doing this on his own i dont know if he is or not but i do know who he often has dinner with theyre both german officers one of them is general schaumberg the other is a sipo captain like yourself name of paul kestner thats interesting i let that one sink in a long way before my next question otto you wouldnt happen to have an address for this puffhouse would you twentytwo rue de provence opposite the hotel drouot in the ninth arrondissement thanks otto i owe you one after dinner there was still an hour before the midnight curfew and i told renata to take the metro back to her tiny apartment in the rue jacob be careful she said its all right i said i shant go in ill just i didnt say be good i said be careful willms has already tried to kill you once i dont think hed hesitate to try again especially now that youre on to his racket dont worry i know what im doing it would have been nice if this had been true but i didnt know what i was doing for the simple reason i still didnt have a clue why willms had tried to kill me i decided to walk to the rue de provence in the hope that the exercise and the summer air might help me to figure things out for a while i was racking my brains for something i might have said to willms on the train from berlin something that might have made him think i was a threat to his nefarious little organisation and gradually i formed the conclusion that it was nothing i had said it was what i was that might have alarmed him at the alex it was generally supposed that i was heydrichs spy and willms who worked there for a while would have known that even if he didnt paul kestner would certainly have said as much for his part kestner had hardly believed that id come all the way from berlin to arrest just one man if the two of them were partners then getting rid of me might have looked like a wise precaution and willms was just the type to have taken the matter in hand of greater concern perhaps was how general schaumberg was involved and before my theory was complete i was going to need to know something more about him this seemed more urgent when arriving outside twentytwo rue de provence i discovered even more staff cars than had been parked in front of maxims for several minutes i stood at a distance in a doorway on the opposite side of the street watching the comings and goings at what on the face of it was a smart address with a liveried doorman twice i saw a german officer arrive utter a single word to the doorman and be admitted inside it seemed obvious that unless i uttered the codeword i had no chance of getting into the maison and i was just about to give up and return to my hotel when a staff car turned the corner and i caught a glimpse of the officer in the back seat he was unremarkable in every way save the red and gold patches on his collar and the blue max he wore around his neck the pour la merite popularly known as the blue max isnt a common decoration and led me to think that this could be none other than the commandant of paris general alfred von vollardbockel burg himself and seeing him headed to the maison gave me an idea what you have to remember is that many of the general staff in paris in were tremendous francophiles that relations with the french were good and that german officers all went out of their way to avoid giving offence to the french or treading on their administrative toes by now the general who couldnt have been more than five feet tall even in his boots had got out of the car and was repeating the codeword to the doorman i took off my hat and sprinted toward this diminutive hero as the puffhouse door opened seeing me near the general an aidedecamp blocked my path this man was a colonel with a monocle general i said general von vollardbockelberg i put on my cap and saluted smartly yes said the general and returned my salute his head was almost hairless he looked like a baby with a moustache thank god sir willms is it this was better than i had hoped for i glanced nervously at the doorman wondering if he spoke much german and risked clicking my heels which to a german officer at least always meant yes im so glad i caught you herr general apparently theres a detachment of french gendarmes on their way here to raid this place what general schaumberg assured me that this establishment was beyond reproach oh im sure the general is right sir but the prefecture of paris has been given orders by the german morality commission that maisons de plaisir employing coloureds or jews are to be closed down the women arrested and any german officers found on the premises checked for venereal disease i signed that order myself said the general that order was for the protection of the ordinary rank and file not for senior german officers not for maisons like this i know sir but the french sir it would appear that they didnt appreciate that sir or at least have chosen not to appreciate it if you receive my meaning i glanced urgently at my watch what time is this raid to take place asked the general well that all depends sir not everyone in paris has bothered to set all clocks to german time as per your orders sir and that includes the french police if the raid takes place according to paris time then it might happen at any minute but if its berlin time then there might yet be time to get everyone else in the maison out before an embarrassing incident occurs hes right sir said the aide there are still a great many french paying no attention to official german time the little general nodded willy he said to the aide go in there and discreetly inform all general staff officers you can find that the story is out on this place ill wait for you in the car would you like me to help herr colonel yes thank you captain willms and thank you for your presence of mind i clicked my heels again and followed the colonel through the door while the little general explained things to the doorman in what sounded like excellent french i went up a curving castiron staircase and found myself in a tall elegant room with a chandelier as big as the underside of an iceberg and several rococo murals that might have been painted by fragonard if ever hed been asked to illustrate the memoirs of casanova with extreme obscenity the vaulted gilt ceiling looked like the inside of a faberge egg there were plenty of chairs and sofas that had been upholstered with the aid of an aircompressor they had long legs and narrow ankles with ball and claw feet the girls seated on the chairs and sofas had long legs and narrow ankles and for all i knew ball and claw feet as well only i wasnt paying that much attention to their feet because there were other details of their appearance that commanded my attention first all of them were naked the angle of this goldplated puffhouse was that every man with a red stripe on his trouser leg might sit in leisurely judgement of these olympian beauties like paris with his especially inscribed apple there was even a bowl of fruit on the table these were attractive thoughts but i was in a hurry and before the temps perdu patronne could give me her couple mother spiel i had grabbed a natural blonde and herded her towards a bedroom with a couple of wellplaced slaps on her wellplaced derriere it wasnt that i was interested in having her but i was in urgent need of a door to lock and wait behind while the generals aide set about raising the alarm already i could hear him warning other officers that the police were on their way to raid the place and it wasnt very long before the sound of many boots was heard on the stairs as the maisons exclusive clientele left the building hurriedly meanwhile i tried to reassure my beautiful naked companion that there was nothing at all to worry about and asked her questions about willms kestner and schaumberg her name was yvette and she spoke excellent german as did nearly all of the girls at number twentytwo probably that was why theyd been selected to work there in the first place general schaumberg is the deputy commander of berlin she explained he seems to spend most of his time touring parisian brothels him and his adjutant whos a german count the graf waldersee and theres a prince in tow as well the prince von ratibor the prince and his dog are here at least twice a week all brothel certificates are issued by schaumbergs office and together with kestner and willms theyve already made it into a nice little racket the germans win both ways they get paid off for a certificate they get laid by the best whores but the brains of the outfit is willms he used to be a flic so he knows how a maison works a bastard too takes a slice of everything most evenings hes in his office here up on the top floor cooking the books to show schaumberg is he here now he was i expect hes already on the phone to schaumbergs office trying to find out what the hells going on what is going on i thought it best not to tell her any more than she needed to know after about half an hour i went upstairs there was no one to be seen but i could hear someone on the floor above shouting in french i quickened my steps and arrived on a landing outside an open office door willms was on the telephone behind a desk he was sitting next to an open safe as if he thought it might keep him warm perhaps it would have done too there was enough money in it seeing me there he put down the phone and nodded i suppose it was you he said the person who gave out that the gendarmerie was coming to raid this place thats right i didnt want to embarrass any of those red stripes when i put you under arrest willms me under arrest he chuckled its you whos going to be in trouble gunther not me half of the general staff in paris are sharing in this particular bottle my friend some very important heads are going to feel sore about what youve done here tonight theyll get over it in a few days those wehrmacht counts and princes will forget a rat like you ever even existed willms the amount of coal theyre raking back from this place i dont think so see youre trying to flood a very nice little money pit here the only question is why or maybe youve got something against your brother officers having a thump now and again im not arresting you for being a pimp willms though thats what you are personally ive got nothing at all against pimps a man cant help what he is no im arresting you for attempted murder oh and whose murder is it that im supposed to have attempted mine you can prove that can you im a detective remember ive got a little thing called evidence not to mention a witness and if im right a motive too not that ill need any of these things when himmler finds out what youve been up to here in paris willms hes rather less understanding than me when it comes to the conduct of men wearing the uniform of his beloved ss somehow i get the feeling that his opinion of your conduct is going to matter a lot more than general schaumbergs youre serious arent you i always take it seriously when someone tries to gas me with the contents of a chemical fire extinguisher and by the way i checked back with the alex it seems that before you joined the police you worked for the fire brigade i dont see that proves a thing it proves you know something about fire extinguishers and it would account for how it was that the missing plug from the extinguisher that almost killed me was found in your hotel room says who the witness you think that a court martial will accept the word of a frenchman against the word of a german officer no but they might accept it against the word of a greasy little pimp you might be right said willms well have to see wont we uttering a weary sort of sigh he sat back in his chair and in the same movement pulled open the drawer of his desk even before i saw the gun i knew it was there and after that it was simply a question of who could shoot first him or me on my ss softshell holster there was just a brass stud to keep the flap down but even so i was no gene autry and the luger was in his hand before the walther p was in mine it was the walthers doubleaction trigger that probably saved my life like most policemen i was in the habit of carrying it with one in the chamber and the hammer down all i had to do was squeeze the trigger willms ought to have known that the togglelock action on his luger was much more cumbersome which was why cops didnt carry them and by the time his pistol was ready to fire i was already shouting a warning i might have finished the warning too if he hadnt started to straighten his arm and aim the gun at me at which point i fired at the side of his head for a moment i thought id missed willms sat down only he didnt sit on the chair but on the floor like a boy scout dropping onto his backside beside a camp fire then i saw the blood boiling out of his skull like hot mud he collapsed onto his side and lay still except for his legs which straightened slowly like someone trying to get comfortable enough to die and all the time his head painted the beige carpet a very dark shade of red as if an indifferent claret had been poured onto the floor by a truculent guest in an unsatisfactory restaurant with shaking hands i made my walther safe and then holstered it asking myself if i couldnt have aimed at something other than his head at the same time i told myself that one of the easiest ways to end up dead is to leave your wounded adversary with an opportunity to shoot you i bent down and made sure the luger was safe too and it was then i started to see how much of a jam i was in what with all the generals and counts and princes who were in league with willms thinking it might be better if willmss death at least looked a bit less like a murder i swapped the luger for my own walther then seeing willmss tunic and belt hanging on coatstand i took his own standardissue walther and put it in my holster before replacing the cold luger in the desk drawer things only looked like a mess suicide was actually a nice tidy solution for the french police for sipo and for the red stripes over at the majestic hotel i wondered if theyd even bother to look for a powder burn on willmss head because cops all over the world love suicides theyre nearly always the easiest homicides to solve you just lift the rug and brush them underneath i picked up the telephone and asked the operator for the prefecture of police in the rue de lutece chapter twentythree germany i sat up and blinked hard in the neardarkness of cell number seven wondering how long id been asleep the shade of hitler was gone at least for now and i was glad about that i didnt much like his questions or the mocking assumption that deep down i was as big a criminal as him it was true that i might have shot nikolaus willms somewhere less lethal than his head and that even when id been trying to put him under arrest secretly i had probably wanted to kill him perhaps if paul kestner had pulled a gun on me id have shot him too but as it was i never saw kestner again and the last i heard of him hed been part of a police battalion in smolensk murdering jews and communists i opened my window and put my face in the cool breeze of the landsberg dawn i couldnt see the cows but i could smell them in the fields across the river to the southwest and i could hear them too one anyway it sounded like a lost soul in a place far far away like my own soul perhaps i almost felt like blowing my own breath in a solitary hot blast by way of an answer the paris of seemed equally far away what a summer that had been thanks to renata the prefecture in the person of chief inspector oltramare had accepted without demur my story of finding willms dead after going to the maison with the intention of arresting him although it was as plain as the eiffel tower that he believed not a word of it sipo proved only a little more troublesome and i was summoned to the hotel majestic in the avenue des portugais to explain myself to general best the head of the rsha in paris a darkeyed severelooking man from darmstadt best was in his late thirties and bore a strong resemblance to the nazi partys deputy leader rudolf hess there was some bad blood between him and heydrich and because of that i halfexpected best to give me a rougher ride instead he confined himself to delivering a light reprimand for my declared intent to arrest willms without consulting him which was fair enough and my apology seemed to put an end to the matter as things turned out he was much more interested in picking my brains for a book he was writing about the german police on several occasions we met at his favourite restaurant a brasserie on the boulevard de montparnasse called la coupole and i told him all about life at the alex and some of the cases i investigated bests book was published the following year and sold very well in fact he turned out to be something of a benefactor he and his damn book were the main reason i managed to stay on in paris until june and so it was best who effectively ensured i missed out on going to pretzsch and himmlers pep talk for the ss and sd i might have stayed on a bit longer and avoided going to the ukraine altogether but for heydrich now and then he liked to tug the line a little just to remind me that he had his hook in my mouth i lit a cigarette and lay down on the bed again waiting for the grey light to strengthen and the room to take shape and the uncaring guards to rouse landsbergs inmates for exercise breakfast and then what was called free association to my surprise i was now allowed back into the general prison population but to avoid biberstein and haensch with their worries about what i was telling the americans and how that might affect their own chances of parole i found myself seeking out the company of waldemar klingelhofer since he had been cut by everyone else at landsberg my speaking to him was the best way of ensuring i was left alone at least for the duration of our conversation we talked in the garden with the sun warming our faces klingelhofer had not aged well since our time together at lenin house in minsk and he was perhaps the only prisoner at wcpn of whom it could have been said that he had some sort of conscience about what he had done he looked like a man haunted by his actions with the moscow commando martin sandberger watching us from a short distance away merely looked psychopathic looking at klingelhofers twitching bespectacled face it was hard to imagine the former opera tenor who owned it singing anything except perhaps the dies irae but i was more interested in talking to him about what had happened in minsk after i had returned from there to berlin do you remember a man called paul kestner i asked him yes said klingelhofer he was active with a murder commando in smolensk when i got there in i was supposed to obtain furs to use for german military winter clothing kestner had been in paris i think and was bitter about his being posted to russia he seemed to be taking it out on jews that much was obvious and my impression was that he was a really cruel man after that i heard he got posted to the death camp at treblinka that must have been about july of he was the deputy commander i think there was some talk about kestner and irmfried eberl who was in charge running the camp for their own pleasure and profit using jewish women for sex and embezzling jewish gold and jewellery that was properly the property of the reich anyway the bosses found out about it and by all accounts dismissed the pair of them and some others besides before putting in a new man to clean the stables fellow named stangl meanwhile eberl and kestner were dismissed from the ss and in i heard they joined the wehrmacht in an attempt to redeem themselves the amis got eberl a few years ago and i believe he hanged himself but ive no idea what became of kestner they say stangls in south america well if he is its not argentina i said or uruguay youre lucky said klingelhofer to have been to those places me i expect ill die here you must be the only prisoner in landsberg who believes that wally everyone else seems to be expecting a parole theyve already let go men who in my opinion were worse than you thanks nice of you to say so but i just hope that if i do die in here theyll allow my family to have my body i wouldnt want to be buried here in landsberg it would mean a lot to them nice of you to say so yes i mean im not looking to get out i mean what would i do what can any of us do i left klingelhofer talking to himself he did a lot of that in landsberg it looked easier than talking to the americans or biberstein and haensch or sandberger who cornered me on the way back to my cell why do you speak to a bastard like that he demanded why not i speak to you really im not that particular funny guy i heard that about you gunther i dont see you laughing then again you used to be a judge didnt you before you went to estonia not many laughs there either from what i heard sandberger had a ruffians face with a jaw like a flat tyre and a boxers hostile eyes it was hard to imagine how anyone could have become a lawyer or a judge with a face like that it was easier to imagine him murdering sixtyfive thousand jews you didnt need to be a criminologist to figure out a physiognomy like sandbergers i hear the amis have been giving you a hard time of it he said you hear good with those things on the side of your head so i took the liberty of mentioning you to the evangelical bishop of wurttemberg he said in my last letter to him as long as there are prisons there will be prayers theres a lot more he can do than just pray a cake would be nice lots of cream and fruit and a walther p filling sandberger smiled a lopsided smile that wasnt provoking any second thoughts in my mind about the descent of man he doesnt do prison breaks said sandberger just letters to influential people here and in america i wouldnt want to put him to any trouble i said besides i just came back from america myself but i certainly didnt make any friends while i was there which part the southern half argentina mainly you wouldnt like argentina martin its hot lots of insects plenty of jews but youre only allowed to kill the insects but lots of germans too i hear no just nazis sandberger grinned probably he meant it well but it felt like seeing something unpleasant and atavistic toward the end of a seance evil flickering on and off like a faulty light bulb well he said full of patient menace let me know if i can help my father is a friend of president heuss and hes trying to help free you i tried to contain the surprise in my voice to get you a parole yes thanks i walked away before he could see the look of horror on my face it was beginning to look as if the only way i was ever going to have any friends in the new germany was to have friends i really didnt like my american friends both of them were in cell seven when after breakfast i was returned there by one of the guards this time theyd brought a little tape recorder in a leather case with a microphone not much bigger than a norelco shaver one was filling his pipe from a pouch of sir walter raleigh the other was adjusting his clipon bow tie against his reflection in my cell window there was a shortbrimmed stetson on my bed and both men smelled lightly of vaseline hairtonic make yourselves at home i said thanks we already did if youre here to record my singing voice i should warn you fellows i already made a deal with parlophone this is for our listening pleasure said the one puffing some heat into his sir walter raleigh were not planning on a general release not this christmas we think were getting to the interesting part said the other about erich mielke at long last the part that affects us now he snapped on the machine and the spools began to turn say something for recording level like what i dunno but lets just hope that the oral tradition is not yet dead in germany if it isnt it must be the only thing in germany thats not dead a few seconds later i heard for the first time the sound of my own voice uttered by someone other than myself there was something about it i didnt like mostly it was the laconic way i had of speaking it was five years since id seen my home city but i still sounded as unhelpful as a berlin gravedigger it was easy to see why people didnt like me very much if ever i was going to make a useful contribution to society i was going to have to fix that maybe take some lessons in courtesy and charm think of us like the brothers grimm said the ami smoking the pipe gathering material for a story i try not to think of you at all if i can help it but the brothers grimm works for me i never liked their stuff very much i especially hated the story about the village idiot with the pipe and the bow tie and his wicked uncle sam so then after paris you went home to berlin briefly i organised renata a job at the adlon and lived to regret it the poor kid was killed in the first big bombing raid on berlin in november some help i was and heydrich oh he was killed earlier than only he had it coming and on a silver salver but thats another story did he believe you about not finding mielke maybe maybe not you never knew with heydrich we talked it over in his office at the prinz albrechtstrasse next thing i knew i had orders to go to the ukraine i might have taken that personally if it wasnt that everyone had the same orders i shrugged well i expect your friends silverman and earp told you all about that then i was in berlin for a while before going to prague that was the summer of lets see now a year later i was in smolensk with the war crimes bureau as an oberleutnant but after the battle of kursk we were out of that whole theatre pretty quickly the red army was in the drivers seat you might say i got a leave i got married to a schoolteacher then i was recruited into the abwehr military intelligence and promoted to captain again why were you demoted because of what happened in prague i stepped on someones corns i guess i shrugged anyway february i joined general schorners northern army as an intelligence officer i spoke a fair bit of russian by then and a bit of polish too the work was mostly interpreting at least it was until the fighting started then it was just fighting kill or be killed tell me something did either of the brothers grimm see combat nope said the man with the pipe i was flying a desk for the whole of the war i was too young said the man with the bow tie i didnt think so you get to recognise that in a mans eye it might interest you to know that by there was no such thing as too young for the german army there was no too old either and no one was left flying a desk as you put it when they could fly a plane or sit in a tank or man an antiaircraft battery boys of thirteen marched alongside men aged sixtyfive and seventy you see it wasnt until the red army reached east prussia that german civilians began to suffer in the way russian civilians had suffered this meant that there was more for us to fight for and it was why men and boys of all ages were conscripted into the army nothing and no one was to be spared least of all ourselves total war was what goebbels called it and it means what it says which was rare for him total means everything all in nothing left out you amis talk about this cold war of yours with no understanding of what it means to fight a cold pitiless war without mercy and against an enemy who never stops coming oh believe me i know i was killing ivans for fourteen months and i can tell you this theres no end to them as many as you can kill they keep on coming so remember that if the time ever comes when you have to do the same not that anyone believes youll stop them why would you fight to save europe to save germans thats the only reason we fought to stop the ivans from slaughtering the population of east prussia you might say that this was what we had done to the jews and youd be right but there were no war crimes trials for soviet officers no ivans here in landsberg you would have to see what happens to a crowd of civilians when a russian tank drives straight through its middle or watch a fighter strafe a line of civilian refugees to know what im talking about sepp dietrich and his men shot how many americans at malmedy ninety ninety a war crime you call it for the russians in east prussia ninety wasnt even an infraction it was a misdemeanour except that its hardly a misdemeanour when the general demeanour of your soldiery is one of barbarous cruelty i was silent for a moment something wrong i never talked about this before i said its not easy what does goethe say about sun and worlds i can tell you but little all that i can see is the suffering of humanity still its right that you should hear it the trouble with you amis is that you think it was you who won the war when everyone knows it was the ivans without you and the british theyd have taken longer to beat us but theyd have beaten us all the same stalins maths we used to call it when there were just five of us left there would be twenty russians and that was how stalin was going to win youd better remember that if the ivans ever invade west berlin sure sure lets talk about konigsberg you were taken prisoner at konigsberg dont rush me i have to tell this in my own way when something has been asleep for this long you dont just shake it by the shoulder and shout in its ear take your time youve got plenty chapter twentyfour germany and russia konigsberg is was important to me my mother was born in konigsberg when i was a child we used to go on holiday to a seaside town near there called cranz best holiday we ever had my first wife and i went there on our honeymoon in it was the capital of east prussia a land of dark forests crystal lakes sand dunes white skies and teutonic knights who built a fine old medieval city with a castle and a cathedral and seven good bridges across the river pregel there was even a university founded in where the citys most famous son immanuel kant would one day teach i arrived there in june as part of army group north i was attached to the nd infantry division my job was to gather intelligence on the advancing red army what type of men what condition how well armed supply lines all the usual stuff and from the german civilians who fled their homes ahead of the russian advance the intelligence i had was of wellequipped illdisciplined drunken neanderthals who were bent on rape murder and mutilation frankly a lot of this seemed like hysterical nonsense indeed there was a lot of nazi propaganda to this effect that was designed to dissuade everyone from surrender and so i resolved to discover the true situation for myself this was made more difficult when at the end of august the royal air force bombed the city to rubble and i do mean rubble all of the bridges were destroyed all of the public buildings lay in ruins so it was a while before i was able to verify the reports of atrocities and i was left in no doubt as to the truth of these when our troops retook the german village of nemmersdorf about a hundred kilometres east of konigsberg id seen some terrible things in the ukraine of course and this was as bad as anything wed done to them women raped and mutilated children clubbed to death the whole village murdered all seven hundred of them youve got to see it to believe it and now i believed it and i could have wished i didnt i made my report the next thing the ministry of propaganda had it and were even broadcasting parts of it on the radio well that was the last time they were honest about our situation the only part of my report they didnt use was the conclusion that we should evacuate the city by sea as soon as possible we could have done it too but hitler was against it our wonder weapons were going to turn the tide and win the war we had nothing to worry about plenty of people believed that too that was october but by january the following year it was painfully clear to everyone that there were no wonder weapons at least none that could help us the city was encircled just like at stalingrad the only difference was that as well as fifty thousand german soldiers there were three hundred thousand civilians we started to get people out but in the process thousands died nine thousand died in just fifty minutes when a russian submarine sank the wilhelm gustoff outside the port of gotenhafen and we kept on fighting not because we obeyed hitler but because for every day that we fought a few more civilians managed to escape did i say that was the coldest winter in living memory well that hardly helped the situation for a short while the artillery and the bombing stopped as the ivans prepared their final assault when it came in the third week of march we were thirtyfive thousand men and fifty tanks against perhaps one hundred and fifty thousand troops five hundred tanks and more than two thousand aircraft me i was in the trenches during the great war and i thought i knew what it was to be under a bombardment i didnt hour after hour the shells fell sometimes there were as many as two hundred and fifty bombers in the sky at any one time finally general lasch contacted the russian high command and offered our surrender in return for a guarantee that we would be well treated they agreed and the next day we laid down our arms that was fine if you were a soldier but the russians were of the opinion that the guarantee had never applied to konigsbergs civilian population and the red army proceeded to exact a terrible revenge on it every woman was raped old men were murdered out of hand the sick and wounded were thrown out of hospital windows to make room for russians in short the whole red army got drunk and went crazy and did what it liked to civilians of all ages before finally they set on fire what remained of the city and their victims those they didnt kill they let fend for themselves in the countryside where most of them starved to death there was nothing any of us in the army could do about this those who did protest were shot on the spot some of us said this was justice that we deserved it for what had been done to them and this was true only its hard to think of justice when you see a naked woman crucified on a barn door maybe we all deserved crucifixion like those mutinous gladiators in ancient rome i dont know but every man who saw that wondered what lay in store for us i know i did for several days we were marched east of konigsberg and as we walked we were robbed of wedding rings wristwatches even false teeth any man refusing to hand over an object of value in a russians eyes was shot at the railway station we waited patiently in a field for transport to wherever we were going there was no food and no water and all the time more and more german soldiers joined our host some of us boarded a train that took us to brno in czechoslovakia where at last we were given some bread and water and then we boarded another train headed southeast as the train left brno we caught sight of the citys famous st peter and paul cathedral and for many men this was almost as good as seeing a priest even those who didnt believe took the opportunity to pray the next time we stopped we got out of the cattle cars and finally we were given some hot soup it was the thirtieth of april twenty days after our surrender i know this because the russians made a point of telling us the news that hitler was dead i dont know who was more pleased to hear this them or us some of us cheered a few of us wept it was the end of one hell no doubt but for germany and us in particular it was the beginning of another hell as it really is perhaps being a timeless place of punishment and suffering and run by devils who enjoy inflicting cruelty certainly we were judged by the book that was open that book was mein kampf and for what was written in that book we were all going to suffer some more than others from that transit camp in romania someone claimed it was a place called secureni from where bessarabian jews had been sent to auschwitz there was another train travelling northeast right through the ukraine a country i had hoped never to see again to a stop in the middle of nowhere where mvd guards drove us from the cattle cars with whips and curses standing there faint from lack of food and water blinking in the spring sunshine like unwanted dogs we awaited our orders finally after almost an hour we were marched along a dirt road between two infinite horizons bistra shouted the guards hurry up but to where to what would any of us ever see home again out there so far away from any sign of human habitation it seemed unlikely even more so when those who had only just survived the journey found they could walk no further and were shot where they fell at the side of the road by mounted mvd four or five men were shot in this way like horses that had outlived their usefulness no man was allowed to carry another and in this way only the strongest of us were permitted to survive as if prince kropotkin had been in charge of our exhausted company at last we arrived at the camp which was a selection of dilapidated grey wooden buildings surrounded by two barbed wire fences and remarkable only because next to the main gate was the surviving steeple of a nonexistent church one of those sharp metallicroofed russian church edifices that looked like some old junkers pickelhaube helmet there was nothing else for miles around not even a few huts that might once have been served by the church to which the steeple had once belonged we trooped through the gate under the silent hollow eyes of several hundred men who were the remains of the hungarian third army these men were on the other side of a fence and it seemed we were to be kept separate from them at least until we had been checked for parasites and diseases then we were fed and having been pronounced fit for labour i was sent to the sawmill i might have been an officer but no one was excused work that is no one who wanted to eat and for several weeks i spent every day loading and unloading wood this seemed like a hard job until i spent a whole day shovelling lime returning next day to the sawmill halfblinded by the stuff blowing in my face and with blood streaming from my nose i told myself i was lucky that a few splinters in my hands and a sore back were the worst i had to suffer in the sawmill i befriended a young lieutenant called metelmann really he was not much more than a boy or so it seemed to me physically he was strong enough but it was mental strength that was needed more and metelmanns morale was at a very low ebb id seen his type in the trenches the kind who awakes every morning expecting to be killed when the only way of dealing with our predicament was to give the matter no thought at all as if we were dead already but since caring for another human being is often a very good means of ensuring ones own survival i resolved to look after metelmann as best i could a month passed and then another long months of work and food and sleep and no memories for it was best not to think about the past and of course the future was something that had no meaning in the camp the present and the life of a voinapleni was all there was and the life of the voinapleni was bistra and davai and nichevo it was kasha and klopkis and the kate beyond the wire was the death zone and beyond that there was another wire and beyond that just the steppe and more of the steppe no one thought of escape there was nowhere to go that was the real communist pravda of life in voronezh it was as if we were in limbo waiting to die so that we could be sent to hell but instead we the german officers at camp eleven were sent to another camp no one knew why no one gave us a reason reasons were for human beings it happened without warning early one august evening just as we finished work for the day instead of marching back to camp we found ourselves on the long march somewhere else it was only after several hours on the road that we saw the train and we realised we were off on another journey and very likely we would never see camp eleven again since none of us had any belongings this hardly seemed to matter do you think we could be going home asked metelmann as we boarded the train and then set off i glanced at the setting sun were headed southeast i said which was all the answer that was needed christ he said were never going to find our way home he had an excellent point staring out of a gap in the planks on the side of our cattle truck at the endless russian steppes it was the sheer size of the country that defeated you sometimes it was so big and unchanging it seemed the train wasnt moving at all and the only way to make sure that we werent standing still was to watch the moving track through the hole in the floor that served as our latrine how did that bastard hitler ever think we could conquer a country as big as this said someone you might as well try to invade the ocean once in the distance we saw another train travelling west in the opposite direction and there was not one of who didnt wish we were on it anywhere west seemed better than anywhere east another man said sing to me of the man muse the man of twists and turns driven time and again off course once he had plundered the sacred heights of troy many cities of men he saw and learned their ways many places he endured heartsick on the open sea struggling to save his life and bring his comrades home he paused for a moment and then for the benefit of those whod never done the classics said homers odyssey to which someone else said i only hope that penelope is behaving herself the journey took two whole days and nights before finally we disembarked beside a wide steelgrey river at which point the classics scholar whose name was sajer began to cross himself religiously what is it asked metelmann whats wrong i recognise this place said sajer i remember thanking god id never see it again god likes his little jokes i said so what is this place demanded metelmann this is the volga said sajer and if im right were not far south of stalingrad stalingrad we all repeated the name with quiet horror i was one of the last to get out before the sixth army was encircled explained sajer and now im back what a fucking nightmare from the train we marched to a larger camp that was mostly ss although not all of them german there were french belgian and dutch ss but the senior german officer was a wehrmacht colonel named mrugowski who welcomed us to a barrack with proper bunk beds and real mattresses and told us that we were in krasnoarmeesk between astrakhan and stalingrad where have you come from he asked a camp called usman near voronezh i said ah yes he said the one with the church steeple i nodded this place is better he said the work is hard but the ivans are relatively fair relative to usman that is where were you captured we exchanged news and like all the other germans at ka the colonel was anxious to hear something about his brother who was a doctor with the waffen ss but no one could tell him anything it was the height of the summer on the steppe and with little or no shade the work excavating a canal between the don and the volga rivers was hard and hot but for a while at least my situation was almost tolerable here there were russians working too saklutshonnis convicted of a political crime which more often than not was hardly a crime at all or at least none that any german not even the gestapo would have recognised and from these prisoners i began to perfect my knowledge of the russian language the site itself was an enormous trench covered with duckboards and walkways and rickety wooden bridges and from dawn until dusk it was filled with hundreds of men wielding picks and shovels or pushing crudely made wheelbarrows a regular potsdamer platz of pleni traffic and policed by stone faced blues which was what we called the mvd guards with their gimnasterka tunics portupeya belts and blue shoulder boards the work was not without hazard now and then the sides of the canal would collapse in upon someone and we would all dig frantically to save his life this happened almost every week and to our surprise and shame for these were not the inferior people that the nazis had told us of it was usually the russian convicts who were quickest to help one such man was ivan yefremovich pospelov who became the nearest thing i had to a friend at ka and who thought he was well off although his forehead which was dented like a felt hat told a different story from the one he told me what matters most herr bernhard is that we are alive and in that we are indeed fortunate for right now at this very moment somewhere in russia someone is meeting his undeserved end at the hands of the mvd even as we speak a poor russian is being led to the edge of a pit and thinking his last thoughts about home and family before the pistol fires and a bullet is the last thing to travel through his mind so who cares if the work is hard and the food is poor we have the sun and the air in our lungs and this moment of companionship that cant be taken away from us my friend and one day when were free again think how much more it will mean to you and me just to be able to go and buy a newspaper and some cigarettes and other men will envy us that we live with such fortitude in the face of what only appear to be the travails of life you know what makes me laugh most of all to think that ever i complained in a restaurant can you imagine it to send something back to a kitchen because it was not properly cooked or to reprimand a barman for serving warm beer i tell you id be glad to have that warm beer now thats happiness right there in the acceptance of that warm beer and remembering how its enough in life to have that and not the taste of brackish water on cracked lips this is the meaning of life my friend to know when you are well off and to hate or envy no man but there was one man at ka who it was hard not to hate or envy among the blues were several political officers politruks who had the job of turning german fascists into good antifascists from time to time these politruks would order us into the mess to hear a speech about western imperialism the evils of capitalism and what a great job comrade stalin was doing to save the world from another war of course the politruks didnt speak german and not all of us spoke russian and the translation was usually handled by the most unpopular german in the camp wolfgang gebhardt gebhardt was one of two antifascist agents at ka he was a former ss corporal from paderborn a professional footballer who once had played for sv neuhaus after being captured at stalingrad in february gebhardt claimed to have been converted to the cause of communism and as a result he received special treatment his own quarters better clothing and footwear better food cigarettes and vodka there was another antifa agent called kittel but gebhardt was by far the more unpopular of the two which probably explains why some time during the autumn of he was murdered early one morning he was found dead in his hut stabbed to death the ivans were very exercised about it as converts to bolshevism were despite the material benefits of becoming a red rather thin on the ground an mvd major from the stalingrad oblast came down to ka to inspect the body after which he met with the senior german officer and by all accounts a shouting match ensued following this i was surprised to find myself summoned to see colonel mrugowski we sat on his bed behind a curtain that was one of the few small privileges allowed to him as sgo thanks for coming gunther he said you know about gebhardt i suppose yes i heard the cathedral bells ringing im afraid its not the good news that everyone might imagine he didnt leave any cigarettes ive just had some mvd major in here shouting his head off making me into a snail about it show me a blue who doesnt like to shout and ill show you a pink unicorn he wants me to do something about it about gebhardt i mean we could always bury him i suppose i sighed look sir i think i ought to tell you i didnt kill him and i dont know who did but they should give whoever did it the iron cross major savostin sees things differently hes given me seventy two hours to produce the murderer or twentyfive german soldiers will be selected at random to stand trial at an mvd court in stalingrad where an acquittal seems unlikely exactly i shrugged so you appeal to the men and ask the guilty man to step up for it and if that doesnt work he shook his head not all of the plenis here are german just the majority and i did remind the major of this fact however hes of the opinion that a german had the best motive to kill gebhardt true major savostin has a low opinion of german moral values but a high opinion of our capacity for reasoning and logic since a german had the best motive for the murder then he thinks it seems reasonable that we should have the most to lose if the killer is not identified which he believes is now the best incentive for us to do his job for him so what are you telling me sir come on gunther everyone in krasnoarmeesk knows you used to be a detective at berlins alexanderplatz praesidium as the sgo im asking you to take charge of a murder investigation is that what this is maybe none of this will be necessary but you should at least take a look at the body while i parade the men and ask the guilty man to step forward i walked across the camp in the stiffening wind winter was coming you could feel it in the air you could hear it too as it rattled the windows of gebhardts private hut a depressing sound it was almost as loud as the noise of my own rumbling belly and i was already reproaching myself for not exacting a price for my forensic services a extra piece of chleb a second bowl of kasha no one at ka volunteered for anything unless there was something in it for him and that something was nearly always food a starshina a blue sergeant named degermenkoy standing in front of gebhardts hut saw me and walked slowly in my direction why arent you at work he yelled and hit me hard across the shoulders with his walking stick between blows i explained my mission and finally he stopped and let me get up off the ground i thanked him and went into the little hut closing the door behind me in case there was anything in there i could steal the first thing i saw was a bar of soap and a piece of bread not the shorni that we plenis received but belii the white bread and before i even looked at gebhardts body i stuffed my mouth full of what should have been his last meal this would have been reward enough for the job i was doing except that i saw some cigarettes and matches and as soon as i had swallowed the bread i lit one and smoked it in a state of nearecstasy i hadnt smoked a cigarette in six months still ignoring the body on the bed i looked around the hut for something to drink my eyes fell on a small bottle of vodka and finally smoking my cigarette and taking little bites off gebhardts bottle i started to behave like a real detective the hut was about ten feet square with a small window that was covered with an iron grille meant to keep the occupant safe from the rest of us plenis it hadnt worked there was a lock on the wooden door but the key was nowhere to be seen there was a table a stove and a chair and feeling a little faint probably from the cigarette and the vodka i sat down on the wall were two propaganda portraits cheap frameless posters of lenin and stalin and collecting some phlegm at the back of my throat i let the great leader have it then i drew the chair up to the bed and took a closer look at the body that he was dead was obvious since there were stab wounds all over his body but mainly around the head neck and chest less obvious was the choice of murder weapon a piece of elk horn that was sticking out of the dead mans right eye socket the ferocity of the attack was remarkable as was the brutal instrumentality of the elkhorn id seen violent crime scenes before in my time as a detective but rarely as frenzied as this it gave me a new respect for elks i counted sixteen separate stab wounds including two or three protective wounds on the forearms and from the blood spatter on the walls it seemed clear that gebhardt had been murdered on the bed i tried to raise one of the dead mans hands and discovered rigor was already well set in the body was quite cold and i formed the conclusion that gebhardt had met his welldeserved death between the hours of midnight and four oclock in the morning i also discovered some blood underneath his fingernails and i might even have taken a sample of this if id had an envelope to put it in not to mention a laboratory with a microscope that might have analysed it i did however take the dead mans wedding ring which was so tight and the finger so badly swollen that i had to use the soap to get it off any other mans ring would have fallen off his finger but gebhardt drew better rations than any of us and was a normal weight i weighed the ring in the palm of my hand it was gold and would certainly come in useful if i ever needed to bribe a blue i looked closely at the inscription on the inside but it was too small for my weakened eyes i didnt put it in my pocket however for one thing the trousers of my uniform were full of holes and for another there was the starshina outside the door who might have taken it upon himself to search me so i swallowed it in the certainty that with my bowels as loose as vegetable soup i could easily retrieve the ring later by now i could hear the sgo addressing all the german plenis outside there was a cheer as he confirmed what most of them knew that gebhardt was dead this was followed by a loud groan as he told them how the mvd were planning to handle the matter i got up and went to the window in the hope that i might see one brave soul identify himself as the culprit but no one moved fearing the worst i took another bite off the vodka bottle and laid my hand on the stove it was cold but i opened it all the same just in case the killer had thought to burn his signed confession but there was nothing just a few pages from an old copy of pravda and some bits of wood ready for when the weather turned colder a shallow closet no deeper than a shoe box was fixed against the corner of the hut and in it i found the waffen ss uniform that gebhardt had ceased wearing when hed switched sides it would hardly have done for an antifascist officer to have carried on wearing an ss uniform his new russian gimnasterka was hanging on the back of the chair quickly i searched the pockets and found a few kopecks which i pocketed and some more cigarettes which i also pocketed with time growing short now i took off my own threadbare uniform jacket and tried on gebhardts ordinarily it wouldnt have fitted but id lost so much weight that this was hardly a problem so i kept it on it was a great pity his boots were too small but i took his socks those were an excellent fit and as with the jacket in much better condition that my own i lit another cigarette and on my hands and knees went hunting around the floor for something other than the dust and the splinters i found down there i was still searching for clues when the hut door opened and colonel mrugowski came in did anyone come forward no as a result i cant believe it was a german who did this our men arent so lacking in honour a german would have given himself up for the good of the others hitler didnt i observed that was different i pushed gebhardts cigarettes across the table here i said have one of the dead mans cigarettes thanks i will he lit one and glanced uncomfortably at the dead body dont you think we should cover him up no looking at it helps to give me ideas as to how it happened and have you any ideas about who killed him so far im considering the possibility that it was an elk with a grudge i showed him the murder weapon see how sharp it is gingerly mrugowski touched the bloodied end with his forefinger makes a hell of a shiv doesnt it i shook my head actually i think it was probably meant to be decorative in here theres a couple of nails and a mark on the wall facing the window thats consistent with this having been part of a small trophy set of horns but i cant say for sure as ive never been in here before so wheres the rest of it maybe he realised how effective a weapon it was and took the rest of it with him i rather imagine there was an argument the killer grabbed the trophy broke it over gebhardts skull and found himself holding just a piece of it a conveniently sharp piece there are some smaller punctures on gebhardts head that are consistent with that possibility gebhardt collapsed onto the bed the killer then went at him with the point finished him off then he went outside and caught the ubahn home as to who and why your guess is as good as mine if this was berlin id be telling the uniforms to look for a man with bloodstains on his jacket but of course here thats not so unusual there are fellows out there who are still wearing uniforms stained with the blood of comrades at konigsberg and i expect the killer knows that too is that all youve got look if this was berlin i could pick up the rugs and beat them you know interview some witnesses some suspects speak to a few informers theres nothing like an informer in my business theyre the flies who know their shit and thats the detective work that nearly always pays a dividend so why not speak to emil kittel the other antifa agent its in his interest to cooperate with your inquiry wouldnt you say he might wind up being the killers next victim after all that might work of course speaking to kittel means i have to speak to kittel and if that happens i dont want anyone in this camp thinking its because im turning ivan like him ill make sure that people know the score but thats only one objection you see kittels already one of my suspects hes lefthanded and one of the few things i can tell you about the murderer is that hes probably left handed how do you figure that the stab wounds on gebhardts body theyre mostly on his right side less than ten per cent of the population is left handed so out of more than a thousand men in this camp ive got about a hundred suspects and one of them is kittel i see somehow ive got to clear ninetynine of them in less than seventytwo hours with nothing more to go on than the fact they disliked the victim only a little less than the man who actually killed him all of this would be more than enough to do if there wasnt already a wheelbarrow with my name on it and several tonnes of sand ready for shifting around this canal thats not a tall order its a tall order standing on a box ill speak to major savostin see if i cant get you off the work detail until this thing is sorted you do that sir appeal to his sense of fair play he probably keeps it in a matchbox alongside his sense of humour and now i think about it thats another objection i have to this socalled investigation i dont like the ivans knowing anything more about me than they already do especially the mvd the sgo smiled did i say something funny sir before the war i was a doctor said the sgo like your brother he nodded in a mental asylum we treated a lot of people for something called paranoia i know what paranoia is sir why are you so paranoid gunther me i suppose its because i have a problem trusting people i should warn you colonel im not the persistent type over the years ive learned its better to be a quitter i find that knowing when to quit is the best way of staying alive so dont expect me to be a hero not here since i put on a german uniform i find that the hero business has been put back thirty years the sgo gave me a disapproving look perhaps he said stiffly if wed had more heroes we might just have won the war no colonel if wed had more heroes the war might never have got started i went back to work filling my wheelbarrow with sand pushing it up a gangplank emptying it and then pushing it back down again endless and unavailing it was the kind of work that gets your picture on the side of a greek amphora or as an illustration in a story that shows the dangers of betraying the secrets of the gods it wasnt as dangerous as the kind of work the sgo wanted me to do and but for the vodka inside me and the nicotine in my lungs i might have been feeling a little less than inspired about the prospect of saving twentyfive of my comrades from a little show trial in stalingrad ive never been the type to mistake intoxication for heroism besides its not heroes you need to win a war its people who stay alive i was still feeling a little intoxicated when the sgo and the mvd major came to fetch me from my sisyphean labour and this can be the only explanation for the way i spoke to the ivan in russian that was a mistake all on its own the russians liked it a lot when you spoke russian in that respect theyre like anyone else the only difference is that russians think it means you like them the mvd major savostin dismissed the sgo with a wave of his hand as soon as mrugowski had pointed me out the russian beckoned me towards him impatiently bistra davail he was about fifty with reddish hair and a mouth as wide as the volga which looked as if it had been exaggerated for the purpose of a vindictive caricature the pale blue eyes in his pale white head had been inherited from the grey shewolf whod littered him i dropped my shovel and ran eagerly toward him the blues liked you to do everything at the double mrugowski tells me that you were a fascist policeman before the war no sir i was just a policeman generally i left the fascism to the fascists i had enough to do just being a policeman did you ever arrest any communists i might have done if they broke the law but i never arrested anyone for being a communist i investigated murders you must have been very busy yes sir i was what is your rank captain sir then why are you wearing a corporals jacket the corporal it belonged to wasnt using it what function did you have during the war i was an intelligence officer sir did you ever fight any partisans no sir only the red army that is why you lost yes sir that is certainly why we lost the pale blue wolf eyes stayed on me unblinking obliging me to snatch my cap off while i stared back at him you speak excellent russian he said where did you learn it from russians i told you major i was an intelligence officer that generally means you have to be something more than just intelligent with me it was the fact that id learned russian but it wasnt the same standard of russian youve described until i came here your honour i have the great stalin to thank for that you were a spy captain isnt that right no sir i was always in uniform which means if i had been a spy id have been a rather stupid one and as i told you already sir i was in intelligence it was my job to monitor russian radio broadcasts read russian newspapers speak to russian prisoners did you ever torture a russian prisoner no sir a russian would never give information to fascists unless he was tortured i expect thats why i never got any information from russian prisoners sir not once not ever so what makes the sgo think that you can get it from german plenis thats a good question sir you would have to ask him that his brother is a war criminal did you know that no sir he was a doctor at buchenwald concentration camp said major savostin he carried out experiments on russian pows the colonel claims not to be related to this person but its my impression that mrugowski is not a common name in germany i shrugged we cant choose the people to whom we are related sir perhaps you are also a war criminal captain gunther no sir come now you were in the sd everyone in the sd was a war criminal look sir the sgo asked me to look into the murder of wolfgang gebhardt he gave me the strange idea that you wanted to find out who did it that if you didnt find out then twentyfive of my comrades were going to be picked out at random and shot for it you were misinformed captain there is no death penalty in the soviet union comrade stalin has abolished it but they will stand trial for it yes perhaps you yourself will be one of these men picked at random so its like that is it do you know who did it not yet but it sounds like you just handed me an extra incentive to find out good we understand each other perfectly youre excused work for the next three days in order that you may solve the crime i will inform the guards how will you start now that ive seen the body by thinking thats what i normally do in these situations its not very spectacular but it gets results then id like permission to interview some of the prisoners and perhaps some of the guards the prisoners yes the guards no it wouldnt be right to have a good communist being crossquestioned by a fascist very well id also like to interview the surviving antifa agent kittel this i will have to think about now then it would not be appropriate for you to interview the other prisoners while theyre working so you can use the canteen for that and for thinking yes it might be best if you were to use gebhardts hut ill have the body removed immediately if youre finished with it i nodded very well then please follow me we walked to gebhardts hut halfway there savostin saw some guards and barked some orders in a language that wasnt russian noticing my curiosity he told me that it was tatar most of these pigs who guard the camp are tatars he explained they speak russian of course but to make yourself clear you really have to speak tatar perhaps you should try to learn i didnt answer that he wasnt expecting me to he was too busy looking around at the huge building site just think he said all of this will be a canal by extraordinary i had my doubts about that which savostin seemed to sense comrade stalin has ordered it he said as if this was the only affirmation needed and in that place and in that time he was probably right when we reached gebhardts hut he supervised the removal of the body if you need anything he said come to the guardhouse he looked around which is where exactly im not at all familiar with this camp i pointed to the west beyond the canteen i felt like virgil pointing out the sights in hell to dante i watched him walk away and went back into the hut the first thing i did was to turn over the mattress not because i was looking for something but because i intended to have a sleep and i hardly wanted to lie on top of gebhardts bloodstains no one ever had enough sleep at ka but thinkings no good if youre tired i took off his jacket lay down and closed my eyes it wasnt just lack of sleep that made me tired but the vodka too the deflated football that was my stomach wasnt used to the stuff any more than my liver was i closed my eyes and went to sleep wondering what the soviet authorities were likely to do to me and twentyfour others if the death penalty had indeed been abolished was it possible there was a worse camp than the ones i had already seen a while later ive no idea how long i slept but it was still light outside i sat up the cigarettes were still in my jacket pocket so i lit another but it wasnt like a proper cigarette there was a paper holder and only about three or four centimetres of tobacco what the ivans called a papirossi cigarette these were belomorkanal which seemed only appropriate since that was a russian brand introduced to commemorate the construction of another canal this one connecting the white sea to the baltic the abwehrs opinion of the belomorkanal was that it had been a disaster too shallow making it useless to most seagoing vessels not to mention the tens of thousands of prisoners sacrificed on its construction i wondered if this particular canal would fare any better i finished the cigarette and aimed the butt at stalin and something about the way it struck the great leaders nose made me get up and take a closer look at the paper portrait when i tugged it off the wall i was surprised to see that the picture had neatly concealed a small shelved alcove about the size of a book on the shelf were a notebook and a roll of banknotes it wasnt a wall safe but in that place it was maybe the nextbest thing the roll of banknotes was almost four hundred five gold rouble notes about three or four months wages for a blue this wasnt a fortune unless you were a pleni two thousand roubles plus a gold wedding band might just be enough to bribe some better treatment inside an mvd jail in stalingrad i looked at the roubles again just to make sure and to my relief they all had that greasy authentically russian feel about them i even held the bills up to the light coming through the window to check the watermark before folding them into the back pocket of my uniform breeches which was the only one with a button and without a large hole the notebook had a red cover and was about the size of an identity card it was full of cheap russian paper that looked more like something flattened by a heavy object and which contained a surprise all of its own for on one page there was a name beneath which were written some dates and some payment details and these seemed to indicate that the pleni named was in the pay of gebhardt not that this made the pleni a murderer exactly but it did help to explain how it was that the blues were able to police the pows so effectively but the date of one particular payment caught my eye wednesday august th this was the feast of the assumption of mary and for some catholic germans especially those from saarland or bavaria it was also an important public holiday but nearly everyone in camp remembered this as the day when georg oberheuser a sergeant from stuttgart had been arrested by the mvd angry that this date was to be treated as a normal working day oberheuser had loudly denounced stalin to everyone in our hut as a wicked godless bastard there were other no less slanderous epithets he used as well and all of them well deserved no doubt but we were all a little bit shaken when oberheuser was taken away and never seen again and by the knowledge that with no ivans in our hut oberheuser had to have been betrayed to the blues by another german the name in gebhardts notebook was konrad metelmann the young lieutenant i had naively resolved to look out for it appeared that hed been doing a better job of looking out for himself i did a bit of thinking after that and remembered how the blues were always ordering our hut to appear in the canteen for an identity check they would ask each man his name rank and serial number in the hope we had supposed of catching one of us out for it was certainly the case that believing themselves to be wanted for war crimes there were several ss officers pretending to be someone else someone who had been killed in the war we were always questioned alone with gebhardt translating and any one of us could have used such an opportunity to give the mvd information the only reason none of us had connected this with oberheuser was that there had been no identity check on the day of his arrest which meant that metelmann and gebhardt must also have been using some kind of deadletter drop the russians had a saying the best way to keep your friends in the soviet union is never to betray them id never much liked georg oberheuser but he didnt deserve to be betrayed by one of his own comrades according to mrugowski oberheuser was tried by a peoples court and sentenced to twenty years of labour and correction or at least that was what the camp commander had told him but i saw no reason to believe what major savostin had told me that the great stalin had abolished the death penalty id seen far too many of my fellow countrymen shot at the side of the road on the long march out of konigsberg to accept the idea that summary execution was no longer routine in the soviet union maybe oberheuser was dead and maybe he wasnt either way it was up to me to make things up to him thats the debt we owe the dead to give them justice if we can and a kind of justice if we cant the rest of the plenis were coming back from work and i went straight over to the canteen to beat the rush seeing metelmann i fell in behind him and waited for some kind of indication that he was anxious but sajer spoke first are you really going to finger someone for the ivans gunther that all depends i said shuffling forward in the line on what on me finding out who did it right now i havent got a clue and by the way ive been told that im one of the twenty five the ivans are going to pick if they dont get a name just so you know that im taking this seriously do you think they mean it asked metelmann course they mean it said sajer when do the ivans ever issue an idle threat you can always depend on them in that way at least the bastards what are going to do bernie asked metelmann how should i know i glared at mrugowski this is all his fault but for him id have the same chance as everyone else maybe youll find out something said metelmann you were a good detective thats what people say what do they know believe me id have to be sherlock holmes to solve this case my only chance is to bribe that mvd major and get myself off the list here metelmann have you got any money you can lend me i can let you have five roubles he said itll take a lot more than five roubles to bribe that major said sajer ive got to start somewhere i said as metelmann gave me a five from his pocket thanks konrad how about you sajer suppose i need to bribe someone myself he grinned unpleasantly at metelmann if its you they pick you might regret giving him that five you silly bastard fuck you sajer said metelmann where does someone like you get five roubles anyway asked sajer metelmann sneered and reached for his chunk of chleb with his left hand i also noted the lividlooking scar on his forearm he might have got the injury on site but all things considered i thought it more likely that hed got it while murdering gebhardt i spent the next three days alone in gebhardts hut catching up on my sleep i knew what i was going to do but i saw little point in doing it before the mvds allotted time had elapsed i was determined to enjoy every minute of my holiday at ka while it was there to be had after months of hard labour on starvation rations i was exhausted and a little feverish once a day the sgo came over and asked how my inquiry was progressing and i told him that despite any evidence to the contrary i had made good progress i could see he didnt believe me but i didnt care it wasnt like i was going to lose my army pension because of his opinion besides the sgo and i were two different heads on the same imperial eagle me looking left and him looking to the right even in a soviet pow camp he could seldom leave a room without clicking his heels oh yes our colonel mrugowski was a regular fred astaire on the third day i rolled the stone away from the front door and went to the site to find metelmann i handed him back his five roubles here i said you might as well keep this i shant be needing it where im going quickly pocketing the note in case one of the guards should see it metelmann tried not to look relieved at my obvious disappointment no luck huh my luck ran out on me a long time ago i said it was going so fast it must have been wearing running shoes you know maybe that mvd major was bluffing he said i doubt it the thing ive noticed about people with power is that they always use it even when they say they dont want to i started to walk away good luck said metelmann major savostin was playing chess when i found him in the guardhouse with himself colonel mrugowski was there too they were waiting for my report theres no one here that plays said the major perhaps we should have a game you and i captain im sure youre much better than me sir after all its virtually your national game why is that do you suppose one would think as logical a game as chess would suit the german character rather well because its black and white i suggested everything is black and white in the soviet union and perhaps because the game involves making sacrifices of smaller less important pieces besides sir with you i should worry how to win without losing i snatched off my cap as a matter of fact sir ive been worried about that for the last three days i mean how to solve this case without pissing you off and im still not satisfied i know the answer to that question but you do know who killed gebhardt dont you yes sir then i fail to understand your difficulty i wondered if i had misjudged him if he wasnt quite as intelligent as id thought then again there is a whole earthwork of understanding between someone who is hungry and someone who is not i could see no way of identifying metelmann as the culprit without putting my own head in the lions mouth i mean youre not suggesting it was a russian i trust he said fiddling with his queen oh no sir a russian would never have murdered a german and not owned up to it besides why kill a pleni in secret when you could just as easily kill him in the open even if he was an antifascist agent no you were right sir it was a german who killed gebhardt i cast my eye over the board in the hope that i might see some evidence of intelligence there but all i could tell was that the right pieces were on the right squares and that the major needed a manicure like i needed a hot bath they probably didnt care about manicures in the soviet workers paradise they certainly didnt care about hot baths it was a little hard to be sure but i had the idea that the major smelt almost as bad as i did the murder was not premeditated i said it happened on the spur of the moment frenzied stabbings often happen like that where theres no sexual aspect involved of course its hard to say much with certainty at a crime scene that ive had to work without a thermometer to take the bodys temperature and there were certainly fingerprints that could have been recovered from the murder weapon and the brass door handle what can be said with confidence however is that the murderer was lefthanded because of the pattern of wounds on the dead mans body now at the canteen i observed all of the men in this camp and drew up a list of all the lefthanded plenis this was my initial pool of suspects since when i have identified the murderer i will not speak his name as a german officer it would be wrong for me to do so but there is no need since his name appears in gebhardts notebook i handed the red notebook to the major metelmann he said quietly as you will see this page contains details of payments that were made to this particular officer in return for information in other words the culprit was acting as the murdered mans paid informer i believe the two men argued about money sir among other things possibly gebhardt refused to pay the murderer five roubles his usual rate for information received after the murder the culprit took the money anyway i handed savostin a hundred of the fiverouble notes i had found behind the poster of stalin savostin handed the notebook to the sgo i found these bills hidden in gebhardts hut as you can see all of the bills are marked in the top righthand corner with a small pencil mark which is i believe a russian orthodox cross savostin examined one of the notes and nodded all of them he said yes sir i knew this because i had marked every one of the bills myself its my guess that if you were to search the officer named in that notebook you would find him in possession of one or more fiverouble notes with the same pencilled cross in the top righthand corner sir the same officer is lefthanded and his arm currently bears a livid scar that was most probably sustained during the attack on gebhardt still clutching my cap i rubbed my shaven head with my knuckle it sounded like something happening to a piece of wood in the camp workshop if i might speak frankly sir speak captain i dont know what youre going to do with this man sir given who and what he is i can appreciate that it might leave you with a problem after all hes your mans man but hes no good to you now sir is he not now that we know who and what he is i suppose you could always use him to replace gebhardt as the antifa officer although his russian isnt up to much and youd have to take him away anyway for political reeducation either way hes finished in this camp i just wanted to let you know that sir arent you jumping the gun a little gunther you havent proved anything yet even if i do find this marked money on metelmann theres nothing to prove he didnt receive the money before gebhardt was murdered and have you considered the possibility that if this man is an informer then it might suit me better to leave him here and have you and the colonel transferred to another camp i have considered that yes sir its true theres nothing to stop you doing that but you cant be sure that we havent told all our comrades what ive told you thats one reason why it wouldnt suit you to send us to another camp another reason is that the colonel is doing an excellent job as sgo the men listen to him with all due respect sir you need him major savostin looked at the colonel perhaps i do at that he said i shrugged as for proving anything to your satisfaction major thats your affair ive handed you the gun you cant expect me to pull the trigger as well however if you do decide to search metelmann you might ask him the name of his wife sir meaning konrad metelmanns wife is called vera sir i handed savostin the ring i had found and which i had assumed was gebhardts wedding ring theres an inscription inside savostins eyes narrowed as he read what was engraved on the inside of the gold band to konrad with all my love from vera february he looked at me that was on gebhardts ring finger sir the finger was broken i think because metelmann tried to get the ring off gebhardts finger after he killed him and failed possibly he even broke the finger i dont know but i had to use soap to get it off myself perhaps gebhardt bought this from metelmann gebhardt bought it all right but im pretty sure it wasnt from metelmann metelmann hid that ring up his arse for weeks then he got a bad dose of diarrhoea and had to wear it on a piece of string around his neck but one of the guards found it and made him hand it over as a matter of fact i saw it happen who sergeant degermenkoy my guess is that gebhardt bought it back from him and promised to return it to metelmann but never did possibly he may have used the ring as leverage to obtain information from metelmann either way im certain this ring is what the fight was about and im sure the sergeant will confirm what ive said sir that he sold the ring to gebhardt degermenkoy is a lying pig said major savostin but i dont doubt that you are correct about what must have happened youve done very well captain i shall question both men in due course for now i thank you captain you too colonel for recommending this man you may go back to work now dismissed mrugowski and i went out of the guardhouse are you sure about all of this yes suppose savostin searches metelmann and he doesnt have that fiverouble note he had it half an hour ago i said i know that because it was me who gave it to him and its marked with a lot more than just a russian orthodox cross theres a thumbprint in blood on it too rather a good one as it happens although i dare say the ivans wont be looking to make a match i dont understand said mrugowski whose thumbprint gebhardts i put the print on the bill using his dead hand and i borrowed five roubles from metelmann the day before yesterday just so that i could repay him with a marked bill i marked the bills with the cross myself the thumbprint was merely for added effect i still dont understand i chalked him out for it metelmann framed him so that he could take the bath out mrugowski stopped and stared at me with horror you mean he didnt kill gebhardt oh he killed him all right im almost sure of that but proving it is something else especially in this place anyway i dont much care metelmann was a point a lousy informer and were well rid of him i do not like your methods captain gunther you wanted a detective from the alex colonel and thats what you got you think those bastards always play fair by the book rules of evidence think again berlin cops have planted more evidence than the ancient egyptians this is how it works sir real police work isnt some gentlemen detective writing notes on a starched shirt cuff with a silver pencil that was the old days when the grass was greener and it only snowed on christmas eve you make the suspect not the punishment fit the crime see it was always thus but more especially here here most of all that major savostin isnt the laughing policeman hes from the ministry of internal affairs i just hope you didnt sell me too hard to that coldhearted bastard because i tell you this its not lieutenant metelmann im worried about its me ive been useful to savostin he likes that the next time he gets cold hands hes liable to treat me like a pair of gloves konrad metelmann was taken away by the blues the same day and life at krasnoarmeesk resumed its awful grey unrelentingly brutal routine or at least i thought it did until it was pointed out to me by another pleni that i was receiving double rations in the canteen people always noticed things like that at first none of my comrades seemed to mind as everyone was now aware that i had uncovered an informer and saved twentyfive of us from a show trial in stalingrad but memories are short especially in a soviet labour camp and as winter arrived and my preferment continued not just more food but warmer clothes too i began to encounter some resentment among the other german prisoners it was ivan yefremovich pospelov who explained what was happening ive seen this before he said and im afraid it will end badly unless you can do something about it the blues have picked you out for the astoria treatment like the hotel better food better clothes and in case you hadnt noticed less work im working i said like anyone else you think so when was the last time a blue shouted at you to hurry up or called you a german pig now you come to mention it they have been rather more polite of late eventually the other plenis will forget what you did for them and remember only that you are preferred by the blues and theyll conclude that theres more to it than meets the eye that youre giving the blues something else in return but thats nonsense i know it you know it but do they know it in six months from now youll be an antifascist agent in their eyes whether you are or not thats what the russians are gambling on that as you are shunned by your own people you have no choice but to come over to them even if that doesnt happen one day youll have an accident a bank will give way for no apparent reason and youll be buried alive but your rescue will come too late and if you are rescued then youll have no choice but to take gebhardts place that is if you want to stay alive youre one of them my friend a blue you just dont know it yet i knew pospelov was right pospelov knew everything about life at ka he ought to have done hed been there since stalins great purge as the music teacher to the family of a senior soviet politician arrested and executed in pospelov had received a twentyyear sentence a simple case of guilt by association but for good measure the nkvd as the mvd was then called had broken his hands with a hammer to make sure that he could never again play the piano what can i do i asked for sure you cant beat them you cant mean that i should join them surely pospelov shrugged its odd where a crooked path will sometimes take you besides most of them are just us with blue shoulder boards no i cant then you will have to watch out for yourself with all three eyes and by the way dont ever yawn there must be something i can do ivan yefremovich i can share some of my food cant i give my warmer clothing to another man theyll simply find other ways to show you favour or theyll try to persecute those that you help you must really have impressed that mvd major gunther he sighed and looked up at the greywhite sky and sniffed the air any day now it will snow the work will be tougher then if youre going to do anything it would be best to do it before the snow when days and tempers are shorter and the blues hate us more for keeping them outside in a way theyre prisoners just like we are youve got to remember that youd see the good in a pack of wolves pospelov perhaps however your example is a useful one my friend if you wish to stop the wolves from licking your hand you will have to bite one of them pospelovs advice was hardly welcome assaulting one of the guards was a serious offence almost too serious to contemplate and yet i didnt doubt what he had told me if the ivans kept on giving me special treatment i was going to meet with a fatal accident at the hands of my comrades many of these were ruthless nazis and loathsome to me but they were still my fellow countrymen and faced with the choice of keeping faith with them or joining the bolsheviks to save my own skin i quickly formed the conclusion that id already stayed alive for longer than i might otherwise have expected and that maybe i had no choice at all i hated the bolsheviks as much as i hated the nazis under the circumstances perhaps more than i hated the nazis the mvd was just the gestapo with three cyrillic letters and id had enough of everything to do with the whole apparatus of state security to last me a lifetime clear in my mind what i had to do and in full view of almost every pleni in the halfexcavated canal i walked up to sergeant degermenkoy and stood right in front of him i took the cigarette from the mouth in his astonishedlooking face and puffed it happily for a moment i discovered i didnt have the guts to hit him but managed to find it in me to knock the bluebanded cap off his ugly tree stump of a head it was the first and only time i heard laughter at ka and it was the last thing i heard for a while i was waving to the other plenis when something hit me hard on the side of head perhaps the stock of degermenkoys submachine gun and probably more than once my legs gave way and the hard cold ground seemed to swallow me up as if id been water from the volga the black earth enveloped me filling my nostrils mouth and ears and then collapsed altogether and i fell into the dreadful place that the great stalin and the rest of his murderous red gang had prepared for me in their socialist republic and as i fell into that endless deep pit they stood and waved at me with gloved hands from the top of lenins mausoleum while all around me there were people applauding my disappearance laughing at their own good fortune and throwing flowers after me i suppose i should have been used to it after all i was accustomed to visiting prisons as a cop id been in and out of the cement to interview suspects and take statements from others from time to time id even found myself on the wrong side of the judas hole once in when id irritated the potsdam police chief and again in when heydrich had sent me into dachau as an undercover agent to gain the trust of a smalltime criminal dachau had been bad but not as bad as krasnoarmeesk and certainly not as bad as the place i was in now it wasnt that the place was dirty or anything the food was good they even let me have a shower and some cigarettes so what was it that bothered me i suppose it was the fact that i was on my own for the first time since leaving berlin in id been sharing quarters with one or more germans for almost two years and now all of a sudden there was only myself to talk to the guards said nothing i spoke to them in russian and they ignored me the sense of being separated from my comrades of being cut off began to grow and with each day that passed became a little worse at the same time i had an awful feeling of being walled in again this was probably a corollary of having spent so much of the last six months outside just as the sheer size of russia had once left me feeling overwhelmed it was the very smallness of my windowless cell three paces long and half as wide that began to weigh on me each minute of my day seemed to last for ever had i really lived for as long as i had with so little to show for it in the way of thoughts and memories with all that i had done i might reasonably have expected to have occupied myself for hours with a remembrance of things past not a bit of it it was like looking down the wrong end of a telescope my past seemed wholly insignificant almost invisible as for the future the days that lay ahead of me seemed as vast and empty as the steppes themselves but the worst feeling of all was when i thought of my wife just thinking of her at our little apartment in berlin supposing it was still standing could reduce me to tears probably she thought i was dead i might as well have been dead i was buried in a tomb and all that remained was to die i managed to mark the passing time on the porcelain tile walls with my own excrement and in this way i noted the passing of four months meanwhile i put on some weight i even got my smokers cough back monotony dulled my thinking i lay on the plank bed with its sackcloth mattress and stared at the caged light bulb above the door wondering how long they gave you for knocking a blues hat off given the immensity of pospelovs crime and punishment i came to the conclusion that i might expect anything between six months and twentyfive years i tried to find in me something of his fortitude and optimism but it was no good i couldnt help but recall something else he said a joke he made once only with each passing day it felt less and less like a joke and more like a prediction the first ten years are always the hardest he said i was haunted by that remark most of the time i hung on to the certainty that before i was sentenced there would have to be a trial pospelov said there was always a trial of sorts but when the trial came it was over before i knew it they came and took me when i least expected it one minute i was eating my breakfast the next i was in a large room being fingerprinted and photographed by a little bearded man with a big box rangefinder camera on top of the polished wooden box was a little spirit level a bubble of air in a yellow liquid that resembled the photographers watery dead eyes i asked him several questions in my best most subservient russian but the only words he used were turn to the side and stand still please the please was nice after that i expected to be taken back to my cell instead i was steered up a flight of stairs and into a small tribunal room there was a soviet flag a window a large hero wall featuring the terrible trio of marx lenin and stalin and up on a stage a table behind which were sitting three mvd officers none of whom i recognised the senior officer who was seated in the middle of this troika asked me if i required a translator a question that was translated by a translator another mvd officer i said i didnt but the translator stayed anyway and translated badly everything that was said to or about me from then on including the indictment against me which was read out by the prosecutor a reasonablelooking woman who was also an mvd officer she was the first woman id seen since the march out of konigsberg and i could hardly keep my eyes off her bernhard gunther she said in a tremulous voice was she nervous was this her first case you are charged wait a minute i said in russian dont i get a lawyer to defend me can you afford to pay for one asked the chairman i had some money when i left the camp at krasnoarmeesk i said while i was being brought here it disappeared are you suggesting it was stolen yes the three judges conferred for a moment then the chairman said you should have said this before im afraid these proceedings may not be delayed while your allegations are investigated we shall proceed comrade lieutenant the prosecutor continued to read out the charge that you wilfully and with malice aforethought assaulted a guard from voinapleni camp number three at krasnoarmeesk contrary to martial law that you stole a cigarette from the same guard at camp number three which is also against martial law and that you committed these actions with the intent of fomenting a mutiny among the other prisoners at camp three also contrary to martial law these are all crimes against comrade stalin and the peoples of the union of the soviet socialist republics i knew i was in trouble now if i hadnt realised it before i realised it now knocking a mans hat off was one thing mutiny was something else mutiny wasnt the kind of charge to be dismissed lightly do you have anything you wish to say in your defence said the chairman i waited politely for the translator to finish and made my defence i admitted the assault and the theft of the cigarette then almost as an afterthought i added there was certainly no intention of fomenting a mutiny sir the chairman nodded wrote something on a piece of paper probably a reminder to buy some cigarettes and vodka on his way home that night and looked expectantly at the prosecutor in most circumstances i like a woman in uniform the trouble was this one didnt seem to like me wed never met before and yet she seemed to know everything about me the very wicked thought processes that had motivated me to cause the mutiny my devotion to the cause of adolf hitler and nazism the pleasure i had taken in the perfidious attack upon the soviet union in june my important part in the collective guilt of all germans in the murders of millions of innocent russians and not happy with this that id intended to incite the other plenis at camp three to murder many more the only surprise was that the court withdrew for several minutes to reach a verdict and more important have a cigarette smoke was still trailing from the nostrils of one member of the tribunal as they came back into the room the prosecutor stood up the translator stood up i stood up the verdict was announced i was a fascist pig a german bastard a capitalist swine a nazi criminal and i was also guilty as charged in accordance with the demands of the prosecutor and in view of your previous record you are sentenced to death i shook my head certain the prosecutor had made no such demands perhaps she had forgotten nor had my previous record been so much as mentioned unless you counted the invasion of the soviet union and that much was true death i shrugged i suppose i can count myself lucky i dont play the piano oddly the translator had stopped translating what i was saying he was waiting for the chairman to finish speaking you are fortunate that this is a country founded on mercy and a respect for human rights he was saying after the great patriotic war in which so many innocent soviet citizens died it was the wish of comrade stalin that the death penalty should be abolished in our country consequently the capital punishment handed down to you is commuted to twentyfive years hard labour stunned at my declared fate i was led out of the court to a yard outside where a black maria was waiting for me its engine running the driver already had my details which seemed to indicate that the courts verdict had been a foregone conclusion the black maria was divided into four little cells each of them so cramped and low you had to bend over double just to get inside one the metal door was perforated with little holes like the mouthpiece of a telephone they were considerate like that the ivans we set off at speed you might have thought the driver was in charge of a getaway car after a bank robbery and when we stopped we stopped very suddenly as if the police had forced us to stop i heard more prisoners being loaded into the black maria and then we were off again at high speed with the driver laughing loudly as we skidded around one corner and then another finally we stopped the engine was switched off the doors were flung open and all was made plain we were beside a train that was already under steam and making strong exhalated hints that it was impatient to leave but to where no one said everyone in the black maria was ordered to climb aboard a cattle car alongside several other germans whose faces looked as grim as i was feeling twentyfive years if i lived that long it was going to be before i went home again the door of the cattle car slid shut with a bang leaving us all in partial darkness the bogies shifted a little throwing us all into each others arms and then the train set off any idea where were going said a voice does it matter said someone hells the same whichever fiery pit youre in this place is too cold to be hell said another i peered through an air hole in the wall of the cattle car it was impossible to see where the sun was the sky was a blank sheet of grey that was soon black with night and salted with snow at the other end of the wagon a man was crying the sound was tearing us all apart someone say something to that fellow for gods sake i muttered loudly like what said the man next to me i dunno but id rather not listen to that sound unless i have to hey fritz said a voice stop that crying will you youre spoiling the party for some fellow at the other end of the carriage this is supposed to be a picnic see not a funeral cortege thats what you think this accent was unmistakably berlin take a look out of this air hole you can see the kirchhof cemetery i moved toward the berliner and got talking to him and soon afterwards we discovered that everyone in the wagon had been tried in the same court on some trumpedup charge found guilty and sentenced to a long term of hard labour i seemed to be about the only man who had committed a real offence the berliners name was walter bingel and before the war hed been a park keeper in the gardens of the sanssouci palace in potsdam i was at a camp next to the zaritsa gorge near rostov he explained i was sad to leave as a matter of fact the potatoes i planted were about ready to pull up but i managed to bring some seeds with me so maybe we wont go hungry at wherever it is were going there was much speculation about where this might be one man said we were going to a coalmining camp at vorkuta north of the arctic circle then another mentioned the name of sakhalin and that silenced everyone including myself whats sakhalin asked bingel its a camp in the easternmost part of russia i said a death camp said someone else they sent a lot of ss there after stalingrad sakhalin means black in one of those subhuman languages they use out there i met a man who claimed hed been there an ivan prisoner no one really knows if it exists or not i added oh it exists all right full of nips it is the place is so far east its not even attached to the fucking mainland they dont even bother with a barbedwire fence at sakhalin why would they theres nowhere else to go the train rolled on for almost three whole days and there was relief when finally they broke the ice on the locks and the door of the wagon opened because the faces of the guards who greeted us were vaguely european and not oriental which seemed to indicate that wed been spared sakhalin not all of us had been spared however as men jumped down from the wagon it was clear that one man had managed to hang himself from a wooden peg it was the man who had been crying several hundred of us lined up beside the track awaiting our new orders wherever we were now was cold but not nearly as cold as stalingrad perhaps it was the weather but a new rumour that we were home quickly murmured its way through the ranks like a hindus mantra this is germany were home unlike most of the rumours to which we german plenis were often prey there was some truth in this one for it seemed that we were just across the border in what many of my more rabidly nazi comrades probably still thought of as the german protectorate of bohemia otherwise known as czechoslovakia and excitement mounted as we marched into saxony theyre going to let us go why else would they have brought us all the way from russia why else indeed but it wasnt long before our hopes of an early release were dashed we marched into a little mining town called johannesgeorgenstadt and then out the other side up a hill with a fine view of the local lutheran church and several tall chimneys and through the gates of an old nazi concentration camp one of almost a hundred subcamps in the flossenburg complex most of us imagined that all germanys kzs had been closed so it was a bit of a shock to discover one still open and ready for business a greater shock awaited us however there were almost two hundred german plenis already living and working at the johannesgeorgenstadt kz and even by the poor standards of soviet prisoner welfare none of these looked well the sgo ss general klause soon explained why im sorry to see you here men he said i wish i could have been welcoming you back to germany with pleasure but im afraid i cant if any of you are familiar with the erzgebirge mountains you will know that the area is rich with pitchblende from which uranium ore is extracted uranium is radioactive and has a number of uses but theres only one use for it that the ivans are interested in uranium in large quantities is vital for the soviet atombomb project and its no exaggeration to say that they perceive the development of such a weapon as a matter of the highest priority and certainly a much higher priority than your health were uncertain what effect prolonged exposure to unrefined pitchblende has on the human body but you can bet its not good for two reasons one is that marie curie who discovered the stuff died from its effect and the other is that the blues come down the mineshaft only when they have to and even then only for short periods and wearing face masks so if youre down the pit try to cover your nose and mouth with a handkerchief on the positive side the food here is good and plentiful and brutality is kept to a minimum there are good washing facilities after all this was a german camp before it was a russian one and were allowed a day off once a week but only because they have to check the lifting gear and the gas levels radon gas im told colourless odourless and thats about all i know about it except im sure its also hazardous sorry thats another negative and since were back on the side of the debits i may as well mention now that in this camp the mvd employs a number of germans as recruiting officers for some new peoples police theyre planning to create in the soviet zone of occupied germany a secret police designed to be a german arm of the mvd the establishment of such a police force in germany is banned by the rules of the allied control commission but that doesnt mean theyre not going to do it under the table by subterfuge but they cant do it at all if they dont have the men to do it so be careful what you say and do for they will most certainly interrogate and interview you at length dyou hear i want no renegades under my command these germans the ivans have working for them are communists veteran communists from the old kpd what we were fighting against the ugly face of european bolshevism if there were some among you who doubted the truth of our national socialist cause i imagine you have learned that it was you who were mistaken not the leader remember what ive said and watch yourself i was one of the lucky ones in that i wasnt ordered down the pit immediately instead i was put on the sorting detail wagonloads of rock were brought up from the mine and emptied onto a large conveyor belt that was running between two lines of plenis someone showed me how to inspect the pieces of brownishblack rock for veins of the allimportant pitchblende rocks without veins were thrown away the others graded by eye and tossed into bins for further selection by a blue holding a metal tube with a mica window at one end the better the quality of the ore the more electric current that was reproduced as white noise by the tube these higherquality rocks were taken away for processing in russia but the quantities considered useful were small it seemed that tonnes of rock would be needed to produce just a small quantity of ore and none of the men working at the johannesgeorgenstadt mine were of the opinion that the ivans would be building an atom bomb any time soon id been there almost a month when i was told to report to the mine office this was housed in a grey stone building next to the pithead winding gear i went up to the first floor and waited through the open door of the office i could see a couple of mvd officers i could also hear what they said and i realised that these were two of the germans general klause had warned us about seeing me standing there they waved me inside and closed the door i glanced up at the clock on the wall it was eleven am there was a microphone on the table and i imagined somewhere a large tape machine ready to record my every word next to the microphone was a spotlight but it wasnt switched on not yet there was an undrawn black curtain beside the window they invited me to sit down on a chair in front of the desk the last time i did this i got twentyfive years hard labour i said so if youll forgive me i really dont have anything to say if you wish said one of the officers you may appeal the verdict did the court tell you that no what the court did tell me was that the soviets are every bit as stupid and brutal as the nazis its interesting you say that i didnt reply it seems to support an impression we have of you captain gunther that youre not a nazi meanwhile the other officer had picked up a telephone and was saying something in russian that i could not hear im major weltz said the first officer he looked at the man now replacing the telephone receiver and this is lieutenant rascher i grunted like you i am also from berlin said weltz as a matter of fact i was there just last weekend im afraid youd hardly recognise it incredible the destruction that was inflicted by hitlers refusal to surrender he pushed a packet of cigarettes across the table please help yourself to a cigarette im afraid theyre russian but theyre better than nothing i took one here he said coming around the desk and snapping open a lighter let me light that for you he sat down on the edge of the table and watched me smoke then the door opened and a starshina came in carrying a sheet of paper he laid it on the table next to the cigarettes and left again without saying a word weltz glanced at the sheet of paper for a moment and then turned it to face me your appeal form he said my eyes flicked across the cyrillic letters would you like me to translate it that wont be necessary i can read and speak russian very well too by all accounts he handed me a fountain pen and waited for me to sign the sheet of paper is there a problem whats the point i said dully theres every point the government of the soviet union has its forms and formalities like every other country nothing happens without a piece of paper it was the same in germany was it not an official form for everything again i hesitated you want to go home dont you to berlin well you cant go home unless youve been released and you cant be released unless you appeal your sentence first really its as simple as that oh im not promising anything but this form puts the process into motion think of it like that pithead winding gear outside that piece of paper makes the wheel start to move i read the form forwards and then backwards sometimes things in the soviet union and its zones of occupation made more sense if you read them backwards i signed it and major weltz drew the form towards him so at least we know that you do want to get out of here he said to go home now that weve established that much all we have to do is figure out a way of making that happen i mean sooner rather than later to be exact twentyfive years from now that is if you survive what anyone here will tell you is hazardous work personally i dont much care to be even this close to large deposits of uranite apparently they turn it into this yellow powder that glows in the dark god only knows what it does to people thanks but im not interested we havent told you what were offering yet said weltz a job as a policeman i would have thought that might appeal to a man with your qualifications a man who was never a member of the nazi party said lieutenant rascher a former member of the social democratic party did you know captain that the kpd and the sdp have joined together its a bit late i said we could have used the support of the kpd in december during the red revolution that was trotskys fault said weltz anyway better late than never eh the new party the socialist unity party the sed it represents a fresh start for us both to work together for a new germany another new germany i shrugged well we can hardly make do with the old one wouldnt you agree theres so much that we have to rebuild not just politics but law and order too the police force were starting a new force for the moment its being called the fifth kommissariat or k we hope to have it up and running by the end of the year and until then were looking for recruits a man such as yourself a former oberkommissar with kripo with a record for honesty and integrity who was chased out of the force by the nazis is just the sort of principled man we need i think i can probably guarantee reinstatement at your old rank with full pension rights a berlin weighted allowance help with a new apartment a job for your wife no thanks thats too bad said lieutenant rascher look why dont you think it over captain said weltz sleep on it you see to be perfectly honest with you gunther youre at the top of our list in this camp and for obvious reasons wed rather not stay here longer than we have to im already a father but the lieutenant here has no wish to damage his chances of having a son if and when he marries you see radiation does something to a mans ability to procreate it also affects the thyroid and the bodys ability to use energy and make proteins at least thats what i think it does the answer is still no i said may i go now the major adopted a rueful expression i dont understand you he said how is it that you a social democrat were prepared to go and work for heydrich and yet you wont work for us can you explain that please it was now i realised who the major reminded me of the uniform might have been different but with the white blond hair blue eyes high forehead and even loftier tone i was already thinking of heydrich before he mentioned the name probably weltz and heydrich would have been about the same age too if he hadnt been murdered heydrich would have been about fortytwo now the younger lieutenant was rather more grey haired with a face as wide as the majors was long he looked like me before the war and a year in a pow camp well gunther what have you to say for yourself perhaps you were always just a nazi in all but name a party fellow traveller is that it did it take you this long to understand what you really are you and heydrich i said to the major youre not so very different i never wanted to work for him either but i was afraid to say no afraid of what he might do to me you on the other hand have shot your bolt there youve already done your worst short of shooting me theres not much more you can actually do to me sometimes its a great comfort to know that youve already hit rock bottom we could break you said weltz we could do that ive broken a few men myself in my time i said but there has to be some point to it and with me there isnt because if you break me then youd be doing it just for the hell of it and whats more id be no good to you when you were finished im no good to you now only you just dont know it major so let me tell you why i was the kind of cop who was too dumb to act smart and look the other way or to kiss someones behind the nazis were cleverer than you they knew that the only reason heydrich brought me back to kripo was because he knew that even in a police state there are times when you need a real policeman but you dont want a real policeman major weltz you want a clerk with a badge you want me to read karl marx at bedtime and peoples mail during the day you want a man whos eager to please and looking for advancement in the communist party i shook my head wearily the last time i was looking for advancement in a party a pretty girl slapped my face pity said weltz it seems youre going to spend the rest of your life dead like all of your class gunther youre a victim of history we both are major being a victim of history is what being a german is all about but i was also a victim of my environment they made sure of that soon after my meeting with the boys from k i was transferred off the sorting detail and into the mine it was a world of constant thunder there was the rumble of underground explosions that broke the rock into manageable chunks and there was the crash of the cage doors before it slid down the guides and into the shaft there was the din of rocks we split with pickaxes and then threw into the wagons and the continual barrage as these moved backwards and forwards along the rails and with each detonation there was dust and more dust turning my snot black and my sweat into a kind of grey oil at night i coughed great gritty gobs of saliva and phlegm that looked like burnt fried eggs it all felt like a high price to pay for my principles but there was a camaraderie down the shaft that wasnt to be had anywhere else in johannesgeorgenstadt and an automatic respect from the other plenis who heard our coughing and recognised their own comparative good fortune pospelov had been right about that theres always someone worse off than yourself i hoped to get a chance to meet that someone before the work killed me there was a mirror in the washroom mostly we avoided it for fear that wed see our own grandfathers or worse their decomposed bodies looking back at us but one day i inadvertently caught sight of myself and saw a man with a face like the pitchblende rock we were mining it was brownish black lumpy and misshapen with two dull opaque spaces where my eyes had once been and a row of dark grey excrescences that might have been my teeth id met a lot of criminal types in my life but i looked like mister hydes blacksheep brother acted like him too there were no blues down the shaft and we settled our differences with a maximum of violence once schaefer another pleni from berlin who didnt much like cops told me that hed cheered when the leaders of the sdp had been chased out of berlin in so i punched him hard in the face and when he tried to hit me with a pickaxe i hit him with a shovel it was a while before he got up and in truth he was never quite the same again after that another victim of history karl marx would have approved but after a while i stopped caring about anything very much including myself i would squeeze into tight spaces in the black rock to work in solitude with my pick which was the most dangerous thing to do since caveins were common but there was less dust to breathe this way than when they used explosives another month passed and then one day i was summoned to the office again and i went along expecting to find the same two mvd officers and hear them ask me if my time down the mineshaft had helped to change my mind about k it had changed my mind about a lot of things but not german communism and its secret police force i was going to tell them to go to hell and perhaps sound like i meant it too even though i was ready for someone to come and put some plaster of paris on my face so i was a little disappointed that the two officers werent there the way you are when youve worked up a pretty good speech about a lot of noble things that dont add up to very much thats important when youre lying in the morgue there was only one officer in the room a heavyset man with receding brown hair and a pugnacious jaw like his two predecessors he wore blue breeches and a brown gimnasterka tunic but he was better decorated as well as the veteran nkvd soldier badge and order of the red banner there were other medals i didnt recognise the insignia on his collar tabs and the stars on his sleeves seemed to indicate that he was at least a colonel or perhaps even a general his blue officers cap with its squarish visor lay on the table alongside the nagant revolver in its bucketsized holster the answer is still no i said hardly caring who he was sit down he said and dont be a bloody fool he was german i know ive put on a bit of weight he said but i thought you of all people would recognise me i sat down and rubbed some of the dust from my eyes now you come to mention it you do seem kind of familiar you i wouldnt have recognised at all not in a million years i know i should lay off the chocolates get myself a haircut and a manicure but i never do seem to have the time my job keeps me pretty busy the officers pork butchers face cracked a smile almost a sense of humour thats impressive in this place but if you really want to impress me then stop playing the tough guy and tell me who i am dont you know he tutted impatiently and shook his head please i can help you if youll let me but i have to believe youre worth it if youre any kind of detective youll remember who i am erich mielke i said your name is erich mielke chapter twentyfive germany you knew all along there was a moment when i didnt the last time i saw you erich you looked like me for a moment mielke looked grim as if he was remembering fucking french he said they were as bad as the nazis in my book it still sticks in my throat they get to be one of the four victorious powers in berlin what did they do to defeat the fascists nothing we can agree on something anyway le vernet was the second time you pulled my bread out of the oven whyd you do it i shrugged it seemed like a good idea at the time no that wont do he said firmly tell me i want to know you were dressed like a gestapo officer but you didnt act like one i didnt get it then and i dont get it now between you and me and these four walls erich im afraid the gestapo were rather a bad lot i told him about the murders committed by major bomelburg and the ss storm troopers on the road to lourdes you see its one thing taking a man back to stand trial its something completely different just to shoot him in a ditch at the side of the road it was just your good fortune that we went to the camp at gurs first otherwise it might have been you who was shot while trying to escape but given what ive seen since of your friends in the mvd its probably what you deserved rats are still rats whether theyre grey black or brown i just wasnt cut out to be much of a rat myself maybe a white rat eh maybe mielke chucked a packet of belomorkanal across the table at me here i dont smoke myself but i brought these for you he tossed some matches after the cigarettes its my opinion that smoking is bad for your health my health has got more important things to worry about i lit one and puffed it happily but maybe you didnt know russian nails are better for your health than american ones oh whys that because theres so little tobacco in them four good puffs and theyre gone mielke smiled talking about your health i dont think this place is good for you if you stay here long enough youre liable to grow two heads that would be a waste in my opinion he came around the table and sat on the corner swinging one of his polished riding boots carelessly you know when i was in russia i learned to look after my health i even won the sports medal of the soviet union i was living in a little town outside moscow called krasnogorsk and i used to go hunting at the weekend on a sporting estate once owned by the yussupov family prince yussupov was one of those aristocrats who murdered rasputin there was all sorts of rubbish talked about the death of rasputin you know that they had to kill him three or four times before he was actually dead that they poisoned him shot him beat him to death and then drowned him in fact they made it all up just to make their futile deed seem more heroic and the prince didnt even do the deed himself the truth was that rasputin was shot through the forehead by a member of the british secret service now i mention all of this to make the point that a man even a strong man like rasputin or you perhaps can survive almost anything except being killed you my friend will die here you know it i know it perhaps you will be poisoned by the uranite perhaps you will be shot attempting to escape or when the mine floods as i believe sometimes it does then you will drown but it doesnt have to be that way i want to help you gunther really i do but youll need to trust me im all ears erich just two of them at the last count we both know that you would make a very poor officer in the fifth kommissariat first you would have to attend the antifascist school in krasnogorsk for reeducation to be turned into a believer from our one meeting and everything ive read about you gunther im quite convinced that it would be a waste of time trying to convert you into a communist however that still remains your best way out of here to volunteer for k and reeducation its true ive rather neglected my reading of late but naturally this would only be a smokescreen for your escape naturally i suppose theres no chance of me being shot through this smokescreen theres a chance of us both being shot if you really want to know im sticking my neck out for you gunther i hope you appreciate that over the last ten or twelve years ive become rather an expert at saving my own skin i imagine its something we have in common either way its not something i do lightly why do it at all why take the risk i dont get it the same way you didnt get it you think youre the only rat thats not cut out for it you think a gestapo officer is the only man who can develop a conscience i was never a believer but you you believed it all erich its true i did believe absolutely which is why it comes as a shock to discover that party loyalty can count for nothing and everything can be taken away again at the stroke of a pen why would they do that to you erich we all have our little secrets thats why no that wont do i said parroting his earlier speech once more tell me i want to know and then maybe ill trust you mielke stood up and walked around the room with his arms folded around himself in thought after a while he nodded and said did you ever wonder what happened to me after le vernet yes but i told heydrich you joined the foreign legion im not sure if he believed me i was interned at le vernet for another three years after i saw you in can you imagine that three years in hell well perhaps you can now yes i suppose you can i was posing as a germanlatvian called richard hebel then in december was conscripted as a labourer into speers ministry for armaments and war production i became what had previously been known as a todt worker effectively i and thousands of others were slave labour for the nazis i myself was a woodcutter in the ardennes forest supplying fuel for the german army thats where i became the man you see now these are woodcutters shoulders anyway i remained a so called relief volunteer working twelve hours a day until the end of the war when i made my way back to berlin and walked into the newly legalised kpd headquarters on potsdamer platz to volunteer my services to the party i was extremely lucky i met someone who told me to lie about what id been doing during the war he advised me to say that i hadnt been a prisoner at all and certainly not a relief volunteer for the fascists mielke frowned a big puzzled frown like a bear gradually realising that it has been stung by a bee he shook his head well this didnt make any sense to me after all it was hardly my fault that id been forced to work for the nazis but i was told that the party wouldnt see it that way and against all of my instincts which were to have faith in comrade stalin and the party i decided to put my trust in this one man his name was victor dietrich so i told them id been lying low in spain and then fighting with the french partisans it was just as well i did say this because without dietrichs advice my honesty would have been fatal you see back in august comrade stalin as peoples commissar for defence had issued an infamous order order number twoseventy which in essence said that there were no soviet prisoners of war only traitors mielke shrugged of almost two million men and women who returned from german and french incarceration to the soviet union and its zones of control many of them loyal party members a very large percentage have been executed or sent to labour camps for between ten and twenty years these included my own brother thats why i no longer believe gunther because at any moment my past might catch up with me and i could be where you are now but i want a future something concrete is that so unusual im seeing this woman her name is gertrud shes a seamstress in berlin my mother was a seamstress did you know that anyway id like us to feel that we might have a life together i dont know why im telling you all this i dont have to justify why im helping you surely you saved my life twice what kind of man would i be if i forgot that i stayed silent for a moment then his face darkened with impatience do you want my help or not damn it how is it going to happen i asked thats what id like to know if im going to put my soul in your hands you can hardly be surprised if i want to check that your fingernails are clean spoken like a true berliner and fair enough now then the central antifa school is in krasnogorsk every month we send them a bag of nazis on a plane from berlin for reeducation theres quite a number of them there now members of the national committee for a free germany they call themselves field marshal paulus is one them did you know that paulus a collaborator ever since stalingrad also there is von seydlitzkurzbach of course youd remember his propaganda broadcasts in konigsberg yes its quite a little german colony over there a regular nazi home from home once youre on the plane to krasnogorsk from berlin theres no getting off but on the train between here and berlin or better still between here and zwickau thats where you could make your escape just think from this camp to the ami zone of occupation is less than sixty kilometres if my lady friend gertrud was not in east berlin i might be tempted myself so what i propose is this i will inform major weltz that ive persuaded you to change your mind that you are prepared to undergo reeducation at the antifa school hell speak to the camp commander wholl take you out of the pit and put you back on the sorting otherwise everything else will appear as normal until the day you leave this place when a clean uniform and new boots will be provided for you to wear by the way what size boots do you take fortysix mielke shrugged a mans body weight can fluctuate dramatically but his feet always stay the same size all right there will be a gun inside the leg of the boot some papers and a key for your manacles youll probably be accompanied on your journey by that young mvd lieutenant and a russian starshina but be warned they wont give up easily the penalty for allowing a pleni to escape is to take the prisoners place in the labour camp and the chances are youll have to use the gun and kill them both but that shouldnt be a problem for you the train wont be like previous convict trains youve been on youll be in a compartment as soon as youre moving ask to use the toilet and come out shooting the rest is up to you the best thing would be if you took the uniform of one of your escorts since you speak russian that shouldnt be a problem either jump the train and head west of course if youre caught i shall deny everything so please spare me the embarrassment if they torture you blame major weltz i never liked him anyway mielkes ruthlessness made me smile theres just one problem i said the other plenis my comrades theyll think i sold out theyre nazis most of them do you really care what they think i didnt think i would but oddly i do yes theyll find out you escaped soon enough that kind of news travels fast especially if that major gets the rap for it and ill make sure he does theres just one more thing when you get to the ami zone i want you to do me a favour i want you to go to an address in berlin and give someone i know some money a woman as a matter of fact you met her once you probably dont remember but you gave her a lift in your car that same day you saved me from those sa storm troopers i wouldnt want to make helping you a habit erich but sure why not how much of what erich mielke told me was true was neither here nor there he was certainly right that if i remained at the camp in johannesgeorgenstadt i would probably die what mielke didnt know when he offered me a way to escape was that i had been about ready to throw in the towel and join k in the hope that much later on after i had become a good communist i might find a chance to escape almost immediately after my meeting with mielke i was as hed promised transferred back to the sorting of the rock this raised some suspicions that id agreed to collaborate with the german communists and i was subjected to some close questioning by general krause and his adjutant an ss major named dunst however they seemed to accept my assurances that i remained loyal to germany whatever that meant and as the days passed their earlier suspicions began to diminish i had no idea when i would be summoned to the office and given my clean uniform and the allimportant boots and as yet more time passed i began to wonder if mielke had deceived me or even if he had been arrested himself then one cold spring day i was ordered to the showers where i was allowed to wash and then given another uniform it had been boil washed and all of the badges and insignia removed but after my own lousy clothes it felt like it had been tailored at holters the pleni who gave it to me was a russian besprisorni an orphaned boy whod grown up in the soviet labour camp system and was regarded by the blues as a trusted prisoner who needed no supervision he handed me my boots which were made of rather fine soft leather and then kept a lookout for me the money was roubles and in an envelope addressed to mielkes friend several hundred dollars the papers included a pink pass a ration card a travel permit and a german identity card everything id need if i was stopped on the road to nuremberg in the ami zone there was a small key for a set of manacles and there was a loaded gun that was almost as small as the key a sixshot colt with a twoinch barrel not much of a gun but enough to make you think again about disagreeing with the person who might be holding it but only just it was a joygirls gun hammerless so as not to snag her stockings i tucked the papers and the money inside my boots the gun under my waistband and walked towards the gate where lieutenant rascher and a blue sergeant were waiting for me as predicted the only trouble was that major weltz was waiting for me as well killing two men was going to be hard enough three looked like a much taller order but there was no going back now they were standing beside a black zim saloon that looked more american than russian i was halfway there when i heard someone call my name i glanced around to see bingel nod at me sign the pact in blood did you gunther he asked your soul i hope you got a good price for it you bastard i just hope i live long enough to have the chance to send you to hell myself i felt pretty low at this but i went to the car and held out my wrists for the manacles then we got in and the blue drove us away what did that man say asked rascher he wished me all the best really no but i reckon i can live with it in the little railway station in johannesgeorgenstadt there was a train already waiting the steam locomotive was black with a red star on the front like something from hell which in the circumstances felt entirely suitable i couldnt rid myself of the feeling that even though i was planning to escape i was doing something inherently shameful i almost couldnt have felt worse if i really had been intending to join the fifth kommissariat the four of us climbed up into a carriage with the word for berlin in cyrillic chalkmarked on the side we had it all to ourselves the train had no central corridor all of the carriages were separate so much for coming out of the toilet with all guns blazing the rest of the carriages were full of red army soldiers headed for dresden which hardly made things any easier our own russian sergeant was sweating and nervouslooking and before he boarded the train behind me i noticed that he crossed himself which seemed a little curious as even in the soviet zone rail travel was really not that hazardous by contrast the two german mvd officers appeared composed and relaxed as we sat down and waited for the train to move i asked the starshina if he spoke any german he shook his head the fellows ukrainian i think said major weltz he doesnt speak a word of german the ivan lit a cigarette and stared out of the window avoiding my eye hes an ugly sonofabitch isnt he i remarked i imagine his mother must have been a whore like all ukrainian women the ivan didnt flinch at any of that all right i said i really do think he doesnt speak german so its probably safe to talk weltz frowned what on earth are you driving at listen sir all our lives could depend on us trusting each other now we three germans dont look at him but how much do you know about our smelly friend here the major glanced at the lieutenant who shook his head nothing at all he said why nothing he was posted to the camp at johannesgeorgenstadt just a few days ago said rascher from berlin thats really all i know about him and hes going back already whats all this about gunther said weltz theres something about him thats not quite right i said no dont look at him but hes nervous when he shouldnt be nervous and i saw him crossing himself a minute ago i dont know what you think youre playing at gunther but shut up and listen i was an intelligence officer and before that i worked for the war crimes bureau in berlin one of the crimes we investigated was the murders of twentysix thousand polish officers four thousand of them at a place im not going to mention in case it makes this dog prick up his ears they were all of them murdered and buried in a forest clearing by the nkvd oh thats nonsense insisted the major everyone knows that was the ss look its vital you believe that they werent killed by the ss i know i saw the bodies look this man this blue sitting next to us is wearing several medals on his chest one of which is the merited nkvd worker medal like i said i was an intelligence officer and i happen to know that this medal was commissioned by the council of the peoples commissars of the ussr in other words uncle joe himself in october as a special thank you to all of those who did the killings in april of that same year the major tutted loudly and rolled his eyes in exasperation outside our carriage the stationmaster blew his whistle and the locomotive expelled a loud cloud of steam where are you going with this conversation dont you get it hes an assassin i wouldnt mind betting that comrade general mielke has placed him on this train to kill all three of us the train started to move ridiculous said weltz look if this is the beginning of an attempt at escape its a pretty clumsy one everyone knows that those poles were murdered by the fascists you mean everyone except everyone in poland i said theres not much doubt there who was responsible but if you dont believe that then maybe youll believe this mielkes already screwed you in the ass major he gave me a gun that im supposed to use to help make my escape but my bet is that the gun isnt going to work why would the comrade general do such a thing asked weltz shaking his head it makes absolutely no sense it makes a lot of sense if you know mielke as well as i do i think he wants me dead because of what i could tell you about him and he probably wants you both dead in case i already have it couldnt hurt to see if hes telling the truth about the gun sir said lieutenant rascher all right stand up gunther staying exactly where i was i glanced quickly at the russian sergeant he had a large stalinsized moustache and one continuous matching eyebrow the nose was round and red almost comicallooking the ears had more hair on and in them than a wild pig if you search me major the ivan will figure somethings wrong and draw his gun and it will be too late for us all when hes done that what if gunthers right sir said lieutenant rascher we dont know anything about this fellow i gave you an order gunther now do as youre told the major was already unbuttoning the flap on his holstered nagant there was no telling if he was about to pull the gun on me or the mvd starshina but the ivan saw it and then met my eye and when he met my eye he saw what i had seen in his something lethal he reached for his own pistol and this prompted lieutenant rascher to abandon the idea of searching me and fumble for his own gun still wearing handcuffs and with no time to decide if the major was with me or not i swung my fists at the ivan as if i had been driving a golf ball and connected hard with the outside of his porcine head the blow knocked him onto the floor between the two rows of seats but the big thirtyeight was already in his greasy fist someone else fired and the glass in the carriage door above him shattered a split second later the ivan fired back i felt the bullet zip past my head and hit something or someone behind me i kicked at the russians face and turned to see the major dead on the seat and the lieutenant aiming his revolver at the ivan with both hands but still hesitating to pull the trigger as if hed never shot anyone before shoot him you idiot i yelled but even as i spoke the more experienced ukrainian fired again punctuating the young germans forehead with a single red fullstop gritting my teeth i stamped at the russians face with the heel of my boot and this time i kept on going as if i was stamping on something verminous one last uppercut of a kick caught him under the jaw and i felt something give way i stamped again and his throat seemed to collapse under the force of my boot he made a loud choking noise that lasted as long as my next kick and then he stopped moving i collapsed back onto the seat of the railway carriage and surveyed the scene rascher was dead weltz was dead i didnt need to check for a pulse to know that when hes shot dead a mans face wears a certain look thats a mixture of surprise and repose as if someone stopped a movie in the very middle of an actors big scene with his mouth agape and his eyes halfopen there was that and there was the fact that their brains and what these had been swimming in were all over the floor the mvd starshina made a long slow gurgling noise and adjusting my balance against the movement of the railway carriage i kicked him hard as hard as i could against the side of his head thered been enough shooting for one day my ears were still ringing from the shots and the carriage smelt strongly of cordite but i wasnt disturbed by any of this after the battle of konigsberg nothing like that bothered me much and my mind was disposed to interpret the ringing in my ears as an alarm and a call to action if i kept my nerve i could still complete my escape in other circumstances i might easily have panicked jumped off the train and tried to make for the american zone as id originally intended but a better plan was already presenting itself and this depended on my acting quickly before the blood spreading on the floor spoiled everything both the german mvd officers had luggage i opened up the bags and found that each man had brought a spare gimnasterka this was just as well as there was blood on both of their tunics but the allimportant blue trousers were still unmarked first i emptied their pockets and removed their decorations their blue shoulder boards and their portupeya crossbelts then i pulled their tunics up and wrapped their shattered heads in the thick cloth to help staunch the blood weltzs skull felt like a bag full of marbles you have to be a certain type of man to clean up efficiently after a murder and no one does that better than a cop maybe what i was planning wouldnt work maybe id get caught but the two germans had bigger problems they were both as dead as weimar i took off their boots unlaced the legs of their blue breeches and then hauled those off too i put both pairs carefully up on the luggage rack well out of the way of what i was going to do next it would have been a mistake to have opened the carriage door a red army soldier in one of the other carriages might have seen me doing it so i slid down the window balanced the majors naked body on the sill and waited for a tunnel it was fortunate that we were travelling through the erzgebirge mountains there are lots of tunnels for the railway line that runs through the erzgebirge mountains by the time i had defenestrated the two dead germans i was exhausted but working down the mineshaft had given me the capacity to go beyond the limits of my own exhaustion to say nothing of a wiry muscularity in my arms and shoulders and in this respect i was also fortunate i might also add that i was desperate i wasnt sure if the ukrainian was dead but i hardly cared his nkvd assassins badge did not inspire my sympathy in his pockets i found some money quite a lot of money and more interesting a piece of paper bearing an address in cyrillic but it was the same address as the envelope mielke had given me for his friend i guessed that having killed me my assassin was detailed to deliver the dollars in the envelope himself that envelope had been a nice touch partly allaying any fears of a doublecross on mielkes part after all who would give an envelope full of money to a man he intended to have killed there was also an identity document that gave the ukrainians name as vasili karpovich lebyediev he was stationed at mvd headquarters in berlin at karlshorst which i remembered better as a villa colony with a racecourse he didnt work for the mvd but for the ministry of military forces the mbc whatever that was the nagant revolver in his apparently lifeless hand was dated and had been well looked after i wondered how many innocent victims of stalin it had been used to kill for that reason i took a certain pleasure in pushing his naked body out of the carriage window it felt like a kind of justice i used the ivans tunic and my old uniform to mop the floor and wipe the walls of any remaining blood and brain tissue and then threw them out of the window i put the pieces of glass into the russians cap alongside his decorations and threw that out of the window too and when everything apart from me looked almost respectable i dressed carefully in the lieutenants blue breeches the majors were too big around the waist and his spare tunic and prepared to face down any ivans who might come aboard at dresden i was ready for that what i wasnt ready for was dresden the train went straight past the ruins of the citys eighteenthcentury cathedral i could hardly believe my own eyes the bellshaped dome was completely gone and the rest of the city was no better dresden had never seemed like an important town or one with any strategic significance and i began to worry about what berlin might look like did i even have a home town that was worth returning to the red army sergeant who came aboard the carriage at dresden and asked to see my papers glanced at the broken window with mild surprise what happened in here he asked i dont know but it must have been some party he shook his head and frowned some of these young lads they have in uniform now theyre just kolkhozniks peasants who dont know how to behave half of them have never even seen a proper passenger train let alone travelled on one you cant blame them for that i said generously and for letting off a bit of steam now and again especially when you consider what the fascists did to russia right now im more concerned about what theyve done to this train he glanced at lieutenant raschers identity document and then at me i met his gaze with steadyeyed innocence youve lost a bit of weight since that picture was taken youre right i said i hardly recognise myself typhus does that to a man im on leave back to berlin after six weeks in hospital the sergeant inched back a little its all right i said im over the worst of it now i picked it up in the pow camp at johannesgeorgenstadt full of fleas and lice it was i started to scratch for added effect he handed me back the documents and nodded a quick goodbye i expect he washed his hands quite soon afterwards i know i would have done i dropped down on the seat and opened the majors bag again there was a bottle of asbach brandy id been looking forward to all morning i opened it took a swig and searched through the rest of his stuff there were some clothes some smokes a few papers and an early edition of poems by georg trakl id always rather admired his work and one particular poem in the eastern front now seemed to match the time and more especially the place i can still remember it by heart the ominous anger of the people is like the furious organ of the winter storm the purple wave of battle like the leafless stars with broken brows and silver arms the night winks to dying soldiers in the shade of an autumn ash tree the ghosts of the dead are sighing a desert crown of thorns surrounds the city from the bleeding stairs the moon chases the shocked women wild wolves break through the door authors own translation chapter twentysix germany and you think that erich mielke wanted you dead because he owed his life to you my american friend tapped his pipe and let the burnt tobacco fall onto the floor of my cell i wanted to scold him for it to remind him that these were my quarters and to show a little respect but what was the point it was an american world i was living in now and i was a pawn in a neverending game of intercontinental chess with the russians not just that i said because i could connect him with the murders of those two berlin policemen you see heydrich always suspected that mielke felt a certain amount of embarrassment that hed committed a crime as serious as the murders of policemen that it was somehow unworthy of him he thought it was almost certainly mielke who fingered the two germans who put him up to it kippenberger and neumann during stalins great purge of they both died in the labour camps their wives too even kippenbergers daughter was sent to a labour camp mielke really tried to clean house there but i also knew about mielkes work in spain his work as a chekist with the military security service torturing and killing those republicans anarchists and trotskyites who deviated from the party line as dictated by stalin again heydrich strongly suspected that mielke used his position as a political commissar with the international brigade in spain to eliminate erich ziemer if you remember ziemer was the man who helped mielke murder the two cops and i think heydrich was probably right i think that mielke may even have planned some political role for himself in germany after the war and he reasoned quite rightly that the german people and more especially berliners would never take to a man whod murdered two policemen in cold blood there was an attempt by the west berlin courts to prose cute him for those murders in said the ami with the bow tie a judge called wilhelm kuhnast issued a warrant for mielkes arrest did you know about that no by then i wasnt living in berlin it failed of course the soviets closed ranks in front of mielke to shield him from further inquiry and tried their best to discredit kuhnast the criminal records that kuhnast used to build up his case disappeared kuhnast was lucky not to disappear himself erich mielke has survived numerous party purges said the ami with the pipe he survived the death of stalin of course and rather more recently the death of lavrenty beria we think that he was never a relief volunteer for the todt organisation that was just a story he gave you if he had worked for them hed be dead like all the rest of them who came back and found a cold welcome from stalin to us it seems much more likely that mielke got out of that french camp at le vernet quite soon after you saw him there in the summer of and got himself back to the soviet union before hitler invaded russia why not i shrugged he never struck me as the george washington i cannot tell a lie type so ill contain my obvious disappointment that he might have lied to me today your old friend is east germanys deputy chief of the secret police the stasi have you heard of the stasi ive been away for five years okay when stalin died last year there was this big workers strike in east berlin and then throughout the whole of the ddr as many as half a million took to the streets to demand free and fair elections even policemen defected to the side of the protesters this was the first big test of the stasi as run by mielke and effectively he broke the strike big time said the other ami at first martial law was declared the stasi opened fire on the protesters many were killed thousands were arrested and are still in prison mielke himself arrested the minister of justice whod questioned the legality of those arrests since then comrade erich has been consolidating his position within the east german hierarchy and he continues to expand the stasis network of secret informers and spies and to build the organisation into the image of the soviet kgb the mvd that was hes a bastard i said what more can i tell you i have nothing else to say about the man that day in johannesgeorgenstadt was the last time i saw him you could help us to get him sure before lockdown tonight ill see what i can do for you seriously ive told you everything and its been very interesting most of it anyway dont think were not grateful gunther because we are might that gratitude stretch as far as letting me go bow tie glanced at the pipe who nodded vaguely and said you know it might it just might provided you agree to work for us oh i yawned sa matter bernie boy dont you want to get out of stir well put you on the payroll we can even get your money back the money you had when the coastguard picked you up in the sea off gitmo thats very generous of you i said but im tired of fighting and frankly i cant see this cold war of yours being any more worthwhile than the last two i took part in id say it could end up being the most crucial war of all said bow tie especially if it gets any warmer i shook my head you guys make me laugh the people you want to work for you do you always treat them like this like what my mistake the other day when i was handcuffed with a hood over my head i formed the distinct impression you didnt like my face that was then you dont see us illtreating you now do you hell gunther youve got the best fucking room in the place cigarettes brandy tell us what else you need and well see if we can get it for you they dont sell what i want in the army px and whats that i shook my head and lit a cigarette nothing it doesnt matter were your friends gunther with american friends who needs enemies i pulled a face look gentlemen ive had american friends before in vienna and there was something about the experience i didnt like even so i knew their names and mostly this is a given with the people who claim to be my friends youre taking this way too personally gunther nothings been broken that cant be fixed we can do this im mister scheuer and this is mister frei like we said before we work for the cia at a place called pullach you know pullach sure i said its the american part of munich where you kennel all of the tame german shepherds who look after the flock for you in this part of the world general gehlen and his pals unfortunately those dogs are not coming to heel the way they used to said scheuer he was the one with the pipe we suspect gehlen made a private deal with chancellor adenauer and that the germans are about to run their own show from now on very ungrateful said frei after all we did for them gehlens new intelligence outfit the gvl is mostly exss gestapo abwehr some very nasty people much worse than you and its probably riddled with russian spies i could have told you that seven years ago in vienna i said in fact i think i did so it looks like were going to have to start again from scratch and that means were going to have to be rather more certain of the kind of people we recruit which is why we were so rough on you from the start we wanted to make quite sure of who and what you are the last thing we want working for us this time is a bunch of diehard nazis imagine how we felt when we discovered that the gvl was helping to train egyptians and syrians for a war with the state of israel with the jews gunther talk about history repeating itself i would think a man like you someone who wasnt ever antisemitic himself might want to do something about that israel is our friend youve got to ask yourself a question bernie do you really want to stay here and let those two jokers from the occwc silverman and earp decide your fate i thought you said they cleared me oh they did since when the french have put in a request for your extradition to paris and you know what the french are like the french havent got anything on me thats not what they think said scheuer thats not what they think at all you have to hand it to the french said frei their capacity for hypocrisy is nothing short of breathtaking france was a fascist country during the war even more so than italy or spain but even now they like to portray themselves as victims to hold others responsible for their crimes and misdemeanours others like you perhaps right now theres a big trial under way in paris your old friend helmut knochen and carl oberg its quite the cause celebre really its in all the newspapers every day i dont see what that has to do with me i said those people knochen and oberg they were big fish i was just a minnow i never even met oberg so what the hells all this about the brits tried knochen in in wuppertal they found him guilty of the murders of some british parachutists and sentenced him to death but the sentence was commuted and now the french want their kilo of flesh theyre looking for scapegoats gunther someone to blame and of course so is knochen which apparently is how your name came up he made a statement to the french surete that it was you who murdered all those prisoners from gurs on the road to lourdes in me there must be some mistake oh sure said frei i think there has been a mistake but thats not going to stop the french theyve made a formal application for your extradition to paris perhaps you would care to read knochens statement he reached into his jacket pocket and fished out several folded sheets of paper which he handed to me then he and scheuer stood up and moved towards the cell door you read that over and then decide whether working for uncle sam is such a bad thing after all helmut knochen interviewed march my name is helmut knochen i was the senior commander of the security police in paris during the nazi occupation of france between and my jurisdiction extended from northern france to belgium until the appointment of carl oberg as supreme leader of the ss and the german police in france i had full responsibility for keeping order and upholding the rule of law as a policeman i tried to ensure that relations between the french and the germans were without friction and that the proper administration of justice was unhindered by the occupation this was not always easy i was not always made privy to senior policy decisions and the most profound tragedy of my life has been the fact that in an indirect way and without being aware of it i was involved in the persecution of the jews of france at no point did i know or even suspect that jews deported to the east were to be exterminated if i had known this i should never have gone along with their deportation let me say that the greatest crime in history was the systematic murder of jews by adolf hitler of course there were many other crimes inflicted upon the french people and i always saw my job as being to help restrain some of my colleagues from acting with excessive zeal not least because i was always fearful of the impact of heavyhanded policing on french public opinion and on those vichy officials whose willing collaboration was needed in all security matters i was always reluctant to provoke an embarrassing confrontation for example in september i thwarted an early attempt to roundup prominent french jews in paris there were other occasions when this happened but that was the largest i think involving as many as five thousand jews this often brought me into conflict with heinz rothke who was chief of the gestapos jewish office in france but my relationship with other fanatical elements in the ss and sd was no less fractious and difficult frequently i had to censure those officers who arriving from berlin believed that the sd uniform permitted them to deal summarily with the french i remember one junior officer from berlin hauptsturmfuhrer bernhard gunther who in the summer of was dispatched to the refugee camps at gurs and le vernet in order to arrest a number of french and german communists and bring them back to paris for questioning but instead this officer ordered the men to be shot at the side of a french country road when i heard about this i was shocked then furious when he subsequently murdered another german officer hauptsturmfuhrer gunther was sent back to berlin helmut knochen interviewed april my name is helmut knochen and i have been asked to make a statement concerning information i gave regarding another german officer captain bernhard gunther in a previous statement i first met captain gunther in paris in july the meeting took place at the hotel du louvre or possibly the hq of the french gestapo at avenue henrymartin other officers present at this meeting included herbert hagen and karl bomelburg gunther had arrived in paris as the special emissary of ss general reinhardt heydrich and he was ordered to track down a number of french and german communists who were wanted by the nazi government back in berlin gunther struck me as typical of the type who found favour with heydrich cynical ruthless and not at all a gentlemen he made clear his own detestation of the french and in spite of my efforts to rein him in he insisted on flying to the south of france and collecting a detachment of motorised ss to drive him to gurs and le vernet to search those two camps for heydrichs wanted men it was my own feeling there was nothing to be lost by delaying matters until the end of summer largely out of sensitivity to the defeated armies of france but gunther was most insistent he was ill i recall i dont remember why but later on there was talk of his involvement with a swiss prostitute but in spite of this he still travelled south to carry out his mission to which heydrich had given top priority in fairness to captain gunther it may have been this illness that prompted his summary action in regard to the prisoners he was accompanied by another german officer hauptsturmfuhrer paul kestner and it was he who informed me of what had happened on the road from gurs to lourdes almost a dozen men were arrested in gurs among these was the head of the french communist party in le havre lucien roux it seems terrible to think it but apparently these men knew what captain gunther had in store for them the ss drove a few kilometres out of gurs and stopped in a forest clearing there gunther ordered everyone out of the trucks the prisoners were lined up offered a last cigarette and then shot gunther delivered the coup de grace to several men who showed signs of life and then they all went on their way leaving the bodies where they fell frankly when captain kestner told me exactly what had happened down there i thought seriously about making a formal complaint against captain gunther but i was advised against it gunther was heydrichs man and this made him all but untouchable you understand even when he murdered another officer at a brothel in paris and it might reasonably have been expected that gunther would be courtmartialled he managed to evade all charges he was merely recalled to berlin from where he was immediately dispatched to the ukraine most likely to carry out the kind of dirty work for which the ss is now notorious its not given to every german officer to behave like a gentleman later on i met heydrich and expressed my own reservations about gunther and his response was typical of the man he said that he rather agreed with schopenhauer that all honour ultimately rests on considerations of expediency heydrich was of course strongly influenced by schopenhauer and i dont just mean his antisemitism anyway i didnt argue with him that was never wise like kant i believe that honour and morality contain their own imperatives and this is of course why i was part of count stauffenbergs plot to kill adolf hitler and why i was arrested by the nazis in july helmut knochen interviewed may my name is helmut knochen and i have been asked to provide a description of ss hauptsturmf u hrer bernhard gunther for the record i met gunther in he was older than me i think perhaps forty years old i recall also that he was a berliner i myself am from magdeburg and i have always had a fascination for the berlin accent well it wasnt so much his accent that marked him out as a berliner as his manner this might be described as rude and uncompromising cynical and unfriendly its no wonder that hitler disliked berlin so much well this man gunther was doubly typical because he was also a policeman a detective i always think that the character of doubting thomas in the bible must have been a berliner this fellow would only have believed christ had risen from the dead if he could have looked through the holes in his hands and feet and seen a judge and a research physicist on the other side he was very germanlooking fairhaired blueeyed about one ninety centimetres tall and powerful in the arms and shoulders even a little heavy his face was pugnacious yes he was very much the kind of man i didnt like at all a real nazi you know the witness knochen was subsequently shown a photograph of a man and positively identified him as the wanted war criminal bernhard gunther chapter twentyseven france from the grimy window in the holding cell at pariss cherchemidi prison i could just see the front of the hotel lutetia and for a long while i stood pressed into the cobwebbed corner watching the hotel closely as if i almost expected to see myself coming out of the door with poor little renata matter on my arm it was hard to know who i felt more sorry for her or me but eventually she edged it she was dead after all when she would have had every reason to expect that she might still be alive but for me i didnt spare myself anything in the way of reproach or blame if only i hadnt fixed her up with a job at the adlon i told myself then she wouldnt have been killed if only i had left her here in paris then there would have been a small but nonetheless real possibility that she could have turned left out of the lutetia crossed the boulevard raspail and come to see me in the cherchemidi it would have been easy enough the cherchemidi was after all no longer a prison but a court and like many others in paris most of them journalists she might have gone there to see the trial of carl oberg and helmut knochen and seen me there too my hosts in the sdece the french counterespionage service had thought it necessary to remind me that i was in their power and that like dreyfus who had also been imprisoned in the cherchemidi they could do what they liked with me now that i had been extradited to their custody not that custody in paris was such an enormous hardship not after everything else not after mainz and the french surete they had been a little rough and it was true that la sante prison where i was currently held wasnt exactly the lutetia but the sdece wasnt so bad probably not as bad as the cia anyway and certainly not as bad as the russians besides the food at la sante was good and the coffee even better the cigarettes were tasty and plentiful and most of the interrogations at the caserne mortier nicknamed the swimming pool were conducted politely often with a bottle of wine and some bread and cheese sometimes the french even gave me a newspaper to take back to la sante none of this was what id been expecting when i left wcpn in landsberg my french improved enough to understand what was in the newspapers and a little of the proceedings on the day i went to court which just happened to be the day when the military tribunal brought in its verdict and handed down the sentences my hosts in french intelligence had a point they wanted to make after all i could hardly blame them for that we sat in the public gallery which was full a civil judge m boessel du bourg and six military judges came into court and took their places in front of a large blackboard so that i half expected them to write out the verdict and sentence with a piece of chalk the civil judge wore robes and an extremely silly hat the military judges were all wearing lots of medals although it was unclear to me what any of these could have been for then the two accused were led into the dock i hadnt seen oberg before except on the german newsreels during the war he wore a smart doublebreasted pinstripe suit and light framed glasses he looked like eisenhowers older brother knochen was thinner and greyer than i remembered prison does that to a man that and a death sentence from the british hanging over your head knochen looked straight at me without showing a sign of recognition i wanted to shout at him that he was a damned liar but of course i didnt when a mans on trial for his life its not good manners to bend his ear about something else at considerable length m boessel du bourg read the verdict and then delivered the sentence which was death of course this was the cue for lots of people in court to begin shouting at the two defendants and a little to my surprise i found i was almost sorry for them once the two most powerful men in paris they now looked like two architects receiving the news that they hadnt won an important contract oberg blinked with disbelief knochen let out a loud sigh of disappointment and amid more abuse and cheers from all around me the two germans were led out of court one of my sdece escorts leaned towards me and said of course they will appeal the sentences still i do get the point i said i am encouraged by voltaires example youve read voltaire not as such no but id like to especially when one considers the alternative which is its hard to read anything when your head is lying in a basket i said all germans like voltaire yes frederick the great was a great friend of voltaire yes i think he was at first germans and french should be friends now yes indeed the schuman plan exactly for this reason i mean for the sake of francogerman relations i think the appeal will be successful thats good news i said although i could hardly have cared less about knochens fate all the same i was surprised at this conversational turn of events and i spent the drive back to the swimming pool feeling encouraged perhaps my prospects were improving after all despite the trial of oberg and knochen and the verdict there was perhaps good reason to imagine that the sdece was keener on cooperation than coercion and this suited me very well from the cherchemidi we drove east to the outskirts of paris the caserne mortier in the barracks of the tourelles was a traditionallooking set of buildings near the boulevard mortier in the twentieth arrondissement made of red brick and semi rusticated sandstone the cm held no obvious affinity with a swimming pool beyond an echo in the corridors and an olympicsized courtyard which when it rained resembled an enormous pool of black water my interrogators were quietspoken but muscular they wore plain clothes and did not give me their names no more did they accuse me of anything to my relief they werent much interested in the events that had happened on the road to lourdes in the summer of there were two of them they had intense birdlike faces five oclock shadows that appeared just after lunch damp shirt collars nicotinestained fingers and espresso breath they were cops or something very like it one of the men the heavier smoker had very white hair and very black eyebrows that looked like two lost caterpillars the other was taller with a whores sulky mouth ears like the handles on a trophy and an insomniacs hooded heavy eyes the insomniac spoke quite good german but mostly we spoke in english and when that failed i took a shot at french and sometimes managed to hit what i was aiming at but it was more of a conversation than an interrogation and save for the holsters on their broad shoulders we could have been three guys in a bar in montmartre did you have much to do with the carlingue the carlingue whats that the french gestapo they worked out of rue lauriston number ninetythree did you ever go there that must have been after my time they were criminals recruited by knochen mostly from the fresnes prison said eyebrows armenians muslims north africans mostly i smiled this or something like it was what the french always said when they didnt want to admit that almost as many frenchmen as germans had been nazis and given their postwar record in vietnam and algeria it was tempting to see them as even more racist than we were in germany after all no one had forced them to deport french jews including dreyfuss own granddaughter to the death camps of auschwitz and treblinka naturally i hardly wanted to hurt anyones feelings by saying so directly but as the subject remained on the table i shrugged and said i knew some french policemen the ones ive already told you about but not any french gestapo now the french ss thats something else again but none of them were muslims as i recall they were nearly all catholics did you know many from the ss charlemagne division a few lets talk about the ones you did know all right mostly they were frenchmen captured by the russians during the battle for berlin in they were men in the pow camps like i was the russians treated them the same way they treated us germans badly we were all fascists in their book but really there was only one frenchman in the camps i got to know well enough to call him a comrade what was his name edgard i said edgard de something or other try to remember one of the frenchmen said patiently boudin i shrugged de boudin i dont know it was a long time ago a lifetime not a good lifetime either some of those poor bastards are only just coming home now it couldnt have been de boudin boudin means sausage or pudding that couldnt have been his name he paused try to think i thought for a moment and then shrugged sorry maybe if you told us something of what you can remember of him the name will come back to you suggested the other frenchman he uncorked a bottle of red wine poured a little into a small round glass and then sniffed it carefully before tasting it and pouring some more for me and the two of them in that room on that dull summers day this small ritual made me feel civilised again as if after months of incarceration and abuse i amounted to something more than just a name chalked on a little board by a cell door i toasted his courtesy drank some wine and said i first met him here in paris in i think it must have been herbert hagen who introduced us something to do with the policy on jews in paris i dont know i never really cared about that sort of thing well we all say that now dont we the germans anyway edgard de something or other was almost as antisemitic as hagen if such a thing was possible but in spite of that i quite liked him he had been a captain in the great war after which hed failed in civvy street and this had led him to join the french foreign legion i think he was stationed in morocco before being sent to indochina and of course he hated the communists so that was all right we had that much in common anyway well that was and when i left paris i didnt expect to see him again and certainly never as soon as november in the ukraine edgard was part of this french unit in the german army not the ss that was later but the legion of french volunteers against bolshevism or some such nonsense thats what the french called it i think we just called it the something infantry the th yes that was it mostly the men were fascists of vichy french or even french pows who didnt fancy being sent to germany as forced labour with the todt organisation there were probably about six thousand of them poor bastards why do you say that i sipped some wine and helped myself to a cigarette from the packet on the table outside the window in the central courtyard someone was trying to start a motor car without success somewhere further away de gaulle was waiting or sulking depending on how you looked at it and the french army was licking its wounds after getting its ass kicked again in vietnam because they couldnt have known what they were letting themselves in for i said fighting partisans sounds fair enough back here in paris but out there in byelorussia it meant something very different i shook my head sadly there was no honour in it no glory not what they were looking for anyway so what did it mean asked eyebrows on the ground i shrugged that kind of action was quite often nothing more than murder mass murder of jews all sorts of police actions and antipartisan activities were merely a euphemism for killing jews to be frank with you the wehrmacht high command in russia wouldnt have trusted the th with any other kind of task but murder the name of the unit commander can you remember that labonne colonel labonne after the winter of i lost touch with edgard i clicked my fingers de boudel that was his name edgard de boudel youre quite sure of that im sure go on well then lets see a couple of years later i was briefly back in that theatre to investigate an alleged war crime that was when i heard that the th was now attached to an ss division in galicia and that it was pretty bad there but i didnt see de boudel again until when the war was over and we were both at a soviet prisonerofwar camp called krasnoarmeesk as a matter of fact there were quite a few french and belgian ss there and edgard told me something of what hed been up to how the th ended up as a part of a french brigade of the ss and that kind of thing apparently there was a recruiting drive here in paris in july the french who joined had to prove the usual himmler rubbish about not having any jewish blood and then they were in a few weeks of basic training in alsace and then at a place near prague by the late summer of the war in france was almost over but there was a whole brigade of french ss ready to fight the ivans about ten thousand of them he said and they were called the sscharlemagne the brigade got sent by train to the eastern front in pomerania which wasnt very far from where i was edgard said that as the train carrying the brigade pulled into the railhead at hammerstein they came under attack by the soviet first byelorussian and were divided up into three groups one group commanded by general krukenberg made it north to the baltic coast near danzig of these quite a few managed to get themselves evacuated to denmark but some like edgard fought on until they were captured the rest were wiped out or fell back to berlin there were other french at krasnoarmeesk whod been captured at berlin i cant say i remember any names by all accounts it was the sscharlemagne who were the last defenders of hitlers bunker in berlin i think they were the only ss happy to be caught by the soviets rather than the americans because the amis handed them over to the free french who shot them immediately tell us about edgard de boudel in the camp yes he was a decorated lieutenant colonel in the ss i mean easy to be with charming even goodlooking unscathed by the war you might even say he was one of those types who looked like he was always going to survive pretty much anything he spoke good russian edgard was the kind for whom languages are easy his german was perfect of course even i couldnt have guessed that he was french if i hadnt already known that about him i think he might have spoken vietnamese too it was his facility with languages that made him especially interesting to the mvd in the beginning they made life pretty difficult for him and of course once they had got their hooks into you it was very difficult for any man to resist them i know that from my own experience with them what specifically did they want him for do you know well it wasnt k thats for sure thats the forerunner of the stasi yes i dont know what they had in mind for him but the next thing i knew hed been sent to the antifa school in krasnogorsk for reeducation as you know i almost ended up there myself theyd have got me too but for the fact that the mvd officer who interrogated me was a man id known from before the war a man named mielke erich mielke he was the german political commissar in charge of recruiting us plenis for k the french asked me some more questions about edgard de boudel and then took me back to la sante it means health but that didnt have much to do with what went on inside the prison it was called la sante because of the prisons proximity to a psychiatric hospital the saintanne on the rue de la sante which was just east of boulevard raspail in la sante i kept myself to myself as much as possible i didnt see helmut knochen which suited me just fine i read my newspaper which reported that things in north africa were as bad for the french as they had been in vietnam in spite of my new friends in the sdece this news was not displeasing to me there were times when i was never very far away from the trenches especially given all the rats there were at la sante real rats they walked along the landings as coolly as if theyd been carrying keys back at the swimming pool the next day the french asked me about erich mielke what do you want to know i asked as if i was unaware of what my audience would best like to hear or to be more accurate what it was best they were told its all ancient history surely you dont want me to go over all that everything you can tell us i cant see how its at all relevant to my being here in paris you should allow us to be the judge of that i shrugged perhaps if i knew why you were interested in him i could be more specific after all its not like this is a story that takes only a couple of minutes to tell christ some of this stuff is twenty years old or even older weve got plenty of time perhaps if you went from the beginning how you first met and when that kind of thing you mean the whole novel with a beginning a middle and an end precisely all right if you really want to know this stuff ill tell you everything of course i hardly wanted to do that hell no not all over again so i gave them an edited more entertaining version of what id already told the amis a french version a smoothtongued pr e cis if you like that was not spoilt by the inclusion of too many facts and which like the french themselves was the result of an exhausted conscience wrestling with simple pragmatism and being very quickly overcome a story that was the best kind of story being better told than believed the decision was made in the ministry of the interior to let mielke make his escape despite the fact that he had participated in the murders of two cops it came about like this department ia had been brought into being to protect the weimar republic against conspirators on the left and on the right and we decided that the best way to do this was to cultivate a few informers on both sides but on the face of it that hardly applied to a man like mielke we had arrested him and fully intended to send him to the guillotine however the abwehr german intelligence persuaded the ministry that they might turn mielke into their agent and this is what happened we were persuaded to let him escape so that he might become our longterm agent the abwehrs moscow mole in return we looked after his family the abwehr kept him going all the way through the thirties and the spanish civil war as well as passing us some very important information on republican troop movements that was extremely helpful to the condor legion he was able to initiate several political purges of some of their best men on the grounds that they were trotskyites or anarchists in that respect mielke was doubly useful when the war broke out the sd and the abwehr decided to share mielke the trouble was wed lost him so heydrich sent me to france in the summer of to get him out of gurs or le vernet which is where we thought he must be which is what happened i got him out of le vernet and across the sea to algeria from there german agents managed to facilitate his return to russia i was his case officer at the sd for the next three years as he worked his way up through the party hierarchy i lost contact with him in at the end of the war however he managed to track me down at the same time that he was recruiting german officers for the stasi and helped me to escape back to west germany where i negotiated a deal with some amis in the counter intelligence corps on behalf of both of us what kind of a deal money of course lots of money after that i helped handle him in berlin and vienna until the cic came to the conclusion that my ss background made me a possible embarrassment to them so they assigned mielke a new controller and got me out of the country on a ratline via genoa to argentina and then cuba id still be in havana but for american incompetence having gone to all that trouble to spirit me out of germany they sent me back there a case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing and now here i am with you is mielke still working for the americans i cant imagine why not someone that highly placed he was the mother lode of all their intelligence on the gdr but they werent sharing even the gvl had no idea that mielke was spying for the amis gehlen knew the amis had a very highly placed agent when the amis refused to reveal who this was gehlen decided to quit and throw in his lot with the west germans so why would they risk letting you go to tell us well for one thing they dont know everything about me and mielke there were certain things ive told you that i never told them but now it hardly seems to matter not any more i havent had any contact with mielke since when i went to argentina since then mielke has become the second or third most powerful man in the gdr so who would believe me how could i prove anything of what ive told you its just my word right besides i have other things on my mind in case youd forgotten im rather more concerned that you believe it wasnt me who shot those prisoners from gurs on the road to lourdes in i dont think its even crossed their minds that you might be interested in mielke as far as theyre concerned youre only interested in settling old scores against people like me if youll forgive me for saying so gentlemen they think your intelligence is snagged on the fence of muslim extremism in algeria and wholly irrelevant in their cold war against russian communism youre a sideshow even the british look more relevant to them than you do none of this was what the french wanted to hear of course but it was what they expected to hear the french were nothing if not pragmatic facts were always of lesser importance than experience it was of course the only way the french could live with themselves later on our conversation returned again to the subject of edgard de boudel and one of the two sdece men asked me the same question that heydrich had posed about mielke in do you think you would recognise him again edgard de boudel i dont know its been seven years maybe why we want to arrest him and put him on trial in the cherchemidi how many trials have there been in that court hundreds isnt it how many war criminals and collaborators have you sentenced to death let me tell you how many it was in the newspaper six thousand five hundred four thousand of those sentences handed down in absentia dont you think thats enough or do you really mean it to feel like the french revolution they said nothing while i lit a cigarette why do you want to put him on trial for being in the ss well im not buying that france is full of exnazis besides i liked him i liked him a lot why should i betray him even if i could since the death of stalin last year your president adenauer has been negotiating the release of the last german pows these last are perhaps the worst of the worst or merely the most important and in soviet eyes the most culpable many of these men are wanted for war crimes in the west including edgard de boudel we have received information that he plans to make his way back to germany as part of one of these repatriations from the soviet union from germany we think he will eventually make his way back to france i dont get it i said if he was working for the kgb why is he coming back as a pow because in his current role hes outlived his usefulness to them the only way he can worm his way back into their favour is by doing what they tell him to do and what they want him to do is pose as someone else a german a german whos probably already dead you said yourself hes a fluent german speaker that even you couldnt fault his german many of these returning pows are treated as heroes a returning hero is a good place to begin rebuilding a career in german society perhaps in german politics and then one day hell be useful again but what can i do you know the man who better than you to recognise if someone or something doesnt look quite right perhaps i shook my head if you say so all of the returning pows arriving back in west germany come through the station in friedland the next train is due in four weeks what do you want me to do stand at the end of the platform with a bunch of flowers in my hand like some pathetic widow who doesnt know her old mans never coming home not exactly no have you heard of the vdh i shrugged something to do with the german government compensating returning german pows yes its the association of returnees and thats one of the things its about yes according to the west german pow compensation law passed in january of this year theres a flat rate payable to all pows of one mark for every day spent in captivity after january first and two marks for every day after january first but the vdh is also a citizens association that advertises the advantages of german democracy to former nazis its denazification of germans by germans your background said the other frenchman makes you ideally suited to be a part of this association not that this would be a problem the lower saxony branch of the vdh is under our control the chairman and several of his members are in the service of the sdece and working for us it goes without saying youll be well paid youre probably even entitled to some of that pow compensation yourself and whats more we can make all this business with helmut knochen go away the insomniac clicked his fingers like that well put you up at a little boarding house in gottingen youll like gottingen its a nice town from there its a short car ride down to friedland he shrugged if things work out we could perhaps make the arrangement more permanent i nodded well its been a long time since i saw de boudel and naturally i would like to get out of la sante gottingens nice as you say and i do need a job it all sounds very generous yes but there is something else id like theres a woman in berlin perhaps the only person in the whole of germany who means anything to me id like to go and see her make sure shes all right give her some money perhaps the insomniac picked up a pencil and prepared to write name and address her name is elisabeth dehler when i was last in berlin about five years ago her address was motzstrasse off the kudamm you never mentioned her before i shrugged what does she do she was a dressmaker still is for all i know and you and she were what we were involved for a while lovers yes lovers i suppose well check out the address for you see if shes still there save you the trouble if shes not thanks he shrugged but if she is we have no objections it will be difficult its always difficult going in and out of berlin still well manage good then we have a deal if i knew the words id sing la marseillaise a signature on a piece of paper will do for now were not much for singing here at the swimming pool theres one question i have everyone calls this place the swimming pool why the two frenchmen smiled one of them stood up and opened a window cant you hear it he said after a moment cant you smell it i got up and went to his side and listened carefully in the distance i could hear what sounded like a school playground you see that turreted building over the wall he explained that is the largest swimming pool in all of paris it was built for the olympics on a day like today half the children in the city are there we go there ourselves sometimes when its quieter sure i said we had the same thing in the gestapo the landwehr canal we never went swimming there ourselves of course but we took lots of others there communists mostly that is provided they couldnt swim chapter twentyeight france and germany from la sante i was transferred to the pension verdin at avenue victor hugo in the suburbs of saintemande which was about a fiveminute drive south from the swimming pool it was a quiet comfortable place with polished parquet floors tall windows and a lovely garden where i sat in the sun awaiting my return to germany the pension was a sort of safe house and hotel for members of the sdece or its agents and there were several faces i halfrecognised from my time at the swimming pool but no one bothered me i was even allowed out although i was followed at a distance and spent a day walking northeast along the seine as far as the lie de la cite and notredame it was the first time id seen paris without the wehrmacht everywhere and hundreds of signs in german bicycles had given way to a great many cars which did little to make me feel any safer than id felt as an enemy soldier in but a lot of this was just nerves cement fever after spending the last six months in one prison or another i couldnt have felt more like a big house brother if id been carrying a ball and chain or looked like one that was why they took me to galeries lafayette on boulevard haussmann to get some new clothes it would be an exaggeration to say that my new clothes made me feel normal again too much water had run off the mountain for that to happen however i did feel partly restored like an old door with a new lick of paint the french had not exaggerated the difficulty of travelling to berlin the inner german border between west and east germany the green border had been closed since may with transport links between the two halves of the country mostly severed the only place where east germans were able to cross freely into the west was in berlin itself and getting in or out of the east was restricted to a few points along a heavily guarded and fortified fence of which the largest and most frequently used was the helmstedtmarienborn crossing at the edge of the lappwald first though we had to go to hannover in the british zone of occupation we left the gare du nord on the overnight train me and my two french handlers from the sdece they had names now names and passports although it seemed unlikely that their names were real especially as i now had a passport myself french in the name of sebastian kleber a travelling salesman from alsace the frenchman with the eyebrows went by the name of philippe mentelin the insomniac was calling himself emile vigee we had a sleeping compartment to ourselves but i was too excited to sleep and when nine and a half hours later the train pulled into hannover railway station i uttered a quiet little prayer of thanks that i was back in prussia the equestrian statue of king ernst august was still in front of the station and city hall with its red roofs and green cupolas looked much the same as i remembered but elsewhere the city was very different adolf hitler strasse was now bahnhofstrasse horst wessel platz was konigsworther platz and the opera house no longer stood in adolf hitler platz but opern platz the aegi dienkirche on the corner of breite strasse was a bombedout ruin overgrown with ivy and left that way as a memorial to those who had died during the war elsewhere the city was hardly recognisable one thing hadnt changed however its said that the purest german is spoken in hannover and thats certainly what it sounded like to me the safehouse was in the east of hannover in a large wooded area called the eilenriede on hindenburg strasse close to the zoo the house was a largish villa in a smallish garden it had a red mansard roof and an octagonal corner tower with a silver steel cupola this tower contained my room and although my door wasnt locked it was hard to rid myself of the impression that i was still a prisoner especially when i mentioned to emile vigee that id seen two suspiciouslooking men from my rapunzellike vantage point look there i said inviting him into my room and over to the window on erwinstrasse is it he nodded those two men in the black citroen i said theyve been there for at least an hour from time to time one of them gets out smokes a cigarette and watches this house and im pretty sure hes armed too how can you tell from here its a warm day but all three buttons on his suit are done up and every so often he adjusts something on his breast you have keen eyes monsieur kleber every time vigee spoke to me now he called me kleber or sebastian to help me become accustomed to hearing this name i used to be a cop remember nothing to worry about theyre both with us as a matter of fact theyre going to drive you to berlin and back here before going on to gottingen and friedland theyre both german and theyve made the drive many times before so there shouldnt be a problem they work for the vdh here in hannover he glanced at his watch i invited them both for dinner tonight to give you a chance to meet them theyre a little early thats all we went to dinner at the nearby stadt halle formerly the hermann goring stadt halle a very large round building that was a bit like fat hermann himself with its green roof the place was half concert hall and half circus tent but according to vigee there was also a good restaurant not as good as paris of course he said but not bad for hannover with quite a reasonable wine list he shrugged i expect thats why goring liked it eh as we arrived for dinner everyone else was leaving to go to the friday night concert and i decided the french had probably timed it that way so that we could talk without fear of being overheard the music helped of course it was mendelssohns third symphony the scottish the two frenchmen were disappointed with the food but to me after months of prison fare it was delicious my two fellow germans had also brought hearty appetites although little in the way of conversation they wore grey suits to match their grey skin neither was very tall one of them had bright blond hair that must have come out of a bottle the other might have come out of a bottle himself he drank so much although it appeared not to affect him at all the blonder man was called werner grottsch the other called himself klaus wenger neither seemed inclined to try to find out anything about me perhaps they were already well informed on that subject by vigee but i thought it more likely that they knew better than to ask and if so it was a compliment i repaid by making no enquiries of them eventually vigee brought the conversation round to the true purpose of our acquaintance sebastians not crossed the border before he said at least not since the implementation of the ddrs special regime werner perhaps youd like to put him in the picture about what will happen tomorrow youll be in a car with french diplomatic number plates even so its always useful to know how to behave what to expect grottsch nodded politely extinguished his cigarette leaned forward and clasped his hands as if he was going to lead us in prayer its called the special regime because the measures are intended to keep out spies diversionists terrorists and smugglers in other words people like us he smiled at his own little joke well be crossing at checkpoint alpha at helm stedt its the largest and busiest crossing point because it offers the shortest land route between west germany and west berlin its one hundred and eightyfive kilometres through east germany to berlin the road runs through a fenced corridor thats heavily guarded a bit like no mans land if you remember that and almost as dangerous so if we have a breakdown on no account get out of the car we wait for assistance no matter how long that takes if you get out you risk being shot and people do get shot the border police the grepos are particularly triggerhappy do i make myself clear abundantly clear herr grottsch thank you good grottsch cocked an ear at the air and nodded his appreciation what a pleasure to listen to mendelssohn again and not to be worried that one was being unpatriotic he was german wasnt he i said from hamburg no no said grottsch mendelssohn was a jew wenger nodded and lit a cigarette thats right he said he was a jew from leipzig of course grottsch went on going in is one thing getting out is quite another inspection pits mirrors theres even a mortuary where they can look inside coffins to check if an occupant who wanted to be buried in west germany is really dead even mendelssohn couldnt leave these days without the proper paperwork and hes been dead for a hundred years your lady friend said wenger fraulein dehler youll be pleased to know shes still at the same address but shes no longer a dressmaker she now runs a nightclub called the queen on augusteviktoria strasse a straight kind of place as straight as they go helmstedt was an attractive little medieval town of brightly coloured towers and unusual churches the town hall looked like an enormous organ from a cathedral that typically no longer existed the redbrick university building resembled a military barracks i might have seen more of it but my two companions were keen to get through checkpoint alpha so that we might reach berlin before dark and i could hardly fault them for that from marienborn berlin was a three hour drive through an inhospitable landscape of barbed wire and on the other side of the fence men with dogs and mines but nothing compared with the inhospitable faces of the grepos at checkpoint alpha in their jackboots cross belts and long leather coats the border police reminded me strongly of the ss and the long wooden huts they emerged from were like something from a concentration camp the swastikas were gone replaced by the red stars and the hammer and sickle but everything else felt the same except for one thing nazism had never looked quite so permanent as this or so thorough grottsch and wenger shared the driving which was straightforward enough if you drive east on the a for long enough you arrive in berlin but they remained wary of asking questions as if the french had warned them against the answers so when we spoke at all it was concerning nothing of any real consequence the weather the scenery the citroen versus the mercedes life in the ddr and as we got nearer our destination the four powers and their continuing occupation of the former german capital which we all agreed none of us liked it went without question that we thought the russians the worst of all but we spent at least an hour arguing which of the other three was going to take the silver medal it seemed my two colleagues were of the opinion that the british had the same faults as the americans arrogance and ignorance without any of the virtues money that made their arrogance and ignorance easier to ignore the french we decided were simply the french not to be taken seriously and therefore beneath any real contempt personally i had my doubts about the british and if i had any lingering doubts about my silverplated dislike of the americans they were soon to be dispelled just southwest of berlin at the dreilinden border crossing into the city in zehlendorf we were obliged to stop to present our papers again and entering the american zone we parked our car and went into a shop to buy some cigarettes i was used to seeing and smoking mostly american brands it was all the other american brands in the shop that brought me up short chex breakfast cereal rexall toothpaste sanka caffeinefree coffee ballantine beer old sunnybrook kentucky whiskey dash dog food jujyfruits appian way pizzamix pream nescafe and up i might have been back in berlin but not so as you would have noticed we drove into the french sector to a safehouse on bernauer strasse that overlooked the russian sector which is to say the french controlled the north pavement and the russians controlled the south it hardly mattered even if it didnt look like the berlin i remembered on the soviet side of the street the bombedout buildings remained in total disrepair it still felt and smelt much the same cynical mongrel perhaps more mongrel than ever in my head and heart an orchestra the size of a division was playing berliner luft and i was clapping and whistling in all the right places for a true citizen in berlin it was never about being german hitler and goebbels never understood that it was being a berliner first and telling anyone who wanted to change that to go to hell one day we would surely be rid of the rest of them too the ivans the tommies the franzis and yes even the amis friends are always harder to get rid of than enemies especially when they believe theyre good friends the following day the two germans drove me to motzstrasse in the american sector we drew up outside number twentyeight the building was in a much better state of repair than the last time id been there for one thing it had been painted canary yellow there were several window boxes filled with geraniums and in front of the heavy oak door someone had planted a thriving lime tree the whole area looked like it was doing well across the street was an expensive porcelain shop and below elisabeths firstfloor apartment was an equally pricey restaurant called kottlers where my two escorts elected to wait for me the street door was open i went upstairs and rang the bell and listened inside elisabeths apartment i could hear music and then it stopped a moment later the door opened and she was standing in front of me seven years older and at least five kilos heavier before shed been a brunette now she was a blonde the weight suited her more than the hair colour which didnt really match her widening brown eyes but i hardly minded that as it was six months since id even spoken to a woman let alone one in her dressing gown just seeing elisabeth like that reminded me of a more innocent time before the war when sex still seemed like a practical proposition her jaw dropped and she blinked deliberately as if she really didnt believe her own eyes oh my god its you she said i was afraid you were dead i was eternal life has its advantages but its amazing how quickly you get bored so here i am again back in the city of mahogany and marijuana come in come in she vacuumed me inside closed the door and hugged me fondly i dont have any marijuana she said but i have good coffee or something stronger coffee will be fine i followed her along a corridor and into the kitchen i like what youve done with the place youve put furniture in it the last time i was here i think youd sold everything to the amis not everything elisabeth smiled i never sold that lots did mind but not me she set about making the coffee and then said how long has it been since i was last here six or seven years it seems longer where have you been what were you doing none of that matters now the past right now the only thing that matters is right now everything else is irrelevant or at least thats how it seems to me you really were dead werent you mmm hmm she made coffee and led the way into a small but comfortable sitting room the furniture was solid but unremarkable outside the coppercoloured leaves of the linden tree helped to shade the window from the bright autumn sun i felt quite at home as much at home as i was likely to feel anywhere no sewing machine i observed theres not much call for expensive tailoring any more she said not in berlin anyway not since the war who can afford such things these days i run a club called the queen on augusteviktoria strasse number seventysix drop by some time not today of course were closed on sundays which is why im here is it a sunday i dont know dead and just coming back to life thats hardly respectable but the club is probably too respectable for a man like you but thats what the customers want nowadays no one wants the old berlin any more with the sex clubs and the whores no one all right the americans dont seem to want them at least not officially you surprise me in cuba they couldnt get enough of the sex clubs every night there was a long line outside the most notorious club of all the shanghai i dont know about cuba but here we get some very lutheran americans well this is germany after all its as if they think the russians might use any sign of depravity as an excuse to invade west berlin they seem to want to make the cold war as cold as possible for everyone involved did you know that you can get yourself arrested for nude sunbathing in the parks at my age thats hardly a concern i sipped her coffee and nodded my appreciation elisabeth lit a cigarette so it was you the person who sent me that money from cuba i thought it must be at the time i had more than enough to spare and now im sorting things out you dont look like someone whos just back from the sun like i said at my age i was never one for lying around in the sun me i love it whenever i can after all the winters we get what sort of things are you sorting out the berlin kind hmm that sounds suspicious this used to be a city of whores and you dont look like a whore now its a city of spies so she shrugged and sipped her coffee i expect thats why they dont like joyladies and sex clubs because they want their spies honest and as for nude sunbathing well its difficult being something youre not when youve got your clothes off ill bear that in mind as a matter of fact we get lots of spies in the club american spies how can you tell theyre the ones not wearing uniforms she was joking of course but that didnt mean it wasnt true i glanced over at a radiogram the size of a drinks cabinet from which a low murmur was emanating what are we almost listening to rias she said i dont know that station i dont know any of the berlin stations it stands for radio in the american sector she said it in english good english too i always listen to rias on a sunday morning to help my english no to improve my english i pulled a face on the coffee table was a copy of die neue zeitung american radio american newspapers sometimes i think we lost a lot more than just a war theyre not so bad whos paying your rent the vdh of course you were a prisoner yourself werent you i nodded a couple of years ago i went to one of those exhibitions put on by the vdh she said on the pow experience they had reconstructed a soviet pow camp complete with a wooden watch tower and a fourmetrehigh barbedwire fence was there a gift shop no just a newspaper der heimkehrer yes its a rag among other things the vdh leadership believes that a free people cannot renounce in principle the protection of a new german army but you dont believe that i shook my head its not that i dont think military service is a good idea in principle i lit a cigarette its just that i dont trust our western allies not to use us as cannon fodder in a new war that some lunatic confederate american general thinks he can fight on german soil safely which is to say a long way from america but which in reality no one can win not us not them better red than dead huh i dont think the reds want a war any more than we do its only the men who fought the last war not to mention the one before that who can really know how many human lives were wasted and how many comrades were sacrificed needlessly people used to talk about the phony war remember that in but if you ask me this war this cold war thats the phoniest war of the lot something dreamed up by the intelligence people to scare us and keep us all in line theres a waiter at the club she said whod disagree with you hes a former pow too he came home last year still a rabid nazi hates the bolsheviks she smiled wryly im none too fond of them myself of course well you remember what it was like when the red army turned up in berlin with a hardon for german women she paused for a moment i had a baby did i ever tell you that no well he the baby died so it didnt seem important i guess he got influenza meningitis and the penicillin they used to treat it turned out to be fake that was god february they got the men who sold the stuff im happy to say not that it really matters made in france it was glucose and face powder dissolved in genuine penicillin vials of course by the time anyone knew it was fake it was too late she shook her head its hard to remember what it was like back then people would do or sell anything to make money im sorry dont be darling it was a long time ago besides even after i had it the baby i was never really sure i wanted it under the circumstances thats hardly surprising i said you never said before well you had your own problems didnt you she shrugged and that is the real reason i never sold my body to the amis of course gang rape it tends to take away your sexual appetite for quite a while by the time i did start feeling inclined that way again it was too late i was on the shelf more or less nonsense too late to find a husband anyway german men are still in rather short supply in case you hadnt noticed most of the good ones were in soviet pow camps or cuba im sure thats not true youre a finelooking woman elisabeth she took my hand and squeezed do you really think so bernie of course i do oh there have been men all right im not completely clapped out its true but its not like it used to be nothing ever is of course but there was an american who worked for the us state department at hicog in the headquarters compound on saargemiinder strasse but he went home to his wife and children in wichita and there was a guy a sergeant who ran club thats the us armys nco club it was him who helped me to get the job at the queen before he went home too that was six months ago my life she shrugged its not exactly effi briest is it oh i do okay at the club pays well the customers behave good tippers ill say that for the amis they like to show their appreciation not like the british worst tippers in the world hell even the french tip better than the british you wouldnt think theyd won the war theyre so tight with their money they say that even the mousetraps are empty in the british sector i tell you this fellow nasser im on his side and when uruguay beat england i think i was even more happy than i was when west germany won the actual trophy talking of west germany elisabeth do you go there ever no id have to cross the green border and i dont like to do that i did it once i felt like a criminal in my own country and east berlin do you ever go there sometimes but theres less and less cause to go theres not much there for those of us who live in west berlin just before jimmy my american sergeant went back to america we took a trip around old berlin he wanted to buy a camera and you can still get a good one for not much money in east berlin we got a camera too but not in a shop on the black market the only shop we visited a department store the communists call ho had very little in it and as soon as i saw it i realised why so many east germans turned up here last year to get a food parcel and why quite a few of them never went back but you wouldnt say it was dangerous for someone like me no you read about the odd person getting snatched by the soviets injected with something and then bundled into a car well i suppose if you were important that might happen but then you wouldnt go there in the first place if you were someone like that would you all the same i wouldnt have thought you would want to go across to the russian sector you having escaped from a pow camp nall look elisabeth theres nobody left in berlin i can really trust if it comes to that theres no one left i even know and i need a favour if there was anyone else i could ask i would go ahead and ask i handed her an envelope i was hoping i could ask you to deliver this im afraid i dont know the correct address and i thought well i thought you might help for old times sake she looked at the name on the envelope and was silent for a moment you dont have to i said but it would help me a lot of course ill do it without you without that money you sent i dont know how id ever have hung on to this place really i dont i finished my coffee and then my cigarette i must have looked as if i was about to leave because she said will i see you again yes only im not sure when im not living in berlin at the moment for the foreseeable future ill be staying in gottingen she looked puzzled at that so i explained with the vdh gottingen is near the friedland transit camp for returning pows theyre there for only a couple of days during which time they receive food clothing and medical aid theyre also given army discharge certificates which they need to obtain a residency permit a food ration card and a travel warrant to get home poor devils she said how bad was it really im not about to sit here and tell any woman from berlin about suffering i said but maybe because of it well know how and where to find each other id like that do you have a telephone not here if i want to make a call i always use the telephone at the club if you ever need to get in contact with me thats the best place to do it if im not there theyll take a message she found a pencil and paper and scribbled down the number i put the number in my empty wallet or you could write to me here of course you should have written before to let me know you were coming id have prepared something a cake i wouldnt have been in my dressing gown and you should have sent me an address in cuba so that i could have written back to thank you that might have been a little difficult i confessed i was living there under a false name oh she said as if such an idea had never occurred to her youre not in any trouble are you bernie trouble i smiled ruefully life is trouble only the naive and the young imagine that its anything else its only trouble that finds out if were up to the task of staying alive because if you are in trouble i hate to ask you another favour she took my hand and kissed the fingers one by one when are you going to get it through your thick prussian head she said ill help you in any way i can all right i thought for a moment and then taking her pencil and paper i started to write when you get to the club i want you to make a call to this number in munich ask for a mister kramden if mister kramden isnt there tell whoever it is that you will call back in two hours dont leave your name and number just tell them that you want to leave a message from carlos when you get to speak to kramden tell him ill be staying with my uncle francois in gottingen for the next few weeks at the pension esebeck until ive met monsieur voltaire off the train from the cherry orchard tell mister kramden that if he and his friends need to contact me ill be going to the st jacobi church each day im in gottingen at around six or seven oclock in the evening and to look for a message under the front pew she looked over my notes i can do that she nodded firmly gottingens quaint pretty what germany used to look like ive often thought it would be nice to live there i shook my head you and me elisabeth were berliners hardly cut out for fairytale living i suppose youre right what will you do after gottingen i dont know elisabeth it seems to me she said that if theres no one else in berlin you know or who you can trust then you should think yourself free to come and live here like you did before remember why else do you think i sent you that money from cuba i hadnt forgotten lately ive had to do quite a bit of remembering one way or another telling my story to well it doesnt matter who a lot of stuff id rather forget but i dont forget that you can depend on it i never forgot about you of course not everything had been told back at landsberg a man should keep some secrets after all especially when hes talking to the cia special agents scheuer and frei might have opened a file in elisabeth dehlers name if id told them every little detail about what happened on the train from the pleni camp in johannesgeorgenstadt to dresden and then berlin in i hadnt wanted them bothering her so i hadnt mentioned the fact that the address on the envelope containing the several hundred dollars mielke had given me was elisabeths chapter twentynine germany instead of pocketing this money id resolved to deliver it to her myself as the mvd assassin would have done if i hadnt killed him first besides i needed somewhere to stay and where better a place to stay than with a former lover so when i got off the train from dresden in the no less depressing ruin of anhalter station in berlin id quickly boarded a westbound tram and headed straight for the kurfurstendamm from there i walked south convinced that at least one of hitlers predictions had come true in the early days of his success he had told us that in five years you will not recognise germany and that was a fact kurfurstendamm formerly one of berlins most prosperous streets was now little more than a series of ruins even for a former policeman it was hard to find my way around once forgetting the uniform i was wearing i asked a woman for directions and she hurried away without reply as if id been the carrier of plague later on when i heard about what the red army had done to the women of berlin i wondered why shed not picked up a rock and thrown it at me motzstrasse was not as badly damaged as some even so it was hard to imagine anyone safely living there one decent earth mover could probably have levelled the entire street it was like walking through a scene from the apocalypse piles of rubble buttressed facades moonsized craters the prevailing smell of sewage the road underfoot as uncertain as a mountain path burnedout armoured vehicles the occasional grave the window on the landing in front of elisabeths apartment was gone and boarded over but the weatherbeaten door looked secure enough i knocked at it for several minutes until a voice shouted down the stairs and told me that elisabeth was out until five i glanced at the dead majors watch and realised i needed to kill some time without drawing too much attention to myself it wasnt that an mvd officer was unusual in the american sector but i thought it best to avoid contact with anyone official who might have asked what i was doing i walked until i found a church i almost recognised on kieler strasse although given the state of kieler strasse it might just as easily have been duppelstrasse the church was catholic and strangely tall and angular like a castle on a mountaintop inside there was a fine mosaic basilica that had escaped the bombs i sat down and closed my eyes not from reverence but sheer fatigue but this was hardly the quiet sanctuary i had expected every few minutes an american serviceman would come in with loud polished shoes genuflect to the altar and then wait patiently on a pew near the confessional business was brisk after the day id had i might have confessed myself but i wasnt feeling particularly sorry about that id been wanting to kill a russian any russian ever since the battle of konigsberg i told him that myself i didnt need a priest to come between us in what was by now an old argument i stayed there for a long time long enough to make peace with myself if not god and when i left the rosary church for that was its name i put a few of the mvd majors coins into a collection box for his sins if not mine then i walked north again and this time elisabeth was at home although she regarded my uniform with horror what the hell are you doing here dressed like that she demanded ask me in and ill explain believe me its not at all what it looks like it better not be or you can be on your way again i dont care who you are i entered her apartment and it was immediately clear from the bed and the gas ring that she was living in just the one room seeing my eyebrows flex their surprise she said its easier to heat like this i dropped major weltzs bag onto the floor and took the envelope of money from inside my gimnasterka tunic and handed it over now it was elisabeths turn to exercise her eyebrows she fanned herself with several hundred american dollars and then read mielkes note which made everything clear did you read this of course so wheres the russian who was supposed to give me this dead this is his uniform im wearing i thought it best to keep things as simple as possible why didnt you keep this for yourself oh i would have done i said if it had been anyone elses name on that envelope after all its not like were strangers no she said all the same its been a long time i thought you must be dead why not everyone else is i told her as briefly as possible that id been in a soviet pow camp and that id escaped i was supposed to be on my way to berlin and then to the anti fascist school near moscow all arranged by our mutual friend of course but i think he figured i knew too much about his past and decided the safer thing was to have me eliminated so here i am i thought that the woman named on that envelope might be prepared to overlook the fact that i left her for another woman and let me lie low for a couple of days especially when she saw those dollars she nodded thoughtfully how is kirsten i dont know i havent seen or heard from frau gunther since christmas earlier on today i took a walk down my old street and found it isnt there any more i guess if it had been then you wouldnt be here now and i wouldnt have this anythings possible well thats honest anyway she thought for a moment people who were bombed out usually leave a little red card on the ruins with some sort of address in case a loved one turns up well maybe thats it loved one kirsten never was what youd call loving unless you mean herself of course she always loved herself i shook my head there wasnt any little red card i looked there are other ways of contacting relatives said elisabeth not looking like this there arent its only a matter of time before im picked up and shot or sent back to the pow camp which would be worse its true maybe its the uniform but you dont look so good ive seen healthier skeletons she shrugged very well you can stay here the first time you try any funny stuff youre on your toes meanwhile ill see what i can find out about kirsten thanks look i have a little money of my own perhaps you could find or even buy me some clothes too she nodded ill go to the reichstag first thing in the morning the reichstag i was thinking of something a little less formal perhaps thats where the black market is she said the biggest in the city believe me theres nothing you cant get there from a pair of nylons to a fake denazification certificate perhaps i can you one of those too of course itll mean im late for work tailoring she shook her head grimly im a servant bernie she said like nearly everyone left alive in berlin im the housekeeper for a family of american diplomats in zehlendorf hey perhaps i can find you a job too they need a gardener i can go into the labour office at mcnair on my way back from work tomorrow mcnair mcnair barracks just about everything to do with the us army in berlin takes place at mcnair thanks i said but if you dont mind id rather not have a proper job at this moment ive spent the last eighteen months working harder than a donkey with three masters if i never see another pick and shovel again it will be too soon rough huh only by the standards of a russian serf now that ive lived and almost died in the soviet union its easy to see where they learn their manners and where they find their sunny outlook on life theres not an ivan i met who could ever be mistaken for an optimist i shrugged still our mutual friend seems to be well in with them i nodded at the envelope she was still holding erich you have no idea how much i need this money presumably he did though i wonder why he didnt give it to you himself he has his reasons i suppose erich doesnt forget his friends i couldnt argue with that elisabeth did he really try to have you killed only a bit she shook her head he was a hothead when he was younger its true but he never struck me as a coldblooded killer those two cops i never believed he did that you know and i cant believe he ordered someone to murder you the two germans i was travelling with arent here to tell you youre wrong elisabeth they werent as lucky as me you mean theyre dead right now thats my working definition of unlucky i shrugged i dont know probably it always was chapter thirty germany on monday morning we drove out of east germany and back to hannover where i spent another night in the safehouse and early the next day we drove south to gottingen and checked into an old pension overlooking the canal on reitstallstrasse the pension was damp with hard wooden floors even harder furniture high ceilings and dusty brass chandeliers and about as homely as cologne cathedral but from there it was only a short walk to the vdh office in a half timbered building on judenstrasse that looked like it was home to a family of three bears everywhere in gottingen was a bit like that and quite a few of the people too the director of the local vdh herr doctor winkel was a mild bespectacled type who might once have been the court librarian to some ancient king of saxony and he told me what we already knew that a train carrying a thousand german plenis was due in friedland the following week for forms sake we decided myself grottsch and wenger to pay a visit to the refugee camp at friedland previously a research farm owned by gottingen university the friedland camp was in the british zone and composed of a series of what were called nissen huts if nissen was a synonym of grim and inhospitable then these halfcylindrical corrugatediron structures were well named the camp was a miserablelooking place especially in the rain an impression that was underscored by the muddy roads and the gooseshit green that everything was painted and it was all too easy to give credence to the rumour that the friedland refugee camp had been the location for anthrax experiments conducted by nazi scientists during the war as a reintroduction to homeland freedom and all things wholesomely german the camp left a lot to be desired and in my expert opinion was almost as bad as any of the labour camps that these german pows had left behind i might have succeeded in feeling sorry for these men had it not been for the fact that i was rather more concerned for my own welfare as the prospect of mixing with a large number of plenis was not without its hazards even after an interval of six or seven years it was possible i might be recognised and denounced as some sort ofcomradekiller a renegade or a collaborator after all as far as anyone back at the camp in johannesgeorgenstadt was concerned i had sold out to the reds and gone to russia for antifascist training at krasnogorsk and i was reminded of the precariousness of my position when i asked one of the friedland camp police why they were needed at all surely i said germans who have come back home know how to behave themselves thats just the point said the policeman theyre not back home are they at least not at home some of them get a bit pissed off when they find out theyre going to be here sometimes for as long as six to eight weeks but it can take that long to get them sorted out with everything theyre going to need for life in the new republic then there are the prisoners intent on settling old scores with each other men who have denounced other men to the ivans informers that kind of thing deprivation of liberty we call that kind of behaviour if it led to someone getting more ill treatment from the ivans and we charge them under section of the german criminal code right now there are over two hundred pending cases involving expows of course thats just the ones we find out about and just as often someone in the camp turns up dead his throat cut and no one saw or heard a thing thats not at all uncommon sir in this camp we reckon on as many as one murder a week of course i hardly wanted to inform the french intelligence service of my own fears i had no appetite for an early return to la sante or indeed any other of the five prisons id been in since leaving havana and i was resigned to hoping that come what may the franzis would protect me just as long as they thought i was their best chance of identifying and arresting edgard de boudel the fact that i had never seen or even heard of someone called edgard de boudel was neither here nor there i was doing what i had been told to do by the americans in landsberg and when i returned to my room at the pension esebeck in gottingen i wrote a note to my cia handlers describing the full extent of my progress how the french had listened to me paint a picture of de boudel at the same time i had also been painting another picture of erich mielke and that they appeared to accept everything i had told them about mielke all of which was false because of everything i had told them about edgard de boudel which was true this operation was what scheuer called the beautiful twin the french and more important the soviet agent who the americans knew to be at the heart of the sdece in paris would it was supposed be more inclined to believe my lies and misrepresentations about mielke if everything they were told about de boudel coincided with what they knew about him or strongly suspected and the icing on this rich cake was a tipoff supplied to them by the british who of course had received it from the americans that edgard de boudel was arriving back to germany as a returning pow having served out his usefulness to the russians in indochina where as a political commissar he had assisted the vietminh in the interrogation and torture of many captured french soldiers most of whom still remained until the geneva negotiations were complete prisoners of war in indochina all i had to do was identify de boudel and the french would it was supposed treat me and my information about mielke as goldplated and to this end before my deportation from landsberg to paris i had carefully studied the only known photographs of de boudel it was hoped that these two pictures along with my own familiarity with the life of a german pow not to mention my background as a kripo detective would help me spot him for the french who for ever thereafter would be in thrall to me as an intelligence source because edgard de boudel was one of the most wanted men in france naturally i was a little concerned about what might happen to me if i failed to identify de boudel so i wrote about that too mentioning my continuing concern that he might have changed more than just his name and identity if as the americans believed the russians were intent on infiltrating him back into west german society in the hope of reactivating him as their agent at some later date i had little or no chance of success if de boudel had undergone plastic surgery i also mentioned what by then would have been obvious that i was being watched closely when i finished writing i went into the sitting room to speak to vigee who was the french officer in charge of the sdeces gottingen operation if you please i said id like to go to church you didnt say you were religious he said did i need to i shrugged look its not mass or even confession i just want to go and sit in church for a while and pray what are you catholic protestant what lutheran protestant i said oh yes and id like to buy some chewing gum to stop me from smoking so much here he said and handed me a packet of hollywood i have the same problem i put one of the green chlorophyll sticks in my mouth is there a lutheran church near here he asked this is gottingen i said there are churches everywhere st jacobi was a strangelooking church eccentric even the body of the building was ordinary enough made of a handsome pinkish stone with darker pink perpendiculars but the steeple the tallest in gottingen was anything but ordinary it was as if the lid of a pink toy box had burst open to permit the egress of a green object on top of a giant grey spring as if some lazy jack had tossed a handful of magic beans onto the floor of the church and these had grown so quickly that the stalk had forced its way through the simple church roof as a metaphor of nazism it was perhaps unsurpassed in the whole of germany the candystriped interior was no less like a fairy tale as soon as you saw the pillars you wanted to lick them or to break off a piece of the medieval altar triptych and eat it like sugarloaf i sat down in the front pew and bowed my head to the amnesiac gods of germany and pretended to pray because id prayed before and knew exactly what to expect of it after a while i glanced around and observing that vigee was occupied in the admiration of the church i fixed the note for my cia handlers underneath the pew with my hollywood gum then i stood up and walked slowly to the door i waited patiently for vigee to follow and then we went outside into the rumpelstiltskin streets chapter thirtyone germany things were quiet at the pension esebeck and there was little to do except eat and read the newspapers but die welt was the only paper i was keen to read i was especially interested in the small ads at the back and on my second morning in gottingen i found the message for field grey i had been waiting for it was some verses from the gospel according to st luke and taking the bible from the shelf in the sitting room i went to my own room to reconstruct the message it read as follows for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name and all went to be taxed every one into his own city and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first that he went through the cornfields and his disciples plucked the ears of corn and did eat rubbing them in their hands and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elisabeth for with god nothing shall be impossible that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear having burned the note id made of the message i went to look for vigee and found the frenchman in a little walled garden overlooking the canal as usual he looked as if he hadnt slept his eyes were half closed against the smoke from his cigarette and there was a little cup of coffee in the palm of his hand like a coin he regarded me with his usual indifferent expression but as before when he spoke it was frequently with the added emphasis of a firm nod or a quick shake of the head you made your peace with god yes his german was halting but grammatical i needed some time to reflect i said on something that happened in berlin on sunday with elisabeth yes she wants to get married i said to me he shrugged congratulations sebastian soon how soon shes waited five years for me emile and now that ive seen her again well she doesnt propose to wait any longer in short she gave me an ultimatum that she would forget all about me unless i married her before the weekend impossible said vigee thats what i said emile however she means it im certain of it i never knew this woman to say anything she didnt mean i took one of his offered cigarettes thats hardly civilised he said thats women i said and its me too up until now everything in the world i ever wanted was never quite as good as i thought it would be but ive a strong feeling that elisabeths different in fact i know she is vigee picked a piece of tobacco off his tongue and for a moment regarded it critically as if it might have been the answer to all our problems i was thinking emile the pow train wont be here until next tuesday night if i could spend sunday with elisabeth in berlinjust a few hours vigee put down his coffee cup and started to shake his head no please listen i said if i could spend a few hours with her im sure i could persuade her to wait especially if i arrived with a few presents a ring perhaps nothing expensive just a token of my feelings for her he was still shaking his head oh come on emile you know what women are like look theres a shop full of cutprice jewellery on the corner of speckstrasse if you could advance me a few marks enough to buy a ring then im sure i could persuade her to wait for me if this wasnt my last chance i wouldnt ask we could be back here by monday evening a full twentyfour hours before the train is even due in friedland and what if you chose not to come back he said its very difficult bringing people out of berlin across the green border whats to stop you from just staying there she doesnt even live in the french sector at least say youll think about it i said i mean it would be a real shame if i allowed my own disappointment to cloud my eyes next tuesday evening meaning i want to help you find edgard de boudel emile really i do but there has to be a little give and take especially in a situation like this if im to work for you then surely its best that im completely in your debt monsieur that theres nothing unpleasant between us he smiled a nasty little smile and threw his cigarette over the wall and into the canal then he quickly gathered the lapels of my jacket in his fist and smacked me hard across both cheeks maybe youve forgotten la sante he said your boche friends oberg and knochen and their death sentences he slapped me again for good measure i took it as calmly as i was able and said that might work on your wife and your sister franzi but not on me see i caught the hand he was waving near my ear and twisted it hard no one gets to slap me unless ive got my hand in her panties now take your paws off this cheap french suit before i teach you the method on tough i looked him in the eye and saw that he seemed to relax a little so i let go his hand in order to prise his fingers off my coat and that was when he punched me with a right hook that rocked my head like balloon on a stick probably hed have punched me again but for my own presence of mind which is another way of saying that i banged its hard bony covering firmly against the bridge of his long hooked nose the frenchman yelped with pain and let go of my coat he pressed his fingers to the side of his nose and took several steps back until he reached the garden wall look i said stop trying to polish my chin and take it easy emile im not asking for the return of alsacelorraine just one lousy sunday afternoon with the woman i love some compassionate leave thats all and none of that gets in the way of me helping you find your traitor i help you you help me unless you want me to enrol for a course at the university its not like i have anything much to do before next tuesday evening i think you broke my nose he said no i didnt theres not nearly enough blood take it from someone whos broken a few noses in his time although nothing on the scale of that eiffel tower on your face i shook my head hey im sorry i hit you emile but for the last nine months a lot of people have been getting tough with me and ive had enough of it see i have to look at my face every morning frenchman its not much of a face but its the only one ive got and its got to last me for a while yet so i dont like it when people think they can knock it around im sensitive like that he wiped his nose and nodded but the incident hung strong in the air between us like the smell of burnt hops from a brewery and for a moment we both stood there stupidly wondering how to proceed it could have been worse i told myself there had been a brief moment when i had actually contemplated tipping him over the wall and into the canal he lit a cigarette and smoked it as if he thought it might improve his humour and take his mind off his nose which now that he had wiped away the blood was already looking better than he might have supposed youre right he said theres no reason at all why this thing cant be fixed after all it is as you say just one sunday afternoon yes i nodded just one sunday afternoon very well we will fix it yes i tell you i would do anything to get de boudel including lie to me i thought after i had served my purpose and identified de boudel there was no telling what the french might do with me send me back to la sante to the amis even the russians france was after all cosying up to the soviet union in its foreign policy and the return of an escaped prisoner was not beyond its perfidy and a ring i asked as if such a bauble really mattered to me or to elisabeth yes he said im sure that can be arranged also chapter thirtytwo germany on saturday grottsch and wenger drove me back to berlin as agreed and on sunday i returned to motzstrasse only this time my two companions insisted on accompanying me to elisabeths door i let her kiss me chastely on the cheek and then made the introductions this is herr grottsch and herr wenger theyre responsible for my safety while im in berlin and they insist on looking around your apartment just to make sure everything is kosher elisabeth frowned are they policemen yes kind of are you in any trouble i can assure you its nothing to worry about i said smoothly its not much more than a formality but they certainly wont leave us alone until theyve had a good look around elisabeth shrugged if you think its really necessary but theres no one else here i cant imagine what you think youll find gentlemen this isnt hohenschonhausen you know grottsch stopped and frowned what do you know about hohenschonhausen he asked suspiciously i can see your friends arent from berlin bernie said elisabeth my dear man everyone in berlin knows about hohenschonhausen everyone except me i said truthfully well she said you remember the heike factory the meatprocessing factory on the corner of freienwalder strasse she nodded that whole area is now occupied by the state security service of the ddr i thought that was in karlshorst i said not any more she said you seem to know a lot about it fraulein said wenger im a berliner the communists pretend the place doesnt exist and the rest of us pretend not to see it its an arrangement that suits us all very well i think a very berlin kind of arrangement it was the same with gestapo headquarters on prinz albrechtstrasse remember i nodded of course it was the building that no one saw elisabeth looked at grottsch and wenger and frowned so go ahead and search the two men walked through the apartment and found nothing when they were quite satisfied at finding nothing grottsch said well be outside the door and then they left i moved her away from the door in case they were listening and into the kitchen where we embraced fondly what were you thinking of i said mentioning the stasi like that i dont know it just sort of came out still you recovered it pretty well i thought id forgotten about heikes meat in the army we lived on that stuff thats probably why they shot him richard heike who the russians she nodded who are those two characters just a couple of thugs who work for french intelligence but they were german werent they i think the french rather enjoy making us do their dirty work so thats what youre doing actually i dont know what im doing thats a comforting thought i told the french i had to come here and ask you to marry me that youd given me an ultimatum not a bad idea at that gunther she pulled away from my embrace and started to make us coffee i dont much like living on my own to be alone in berlin is not like being alone anywhere else even the trees here look isolated you mean you really would like to be married why not you were kind to me gunther once in again in a third time in and then a fourth time last year that makes four times in twentythree years my father left home when i was ten my husband well you remember what he was like very free with his fists was my ulrich i have a brother who i havent seen in years elisabeth took out a handkerchief and dabbed her eyes god i hadnt realised it until now but youve been one of the only constant figures in my life bernie gunther perhaps the only one she sniffed loudly shit what about your americans what about them are they here drinking coffee in my kitchen are they do they send me money from america no they dont they fucked me while they were here the way amis do and then they went home to wichita and phoenix oh yes there was another one i didnt tell you about major winthrop now he did give me money only it wasnt like i asked for it or wanted it if you know what i mean he used to leave it on the dresser so that when he went back to his wife in boston it meant he went with a clear conscience because wed never had a proper relationship at least not according to him i was just some little chocolady he saw when he wanted someone to suck his pipe she blew her nose but the tears kept on coming and you ask me why i want to get married gunther its not just berlin thats an enclave its me too and if i dont do something about it soon then i dont know whats to become of me you want an ultimatum well there it is you want me to help you then help me thats my price i nodded then its lucky i came prepared i handed her the ring box vigee had given me bought he said from a secondhand shop in gottingen but for all i knew he might have stolen it from the dwarf alberich elisabeth opened the box the ring was not rhinegold but it did at least look like something valuable although in truth id seen better diamonds on a playing card not that it seemed to matter to her in my experience women like the idea of jewellery no matter what it looks like if they like you then theyre almost always pleased to see a ring of any size and colour she gasped and snatched it out of the box if it doesnt fit i said lamely then i suppose theres a way of fixing that but the ring was already on her finger and seemed to fit well enough which was her cue to start crying again there could be no doubt about it i had a real talent for making women happy just so you know i said my wife died twice the first one after the first war and the second one soon after the second thats not a record you can be proud of as a husband if theres another war you should probably take the precaution of divorcing me quickly but frankly ive always been better at finding other peoples husbands or sleeping with their wives what else oh yes im a born loser thats important for you to know i think this at least explains my current situation which is not without its hazards angel i dare say youve gathered that a man doesnt work for his enemies unless he has little choice in the matter or no choice at all im just a cheap paperknife people pick me up when they need to open an envelope and then they put me down again i dont have any say in the matter as far back as i can remember thats all ive been when i thought i was more than that the truth is that were just what weve done and what we do and not what we ever want to be youre wrong she said it doesnt matter what weve done or what we do what matters is what others think we are if youre looking for meaning then here it is let me supply that for you to me youll always be a good man gunther in my brown eyes youll always be the man who was there for me when i needed someone to be there maybe thats all any of us need you want a plan or a purpose then look no further than me mister i grinned liking her resilience you could tell she was a berliner all right probably shed been one of those women with a bucket whod cleared the city of rubble in raped one day rebuilding the next like some trojan princess in a play by some marbleheaded greek made of the same stuff as that german aviatrix who used to fly missiles for hitler you could say thats why i kissed her properly this time but it might just as easily have been because she was as sexy as black stocking tops especially when her eyes were fixed on me besides most german men prefer a woman who looks like she has a healthy appetite which is not to say elisabeth was fat or even large just well endowed i expect youre wondering if there was a reply to your letter she said it was beginning to itch a little good at the very least i want to see some scratch marks for what you put me through to get this ive never been so scared she opened a kitchen drawer and took out a letter that she now handed to me ill finish making that coffee while you read it chapter thirtythree germany to the west there was the town to the east there were just green open fields and in the middle was the railway line the station immediately south of the refugee camp was like every other building in friedland unremarkable it was made of red bricks and had two red roofs three if you counted the wizardshat roof on top of the square corner tower that was the station masters house a neat little flower garden was laid out by the front door of the house and at the two upperfloor arched windows a neat set of flowery curtains hung there was also a clock a noticeboard with a timetable and a bus stop everything was neat and orderly and just as sleepy as it should have been except today today was different the capital of west germany might have been the unlikely town of bonn but today and no less unlikely than that all german eyes were focused on friedland in lower saxony for today saw the homecoming of one thousand german prisoners of war from soviet captivity aboard a train that had left its remote destination more than twenty four hours earlier the late evening mood was one of high expectation even celebration a brass band was assembled in front of the station and it was already playing a selection of patriotic music that was at the same time politically acceptable to the ears of the british whose zone of occupation this was of the train there was as yet no sign but that autumn evening several hundred people were assembled on the platform and around the station to greet the returnees you would have thought we were expecting to see west germanys fifa world cup team arriving home victorious from the miracle of berne and not a train carrying ss and wehrmacht none of whom had expected ever to be released from russia and who were all of them entirely ignorant of the fact that germany had won the world cup or even that konrad adenauer the former mayor of cologne to whom they owed their freedom was now chancellor of another german republic this time the federal republic of germany but some local men keen to remind the returnees of the chancellors crucial role in their delivery from captivity were carrying a sign that read we thank you doctor adenauer i wouldnt have argued with that although it sometimes seemed to me that the herr doctor was intent on becoming another uncrowned king of germany other signs were much more personal even pathetic between ten and twenty men and women were carrying signs on which were written details of a missing loved one and of these that of an old bespectacled lady who reminded me of my own late mother seemed typical do you know him untersturmfuhrer rudolf rolf knabe second th ss panzer division hohenstaufen and second ss panzerkorps last heard of at kursk july i wondered how much she knew about what had happened at kursk that this place had been the scene of the largest and bloodiest tank battle in history and had probably marked the beginning of the end for the german army others perhaps less optimistic were holding little candles or what looked like miners lamps which i took to be memorials for those who werent ever coming back on the actual platform of the station were those like myself grottsch vig e e and wenger whose role was more official vdh and others veterans organisations policemen churchmen red cross volunteers british army soldiers and a large contingent of nurses several of whom caught my bored eye all were facing south down the track toward reckershausen and beyond to the ddr now now said vigee noticing my interest in the nurses youre almost a married man theres something about nurses that always attracts me i used to think it was the uniform but now i dont know maybe its just sympathy for anyone who has to do someone elses dirty work is it so dirty to help someone who needs it i glanced at the german policeman who vigee had brought along so that if i did identify de boudel he might be arrested immediately and then extradited to france forget it i growled i just never had to blow the whistle on anyone before thats all i guess theres something about it i dont like who knows i started on a new stick of gum if i see this fellow what do you want me to do anyway kiss him on the cheek just point him out to us vigee said patiently the police inspector will do the rest why so squeamish gunther asked grottsch i thought you used to be a policeman i was a cop its true i said several thousand midnights ago but it was one thing arresting some old lag its something else when its an old comrade a nice distinction said the frenchman but hardly correct its not much of an old comrade who sells his soul to the other side there was a loud cheer along the platform as in the distance we heard the whistle of an approaching steam locomotive vigee made a fist and pumped his biceps excitedly who gave you this tip anyway i asked that de boudel would be on this train the english secret service and how did they find out the train was now in sight a shiny black locomotive wreathed in grey smoke and white steam as if a kitchen door in hell had been flung open it was hauling not cattle wagons as would have been more typical of a russian pow train but passenger carriages and it was immediately plain to me that upon entering germany the prisoners had been transferred onto a german train men were already leaning out of open windows waving to the people running alongside the track or catching bunches of flowers thrown up into their arms the train whistled again and halted in the station and men in patched and threadbare uniforms stretched out to touch those on the platform amid shouts and cheers the russians had not provided names of the pows on the train and before anyone was allowed to get off they had to wait patiently while officials from the red cross entered each carriage and collected a list of names for the benefit of the police the commander of the refugee camp and the vdh only when after almost half an hour this task was completed were the men finally allowed to disembark a trumpet sounded and for a moment it seemed as though the hour had truly arrived when those who had been in their graves were truly resurrected and when they came forth from the train in their battered field grey they did indeed resemble recently interred corpses so thin were their bodies so gaptoothed were their smiles so white their hair and so old their weatherbeaten faces some were filthy and shoeless others appeared stunned to be in a place that was not filled with cruelty or surrounded with barbed wire and empty steppe quite a few had to be carried from the train on stretchers a great stink of unwashed bodies filled the clean air of friedland but no one seemed to mind everyone was smiling even a few of the pows but mostly they were crying like stolen children now returned to their aged parents after many years in a dark forest dw griffith or cecil b demille could not have directed a more moving crowd scene than that which was taking place on a railway platform at a small town in germany even vigee appeared moved to the verge of tears meanwhile the brass band started to play the deutschland lied a few of the crazierlooking prisoners started to sing the forbidden words and across the fields a couple of kilometres to the north in gros schneen the local church bells rang out i heard one of the pows tell someone on the platform that it was only the day before that theyd learned they were to be released these men said vigee they look like theyre back from hell no i told him in hell they tell you whats happening to you i had my eyes peeled but i knew there was little real chance of seeing de boudel in the crowds of people at the station vigee knew this too he was expecting us to have better luck when the pows paraded back at the camp the next morning it seemed that i was going to have to repeat my le vernet experience and inspect the men at close quarters i was not looking forward to this and was hoping against hope that we might get lucky and spy de boudel at the station that i might see him before one of my old comrades saw me to this improbable end i went into the station and climbed the stairs to lean out of an upperfloor window in order to gain a better view of this mass of jubilant german soldiery vigee followed then grottsch wenger and the detective i had not seen so many uniforms since the labour camp at johannesgeorgenstadt they swept across the platform like a sea of grey wearing his chain of office and dispensing schnapps from a doublesized earthenware bottle the mayor of friedland moved among the returnees like some hamelin burgomaster surrounded by a plague of rats and mice i could hear him shouting your health and to your freedom and welcome home at the top of his voice next to him a large wehrmacht sergeant stood enfolding an old woman in his arms both were weeping uncontrollably his wife his mother it was hard to tell the sergeant looked so old himself they all did it was hard to believe that these old men had once been the proud storm troopers who had carried hitlers mad operation barbarossa into russia a woman standing next to me was throwing carnations onto the grey heads below isnt it wonderful she said i never thought id live to see the day our boys finally came home germanys heart beats in friedland theyre back back from the godless world of bolshevism i nodded politely but kept my eyes on the faces in the crowd below the window this is chaos said the detective whose name was moeller how the hell are we supposed to find anyone in this the next time we have prisoners arriving here theyd do better to bring them on buses from the border station at herleshausen that way we might at least establish some kind of order youd think this was italy not germany let them have their chaos i said for fourteen years these men have endured discipline and order theyve had a bellyful of it so let them enjoy a moment of disorder it might help to make them feel like human beings again flowers fruit candies cigarettes schnapps hot coffee hugs and kisses every sign of affection was showered on these men i hadnt seen so much joy on the faces of so many germans since june and two things were clear to me that only the federal republic could claim to be the legitimate representative of the german nation and that no one regarded any of these men whatever crimes and atrocities they might have committed in russia and the ukraine as anything other than heroes but equally clear was the reality of the problem now facing me for among the lined grinning faces of the men underneath my gaze was one i recognised from johannesgeorgenstadt a berliner named walter bingel whom i had befriended on the train from the mvd prison near stalingrad the same bingel who had seen me leaving the camp in a zim saloon accompanied by two german communists from k and who assumed that id made a deal with them to save my skin and if bingel was on the train then quite probably there were others from johannesgeorgenstadt who thanks to him would have the same memory of me it was beginning to look as if inspector moeller might be obliged to arrest me too vigees keen eyes saw mine lingering nervously on bingels face recognise anyone he asked not so far i lied but to be honest these men seem older than their years im not sure id recognise my own brother down there if i had a brother well thats good for us isnt it said the frenchman a man who has spent the last six or seven years working for the mvd ought to stick out from the rest of these uncles after all de boudel is merely posing as a pow he hasnt been in a labour camp like them i nodded the frenchman had a point can we get a copy of that list of names made by the red cross i asked vigee nodded at moeller who went away to fetch one all the same he said i dont think hell be using his real name do you no of course not but one has to start somewhere most police work starts with a list of something or other even if its a list of what you dont know sometimes thats as important as what you do know really detective work is simple its just not very easy dont sweat it said vigee we always knew that finding de boudel at the station would be a long shot reveille at the refugee camp tomorrow morning thats where im pinning my hopes yes i think youre right i said we watched moeller struggling through the crowd of men to one of the red cross officials he said something and the official nodded back where did you find him i asked gottingen said vigee why he lit a cigarette and flicked his match onto the heads of the men below as if he wished to express his contempt for them do you think hes not up to this i couldnt say maybe hes not the detective you were gunther vigee blew out his cheeks and sighed all he has to do is arrest the man you identify theres not much to being that kind of a cop nest cepas he sneered perhaps you should give him some tips tell him your forensic secrets theyre quite simple too i said i used to get up in the morning and go to bed at night and in between id try to keep myself busy and out of mischief really is that all you have to offer after how many years of being a detective any fool can solve a crime frenchman its proving it that wears you out moeller started back through the crowd to the station door but found himself making little or no progress he looked up and seeing vigee and then me he threw up his hands and grinned helplessly i grinned back and nodded affably as if recognising his difficulty but all the time i was looking at him i was trying to gauge what kind of policeman i was going to be dealing with when the following morning walter bingel identified me as a collaborator and traitor chapter thirtyfour germany we remained behind until all of the pows had marched off to the camp and most of the local people had left the station vigee was i think impressed that i had insisted on being there until the last and of course he was quite without a clue that the real reason had much more to do with my trying to keep out of sight before we climbed into the citroen that would take us back to our pension in gottingen moeller handed me a twentypage list of names and ranks and serial numbers all of the men who were in that train he said redundantly i tucked the list into my coat pocket and glanced around the station ticket hall and beyond onto the platform where those whose dashed hopes of seeing some longlost loved one remained to the bitter end a few of these people were in tears others just sat alone in quiet and stoic grief i heard someone say next time frau kettenacher i expect hell come the next time they say it might be another year before theyre all home and that the ss will be the last gently the owner of the voice some local pastor it looked like to me helped an old woman to her feet collected her missing persons sign off the ground and guided her towards the platform exit we followed at a respectful distance poor soul muttered moeller i know how she feels i have an elder brother whos still a prisoner why didnt you say something i said suppose hed turned up here what would you have done moeller shrugged i was sort of hoping he would thats one of the reasons i got put forward for this job but now that ive seen that refugee camp im not so sure there must be better ways of treating our men herr gunther dont you agree i nodded they dont do so bad said grottsch every week the camp commander at friedland gets hundreds of letters from single women all over germany who are looking for a new husband the five of us squeezed into the car and set off north for gottingen some fifteen kilometres away sitting in the back i switched on the courtesy light and nervously scanned the list for the names of any others from johannesgeorgenstadt and it didnt take long to find the name of ss general fritz klause who had been the sgo at the camp it was beginning to look as if the radiation there hadnt been nearly as lethal as i had been led to believe then again a man can use hate for his enemy as a blanket just warm enough to keep him alive through even a russian winter i wish someone would write and offer to marry me said wenger as he drove the car or at the very least offer to take the place of the wife i already have i wonder what theyll think said moeller about the new germany i imagine theyll think its really not quite german enough observed grottsch that was my impression when i came back from a british pow camp i kept looking for germany and all i found was new furniture cars and toys for american boys turn the car around i said we have to go back vigee sitting beside wenger in the front seat ordered him to pull up for a moment then he turned in his seat to look at me found something maybe explain please as we were leaving there was a woman back at the station seeking information about her loved one she had written all of his details on a sign yes said vigee what was her name kettenacher i said but there was also a kettenacher who was on the train whos on this list prepared by the red cross its not an uncommon name in this part of germany said moeller no i said firmly but frau kettenachers son was in the panzer corps he was a hauptmann a captain same as me richard kettenacher fiftysixth panzer corps last heard of in the battle for berlin he missed his mother in the crowd said moeller it happens and what about all his comrades i asked would they have missed her too go back vigee told wenger urgently go back immediately wenger turned the car around let me see that list said the frenchman i handed it to him and pointed out the name what do you think we should do he asked go straight to the camp suppose he slips away before he gets there no i said hes here because he needs to be official he needs some papers otherwise the russian state security people could have smuggled him across the border in berlin he needs his discharge papers ration cards an identity document all of that in order to enter german society to become something new hes not going to slip away i thought for a moment we need to speak to the real captain kettenachers mother that old lady we saw at the railway station we need her to give us a photograph of her son so that when you and moeller here go to the camp tomorrow and he tries to throw some sand in your face youll be able to deal with it by being able to produce a picture you can leave asking her to me i am after all a representative of the vdh you said that in a way that implied you thought you wouldnt be coming to the refugee camp said vigee why because i think you need to keep me in reserve i said smoothly think about it emile you arrest kettenacher on suspicion of really being de boudel he denies it of course so you take him to the pension esebeck and show him the real kettenachers photograph he still denies it theres some mistake an administrative error there were two captain kettenachers you let him talk himself into a corner thats when i step out from behind the curtain and say hello edgard remember me im your ace emile but you mustnt play me until the end vigee was nodding yes youre correct of course but how will we find frau kettenacher i shrugged im a detective remember if finding people was difficult they wouldnt ask policemen to do it every day of the week i smiled at moeller no offence intended inspector none taken sir so where am i driving muttered wenger suppose the old lady doesnt live in friedland suppose she already left town that pastor seemed to know her said vigee yes but theres no church in friedland there is one in gros schneen said moeller head back to the station i said well see if anyone remembers them there if not we can then decide what to do the stationmaster a stooping etiolated figure was sweeping up after the crowds his flowerbed had been trampled and as a result he could have been in a better mood he shook his head when i asked him about frau kettenacher but seemed to remember the pastor all right that was pastor overmans from the church in hebenshausen wheres that a couple of kilometres south of here you cant miss it theres even less in hebenshausen than there is here in friedland wenger drove south and we soon found ourselves in a village that lived down to the stationmasters description we were just in time to see a bus leaving the village square and the pastor and the old lady still carrying her missing persons sign walking away from the bus stop behind the stop was a largish halftimbered house and behind the house was a small square church tower the pastor and the old lady went inside the house and some lights were turned on wenger stopped the car moeller i said you come with me and dont say anything the rest of you wait here the pastor was surprised to see us there so late until i explained that i was from the vdh and that wed missed frau kettenacher at the station i try to see all of the families in this part of lower saxony who have a missing loved one i said but i dont think ive met the lady before ah thats because shes from kassel explained pastor overmans frau kettenacher is from kassel im her brotherinlaw shes been staying with me so that she could be at the railway station tonight im very sorry that your son wasnt on the train i told her in the hope of avoiding further disappointments weve been pressing the russians to provide more details of who theyre still holding and when these pows might be released the pastor a brickfaced man with white hair glanced around the sombrely furnished room at the sagging heap of a woman who was sitting on an inadequatelooking chair well that would be something eh rosa frau kettenacher nodded silently she was still wearing her coat and a hat that looked like an airraid wardens helmet she smelt strongly of mothballs and disappointment i continued with my cruel deception if i was correct and edgard de boudel was indeed using the name of hauptmann richard kettenacher it could only mean one thing that the real captain was dead and had been for some considerable time i managed to persuade myself that his cruelty and the cruelty of the russian intelligence service that had put together this legend was crueller than mine but only just however i said weightily the soviet authorities are not known for the efficiency of their record keeping i know i was a prisoner myself when our men are repatriated its the german red cross and not the russians who establish who is actually being released for this reason were in the process of compiling our own records of who is still missing and while this may not seem like the best moment to be asking questions like this i wonder if i might take a few details of the loved one still missing i smiled sadly at the pastor your nephew is it yes he said and repeated the missing mans name rank and serial number and the details of his war service i noted these down conscientiously i wont take up too much of your time i said do you have any personal documentation a pay book perhaps not every soldier kept his pay book on him like he was supposed to a lot left them at home for safe keeping so that their wives could claim the money i know i did or perhaps a military service record book a party card that kind of thing frau kettenacher was already opening a brown leather bag that was the size and shape of a small coracle my ricky was a good boy she said in a strong saxon accent he wouldnt ever have disobeyed the rules about carrying his pay book she took out a manila envelope and handed it to me but youll find everything else in here his national socialist party personal identity card his sa identity card his craftsman guild certificate his id for commercial travellers he trained to be a metalworker see and then became a travelling salesman selling the things he used to make his german state travel passport that was for the time he went to italy on business his bombing victims pass rickys apartment in kassel was bombed you know and his wife was killed a lovely girl she was and his military service pass book i tried to contain my excitement the old lady was giving me everything that could have identified the real richard kettenacher several of the documents contained not just photographs but personal signatures bloodtypes details of medical examinations his size of gasmask helmet cap and boots a record of wounds and serious illnesses and military decorations the inspector here will issue you with a receipt for these documents i said and hell make sure that theyre returned safely to you i dont care about them she said all i care about is having my ricky returned safely to me god willing yes i said pocketing the missing mans life history as soon as moeller had written a receipt we left the pastor and the old lady alone and walked back to the car well asked vigee i nodded i got everything i brandished the old ladys envelope everything kettenachers double couldnt get past this lot thats the great thing about nazi documentation for one thing there was so bloody much of it and for another its virtually impossible to contradict lets hope its not the real one said vigee if he was blind then perhaps he couldnt see his mother and perhaps her eyes are not so good and she couldnt see him he looked through the documents let us hope youre right about this i dont like disappointments chapter thirtyfive germany the following morning i remained at the pension in gottingen while vigee and some of the others went to arrest the man posing as kettenacher i asked if i might be allowed to go to church but grottsch said that vigee had given orders that we should remain indoors and await his return he said i hope its him so that we can go back to hannover i really dont like gottingen any more why its a nice enough little town too many memories said grottsch i went to university here my wife too i didnt know you were married she was killed in an air raid he said october sorry and you were you married before yes she died too but much later on in we had a small hotel in dachau he nodded dachau is very lovely said grottsch well it was before the war for a moment we shared a silent memory of a germany that was gone and probably would never be again not for us anyway and certainly not for our poor wives conversations in germany were often like this people would just stop in the middle of a sentence and remember a place that was gone or someone who was dead there were so many dead that sometimes you could actually feel the grief on the streets even in the feeling of sadness that afflicted the country was almost as bad as it had been during the great depression we heard a car draw up outside the pension and grottsch went to see if they had our man a few minutes later he came back looking worried well he said theyve got someone yes theyve got someone all right but if it is edgard de boudel then he speaks german better than any franzi i ever met of course he would i said he was fluent even when i knew him his german was better than mine grottsch shrugged anyway he insists hes kettenacher vigees confronting him with the real kettenachers documents now did you see kettenachers party id the man had donation stamps going back to and did you see those duelling scars on his cheek in the photographs i nodded its true he was everyones idea of what a nazi should look like especially now that hes dead why do i get the feeling that you werent a party member yourself does it really matter now if i was or i wasnt i shook my head as far as our new friends are concerned the french the amis the tommies we were all fucking nazis so it doesnt matter who was and who wasnt they look at all those old leni riefenstahl movies and who can blame them there was never a moment when you believed in hitler like the rest of us oh yes there was for about a month in the summer of after we licked the french in six weeks i believed in him then who didnt yes that was the best time for me too after a while we heard raised voices and a few minutes later vigee came into the room he looked cross and out of breath and there was blood on the back of one hand as if hed hit someone hes not richard kettenacher he said that much is certain but he swears hes not edgard de boudel so its up to you now gunther i shrugged all right i followed the frenchman down to the wine cellar where wenger and moeller were guarding our prisoner the photographs the amis had shown me had been black and white of course and blown up after being shot from a distance so that they were a little blurred and grainy doubtless the real de boudel would have gone to great lengths to disguise himself he would have lost some weight dyed his hair grown a moustache perhaps when id been a uniformed policeman in the twenties id arrested many suspects on the basis of a photograph or a police description but this was the first time id been obliged to do it in order to save my own neck the man was sitting in a chair he was wearing handcuffs and his cheeks were red as if hed been struck several times he looked about sixty but he was probably younger in fact i was certain of it as soon as he saw me the man smiled bernie gunther he said i never thought id be pleased to see you again tell this french idiot im not the man hes looking for this edgar boudel he keeps asking me about he spat on the floor why dont you tell him yourself i said tell him your real name and then perhaps hell believe you the man frowned and said nothing do you recognise this man vigee asked me yes i recognise him and is it him is it de boudel who is this boudel fellow anyway said the prisoner and whats he supposed to have done i nodded yes thats a good idea i told the prisoner find out what this wanted mans done and if it turns out be rather less heinous than what you did yourself then put your hands up for it why not i can see how you could think that might work i dont know what youre talking about gunther ive spent the last nine years in a russian pow camp whatever it is im supposed to have done i reckon ive paid for it several times over as if i care i demand to know this mans name said vigee how about it i told the prisoner we both know youre not richard kettenacher i suppose you stole his pay book and just swapped the photograph on the inside cover stuck it on with some egg white russians didnt usually pay too much attention to the corner stamps you figured a new name and a different service would keep the dogs off your trail because after treblinka you knew that someone would be coming to look for you you and irmfried eberl wasnt it i dont know what youre talking about neither do i complained vigee and im beginning to get irritated permit me to introduce you emile this is major paul kestner formerly of the ss and deputy commander of the treblinka death camp in poland rubbish said kestner rubbish you dont know what youre talking about at least he was until himmler found out about what he was doing there even he was horrified by what he and the commandant had been up to theft murder torture isnt that right paul so horrified that you and eberl were kicked out of the ss which is how you found yourself in the wehrmacht defending berlin trying to redeem yourself for your earlier crimes nonsense said kestner you may not have edgard de boudel in custody emile but you do have one of the worst war criminals in europe a man who is responsible for the deaths of at least three quarters of a million jews and gypsies rubbish rubbish and dont think im unaware of what this is really about gunther its about paris isnt it june vigee frowned what about it he tried to have me murdered i said i knew it said kestner vigee nodded at the door outside he told me i need to speak with you i followed him out of the wine cellar up the stairs and into the little walled garden by the canal vigee lit us each a cigarette paul kestner huh i nodded i imagine the un war crimes commission will be pleased to have him in custody i said you think i give a fuck about any of that he said angrily how many fucking jews he killed i dont care i dont care about treblinka gunther or the fate of some lousy gypsies theyre dead too bad its not my problem what i do care about is finding edgard de boudel got that what i care about is finding the man who tortured and murdered almost three hundred frenchmen in indochina he was shouting now and waving his arms in the air but he didnt grab me by the lapels and i sensed that while he might have been angry and disappointed he was also wary of me now so were going back to that refugee camp at friedland tomorrow and were going to look at every man there and were going to find de boudel understand its not my fault that hes not our man i shouted back but it was the right call and assuming your information is correct and de boudel really was on that fucking train then it stands to reason hes in the camp youd better pray he is or were both in trouble its not only your ass its mine too i shrugged maybe ill do that what pray pray to get out of this place for a while to get away from you emile i shook my head i need some room to breathe to clear my head he seemed to control himself and then nodded yes im sorry its not your fault youre right look take a walk around town go to church again ill send someone with you what about him kestner well take him back to the refugee camp the german authorities can decide what to do with him but me i dont have any time for the un and their stupid war crimes commission i dont want to know about it muttering in french he walked off probably before one us felt obliged to try to hit the other again i found grottsch who to my surprise tried to excuse the frenchman with the explanation that his daughter was ill we collected our coats and went outside into the autumn sunshine gottingen was full of students which served to remind me that my own daughter dinah was probably in her first year of university by now at least i hoped she was walking around a bit grottsch and i found ourselves beside the ruins of the towns synagogue on oberemasch strasse burnt to the ground in and i wondered how many of gottingens jews had met their ends in treblinka at the hands of paul kestner and if nine years in a russian pow camp really was sufficient punishment for three quarters of a million people perhaps there was after all no earthly punishment that was equal to a crime like that but if not here on earth then where our footsteps took us back to st jacobis church outside i stopped to look in the window of a shop opposite but when i walked away i found i was alone i stopped and glanced around expecting to see grottsch coming towards me but he was nowhere to be seen for a moment i considered escape the prospect of visiting friedland refugee camp and being seen by bingel and krause was no more appealing than it had been the previous day and about the only thing that prevented me walking straight to the railway station was a lack of money and the knowledge that my french passport was back at the pension esebeck i was still debating my next course of action when i found i was closely accompanied by two men wearing neat little hats and short dark raincoats if youre looking for your friend said one of the men he had to sit down and rest on account of the fact that he suddenly felt very tired i was still looking around for grottsch as if i really cared what happened to him when i realised that there were two more men behind me hes sleeping it off in the church the man speaking had good german but it wasnt his first language he wore heavy framed glasses and was smoking a metalstemmed pipe he puffed and a cloud of tobacco smoke obscured his face for a moment sleeping it off a hypodermic shot nothing to worry about not for him and not for you gunther so relax were your friends theres a car around the corner waiting to take us on a little ride suppose i dont want to go for a ride why suppose anything of the kind when we both know thats exactly what you want besides id hate to have to give you a shot like your friend grottsch the effects of thiopental can linger unpleasantly for several days after injection he had my arm now and his colleague had the other and we were already turning the corner onto weender strasse a new life awaits you my friend money and a new identity a new passport anything you want the door of a large black saloon swung open ahead of me a man wearing a leather jacket and a matching cap was standing behind it another man walking a few steps ahead of me stopped by the car door and turned to face me i was being kidnapped and by people who knew exactly what they were doing who are you i asked surely youve been expecting us said the man beside me after your note he grinned you cant imagine the excitement your information has caused not just here in germany but at headquarters too i bent forward to get into the car and felt someones hand on the top of my head just in case at the last moment i tried to resist and bumped my head on the door frame cops and spies all over the world were always thoughtful like that two men outside the car stayed on the alert looking around nervously until everyone who was supposed to be in the car was in the car and then the doors were closed and we were moving and it was all over with no more fuss than if we were all going on an unexpected shopping trip to the next town after a few minutes i saw that we were driving west and breathed a sigh of relief at least now i knew who was kidnapping me and why just sit back and enjoy the journey my friend from here on in youre five star all the way those are my orders gunther old buddy im to treat you like a very important person that will make a pleasant change from when i was last a guest of you americans i said frankly there was something about it i didnt like and what was that my cell chapter thirtysix germany two and a half hours later we were in frankfurt and heading across the main into the north of the city our destination was an enormous curving honeycoloured marble office building with six square wings that lent the place a quasi military aspect as if any minute the clerks and secretaries inside might abandon their typewriters and comptometers and man some antiaircraft guns on the flat roofs i hadnt ever been there but i recognised it from old newsreels and picture magazines completed in the poelzig ensemble or poelzig complex had been the largest office building in europe and the corporate headquarters of the ig farben conglomerate this former model of german business and modernity had been the centre for nazi wartime research projects relating to the creation of synthetic oil and rubber not to mention zyklon b the lethal gas used in death camps it was now the headquarters of the us high commissioner for germany the hicog and it now seemed the central intelligence agency the car passed through a couple of military checkpoints before we parked and entered a templelike portico behind this were some bronze doors and on the other side a capacious hallway with a large american flag several american soldiers and two curving staircases covered with sheet aluminium in front of the paternoster elevator i was invited to step aboard and to disembark on the ninth floor a little nervously for i had never before ridden one of these intimidating elevators i complied the ninth floor was very different from those below there were no windows it was lit from skylights instead of banded glazing which probably afforded the securityminded inhabitants yet more privacy the ceiling was also much lower which made me wonder if one of the qualifications to be an american spy in europe might be a lack of height certainly the man to whom i was now introduced was not tall although he was hardly short either he wasnt anything you could have described being unremarkable in almost every way he was i suppose like an american professor albeit one who spoke fluent german he wore a blazer grey flannel trousers a buttondown blue shirt and some sort of club or academic tie maroon with little shields the introduction was not however illuminating in that he appeared to have no name just a title he was the chief and that was all i ever knew about him i did however recognise the two men who were also waiting for me in that windowless meeting room special agents scheuer and frei were those their real names i still had no idea waited until the chief had acknowledged their presence before nodding at me with silent courtesy have you been here before he asked i mean when this building was owned by ig farben no sir i shrugged as a matter of fact im surprised to find its still here apparently undamaged a building this size of such importance to the nazi war effort id always assumed it was bombed to rubble like almost everything else in this part of germany there are two schools of opinion on that gunther sit down sit down one school has it that the us air force was forbidden to bomb it because of the buildings proximity to the allied pow camp at gruneburgpark the other school would have you believe that eisenhower had this building marked out as his future european headquarters apparently the building reminded him of the pentagon in washington and i suppose if im honest it does look a little similar so maybe thats the real explanation after all i drew a chair out from a long dark wood table and sat down and waited for the chief to get to the point of my being there but it seemed he hadnt yet finished with eisenhower the presidents wife wasnt quite so enamoured of this building however she took particular exception to a large bronze female figure a nude that used to sit on the edge of the reflecting pool she thought it wasnt suitable for a military installation the chief chuckled which makes me wonder how many real soldiers shes actually met he frowned im not sure where that statue went the hoechst building perhaps that nude always did look like she needed some medicine eh phil yes sir said scheuer you must be tired after your journey herr gunther said the chief so ill try not to fatigue you any more than i have to would you like some coffee sir please scheuer moved towards a sideboard where coffee things had been neatly assembled on a tray the chief sat down and regarded me with a mixture of curiosity and distrust if there had been a chessboard on the table between us it might have made things feel a little easier for us both all the same a game was in progress and we both knew what it was he waited until scheuer phil had set a cup of coffee in front of me and then began zyklon b i assume youve heard of it i nodded everyone assumes it was developed by ig farben but they merely marketed the stuff it was actually developed by another chemical company called degesch which came to be controlled by a third chemical company called degussa in degussa needed to raise some money and so they sold half of their controlling interest in degesch to their main competitor ig farben and by the way the stuff the actual crystals that exterminated insects with the speed of a cyclone thus the name well that was made by a fourth company called dessauer werke you with me so far yes sir although im beginning to wonder why patience sir all will be explained so dessauer made the stuff for degesch who sold the stuff to degussa who sold the marketing rights to two other chemical companies i wont even bother telling you their names it would just confuse you so in fact ig farben held only a twenty per cent share in the gas with the lions share owned by another company the goldschmidt ag company of essen why am i telling you this let me explain when i moved into this building i felt kind of uncomfortable at the idea that i might be breathing the same kind of office air as the folks who developed that poison gas so i resolved to find out about it for myself and i discovered that it really wasnt true that ig farben had had very much to do with that gas i also discovered that back in the us public health service were using zyklon b to disinfect the clothes of mexican immigrants and the freight trains they were travelling in at the new orleans quarantine station incidentally the stuff is still being manufactured today in czechoslovakia in the city of koln they call it uragan d and they use it to disinfect the trains that german pows have been travelling on back to the homeland you see herr gunther i have a passion for information some people call that sort of thing trivia but i do not i call that truth or knowledge or even when im sitting in my office intelligence i have an appetite for facts sir facts whether its facts about ig farben zyklon b gas mickey messer or erich mielke i sipped my coffee it was horrible like stewed socks i reached for my cigarettes and remembered that id smoked the last of them in the car give herr gunther a cigarette will you phil that was what you were after was it not yes thank you scheuer lit me with an armourplated dunhill and then lit one for himself i noticed the shields on his bow tie were the same as the ones on the chiefs and i assumed they shared more than just a service but a background too ivy league probably your letter herr gunther was fascinating especially in the context of what phil here has told me and what ive read in the file but its my job to discover how much of it is fact oh im not for a moment suggesting that youre lying to us but after twenty years people can easily make mistakes thats fair isnt it very fair he regarded my undrunk coffee with vicarious disgust horrible isnt it the coffee i dont know why we put up with it phil get herr gunther something stronger what are you drinking sir a schnapps would be nice i said and glanced around as scheuer fetched a bottle and a small glass from inside the sideboard and placed it on the desk thank you coaster snapped the chief coasters were fetched and placed under the bottle and my glass this tables made of walnut said the chief walnut marks like a damask napkin now then sir you have your cigarette you have your drink all i need from you are some facts in his fingers he held a sheet of unfolded paper on which i recognised my own handwriting he placed a pair of half moon glasses on the end of his snub nose and viewed the letter with a detached curiosity he barely read the contents before letting the note fall onto the table naturally ive read this several times but now that youre here id prefer it if you told me in person what you have written to agents scheuer and frei in this letter of yours so that you can see if i deviate from what i wrote before we understand each other perfectly well the facts are these i said suppressing a smile as a condition of my working with the sdece the chief winced exactly what does that mean phil service de documentation exterieure et de contreespionage said scheuer the chief nodded go on herr gunther well i agreed to work for them if they permitted me to visit berlin and an old friend of mine perhaps the only friend i have left she have a name this friend of yours elisabeth i said surname address i dont want her involved in any of this meaning you dont want to tell me thats true you met her how and when she was a seamstress a good one too she worked in the same tailors shop as erich mielkes sister which was also where mielkes mother lydia mielke worked until her death in it was pretty hard for erichs father bringing up four children on his own his elder daughter went to work and cooked for the family meals and because elisabeth was her friend sometimes she helped out there were even times when elisabeth was like a sister to erich where did they live can you remember the address stettiner strasse a grey tenement building in gesundbrunnen in northwest berlin number twentyfive it was erich who introduced me to elisabeth after id saved his neck tell me about that i told him and this is when you met mielkes father yes i went to mielkes address to try to arrest him and the old man took a swing at me and i had to arrest him it was elisabeth who had given me the address and she wasnt very happy that id asked her for it as a result our relationship hit a rock and it was very much later on i suppose it must have been the autumn of before we became reacquainted and the following year before we started our relationship again you never mentioned any of this when you were interrogated at landsberg said the chief why not i shrugged it hardly seemed relevant at the time i almost forgot that elisabeth even knew erich not least because shed always kept it a secret from him that we were friends erich didnt like cops much to put it mildly i started seeing her again in the winter of when i came back from the russian pow camp i lived with elisabeth for a short while until i managed to find my wife again in berlin but i was always very fond of her and she of me and recently when i was in paris i got to thinking of her again and wondering if she was okay i suppose you might say i began to entertain romantic thoughts about her like i said theres no one else in berlin i know so i was resolved to look her up as soon as possible and see if she and i couldnt make another go of it and how did that go it went well shes not married she was involved with some american soldier more than one i think anyway both men were married and so they went back to their wives in the states leaving her middleaged and scared about the future i poured a glass of schnapps and sipped it while the chief watched me closely as if weighing my story in each hand trying to judge how much or how little he believed she was at the same address as shed been in yes we can always ask the french you know her address go ahead they might reasonably assume thats where youve gone he said they might even make life difficult for her have you thought of that we could protect her the french arent always as romantic as theyre often portrayed elisabeth lived through the battle of berlin i said she was raped by the russians besides shes not the type to give a man an injection of thiopental on the streets of gottingen in broad daylight when grottsch tells his story i imagine the french will think the russians pinched me dont you after all thats what you wanted them to think isnt it i wouldnt be at all surprised if your men were speaking russian when they grabbed him just for appearances sake at least tell me if she lives in the east or the west in the west the french gave me a passport in the name of sebastian kleber youll be able to check me coming through checkpoint alpha at helmstedt and into berlin at the dreilinden crossing but not leaving it to enter east berlin all right tell me your news about erich mielke my friend elisabeth said shed seen mielkes father erich that he was still alive and in good health he was in his early seventies she said they went for a coffee at the cafe kranzler he said hed been living in the ddr but that he didnt like it missed the football and his old neighbourhood while elisabeth was telling me this it was clear she had no idea what erich junior had been doing who and what he was all she said was that erich visits his father from time to time and gives him money and i assumed given who he was that this must be in secret from time to time how often is that regularly once a month why didnt you say so i might have done if youd given me enough time did she say where erich senior had been living in the ddr a village called schonwalde northwest of berlin she said he told her he had a nice enough cottage there but that he was bored in schonwalde its rather a boring place of course she knew that erich senior had been a staunch communist and so she asked him if living in the west meant he had left the party and he said that he had come to the conclusion that the communists were every bit as bad as the nazis she said he said that yes you know we checked and theres no record of an erich mielke living in west berlin mielkes father isnt called mielke his name is erich stallmacher mielke was illegitimate not that the fathers using the name of stallmacher either did she tell you what his name is no give you an address stallmacher isnt that stupid but there is something something youd like to trade yes stallmacher told elisabeth the name of a restaurant where he regularly likes to go for lunch on saturdays and your idea is what exactly this is your area of expertise not mine chief i was never much of an intelligence officer i didnt have the kind of dirty mind to be really effective in your world i was a better detective i think better at uncovering a mess than creating one i see you have a low opinion of intelligence just the people who work in it us included you especially you prefer the french theres something honest about their hypocrisy and selfregard as a former berlin detective what would you propose follow erich stallmacher from his favourite restaurant to his apartment and lay a trap for erich mielke there risky sure i said but now that youve pulled me youre going to do it all the same you have to now that youve partly undermined all that black propaganda id been giving to the french about mielke being your agent and before that an agent of the nazis without the cherry on the cake me identifying de boudel for them maybe they wont find all those lies i told about erich so persuasive any more its true that we would like to get our hands on mielke with his father in our back pocket we could even perhaps turn him into the spy you told the french he was of course then wed have to blacken your name to the french to make sure they formed the correct impression about mielke again that he was and always had been a perfect communist bastard you see i knew youd think of some way around these problems and you what will you want to help i frowned i can show you where the restaurant is maybe even get you a table we shall want more help than that after all youve met erich stallmacher he took a swing at you you arrested him you must have got a good look at him that day no herr gunther we shall want more than your help in obtaining a table at this man stallmachers favourite watering hole we shall want you to identify him i smiled wearily something funny about that youre not the first intelligence chief to have asked me to do this heydrich had the same idea ive often wondered about heydrich said the chief they said he was the cleverest nazi of the bunch you agree with that its true he had an instinctive understanding of power which made him a very effective nazi you like facts sir then heres a fact about reinhardt heydrich you might appreciate his father bruno was a music teacher and before that a composer of sorts ten years before his son was born bruno heydrich wrote an opera entitled reinhardts crime oh yes and heres another fact heydrich was murdered on himmlers order you dont say i was the investigating detective interesting more interesting to me right now is the money that was taken from me when i was arrested in cuba and the boat that was impounded thats part of the price for my help actually it was the price of the deal we had in landsberg in return for me bullshitting the french so youre only agreeing to what your people have already agreed i want the boat sold and all of the money paid into a swiss bank account as we agreed i also want an american passport and for delivering erich mielke the sum of twentyfive thousand us dollars thats a lot given that im about to deliver the deputy head of the east german state security apparatus id say it was cheap at twice the price philip yes sir a price worth paying would you say for mielke yes sir i would ive always thought that since the beginning of this whole intelligence effort because you know i shall want you to play the ringmaster at herr gunthers show dont you no sir then i guess you know it now eh philip scheuer looked uncomfortable at being put on the spot like this yes sir you too jim frei raised his eyebrows at that but nodded all the same i poured myself another glass of schnapps why not said the chief i think we could all use a drink dont you agree phil yes sir i think we could but not schnapps eh forgive me herr gunther theres a lot about your country i admire but were not very keen on schnapps at the cia i imagine its rather hard to spike a glass this small dont you believe it the chief smiled hmm yes thats quite a sense of humour you have there for a german philip scheuer produced a bottle of bourbon and three glasses sure you wont try any of this herr gunther said the chief to toast your deal with ike why not i said good man well make an american of you yet sir but that was exactly what i was worried about chapter thirtyseven berlin most people go through life accumulating possessions i seemed to have gone through mine losing them or having them taken away from me the only thing i still had from before the war was a broken chess piece made of bone the head of a black knight from a selenus chess set during the last days of the weimar republic this black knight had been constantly in use at the romanisches cafe where once or twice id played the great emmanuel lasker hed been a regular at the cafe until the nazis obliged him and his brother to leave germany for ever in i could still picture him crouched over a board with his cigarettes and cigars and his wild west moustache generous to a fault he would give out tips or play exhibitions for anyone who was interested and on his last day in the romanisches cafe he went to moscow and then to new york lasker presented everyone who was there to wish him goodbye with a chess piece from the cafes best set i got the black knight the way id been played over the years i sometimes think a black pawn would have been more appropriate then again a knight even a broken one seems intrinsically more valuable than a pawn which was probably why i tried so hard to keep it through one adversity after another the little bone base had become detached during the battle for konigsberg and was lost soon afterwards but somehow the horses head had remained in my possession i might have called it my lucky charm but for the salient fact that one way or another id not always had the best of luck on the other hand i was still in the game and sometimes thats all the luck you need anything absolutely anything can happen so long as you stay in the game and lately as if to remind myself of this fact the little black knights head was often held tight in my fist the way a mohammedan might have used a set of beads to utter the ninetynine names of god and bring him closer during prayer only it wasnt being closer to god i wanted but something more earthly freedom independence selfrespect no longer to be the pawn of others in a game i wasnt interested in surely that wasnt so much to ask the flight to berlin from frankfurt aboard a dc took just under an hour travelling with me were scheuer frei and a third man the man with the heavyframed glasses who had kidnapped me in gottingen his name was hamer a black mercedes was waiting for us in front of the airport building at tempelhof as we drove away scheuer pointed out the monument to the berlin airlift of that occupied the centre of eagle square made of concrete and taller than the airport building itself the monument was supposed to represent the three air corridors that were used to fly in supplies during the soviet blockade it looked more like the statue of a comicbook ghost arms raised leaning over to scare someone and as i glanced back at the airport i was rather more interested in the fate of the nazi eagle that surmounted the centre wall of the airport building there could be no doubt about it the eagle had been americanised someone had painted its head white so that now it looked more like an american bald eagle we drove west through the american sector which was clean and prosperouslooking with lots of plateglass shop windows and garish new movie houses showing the latest hollywood movies rear window on the waterfront and dial m for murder ihnestrasse close to the university and the new henry ford building looked much the same as it had before the war lots of chestnut trees and wellkept gardens the american flags were new of course there was a large one on the flagpole in front of the american officers club at harnack house formerly the guest quarters of the famous kaiser wilhelm institute scheuer told me proudly that the club had a restaurant a beauty parlour a barber shop and a newsstand and promised to take me there but somehow i didnt think the kaiser would have approved he was never very fond of americans we stayed in a villa further down the street from the club from my dormer window at the back you could see a small lake the only sounds were the birds in the trees and the bicycle bells of students going to and from the free university of berlin like little couriers of hope for a city i was finding it hard to love again in spite of the instant service that came with my room in the shape of an obsequious valet in a white messjacket who offered to bring me coffee and a doughnut i declined both and asked for a bottle of schnapps and some cigarettes worst of all was the music hidden speakers playing some honeyvoiced female singer who seemed to follow me from the dining room through the hall and into the library it wasnt particularly loud or obtrusive but it was there when it didnt need to be i asked the valet about it his name was george and he told me that the singer was ella fitzgerald as if that made it okay the furniture looked like it was original to the house so that was all right although the watercooler in the library seemed somehow out of place as did the periodic eructations of air that passed through the water like an enormous belch it sounded like my own conscience the am steinplatz restaurant was at uhlandstrasse southwest of the tiergarten and dated from before the war the dilapidated exterior of the building belied a restaurant that was good enough to warrant inclusion in the us armys berlin booklet which meant that the place was popular with american officers and their german girlfriends there was a bar with a dining room serving a mixture of american and berlin favourites the four of us me and the three amis occupied a window table in the dining room the waitress wore glasses and had her hair shorter than seemed right as if it was yet to grow back following some personal disaster she was german but she spoke english first as if she knew that there were few berliners who could have afforded the prices on the extensive menu we ordered wine and lunch the place was still more or less empty so we knew erich stallmacher wasnt yet there but it quickly filled up until there was only one table left he probably wont come said frei not this time thats always been my experience of stakeouts the target never comes the first time lets hope youre not wrong said hamer the food in heres so damn good i want to come back several times rain hit the steamedup window of the restaurant a cork popped from a bottle of wine the officers on the next table laughed loudly like men who were used to laughing in wide open spaces possibly on horseback but never in small berlin restaurants they even clinked their glasses with more panache and noise than was properly required in the kitchen someone shouted that an order was ready i looked at scheuers watch my own was still in a paper bag back at landsberg it was onethirty maybe ill check the bar i said good idea said scheuer give me some money for cigarettes i told him for appearances sake i went through to the bar bought some english cigarettes from the barman and glanced around while he found me a light some men were playing dominoes in a snug little alcove a dog was lying on the floor beside them its tail periodically wagging an old man sat in a corner nursing a beer and reading the previous days edition of die zeit i took a quick schnapps with the change lit my cigarette and went back into the restaurant as a coffee machine howled like an arctic wind i sat down stubbed out the cigarette sawed off a corner of my uneaten schnitzel and said hes in there my god said frei i dont believe it are you sure asked hamer i never forget a man whos punched me you dont think he recognised you said scheuer no i said hes wearing reading glasses and theres another pair in his top pocket my guess is hes long in one eye and short in the other a bavarianlooking wall clock struck the halfhour at the next table one of the americans pushed his chair away with the backs of his legs on the hard wooden floor of the restaurant it sounded like a drum roll so what happens now asked hamer we stick to the plan said scheuer gunther will follow him and well follow gunther he knows this city better than any of us ill need more money i said for the ubahn or a tram and if i lose you i might have to get a taxi back to ihnestrasse you wont lose us hamer smiled confidently all the same said scheuer hes right he handed me some notes and some small change i stood up are you going to sit in the bar asked frei no not unless i want him to recognise me later im going to stand outside and wait for him there in the rain thats the general idea youd best stay out of the bar we wouldnt want him to feel like he was of any interest to anyone here said frei you can borrow my hat i tried it on the hat was too big so i handed it back to him keep it i said ill stand in a doorway on the opposite side of the road and watch from there scheuer cleaned a patch of condensation from the window and well watch you from here hamer looked at my halfeaten food you germans eat too much anyway he observed ignoring him i said i follow him not you if you think ive lost him dont panic just keep your distance and dont try to find him again for me i know what im doing try to remember that i used to do this kind of thing for a living if he goes in another building then wait outside dont follow me in he might have friends looking out of a window good luck said scheuer good luck to us all i said and drained the contents of my wine glass then i went outside for the first time in a while i felt a spring in my step things were starting to work out nicely i didnt mind the rain in the least it felt good on my face refreshing i took up a position in the doorway of the sootblackened building opposite a cold doorway a policemans true station and blowing on my fingernails for want of gloves i settled in against the inside wall once a long time ago id lived not fifty or sixty metres from where i was standing in an apartment on fasanenstrasse the long hot summer of when the whole of europe breathed a collective sigh of relief because the threat of war had been averted so we had thought anyway when henry ford had finished saying history is bunk he also said that most of us preferred to live in the present and not to think about the past or words to that effect but in berlin the past was rather harder to avoid a man came down the stairs of the building and asked me for a cigarette i gave him one and for a moment or two we talked but all the time i kept one eye on the two doors of the am steinplatz at the opposite end of uhlandstrasse near the eponymous square was a hotel called the steinplatz the two establishments were owned by the same people to the confusion of all americans they even shared the same telephone number the confusion of all americans was just fine by me it stopped raining and the sun came out and a few minutes later so did my quarry he paused looked up at the clearing sky and lit a pipe which was my chance to get another good look at him he was wearing an old loden coat and a hat with a goose feather in the silk band and you could hear the nails in his shoes from the other side of the street he was stout and balding and wore a different pair of glasses now there was without a doubt a strong resemblance to erich mielke he was about the same height too he checked his flies as if hed been to the lavatory and walked south toward kant strasse after a decent interval i followed with one hand on my little knights head i felt even better now that i was walking alone well almost alone i glanced around and saw two of them frei and hamer about thirty metres behind me on opposite sides of the street i couldnt see scheuer and decided hed probably gone to fetch the car so that they wouldnt have to walk when eventually we tracked our man to his lair americans didnt like walking any more than they cared to miss a meal since id started to spend some time with them i had observed that the average american supposing that these men were average americans eats about twice as much as the average german every day on kant strasse the man turned right toward savigny platz then near the sbahn a train pulled into the elevated station above his head and he broke into a trot so did i and only just managed to buy a ticket and board the train before the doors closed and we were on our way northeast towards old moabit hamer and frei werent so lucky and just as the train pulled out i glimpsed them running up the stairs of savigny platz station i might have smiled at them too if what i was doing hadnt felt so vital to my own future and fortune i sat down and stared straight ahead and out of the window all of the old police training was kicking in again the way to follow a man without making yourself obvious mostly it was about keeping your distance and learning how to tail a man who was behind you as often as he was in front of you or as now in the adjoining carriage i could see him through the connecting window still reading his newspaper that made it easier for me of course and the thought that i was well on top of it made the discomfiture that was very likely being experienced by the amis all the more enjoyable scheuer i almost liked but hamer and frei were a different matter i especially disliked hamer if only because of his arrogance and because he seemed to have a real dislike of germans well we were used to that but it was still annoying without moving my head i rolled my eyes to one side like a ventriloquists dummy we were coming into zoo station and i was watching the newspaper in the next carriage to see if it got folded away but it stayed erect and remained that way through the stations at tiergarten and bellevue but at lehrter it finally came down and the reader stood up to disembark he went down the steps and walked north with humboldt harbour on his right several canal boats moored together in one large flotilla shifted gently on the steelblue water of the british sector on the other side of the same harbour was the charite hospital and the russian sector in the distance east german or possibly russian border guards manned a checkpoint on the junction of invalidenstrasse and the canal but we were walking north up heide strasse until we came to the french sector where we turned right along fenn strasse and onto the triangular wedding platz i paused for a moment to take in the ruins of the dankes church where i had married my first wife and then caught a last glimpse of my man as finally he went to ground in a tall building on the southern schulzendorfer strasse overlooking the old disused brewery there was little or no traffic on the square almost as bankrupt as the british the french had little money to spend regenerating german business in the area let alone for the restoration of a church that had been built in thanksgiving for the delivery of their ancient mortal enemy kaiser wilhelm i from an attempt made on his life in i approached the building on the corner of schulzendorfer strasse and glanced down chaussee strasse here the border crossing point on liesenstrasse was very close and probably just the other side of the brewery wall i looked at the names on the brass bell pulls and figured that erich stahl was close enough to erich stallmacher for our clandestine operation now to proceed as planned chapter thirtyeight berlin we moved to a small and very crummy safehouse on dreyse strasse east of moabit hospital in the british zone which scheuer said was as close to stallmachers apartment as we dared to get for the moment without tipping our hand to the russians or for that matter the french the british were told only that we were keeping a suspected blackmarketeer under surveillance the plan was simple that i being a berliner would contact the owner of the building on schulzendorfer strasse and offer to rent one of several empty apartments using my wifes maiden name the owner a retired lawyer from wilmersdorf showed me around the apartment which hed furnished himself and it was much better on the inside than it looked from the outside he explained that the building had been owned and administered by his wife martha until she had been killed by a bomb the previous year while visiting her mothers grave in oranienburg they said she never knew a thing said herr schurz a two hundred and fifty kilogram american aerial bomb had lain there for almost ten years without anyone noticing a gravedigger twenty metres away was digging and he must have hit the thing with his pickaxe thats too bad i said they say oranienburg is full of unexploded ordnance the soil is soft there you see with a hard layer of gravel underneath the bombs would penetrate the earth but not the gravel he shrugged and then shook his head apparently there were a lot of targets in oranienburg i nodded the heinkel factory and a pharmaceutical plant not to mention a suspected atomic bomb research plant are you married herr handloser no my wife also is dead she got pneumonia but shed been ill for a while so it wasnt as great a shock as what happened to your wife i went to the window and looked down onto the street this is a big apartment for someone living by himself said schurz im planning to take in a couple of tenants to help me with the rent i said if thats all right with you some gentlemen from an american bible school im pleased to hear it said schurz thats what the whole french sector needs now more americans theyre the only ones with any money talking of which i counted some banknotes into his eager hand he gave me a set of keys and then i returned to the safehouse on dreyse strasse as far as the landlord is concerned i said we can move in tomorrow you said nothing to him about stahl or stallmacher said scheuer i did exactly as you told me i didnt even ask about the neighbours so what happens now we move in and keep the place under close surveillance said scheuer wait for erich mielke to visit his dad and then go upstairs to introduce ourselves frei laughed hello were your new neighbours can we interest you in defecting to the west you and your old man what happened to the idea of making him into your spy not enough leverage our political masters want to know what the east german leadership is thinking now not what theyre thinking in a years time so we grab him and take him back to the states to debrief him youre forgetting mielkes wife gertrud arent you and doesnt he have a son now frank he wont want to leave them surely were not forgetting them at all said scheuer but i rather think that erich will from everything we know about him hes not the sentimental sort besides he can always apply for them to come to the west as well and its not like theres a wall thats stopping them from coming and if he doesnt want to defect well then thats too bad youll kidnap him thats not a word we use said scheuer the us constitution permits public policy exceptions to the normal legal process of extradition but i doubt any of this is going to matter as soon as he sees the four of us hell know the game is up and that he has no choice in the matter and when you do take him back what then scheuer grinned i dont even want to think about that until weve got him gunther mielkes the great white whale for the cia in germany we land him we get enough oil to burn in our lamps to see what were doing in this country for years to come the stasi might never recover from a blow like this it could even help us to win the cold war damn right said hamer mielkes the whole fucking ball game theres very little that bastard doesnt know about communist plans in germany will they invade will they keep to their side of the fence how far are they prepared to go to hold on to the yardage theyve already won and just how independent of moscow is the current east german leadership frei clapped me on the shoulder amicably gunther old buddy he said you help us get this bastard youre set for life do you hear by the time ike gets through thanking you my german friend youll feel more american than we do hamer frowned dont you think its time gunther should maybe get some more intel from his lady friend does mielke come on a weekend does he come at the beginning or the end of the month we could be in that apartment for weeks waiting for this kraut to show up but scheuer was shaking his head no its best we leave things as they are besides i think gunthers already tested the limit of his friendship with this lady if he asks her any more questions about mielke shes just liable to start wondering who hes more interested in him or her and i wouldnt want her to become jealous jealous women do unpredictable things he went to the window of the safehouse drew back a greywhite length of net curtain and looked out as an ambulance raced up bendlerstrasse to the hospital its bell ringing furiously that reminds me said scheuer he turned to look at frei did you get hold of that ambulance yes its not for us scheuer glanced at me its for the package you mean mielke thats right but from now on we never use that name not until hes on a private wing at the us army hospital in lichterfelde i suppose youll give him thiopental too i said only if we have to aint like its rationed said frei hamer laughed not for us anyway by the way i said feel free to pay me any day soon youll get your lousy money said hamer ive heard that before i shot a sarcastic smile hamers way and then looked at scheuer look all i am asking is that i see a letter from the kind of swiss bank that treats you like just another number and all i want is whats mine and where did that come from said hamer none of your goddamn business but since you ask so politely hamer i won it gambling in havana you can pay me the twentyfive thousand as a bonus if and when you collect the package gambling yeah sure when i was arrested in cuba i had a receipt to prove that so did the ss when they robbed the jews said hamer if youre suggesting thats how i came by my money youre wrong the way youre wrong about nearly everything hamer youll get your money said scheuer dont worry about it everything is in hand i nodded not because i believed him but because i wanted him to believe that money was what motivated me now when it wasnt not any more i squeezed the black knight in my trouser pocket and determined to imitate its action on the chessboard to move obliquely one square to the side before jumping two squares forward in a closed position what else could i do chapter thirtynine berlin the following afternoon with our bags and suitcases packed mine was the smallest we prepared to leave the pension in dreyse strasse and move into the apartment on schulzendorfer strasse none of us were sorry to be out of there the landlady owned several cats and these were not much inclined to piss out of doors even with the windows open the place smelled like an old peoples home we filled a newishlooking vw transporter van with ourselves and our luggage and our equipment scheuer drove with me sitting in the passenger seat and giving directions while hamer and frei rolled around in the back with the bags complaining loudly following at a distance was the ambulance containing what scheuer called security cia muscle with guns and shortwave radios according to scheuers plan the ambulance would park a short distance away from schulzendorfer strasse and when the time came these men were ready to help us grab erich mielke i told scheuer to drive north onto perleberger strasse intending to go across the canal on fennbrucke but an old building on the corner of quitzowstrasse had collapsed across the road and we were obliged by the local police and the fire brigade to go south down heide strasse wed better not cross the canal on invalidenstrasse i told scheuer for obvious reasons invalidenstrasse on the east side of the canal was the ddr and a new looking transporter filled with americans not to mention an ambulance filled with armed men was certain to attract unwelcome attention from the grepos go west on invalidenstrasse until youre on old moabit and then right up rathenower strasse well have to cross the canal on the fohrer bridge if its still there its been a while since i was up this way every time i come to berlin it looks different from the last time i was here scheuer shouted at the two in the back thats why gunther has the seat he said so he can tell us where to go i know where id like to tell him to go grumbled hamer scheuer grinned at me he doesnt like you he said thats okay i said i feel the same way about him on rathenower we drove past a large grim starshaped building on our left whats that he asked moabit prison i said and the other building he meant the great semiruined building just north of the prison a huge fortress of an edifice that ran west along turm strasse for almost a hundred metres that i smiled that is where this whole lousy story began its the central criminal court back in may there were police cars parked the length of the street and cops everywhere inside and outside the building but mostly outside because that was where most of the nazi storm troopers were gathered a couple of thousand of them maybe more and newspapermen crowded around the big doors of the entrance an important trial was in progress huh the eden dance palace trial i said actually it was a routine sort of case four nazis had tried to murder some communists in a dance hall back in that was almost an everyday occurrence no it was the witness for the prosecution that made the case so noteworthy and why there were so many cops and nazis on the scene the witness was adolf hitler and the prosecution lawyer wanted to show that hitler was the malign force behind this kind of nazioncommunist violence hitler was always publicly affirming his commitment to law and order and the prosecution wanted to show this up for a lie so hitler was summoned to testify you were there yes but i was more interested in the four defendants and what they might have to say about another murder that i was investigating but i saw him yes who knew it would be the only occasion on which hitler would have to answer for his crimes before a court of law he arrived in court wearing a blue suit and for several minutes he played the good law abiding citizen but gradually as the questioning continued he began to contradict himself and then to lose his temper the sa he claimed was forbidden to commit or to provoke any violence many of his answers even provoked laughter in the spectators gallery and finally after giving evidence for almost four hours hitler lost all composure and started to rant at the lawyer questioning him who happened to be a jew now under german law the oath is given after testimony not before and when hitler swore to the truth of his evidence that he was pursuing legal democratic methods to gain political power there were very few who believed him i know i didnt it was plain to anyone who was there that hitler was absolutely complicit in sa violence and i suppose you could say that this was the minute when i realised for sure that i could never be a nazi and follow an obvious liar like hitler so what did you mean when you said that this was where the story began mielkes story or rather my mielke story if i hadnt been to the central criminal court that day i might not have thought it worth while to go to tegel prison a couple of weeks later to question one of the four sa defendants and if i hadnt gone to tegel that day i might never have seen some sa men piling out of a bar in charlottenburg and followed them in which case id never have seen erich mielke or saved his life thats what i mean given everything that happened afterwards said hamer wed all have been a lot better off if youd just let him get killed but that would mean id never have had the pleasure of your acquaintance agent hamer i said less of the agent gunther said scheuer from now on were all of us just gentlemen okay does that include herr hamer keep riding me gunther you arrogant german bastard said hamer and see where it gets you i almost hope erich mielke doesnt come just to bring you down a size or two not to mention the pleasure of seeing you come up short on twenty five thousand bucks hell come i said how do you really know that said hamer because he loves his father of course i wouldnt expect you to understand something like that hamer youd have to know who your father is to love him hamer said scheuer im ordering you not to answer that and gunther thats enough he pointed at the road ahead where now left on quitzow strasse and then right onto putlitz strasse we drove west with the ringbahn on our right keeping pace with the little red and yellow train that clattered toward putlitzstrasse station moving along the green verge and overgrown track like two snooker balls the red brick station with its tall arched window and tower was more medieval abby than rail terminus dusk was fast approaching and under the weak greenish gaze on the prayingmantis street lamps of the foherer bruche we drove into wedding with its textile works breweries and massive electronics factories wedding had once been i he industrial heart of berlin and a communist stronghold back in fortythree per cent of wedding voters many of them soon to be made unemployed by the great depression had voted for the kpd once it had been one of the most overcrowded bezirks in berlin now with long winter nights fast approaching and no sign of the economic revival that had come to the american sector wedding looked almost deserted as if all had been taken away to the ships of the conquerors in truth berlin had always gone to bed early especially in winter but never in the late afternoon scheuer hammered the steering wheel with excitement as he turned us onto trift strasse i cant believe were really gonna get this guy he said were gonna get mielke fuck yeah said frei and whooped loudly the three of them sounded like a basketball team trying to rouse themselves for an important game if only you knew gunther said scheuer what this guy is capable of he likes to torture people himself did you know that i shook my head les bauer continued scheuer a party member since he was arrested in and mielke beat him like a dog the russians sentenced bauer to death and the only reason hes still alive is because stalin is dead and kurt muller head of the kpd in lower saxony the stasi lured him to east berlin for a party meeting and then accused him of being a trotskyite mielke tortured him too poor muller has spent the last four years in solitary confinement in the stasis own prison at halle the red ox they call it and you dont want to know what mielkes done to the cia agents theyve caught mielkes a real gestapo type they say he has a bust of felix dzerzhinsky in his office you know the first bolshevik secret police chief believe me this guy mielke makes your friend heydrich look like an amateur if we get mielke we can cripple the whole stasi id heard it or something like it before and i hardly cared this was their war not mine probably the stasi thought the cia fascists were just as bad as we neared the end of trift strasse i told scheuer to turn right onto miiller strasse thats wedding platz just ahead i said approaching the apartment building on the corner of schulzenstrasse hamer kneeling behind us said what a dump i cant imagine why anyone would want to swap a cottage in schonwalde to live here scheuer who had been to the apartment himself said really its not so bad inside well i dont get it i shrugged thats because youre not a berliner hamer erich mielkes father has lived in and around this area all his life its in the bone like the allegiance to a tribe or a gang for an old berlin communist like stallmacher this is the centre of german communism not police headquarters in east berlin and i wouldnt be at all surprised if he has some old friends who live in these very streets thats a big thing for berliners community i dont expect you get that much where you come from you have to trust your neighbours in order to be neighbourly scheuer stopped the van and turned in his seat a few metres away the ambulance containing our security came to a halt all right listen up said scheuer this is a stakeout and we could be here for a while until erich junior shows up no one mentions the company once again theres to be no company names and no company language and nobody uses profanity from now on were members of an american bible school and the first thing we take out of this van is a box of bibles okay lets go and get this bastard but as we entered the building and trooped up the stone stairs i almost hoped that erich mielke wouldnt come at all and that everything might stay the same as before my heart was beating loudly now was it just the effort of climbing two flights of stairs with a box of bibles in my arms or something else in my imagination i already saw the scene that lay ahead of us and felt a twinge of regret i told myself that if only id remained in cuba i would never have landed in the hands of the cia and all of this might have been avoided that even now i might have been reading a book in my apartment on malecon or enjoying the pleasures that were to be had in omaras body at the casa marina was mister greene still there juggling breasts sometimes we just dont know when were well off and for the first time in a long time i wondered about poor melba marron the little rebel chica whod shot the sailor on my boat was she in an american prison for her sake i hoped so or was she back in havana and at the mercy of the corrupt local police as she had feared in which case she might very likely be dead what was i doing here why did you have to suggest bibles hamer grunted loudly as he put the box hed been carrying down on the landing outside the firstfloor apartments door he looked at the door with obvious displeasure you sure about this place gunther ive seen betterlooking slums than this place actually i said theres a very nice view of the gasworks from the sitting room window but in my imagination i saw only the cia surrounding mielke as he arrived to visit his father and i heard only their snarling pleasure as they bundled him into the apartment snapped handcuffs on his wrists hauled a canvas bag over his head and tripped him onto the floor maybe they would kick and abuse him the same way i had been kicked and abused until something in me had broken the way they had wanted it broken and i realised that i had at last become the thing that i abhorred that i had crossed an invisible line of decency and honour i was about to become the fascist id always detested stop complaining said scheuer glancing anxiously up the stairs at the landing above where he believed erich stallmachers apartment was located i found the set of keys given to me by the landlord and slid one into the strong dom lock the key turned and i pushed at the heavy grey door a strong smell of floor polish greeted our nostrils as we entered our apartment i waited in the largish hallway until the last of the amis was inside and then closed the door then i locked it carefully what the fuck agent hamers voice contained a tremor agent scheuer turned back to the locked door and was felled by a blow from a makarov pistol to the back of the head agent frei was already in handcuffs his face was pale and worriedlooking there were six of them waiting for us in the apartment they wore cheap grey suits and dark shirts and ties all of them were armed with pistols soviet automatics with cheap plastic handles but no less deadly for that their faces were impassive as if they too were made of cheap russian plastic manufactured in quantity by some factory stolen from germany and then reassembled on an eastern shore of the volga just as cold as that river were their greyblue eyes and for a moment i saw myself in them policemen doing their duty taking no pleasure in these arrests but handling them quickly and with the efficiency of welltrained professionals the three americans might have said something but their mouths were already stuffed with cloth and taped tight so that i only had their watery eyes to reproach me although these were no less bitter for that i might have said something too but for the fact that the handcuffed men were already being marched downstairs each between two stasi men as if they were being led to a firing squad if i had spoken to them i might have adduced the months of illtreatment i had endured at their hands not to mention my desire to be away from their control and influence but it hardly seemed appropriate or for that matter proportionate to what id now inflicted on them i might even have mentioned something about the unquestioning assumption of all americans that they had right on their side even when they were doing wrong and the irritation that the rest of the world felt at being judged by them but that would have been to overstate the matter on my part it wasnt so much that i did not care to be judged for a german in the fifties that was perhaps unavoidable it was simply that i did not care to be grateful for whatever it was the amis were supposed to have done for us when it was abundantly clear to me and many other germans that really they had done it for themselves and hadnt they intended some rather similar treatment for mielke himself where is he i asked one of the stasi men if you mean the comrade general said the man he is waiting outside i followed them out of the apartment and downstairs wondering how they were going to deal with the security men in the cia ambulance or had they already dealt with them but before we reached the ground floor we went through a door that led out of the back of the building and down a fire escape to a courtyard that was about the size of a tennis court and enclosed on all four sides by tall black tenements most of them derelict we crossed the courtyard and in fading light went through a low wooden door in the wall of the old schulzendorfer brewery underfoot the cobbles were loose and in some places there were large potholes filled with water the moon rippled in one of them like a lost silver coin the three americans did not resist and to my experienced eyes they already seemed to have acquired the compliant demeanour of pows with bowed heads and heavy stumbling footsteps a small tributary stream of the river spree marked the edge of the narrowing courtyard at its southern end was a building with broken dirty windows and tall weeds growing on the roof painted on the brickwork was a faded advertisement for chlorodont toothpaste id have needed a whole tube of the stuff to get rid of the nasty taste i had in my mouth within the word tooth was a door which one of the stasi men opened we went into a building that smelt of damp and probably something worse advancing to one of the filthy windows the team leader looked carefully out onto a street he waited cautiously for almost five minutes and having checked his watch produced a torch which he then aimed at the building opposite almost immediately his signal was answered by three short flashes of a small green light and across the street a door opened the three american prisoners were hustled across and it was only when i put my own head out of the door that i realised we were on liesenstrasse and that the building on the opposite side of the street was in the russian sector as the last of the three americans was pushed across the road in the allenveloping darkness and on into the building i saw a portly figure standing in the doorway he looked up and down the street and then waved to me come he said come quickly it was erich mielke chapter forty berlin he was shorter than i remembered and stockier too a powerful man who was square on his feet with the air of a pugilist his hair was short and thin and so was his mouth which made an attempt at a smile only it came off as something sardonic or whatever it is you call it when a man can laugh at things that other people dont find in the least bit amusing come he repeated its all right youre in no danger the voice was deeper and also more gravelly than i remembered but the accent was much the same as it had always been an uneducated and truculent berliner i didnt give much for the chances of the three americans when they were interrogated by this man i looked both ways on liesenstrasse the cias security ambulance was nowhere to be seen and it would probably be hours before they worked out that the team of agents they were supposed to be guarding had been kidnapped right under their noses i had to admit the stasi operation had been as neat as a freshly laid egg true it had been my own plan but it had been mielkes idea to supply an actual east german border guard who looked like his own father for the cia to follow around and lead them to the apartment on schulzendorfer strasse where the stasi kidnap team would be waiting the street was clear but in the darkness i still hesitated to cross a little impatience edged into mielkes voice we berliners could get impatient with a newborn baby come on gunther he said if you had anything to fear from me youd be in handcuffs like these three fascists or dead and recognising the truth of this i walked across the street mielke wore a midblue suit that appeared to be of much better quality than the suits worn by his men certainly his shoes were more expensive these looked handmade a navy knitted tie look neat against a light blue shirt his raincoat was probably british he was standing in the doorway of an old florists shop the windows were boarded up but on a floor strewn with broken glass there was a lantern that gave enough light to see vases filled with petrified flowers or no flowers at all through an open door at the back of the shop was a yard and parked at the end of the yard was a plain grey van which i imagined already contained the three american agents the shop smelt of weeds and cat piss a bit like the pension we had vacated earlier mielke closed the door and put on a leather cap that added a properly proletarian touch to his appearance although there was a big heavy padlock he didnt secure the door for which i was grateful he was younger than me and probably armed and i wouldnt have cared to fight my way out of there we sat down on a couple of ancient wooden chairs that belonged in an old church hall i like your office i said its very convenient for the french sector he said the security here is almost nonexistent and its the perfect spot to slip back and forth between our sector and theirs without anyone knowing about it but oddly enough i can remember coming into this florists shop as a kid you never struck me as the romantic type he shook his head theres a cemetery along the street one of my old mans relations is buried there dont ask me who i cant remember he produced a packet of rothhandel and offered me one i dont smoke myself he said but i figured your nerves might be gone very thoughtful of you keep the packet i pulled a little bit of tobacco out of the cigarettes smoking end and pinched it tight between thumb and forefinger the way you did when you didnt really like the taste i didnt but a smoke was a smoke what will happen to them the three amis do you really care about them to my surprise yes i shrugged you can call it a guilty conscience if you like he shrugged theyll have a pretty rough time of it while we find out what they know but eventually well exchange them for some of our own people theyre much too valuable to send to the guillotine if thats what you were thinking you dont still do that surely the guillotine why not its quick he grinned cruelly a bullet is a bit of a letoff for our enemies of state but its a lot quicker than the electric chair last year it took ethel rosenberg twenty minutes to die they say her head caught fire before she died so you tell me which is more humane the two seconds it takes for the axe to fall or twenty minutes in the sing sing chair he shook his head again but no your three americans they wont be waiting for a delivery of bread seeing my puzzled expression he added so as not to cause our citizenry undue alarm we send our falling axe around the ddr in a bread van from the bakery in halle wholegrain bread its better for you same old erich you always did have a strange sense of humour i remember once on a train to dresden i nearly died laughing i think you had the last laugh on that occasion i was impressed with the way you handled things he wasnt an easy man to kill that russian but i was rather more impressed with the way you handled everything afterwards how you gave that money to elisabeth to be honest until i got your letter i had no idea that you and she had ever become that friendly either way i suspect most men would have kept the money for themselves and it made me think said mielke i asked myself what kind of man would do such a thing obviously a man who was not the predictable fascist i had thought he was a man of hidden qualities a man who might even be useful to me you wouldnt be aware of this but three or four years ago i actually tried to get in contact with you gunther to do a job for me and i discovered youd disappeared i even heard youd gone to south america like all those other nazi bastards so when elisabeth turned up at my office in hohenschonhausen with your letter i was very pleasantly surprised but even more surprised when i read the letter and by the sheer audacity of your proposal if i may say so it was a real spymasters stratagem and you have my compliments on pulling it off and whats more right under the noses of the americans thats almost the best part they wont forgive you for that in a hurry i said nothing there wasnt much to say so i sucked at my cigarette and waited for the end that part was as yet undecided what would he do keep his side of the bargain as he had promised in his own letter to me or doublecross me like before and what else did i really deserve me the man who had just betrayed three other men of course elisabeths the reason i knew i could really trust you gunther if youd truly been a creature of the americans you would have told them where she lived and theyd have had her placed under surveillance with the aim of burning me burning its what we call it when you let someone someone in intelligence circles know that you know everything about them and that their whole life has gone up in smoke burning or for that matter when you dont let them know well then i guess theyd already tried to burn you some of what i now said i had already told him in the letter that elisabeth had delivered how the cia had coached me to sell the french sdece the idea that mielke had been first a spy for the nazis and then a spy for the cia at the same time leading them to suppose that i might be able to identify a french traitor named edgard de boudel who had worked for the viet minh in indochina but mostly i told him again as a way of getting the answers to a few questions of my own the amis had the idea that theres a communist spy at the heart of french intelligence and that he might be more inclined to believe what i told them about you playing both sides by my proving reliable in identifying edgard de boudel as he arrived back in friedland as a returnee from a soviet pow camp but the amis canned that idea when you told them that you thought you had figured out a way of them getting their hands on me in person said mielke is that right i nodded which probably leaves your reputation undamaged lets hope so eh is there a spy at the heart of french intelligence several admitted mielke you might just as well ask if there are any communists in france or if edgard de boudel really did fight for the german ss and then the viet minh and did he oh yes and its a shame the americans should have told the french about him now someone in gvl gehlens new intelligence organisation must have told them you see we had a deal with the gvl and chancellor adenauer that the german government would allow edgard de boudel back into germany in return for allowing one of ours back its like this de boudel has inoperable cancer but the poor fellow wants to die in his native france and this seemed to be the best way of doing it to sneak him back into germany as part of a pow repatriation and then into france without anyone objecting theres not much love lost between the cia and gehlens gvl i said it would seem not the german son seems to have turned his back on his american father yes indeed said mielke its odd but you and elisabeth are about the only two people who even know about my own father so that was a real stroke of genius my friend because as it happens a lot of what you imagined might be true is true we dont really see each other much any more does he live in the east in potsdam but hes always complaining odd how your suggestion of him coming back to live in west berlin is so nearly true but then you are a berliner you know how these things are ive got no friends in potsdam he says thats always the big complaint look pa i say theres nothing to stop you from going into west berlin and seeing your mates and coming home again incidentally the mates his mates they thought i was dead thats what i told pa to tell them as early as i say see your friends quietly in the west and live quietly in the east its not like theres a wall or anything of course since the inner border was closed hes started to suspect the same would happen here in berlin that hell be trapped on the wrong side mielke sighed and there are other reasons father and son reasons is your old man still alive no did you get on with him when he was no i smiled sadly we never learned how then you know what its like my father is a very oldfashioned kind of german communist and believe me theyre the worst it was the workers strike of last year that really did it for him troublemakers most of them some of them counterrevolutionaries a few of them cia provocateurs but pa didnt see it that way at all i flicked my cigarette onto the ground and was leaving it there but mielke ground it under the heel of his handmade shoe as if it had been the head of a counterrevolutionary since were being honest with each other he said theres something i dont understand go ahead why you did it why you betrayed them to me youre not a communist any more than you were a nazi so why you asked me a question like that before dont you remember oh i remember i didnt understand it then either you might say that after spending six months in one american prison after another i began to hate them you might say that but it wouldnt be true of course the best lies contain some truth so thats not entirely false then you might say that i dont share their world view and that wouldnt be entirely false in some ways i admire them but i also dislike the way they dont ever seem to live up to their own ideals i think i might like the amis a lot more if they were like everyone else one might forgive them more but they preach about the magnificence of their fucking democracy and the enduring power of their constitutional freedoms while at the same time theyre trying to fuck your wife and steal your watch when i was a cop we gave the people of whom more was expected severer sentences when they turned out to be crooks lawyers policemen politicians people in positions of responsibility americans are like them theyre the crooks who should know better but you might also say im tired of the whole damned business for twenty years ive been obliged to work for people i didnt like heydrich the sd the nazis the cic the perons the mafia the cuban secret police the french the cia all i want to do is read the newspaper and play chess but how do you know im not going to oblige you to work for me mielke chuckled since you sent that letter to me youre halfway to working for the stasi right now i wont work for you erich any more than ill work for them if you make me ill find a way to betray you and suppose i threaten to have you shot or send you to prison to await a delivery of wholemeal bread what then ive asked myself this question suppose i said he threatens to kill you unless you work for the stasi well i decided that id rather die at the hands of my own countrymen than get rich in the pay of some foreigners i dont expect you to understand that erich but thats how it is so go ahead and do your worst of course i understand mielke smacked himself proudly on the chest before everything else i am a german a berliner like you of course i understand so for once i am going to keep my word to a fascist you still think im a fascist then you dont know it yourself but thats what you are gunther he tapped his head in here you may not ever have joined the nazi party but in your mind you believe in centralised authority and the right and the law and you dont believe in the left to me a fascist is all youll ever be but i have an idea that elisabeth has some hopes of you and because of my high regard for her my love for her you as a sister yes i smiled mielke looked surprised yes why do you smile i shook my head forget it but i love people he said i love all people thats why i became a communist i believe you he frowned and then tossed me a set of car keys as we arranged elisabeth has quit her apartment and is waiting for you at the steinplatz hotel so say hello from me and make sure you look after that woman if you dont ill send an assassin to kill you just see if i dont someone better than the last one elisabeths the only reason im letting you go gunther her happiness is more important to me than my political principles thanks theres a car on grenz street go right and then left youll see a grey type one in the glove box youll find two passports in your new names im afraid we had to use your picture from your time as a pleni there are visas money and air tickets my advice would be to use them the amis arent stupid gunther nor are the french theyll each come looking for you both so get out of berlin get out of germany get out while the going is good it was good advice i lit another cigarette and then left without another word i turned right out of the shop and walked around the edge of the cemetery all of the graves were gone and in the misty darkness it wasnt much more than a greylooking field was it just the tombs and the headstones that were gone or had the corpses been moved too nothing ever lasted the way it was supposed to last not any more not in berlin mielke was right it was time for me to move on too just like those other berlin corpses the volkswagen beetle was where mielke had said it would be the glove box contained a large thick manila envelope on the dashboard was mounted a little vase and in it were some small flowers i saw it and i laughed maybe mielke did like people after all but i still checked the engine and underneath the chassis for a car bomb i wouldnt have put it past him to send funeral flowers before i was actually dead as it happens those are the only kind of funeral flowers ive ever really liked
