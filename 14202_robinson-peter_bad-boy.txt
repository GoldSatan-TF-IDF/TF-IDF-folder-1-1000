peter robinson bad boy book in the inspector banks series to sheila by the end of august the waterlogged yorkshire countryside was a symphony of green and gold under a blue sky scribbled with white clouds heaven only knew how the farmers had managed to mow and bale the hay as the rain seemed to have been falling for days without end but somehow they had succeeded and their neat straw cylinders dotted the fields bright tractors plowed in the stubble and turned the earth a dark fecund brown smells of the recent harvest and of the coming autumn chill mingled in the mild air on the moors the purple heather was in bloom by the roadside swallows gathered on the telephone wires preparing for their long flight to south africa annie cabbot wished she could go with them as she drove the last few miles to work that monday morning a few days on a game reserve would do her the world of good photographing and sketching giraffes zebras leopards lions and elephants then perhaps a tour of the winelands a taste of fine cape town cuisine and night life but it was not to be she had exhausted her entire holiday allowance for the year apart from a few days which she planned to use to create occasional long weekends between now and christmas besides she couldnt afford to go to south africa she would be hardpushed to pay for a minibreak in blackpool lucky swallows the traffic came to a halt about half a mile from the big roundabout on the southern edge of eastvale and when annie finally got close enough to see the fender bender that was causing the delay she was already late for work a patrol car had arrived at the accident scene so she felt she could safely leave the uniformed officers to deal with the obvious case of road rage between the two drivers who were standing by their cars shouting at each other fists raised traffic wasnt her department annie made her way through the increasingly builtup and busy streets around the college where a few late summer students strolled across the green to morning lectures rucksacks slung over their shoulders from there she cut down a long narrow street of threestory redbrick victorian houses mostly converted into student flats over to market street when she reached the market square she took the narrow lane between the buildings and parked at the back of the tudorfronted police station she said hello to a couple of officers she recognized standing outside sneaking a quick smoke break then swiped her card in the slot on the back door and entered western area headquarters a couple of people greeted her when she walked into the major crimes squad room geraldine masterson their new probationary detective constable told her that winsome jackman and doug wilsonknown to most of his colleagues as harry potter due to his uncanny resemblance to daniel radcliffewere already out interviewing witnesses to last nights hitandrun on the lyndgarth road the incident had left two teenagers in hospital and one no doubt very shaken driver holed up at home just waiting for the knock on the door wishing he hadnt had that one last drink for the road annie had hardly made a dent in the accumulated paperwork when her phone rang she put down her pen and picked up the handset di cabbot it was the desk sergeant someone to see dci banks he said a mrs doyle there was a moments pause while the sergeant appeared to be conferring with the visitor their voices muffled mrs juliet doyle he went on she says she knows the dci says its urgent annie sighed all right she said send her up might as well have someone show her to dci bankss office its a bit more private there will do maam annie closed the thick folder of crime statistics on her desk and walked down the corridor to bankss office the few occasions she had been in there recently had unnerved her even more than her brief visits to his cottage to water the plants take in any parcels and flyers and make sure all was well bankss absence seemed even more palpable in the cool silence and the slight musty smell of his office his desk was empty except for the computer which hadnt been switched on in ages a cd playerradio combination stood silent on one of his bookshelves next to a couple of tattered kingsley amis paperbacks hed picked up from the secondhand bookshop in the market square a few days before he had left annie moved the computer monitor aside so that she would have an unobstructed view of the person sitting opposite her a young pc knocked at the door and showed the woman in i thought this was alans office juliet doyle said it has his name on the door who are you i dont mean to seem rude but i specifically asked to see alan she seemed nervous annie thought her movements jerky and birdlike as she took in the sparse room dci banks is on holiday annie explained standing up and extending her hand im di annie cabbot can i help you ii dont know i was expecting alan this is all so juliet fingered the chain around her neck a heavy goldandjade pendant hung from it in the lightly freckled cleft between her breasts she was probably in her midforties annie guessed smartly dressed her clothes definitely not from any of the shops you would find in the swainsdale centre more likely harrogate or york wavy blond hair with dark brown roots tasteful makeup still attractive and not concerned about showing a little cleavage her skirt was a modest kneelength legs nicely tapered beneath it and she wore a tan suede jacket in an elegant hourglass cut annie wondered if she fancied banks if there had been something between them please sit down annie said after a slight hesitation juliet perched at the edge of the chair opposite her is it anything i can help you with or was it something personal thats why i was hoping to see alan juliet went on you see its both really oh this is so difficult when will he be back not until next week im afraid juliet doyle seemed to consider this for a few moments still fidgeting with her chain as if debating whether the matter could wait that long would you like some tea coffee annie asked no thank you i cant help you if i dont know what its about annie went on you say its both police business and personal is that right juliet nodded thats why its so hard i mean alan would understand she had shifted her attentions from the necklace to the chunky diamond ring on the third finger of her left hand twisting it around and around her fingernails were bitten low and painted pink why dont you try me annie said just tell me what the problem is alan would know what to do annie leaned back in the chair and linked her hands behind her head she felt as if she was in for a long haul perhaps you could start by telling me exactly what your relationship is with dci banks juliet appeared startled relationship we dont have a relationship i simply meant how you came to know one another oh that i see yes im sorry were neighbors were annie happened to know that banks had no neighbors anywhere close to his gratly cottage so she assumed that juliet doyle was referring to the past perhaps when he had lived on laburnum way about a mile down market street from the police station but banks hadnt lived there for ten years had they kept in touch all that time was there something she was missing when was this she asked when he and sandra were still together i still think its so tragic that they parted like that dont you such a lovely couple yes said annie whose only experiences of sandra had been humiliating and more than a little frightening anyway juliet went on we were friends and neighbors thats why i thought he might be able to help me mrs doyle said annie if this is a police matter you really should tell me are you in some sort of trouble juliet flinched as if shed been tapped on the shoulder by surprise trouble me no of course not then what is it juliet scanned the office as if she suspected banks were hiding behind a filing cabinet or in a cupboard are you sure alans not here positive i told you hes on his holidays juliet twisted her diamond ring again and let the silence stretch just when annie was about to get up and show her the door she blurted out its about erin erin yes our daughter me and my husband that is patrick he sent me hes stopping home with erin is erin in trouble i suppose she is yes you dont know what they get up to do you do you have any children no well you wouldnt know then its too easy to blame the parents the way they do in the papers and on television but when you just dont know she let the sentence trail im going to ring for some tea said annie the good old english panacea she thought as she picked up the phone and asked for a pot to be sent up a nice cup of teathis was clearly going to take some time and if juliet doyle didnt need a cuppa annie certainly did maybe theyd bring chocolate digestives too if she was lucky erin lives in leeds juliet said in headingley hardly a den of iniquity you might say but youd be surprised like most big cities it can be a dangerous place if youre not careful said annie but i must tell you were north yorkshire if the problem is in leeds then you need to no no thats not it you dont understand of course i dont understand annie thought gritting her teeth id have to be a bloody mind reader to understand tell me then she said the tea arrived a welcome interruption no chocolate digestives though normally annie would have asked or made some sort of comment to the young pc who brought in the tray but it wouldnt do to take up a petty issue like the lack of chocolate biscuits with juliet doyle sitting opposite her erins a good girl i think she must have fallen in with a bad crowd said juliet accepting the cup annie handed her adding milk and sugar with slightly shaking hands how old is she twentyfour working yes as a waitress its a nice restaurant very upmarket down in the calls with all those fancy new boutique hotels and waterfront flats and she makes decent enough money but even so she shrugged its not what you expected for her not with a good upper second in psychology times are hard perhaps shes just waiting for the right job to come along id like to think so but what well i think shes more likely been wasting her time its been two years now since she got her degree she took a gap year before she went does she have a boyfriend as far as i know she still does said juliet not that weve met him or even that shes told us much about him mostly we keep in touch through phone calls texts you know what the young are like the last thing they think of sometimes is visiting their parents unless they need something or its a special occasion young people can be very secretive annie agreed shes a grown woman i was married when i was her age but times change said annie kids arent so quick to leave the nest these days erins not a parasite if thats what you mean she was happy enough to get away from home in the first place couldnt get out fast enough that wasnt the problem then what is annie said close to the end of her patience she was beginning to think that this was some sort of domestic matter and she was starting to feel resentful that she wasnt only left to do bankss job while he was away but handle his personal problems too why are you here what did you think alan could do for you juliets back stiffened hed know what to do wouldnt he about what annie knew she was almost shouting but she couldnt help herself about the gun said juliet doyle head bowed speaking so softly that annie could barely hear her she has a gun tell me how it happened detective superintendent catherine gervaise was sitting on the edge of her desk with her arms folded and the way she towered over annie and juliet doyle made annie feel as if they were two truant schoolgirls brought up before the headmistress gervaise could have that effect when she wanted annie had her notebook open and her pen in her hand waiting no matter what action the situation warranted there was likely to be a lot of red tape ahead and she had to get it down right i was dusting and cleaning her room juliet began honestly i wasnt prying erin was downstairs watching breakfast television i like to keep a neat and clean house and it was my morning to do the upstairs so i didnt see any harm in it so erin still lives at home gervaise asked no as i told ms cabbot here she lives in leeds would you give us the address please of course juliet gave an address in headingley and annie wrote it down she knew the area and recognized the street name what is she doing in eastvale sheshe didnt really say what did she say just that she needed to come home for a while i thought she might have split up with her boyfriend or something did you ask her if she had yes but she just told me to mind my own business she isnt usually so rude we brought her up to be polite and respectful to her elders but shes upset i thought if i left her alone she would tell me what was bothering her eventually she usually does are you very close i wouldnt say very close but i like to think that we are close yes that she feels she can talk to me tell me anything thats why it was such a shock finding the gun what do you know about her boyfriend just what she told me on the phone really whats his name geoff i dont know his last name they only use first names dont they how long has she been going out with him about six months do you think hes been a bad influence on her quite the opposite really from what she says hes a nice lad and hes done very well for himself not like her usual scruffy student types and i must say ive noticed a great change for the better in her appearance on the few occasions i have seen her since theyve been together like what her dress sense for a start her whole style much smarter for so long she dressed like a typical student but she turned up for her dads birthday in a nice summer frock with a lovely heart pendant around her neck she never used to wear jewelery unless it was the cheap kind plastic colored beads and the like shes had her hair done too you can tell she went to a good hairdresser its a professional job when was this july the thirtieth do you know what this geoff does for a living hes in sales and marketing thats all i know and hes got a company car a bmw sounds like a good catch said gervaise what was erin like when she came back home what was her state of mind you said she was upset yes she seemed distant distracted quiet and withdrawn is that like her no shes usually quite normal when it comes to conversation and such always has been cheerful quick to smile gregarious even but this time shes been acting like a hermit staying in her room did she ask you for any help at all juliet frowned what do you mean what sort of help financial emotional medical anything could she be in trouble you mean pregnant its a possibility said gervaise though that wasnt what i meant specifically would she have been able to talk to you about something like that id like to think so how long has she been back here in eastvale since friday morning we kept her room always just as it was well tidier lots of parents do that gervaise said it offsets the sense of loss when their children leave home sometimes its hard to let go annie knew that the superintendent had two children of her own though it was hard to imagine it at the moment as she perched there in her pinstripe skirt buttonedup jacket and crisp white blouse all business yes said juliet did you get the impression that this time its more than a passing visit definitely and is this the first time shes come to stay for any length of time since she left home yes gervaise paused now about the gun you found on top of the wardrobe she went on it was near the back where you couldnt possibly see it unless you stood on a chair or a stepladder it was wrapped in a tea cloth i suppose she thought it was safe up there i mean she doesnt really think about housework or anything like that it would have been if it hadnt been for your thoroughness said gervaise you did the right thing coming to us mrs doyle i dont know juliet said shaking her head my own daughter i feel like such ajudas what will happen to her annie had deeply conflicted feelings toward juliet doyle at that moment on the one hand the poor woman was turning in her own daughter and she must be going through hell whether juliet was aware of it or not annie knew there was a mandatory five year sentence for possession of a handgun and the courts tended to be strict in its application though there had recently been some complaints about overly lenient judges perhaps they would take special circumstances into account for a young woman with no prior record but however forgiving they were erin doyle was looking at a prison sentence of some sort rather than probation or community service and she would come out with a criminal record juliet probably didnt suspect this still annie reminded herself as yet they had absolutely no evidence that erin doyle was guilty of anything its a very serious matter gervaise went on guns are dangerous weapons and the more we get off the streets the safer our towns and cities will be it was the party line annie knew and gervaise was clearly trying to make juliet feel more at ease with her betrayal feel like a rightthinking citizen but annie sensed that juliet doyle was getting seriously worried now and beginning to regret that she had come she was probably thinking that she and her husband could have dealt with the whole mess themselves disposed of the gun chucked it in the river given erin a good talking to in a way annie thought she was right for a mother to take such a step was almost inconceivable to annie no matter how much police policy encouraged it or how much as an officer of the law and a campaigner against gun crime she was supposed to applaud it while a part of her admired juliets sacrifice to duty to the greater good another part of her felt disgust for what the woman was doing though annie had never raised a child herself she didnt think she would be capable of betraying her daughter she was certain that her own mother would never have done such a thing though she had died when annie was very young her father would have given her a stern talking to and thrown the gun in the sea but he would never have turned her in to the police either but she reminded herself juliet doyle had come here asking for bankss help no doubt she had hoped that he would have been able to deal with the matter unofficially off the record what happens now juliet asked gervaise moved away from the edge of her desk and went to sit behind it she didnt seem quite so imposing there and annie felt the atmosphere lighten a little there are procedures to be followed gervaise said where is the gun now in the kitchen patrick has it we didnt think it would be a good idea for me to carry it in the street and i must admit the idea made me very nervous and your daughter shes with him we agreed this was the best way they would stay at the house i would come here and talk to alan ask him to go back with me but yes i understand that dci banks was a neighbor gervaise said dont worry were all professionals here well deal with this just as he would i know its much more pleasant to have a familiar face around in a situation like this but we all want the same thing first of all are you absolutely certain its a real gun you have no idea how many people we get reporting replicas or ballbearing guns patrick said it is he used to belong to a gun club many years ago after grammar school i dont know about such things did he also happen to check if its loaded he says it is he handled it very carefully good said gervaise did he unload it no he said it was best to leave it as it was not to contaminate the evidence wonderful thought annie another one been watching too many episodes of csi a loaded gun now they would have to bring in the firearms support unit for certain it would have had more sense and been much safer if patrick doyle had unloaded the gun annie also knew that most people rarely act sensibly during crises after all how often do you find a loaded gun in your daughters bedroom did he happen to mention what kind of gun it is gervaise asked he said something about a semiautomatic can that be right annie knew very little about firearms but she knew that a semiautomatic used a removable magazine to hold cartridges rather than a cylinder it usually held several rounds of ammunition and it fired one shot each time you pulled the trigger so when you left the house gervaise went on your husband and daughter were in the kitchen and the gun was on the table yes still wrapped patrick wrapped it up in the tea cloth again after hed examined it yes what state of mind was erin in then she was upset obviously angry tearful frightened did you ask her who shed got the gun from of course but she wouldnt say gervaise pursed her lips and thought for a moment then she glanced at annie and stood up thank you she said to juliet doyle im going to ring for someone to take care of you for the time being while we deal with the problem of the gun that has to be our priority you understand we need to get that loaded gun out of your house and into safekeeping and there are strict procedures we need to follow she picked up the telephone and talked to the officer on the front desk juliet looked pleadingly toward annie will you stay with me she asked im afraid i need di cabbot said gervaise shes the only other senior officer i have here at the moment but dont worry ill make sure youre nice and comfortable with wpc smithies in the canteen cant i go home not just yet said gervaise not until weve cleared the premises of the firearm but cant i go with you im afraid not said gervaise she touched juliets arm dont worry i told you youll be well taken care of can i ring my husband sorry said gervaise it might seem petty and silly to you but we cant allow any contact until the matter is settled and the firearm is safely in our possession but what harm could it possibly do if i talked to my husband it could do a lot of harm annie thought it could precipitate an argument between father and daughter in the house for example and with a loaded gun lying on the table and tempers no doubt already stretched to breaking point that could prove fatal but before gervaise could answer the question assuming she was intending to wpc smithies knocked at the door and escorted a reluctant juliet doyle to the canteen gervaise beckoned annie to stay well do this by the book annie i dont want any guns on my patch and i certainly dont want any accidents with them due to haste or negligence is that clear yes maam said annie want me to log the incident and call in an armed response vehicle yes and get one of the dcs to run a check on the doyles especially the daughter everything seems hunkydory on the surface but find out if weve any cause for alarm ill ring acc mclaughlin and hell no doubt get in touch with deputy chief constable i also want to arrange for the leeds police to search erins house i hardly think shes an arms dealer but wed better cover it lets get this in motion the longer we delay the more chance there is of something going wrong it wasnt the first time annie had witnessed an armed police raid she had been involved in two of them in london a few years earlier the first had gone smoothly but the second had been a disaster shots had been fired and two men had been killed this time she felt much stranger being just down the road from the police station across from bankss old suburban semi it all seemed so ordinary a black cat picked its way through a flower bed people passed by the end of the street with their shopping and paused to see what was happening annie sat silently in an unmarked police car with detective superintendent gervaise and waited for the armed response vehicles to arrive she almost wished she smoked it would be something to do to help pass the time instead she just gazed out at the baywindowed semis with their lowwalled gardens pebbledash and trim lawns and she realized she found it hard to imagine banks ever living here as a family man to her he had always been very much a lone figure even when they had had their brief romance now she couldnt fathom him at all something had changed in him something fundamental had broken and she wasnt sure if it could ever be mended two volvo ts parked at the junction with market street each armed response vehicle from the firearms support unit comprised two authorised firearms officers or afos in full personal protective equipment carrying pr batons rigid handcuffs and cs spray in addition to glock sidearms and tasers they would have heckler and koch mp carbines locked in the boots of their volvos along with an array of other lethal weapons laburnum way was a culdesac about a hundred yards in length so their arrival effectively cut off the street two patrol cars were parked at the far end people were already watching at their windows the four afos had already been briefed on the layout of the house as provided by juliet doyle should they need to effect entry they didnt expect to have to do that however as patrick doyle and his daughter knew where juliet had gone and they were expecting a police visit annie thought one of the team members was a woman but it was hard to tell behind all the body armor and equipment she was carrying another car pulled up and mike trethowan the firearms cadres superintendent also wearing full ppe spoke briefly with his officers then came over to join annie and gervaise any change he asked none said gervaise according to our information theyre just sitting there in the kitchen waiting for us to arrive and the kitchen is where back of the house down the hall door off to the right the superintendent sniffed the air nodded and went back to his team this wasnt a firearms hostage situation or a fatal shooting so far nothing had happened and the procedure was a simple one as it didnt appear that anyone was intent on using the firearm and that the situation was more or less under the control of the girls father the uniformed officers would knock at the door and shout for patrick and erin doyle to come out once they appeared they would be asked to hand over the weapon in question and step away it was simply a matter of being on guard and of using the usual extra care and caution around firearms the house was certainly quiet enough from the outside things started to go wrong right from the start when no one answered the door because of the natural tension when firearms are involved everyone was a little impatient but even annie had to admit that a pensioner in a zimmer frame could have got there by the time superintendent trethowan recalled the local officers sent two armed men around the back and two up the front path annie glanced at gervaise whose expression was set teeth clenched cupids bow mouth almost a single straight red line getting no response to their shouts the afos used a battering ram on the door which splintered open and the two officers rushed inside making as much noise as they could within seconds they had disappeared from view and after a brief silence annie heard a muffled shout and then a clicking sound like some distant cicada chattering in the trees followed by a scream and a lot of shouting and banging about she and gervaise jumped out of the car and dashed for the garden but superintendent trethowan outside the house raised his hand to warn them to stay back then he went inside annie could hear the other two officers breaking in at the back then more shouting the sound of a chair or a table crashing over and finally another loud scream a different voice this time annie felt her heart beating so hard and fast that she thought it would explode inside her chest she was shaking all over for what seemed like ages nothing happened the house fell silent again apart from the sounds of the team walking about inside doors opening and closing finally trethowan came out with two officers and the three of them walked toward the van what happened gervaise asked as they passed by but trethowan simply shook his head annie couldnt see his expression because of the protective headgear about thirty seconds later someone shouted the allclear and another officer came out carrying a small item wrapped in a tea cloth so that was what it was all about annie thought so tiny so deadly and from what she could see as the man passed right by her the tea cloth had a map of the yorkshire dales printed on it a moment later the final two armed response officers came out dragging between them a struggling and screaming young woman in rigid handcuffs erin doyle then came the sound of an ambulance speeding toward them down market street oh shit said gervaise here we go right said acc ron mclaughlin when everyone was seated in the boardroom of western area headquarters weve got the house on laburnum way locked down erin doyle is in custody and juliet doyle is at the hospital by her husbands bedside i hardly need to tell you ladies and gentlemen that we appear to be looking at a cockup of gigantic proportions mclaughlin had called the meeting to make some sense out of what had just happened and to determine what should be done next and by whom the room was crowded and the atmosphere tense though no media had arrived at the station yet annie could sense the vibrations thrumming through the ether hear the tomtoms beating in the distance and see the smoke signals curling into the sky in plain gray tshirts and combats the afos looked as if they had just come from the nearest fitness center annie saw that she was right about one of the team being female she had seen the woman around county hq at newby wiske on the few occasions she had been there and they had exchanged brief and polite greetings but she hadnt known the woman was a trained afo luckily western area hadnt had much use for their services lately there were few enough women in the force and annie reckoned that this one must be very good if she was a member of the afo team training was tough and standards were high the female officer had closely cropped spiky dark hair over a heartshaped face with large eyes a small mouth and an olive complexion she was short with a barrelshaped muscular upper body as if she lifted a lot of weights annie caught her eye and gave her a smile of solidarity she gave annie a grim shy smile of understanding back then turned away one of the team members a youngishlooking fellow whom annie didnt recognize seemed paler than the rest and was chewing on the end of a biro the hand in which he held it was shaking and it didnt take a genius to work out that he was the shooter the one who had dashed out of the house and thrown up in the herbaceous border he didnt look any older than eighteen but annie knew that he had to be in his midtolate twenties to have completed the training and psychological testing necessary to be an afo i think you all know the drill mclaughlin went on once everybody had a coffee in front of them im going to hand over to superintendent chambers from professional standards now to get the ball rolling once weve got the general picture well try to make some decisions on how best to proceed reg chambers cleared his throat leaned back in his chair and put his pen down on his notepad the buttons on his waistcoat stretched tight across his chest and belly annie thought he had the faintly ridiculous air of a dickensian character she had once worked with chambers for a few weeks herself and had quickly come to understand why the internal affairs department was always referred to as the rat squad on american television programs thank you sir said chambers lets just get a few facts straight first of all shall we who called in the fsu he had a home counties accent which he seemed to think made him sound posh i did said gervaise we had information that an illegal firearm had been discovered in erin doyles bedroom at her parents house on laburnum way miss doyle had remained there in the custody of her father while her mother reported the weapon to us admirable chambers jotted something down then asked gervaise was there any reason to suspect that anyone in the house was in danger none said gervaise or that the firearm was a threat to anyone at all a loaded firearm is always a threat but there was no reason for us to assume that either erin or patrick doyle intended to use the weapon either on each other or on anybody else they were both aware that the mother juliet doyle had gone to the police station to report finding it they were expecting us chambers scratched the edge of his nose and coughed i understand that the daughter was quite upset and angry when the gun was discovered in her room naturally said gervaise but you dont think she was afraid of the consequences was likely to use the weapon to effect an escape gervaise took her time before answering i dont think she was even aware of the consequences she said finally most people in her position arent they dont really think theyve done anything wrong in simply giving house room to a gun no matter how they came by it after all they havent used it i doubt that she even realized she was committing a serious crime she probably expected to be thanked for keeping it off the streets if she even knew about it what do you mean chambers demanded im just pointing out that at this stage in our inquiries we have absolutely no evidence whatsoever that erin doyle had any connection with the gun found by her mother on top of her wardrobe are you suggesting that someone else put it there i am simply saying that we dont know said gervaise annie could tell she was holding back her irritation i understand from sergeant haggerty on the reception desk that mrs doyle asked to see detective chief inspector banks said chambers shooting annie a sly glance annie knew that chambers and banks didnt get on had crossed swords on more than one occasion since the reorganization in which chamberss department had been relocated to county hq dci banks is one of my best officers said gervaise as it happens hes on holiday gardening leave is it chambers asked with a smirk we all know hes been off his medication lately a welldeserved holiday said gervaise tightlipped she looked over at annie according to di cabbot mrs doyle did first ask for dci banks yes your point is chambers turned to annie his eyes narrowed so its true yes said annie any idea why this was apparently they used to be neighbors and have remained friends since dci banks left the neighborhood why do you think she asked for him by name because she knew him i think she expected that he would accompany her back to the house pick up the gun and bring it in to the station rather than follow correct procedure annie shifted uncomfortably in her seat i think that dci bankss first priority would have been to defuse the situation she said and to make sure that no harm came to anyone and our prioritythe correct procedurewasnt likely to achieve that with all due respect its not my place to comment on procedure but im certain that whatever dci banks would have done would have been well within acceptable bounds i wish i could share your confidence said chambers his upper lip curling well well never know will we said annie because he wasnt here and its all mere speculation that will do di cabbot said chambers annie gave him a contemptuous look so in fact what erin and patrick doyle were expecting chambers went on was for an old family friend to come knocking at their door give their daughter a stern talking to then disappear from their lives forever with the gun problem solved i wouldnt necessarily say that annie argued i dont know what they were expecting there are no grounds whatsoever for assuming that dci banks would in any way interfere with the law or try to protect erin doyle from prosecution for any offense she might have committed chambers sneered well well never know now will we di cabbot he wasnt here he had the kind of face that seemed to be wearing a perpetual expression of distaste annie had noticed as if he had just smelled or swallowed something unpleasant she also felt his eyes undress her every time he looked in her direction his complexion was like the shiny pink plastic of a childs doll and his lips were fleshy wet and red annie felt like sticking her tongue out at him but she managed to restrain herself that would be childish instead she gave him a sweet smile and sipped some bitter tepid coffee this isnt getting us anywhere reg cut in mclaughlin who annie suspected was well aware of chamberss shortcomings what might have happened under different circumstances isnt our concern here certainly not at this point no sir said chambers with a quick glare at annie forgive me i was simply trying to get a general sense of events did anyone telephone the doyle house try to talk to the father and assess the situation gervaise paused we felt that a telephone call might cause too much consternation given that erins mother had already told us that her daughter was distraught and that erin and her father were expecting dci banks to be in touch chambers raised his eyebrows though that is standard procedure before sending in the cavalry isnt it lets move on to the incident itself reg mclaughlin said by all means chambers turned to the young afo constable warburton would you care to tell us briefly in your own words what transpired at laburnum way just stick to the facts and keep it simple dont embellish yes sir said warburton sitting to attention if such a thing was possible he went on to describe how the team had waited while the local police knocked on the door and announced themselves but no one answered is that correct yes sir how long would you say transpired between the first officers announcing themselves and your forced entry its hard to say sir said warburton time can behave very strangely in circumstances like that i acknowledge that ones perception of time can be affected by stress said chambers but surely you can give me a rough estimate seconds minutes hours a few minutes at most sir minutes very well a minute can be a long time yes sir and during that time did you hear anything hear anything yes from inside any sounds an argument or anything like that i thought i heard voices at one point sir people talking arguing impossible to say sir they were muffled but could they have been raised i suppose they could i couldnt tell very well what happened next when it seemed apparent that no one was going to answer the door we thought it necessary to force entry that is wpc powell and i did anything could have happened since the first reports the girl could have been holding her father at gunpoint she could even have shot him nobodys arguing with your judgment son said chambers though the press might take a slightly more jaundiced view of things i feel that i acted in accordance with the law sir and with my training id do the same yes yes all right spare us the selfjustification pc warburton what happened when you entered the house you entered from the front with constable nerys powell am i correct chambers glanced at pc powell and it was clear to annie even from such a short look that he disapproved of the presence of a woman on the team they both worked at county hq perhaps they had clashed before yes sir said warburton we entered the building as instructed wpc powell and me nerys powell gave him a sad smile of encouragement what happened next the hallway was very long and dark it was daytime but there was no direct source of light did you have a torch mclaughlin asked yes sir on my belt did you switch it on warburton paused before answering no sir he said there was just no time it all happened so quickly i did flick a light switch on the wall as we entered but the bulb blew tell me what happened next warburton drank some water and rubbed his face with both hands just as we entered the hall by the bottom of the stairs a door at the far end opened to the right i knew from my briefing that this was the door to the kitchen and the kitchen was where the where mr doyle and his daughter were said to be waiting and the loaded firearm i heard a creaking noise then there was a figure in the corridor just a silhouette really and i could swear he was waving a sword or some such weapon at me about to rush us like i said it was still dark in there our eyes hadnt had a chance to adjust and we didnt have time to get out our torches but we knew there was a loaded weapon on the premises and ii just reacted as fast as i could sir the way any officer would so you fired i discharged my taser sir yes as we are instructed to do when faced with someone brandishing a sword or a knife yet as far as you were concerned the weapon you were there to recover was a firearm and it had been found in the possession of erin doyle not her father thats correct sir but he could have taken possession of it and just decided to shoot a policeman for the hell of it stick to the facts constable you mentioned a sword not a gun and this sword was actually a walkingstick warburton swallowed well yes sir strictly speaking but i strictly speaking id be interested to know how else you would put it were you aware of any reason mr doyle might have had for attacking you with a sword or even a walking stick for that matter no sir weisimply reacted to the circumstances did the right thing as per training there was no time to speculate perhaps he had decided to try to defend his daughter perhaps hed realized since the mother went off to see the police that the girl would be sent to jail perhaps he felt under threat because things hadnt turned out the way he had expected i dont know sir i just reacted are those the thoughts that passed through your mind at the time or are they explanations you have thought up since i cant say i really had time to think of anything like that sir not at the time in action you just sort of fall back on your training its not like thinking finding reasons thats for later where did you aim for for the chest area sir the largest body mass its not as if youd expect a taser to kill someone i know that but it has happened dont you know its now recommended that firearms officers aim tasers for the arms or legs not the chest sir it was dark i felt threatened and i didnt want to risk missing chambers cleared his throat do you have any idea why there was such a long delay inside the house that you were forced to break down the door no sir were you aware at that time that mr doyle was expecting dci banks an old friend to turn up and sort things out no sir i wasnt did you know that he was walking with a stick after a recent knee operation i did not sir warburton turned to his immediate boss firearms cadre superintendent mike trethowan who gave him an encouraging nod trethowan was an experienced superintendent of about fifty with compact military bearing and a red complexion that annie associated with high blood pressure he always seemed cool enough though so she doubted that was the reason maybe he just burned easily in the sun that information was not in our briefing said warburton chambers turned to gervaise i take it you didnt know about this either catherine no said gervaise juliet doyle neglected to mention that her husband was walking with the aid of a stick i think she was far too het up about her daughter her reasons are irrelevant this should have been an essential part of the briefing essential you cant send men into battle on dodgy intelligence it can mean the difference between life and death gervaise crossed her arms annie was about to make a remark about tony blair not being worried about dodgy dossiers when it came to going to war with iraq but she decided it wouldnt go down well at this point she must be growing up she thought not sticking her tongue out keeping her lips buttoned chambers put his pen on his pad it was covered in looping spiderlike scrawl annie noticed quite a lot of which appeared to be doodles i think we should wrap this up now he said there are a lot of loose ends a lot more questions to be asked this is only the beginning there is one more thing said gervaise chambers raised an eyebrow oh gervaise ignored him and looked directly at acc mclaughlin if we might have your permission to interview erin doyle sir before the ground gets muddied chambers spluttered i dont think thats mclaughlin cut chambers off then glanced from him to gervaise and back i do see the problem he said clearly the discharge of the taser is an incident that needs to be investigated by you and your department reg the independent police complaints commission will no doubt insist on that chambers nodded in agreement but on the other hand mclaughlin went on we still have the matter of the firearm itself the reason the afo team were at the doyle house to begin with i think youll agree reg that were dealing with a separate investigation here we need to find out as much as we can about this weapon and where it came from as soon as possible and i dont think another force would be any better equipped to deal with that than our own do you but its protocol its protocol that someone else investigates the actions of constables warburton and powell and the rest of the afo team true but that same protocol hardly requires an outside force to investigate the firearm we were called to recover in the first place we have yet to establish any irrefutable link with erin doyle but theyre connected sir of course theyre connected said mclaughlin he turned to gervaise where is the firearm now on its way to forensic services in birmingham sir mclaughlin nodded i insist on being present at all interviews connected with this business and with any members of the afo team or anyone else connected with the weapon discharge demanded chambers there you are you see reg mclaughlin said allowing himself a flicker of a smile youre already calling it this business to me that simply confuses the issue we have the matter of the discharge of a taser by a police officer in the course of his duty yes but we also have the discovery of a loaded firearm in a young womans bedroom i would like to know where that weapon came from what its history is whether it has ever been used in the commission of a crime for example and how it got into erin doyles bedroom in the first place now im aware theres a connectionthe officers were there to pick up the firearm after allbut as far as i know the handgun wasnt used in this business was it nobody got a gunshot wound at laburnum way did they as far as i can gather the weapon were interested in remained wrapped in a tea cloth from the moment it was picked up by constable powell to the moment we shipped it off to birmingham the chain of evidence is quite clear on this lets face it gervaise said as soon as the media get hold of this theyll have a field day were all going to be under the microscopenot just for the taser discharge but for the loaded gun tooand things are likely to get even more twisted than they are right now therell be questions in the house a home office inquiry a government report yes yes said mclaughlin rubbing his forehead im aware of all that catherine i dont need reminding thank you very much im also aware that my opinion cuts very little ice with superintendent chambers here but im still in charge and i cant see any objection at all to your interviewing erin doyle as long as you stick to the matter of the firearm and she has legal representation present the sooner the better and my request to be present cut in chambers salvaging as much dignity as he could from the situation before mclaughlin could answer there came a soft tap at the door annie knew that the acc had specifically asked that they not be interrupted so she wasnt surprised when he barked out a gruff what is it a grimfaced harry potter opened the door a crack and stuck his head through sorry to disturb the meeting maam he said addressing gervaise but the hospital thought you ought to know mr doyle patrick doyle he died ten minutes ago sorry maam when tracy banks got home from work at about half past five that evening she was hot tired and grumpy the traffic on otley road had been jammed up almost as far back as the original oak and it had taken her bus nearly an hour to crawl the short distance from town it had been a difficult day at the bookshop too they had a bigname crime author coming to do an event that evening and she had spent most of the day on the phone chasing down his backlist from a variety of recalcitrant publishers books that had been promised for weeks but still hadnt arrived still that wasnt her problem anymore bugger it she thought let shauna the eveningshift manager deal with it after all she would also get to go out with the writer and his entourage afterward for a slapup meal and a bunch of free drinks at maxis all tracy wanted now was a joint and a bit of peace and quiet she hoped erin was still at her parents place life had been a lot more relaxed without her over the weekend and the last thing tracy wanted was another row despite its overgrown garden the house appeared more impressive than it was tracy always thought as she walked up the path toward its solid sandstone facade and mullioned windows three bedrooms one each a shared bathroom and toilet large highceiling living room with a drafty bay window expensive to heat in winter no double glazing the kitchen was large enough to double as a communal dining area though it was rare that the three of them actually ate together luckily tracy rose and erin got along well most of the time though three more different personalities in one place youd be hard pushed to find erin was sloppy and untidy left a mess behind her everywhere she went rose was a bit of a bookworm and though she kept her things generally tidy she didnt always seem to notice the general mess and was quite content living in her own world and tracywell she didnt really know how to describe herself except she felt angry a lot of the time these days at nothing in particular and a little dissatisfied with what life had to offer no if truth be told more than just a little but a lot dissatisfied it wasnt supposed to be like this at all whatever this was and her name wasnt tracy anymore most people called her francesca now despite their differences the three of them had fun and somehow it worked though tracy found it was always she who ended up cleaning and tidying the mess simply because it got her down not because tidiness was necessarily in her nature they had talked about it more than once and the others had promised to do better but it remained a problem at least rose tried when she noticed rose was the newcomer replacing jasmine who had left to get married four months ago tracy had known erin since she first came to live in eastvale since they were little kids neighbors from across the street they were the same age and had gone through comprehensive school and university together both ending up living in leeds neither in exactly the sort of job they or their parents had envisioned rose jumped up and stubbed out a cigarette when tracy entered the living room there was a nosmoking rule in the house and rose usually went outside into the back garden so tracy could tell immediately that something was wrong an emotional crisis was the last thing she needed what is it she asked rose started pacing the carpet something shed never done before the police were here today thats what police what did they want rose stopped pacing for a moment and glanced at her only to search the place thats all search they didnt no relax they were mostly interested in erins room and they seemed to be in a hurry but why what were they looking for they wouldnt say tracy ran her hand over her hair christ she said getting up and heading for the door to the kitchen i need a joint you cant rose called after her what are you talking about you cant ii flushed it you flushed it rose there was half an ounce of ace weed left at least what do you well they couldve come back couldnt they and gone through all the jars you werent here you dont know what its like having the police crawling all over the house asking questions that way they have of looking at you like they dont believe a word youre saying oh dont i thought tracy i lived with one for about twenty years but rose didnt know that rose was part of the new scene she had told rose that her name was francesca banks because she thought tracy was a chav name and she said her father was a retired civil servant an expenpusher an old geezer and her mother lived in london half of which was true and like the heiress who keeps her fortune a secret to make sure no one falls in love with her for the wrong reason tracy also never mentioned that her brother was brian banks of the blue lamps whose latest cd was riding high in the charts and who were hotly tipped for a mercury prize erin knew of course having been a childhood friend of the family and she had agreed to keep tracys secrets to go along with the deception because she thought it was cool and fun christ said tracy sitting down again half an ounce of grass she put her head in her hands do you have any idea how much that cost me have a drink rose offered cheerfully weve still got some gin left i dont want any fucking gin if truth be told tracy didnt much like alcohol or its effects at all she drank merely because her friends did and sometimes she overdid it tottered around the city center in her high heels and puked in ginnels and snickets ended up in the wrong bed any bed they all drank some sort of alcopop colored liquids with a kick but tracy preferred a nice joint every now and then and sometimes e they seemed harmlessenough diversions look said rose im really sorry but i was scared i mean i was shaking like a leaf in case they found it while they were searching the place you would have been too i was sure they noticed how nervous i was thought i was hiding something soon as they left i flushed it i am sorry but they could have come back they could still come back okay said tracy tired of the subject okay just forget it did they ask you any questions they were only interested in erin but it was just vague general stuff like about if she had any boyfriends what she did who else lived here were they looking for her did they ask if you knew where she was no did you mention me i had to didnt i they could find out you live here easily enough what about jaff well he is her boyfriend isnt he i had to tell them who he was why wouldnt i christ did you give them his address i dont know it do i all i know is he lives by the canal do you think its something to do with him why would it be anything to do with him i dont know said rose i know you like him but ive always thought he was a bit dodgy the flash clothes and car jewelry that fancy rolex watch where does he get all his money from theres just something about him that makes me think the police might be interested in him thats all something not quite right drugs ill bet maybe said tracy she knew what rose meant she had had the same suspicions about jaff but she also fancied him and she didnt care if he was a bit dodgy he certainly always seemed to have some weed or blow with him and the dodginess was part of his appeal for tracythat cheeky devilmaycare badboy attitude he exuded it turned her on that was part of the problem he was goodlooking bright a real charmer and maybe crooked and he was erins boyfriend perhaps the police visit was something to do with jaff if so she needed to warn him let him know what had happened there was a good chance that she could get to him before the police did what the hell had the silly bitch erin gone and done whatever it was it must have been in eastvale at her parents house which was where rose had said she had gone tracy just hoped that none of this would get through to her father then she remembered that he was away somewhere in the world licking his wounds over a broken love affair and she didnt know exactly where he was only that he wouldnt be back until next week did they say anything else she asked rose frowned only that they had a warrant to search the house they showed it to me but i didnt have a chance to read it it could have said anything one of them poked about in here while the others were gone just in the drawers and under cushions and so on but his heart didnt seem in it like i said they were mostly interested in erin they wouldnt let me go up with them they didnt examine all the herb jars and stuff thank god i was terrified theyd take samples or sniff the basil i wonder why they didnt tracy said if they were looking for drugs youd think theyd have a good look at stuff like that wouldnt you i mean its hardly the most brilliant hiding place a jar labeled basil is it rose shrugged they just didnt maybe it was something else i mean this didnt seem like a drugs raid not that id know what one was like of course but they didnt have sniffer dogs and they seemed to be in a bit of a hurry its like they were looking for something in particular in erins room mostly why dont you ring her at home youve got her number havent you tracy nodded she knew the number by heart she also knew that the phone at the doyles house had call display and recorded the number of anyone who rang then she realized that didnt matter the police had already been here they knew this was where erin had a flat in leeds they would also know tracys name her real name and that she lived here too it would hardly set off any alarms if someone from here phoned to ask about erin and maybe mr or mrs doyle would be able to tell her something you were here on friday morning when she dropped by to pick up her things tracy said what was she like is there anything she said that youve forgotten to tell me no she was just pissed off thats all sulky she didnt say anything except when i asked her where she was going then she just said she was going home for a few days and stormed out that sounded like erin in a snit tracy thought she went into the hall picked up the handset and dialed erins home number the phone rang then someone answered it and a mans voice came on the line hello said tracy is that mr doyle whos speaking are you mr doyle erins dad id like to know to whom im speaking please identify yourself tracy hung up it wasnt patrick doyle she knew a cops tone when she heard it but why would a cop be answering the doyles telephone where were erins mother and father a deep feeling of unease stirred inside her and started to seep like the damp chill of winter through her flesh something was wrong perhaps seriously wrong and it wasnt only erin who was involved she grabbed her black denim jacket and shoulder bag from the stand in the hall and popped her head back around the living room door im going out for a while rose dont worry just keep cool right but francesca you cant just leave me in the lurch like this im frightened what if tracy shut the door and cut off roses protests in a funny way she could almost pretend that rose wasnt talking to her after all her name wasnt really francesca was it erin doyle made a pathetic figure sitting in superintendent gervaises office late that afternoon her ashblond hair clearly cut professionally falling over her shoulders in casual disarray her cheeks tearstreaked bags under eyes red from crying a pale sickly complexion her expression was sullen and her fingernails were bitten to the quicks juliet doyle had said that erins style and appearance had improved considerably over the past six months but that was hardly apparent right now juliet doyle had gone to stay with harriet weaver a friend and neighbor across laburnum way relations were so strained between mother and daughter that erin would have to stay elsewhere patricia yu the family liaison officer was looking into local accommodation and she would later liaise between the doyles and the police erin would almost certainly get police bail after the interview they could hardly keep her in custody after what had just happened to her father the media would go crazy for a start and annie recognized that it would be callous in the extreme to keep the poor girl locked up in a cell overnight after the death of her father even if they got real evidence against her during the forthcoming interview both detective superintendent gervaise and acc mclaughlin had agreed that the interview should be conducted in the relative comfort of gervaises office only a couple of hours ago erin had been told that her father was dead and a grungy interview room hardly seemed appropriate there were only four people in the spacious office gervaise was stuck in meetings with mclaughlin and the deputy chief constable at county hq so annie sat in her chair opposite erin who was on the other side of the desk chairs had also been brought in for erins solicitor irene lightholm and for superintendent chambers who had been granted his request to be present annie just hoped the fat bastard wouldnt keep interrupting the same went for irene lightholm who sat perched on the edge of her seat like a bird of prey with a nose to match her pristine notepad rested on the pleated gray material of her skirt which itself lay across her skinny thighs it had been agreed that annie as gervaises deputy investigating officer should do the questioning and she was as agreed required to stick to the issue of the loaded gun and avoid anything relating to the death of erin doyles father or the actions of the afos it was something of a balancing act and she didnt think it would be easy as mclaughlin had said the two issues were closely related annie felt she had everything working against her the poor girls state of mind the hypervigilant lawyer piggyeyed chambers best just to ignore them all focus on erin keep calm and carry on she got the formalities out of the way as quickly and painlessly as possible then began im sorry about your father erin she said erin said nothing she just stared down at the desk and chewed on a fingernail erin i really need you to talk to me i know youre upset and you want to be with your mother but can you please just answer a few questions first then you can go erin muttered something she was still chewing on her nail so it was hard to tell what she said what was that annie asked her i said i dont want to be with my mother well i know id want to be with mine said annie if i had one she thought she turned me in erin said her hands clasped on her lap now twisting she still stared at the desk and her voice was muffled her words hard to make out how would you feel she did what she thought she had to do annie said erin gave her a withering glance you would say that erin thats not what im here to talk to you about however much it hurts however bad it feels i want you to tell me about the gun erin shook her head where did you get it from i dont know anything about it why did you bring it home with you and hide it on top of your wardrobe erin shrugged and picked at her fingernail who gave you the gun erin nobody somebody must have given it to you or did you buy it yourself erin didnt answer are you hiding it for someone no why do you think that annie knew that she was getting nowhere and she didnt feel that things were likely to change in the next while it was all too raw and confusing she was tempted to call it a day and pack erin off to whatever hotel or bandb patricia yu had found but she was nothing if not persistent was it someone in leeds she asked no answer your boyfriend perhaps i dont have a boyfriend oh come on cut in chambers trying to sound avuncular a pretty young girl like you surely you must have a boyfriend he ended up sounding like a dirty old man annie thought erin treated the question with the silent contempt it deserved annie could tell from her general appearance and body language that her selfesteem was low right now and that she certainly didnt see herself as a pretty young girl annie gave chambers a disapproving look and carried on of course you do geoff isnt it dont you want him to know where you are annie didnt understand the look erin gave her she carried on was it geoff who gave you the gun is that why you dont want to talk about him still erin said nothing are you afraid of him is that it id be afraid of someone who kept a loaded gun around the house you dont understand anything then help me i want to understand annie got no reaction oh this is getting us precisely bloody nowhere chambers burst out i did it erin said her voice was little more than a whisper and she still wouldnt look up at them did what erin brought the gun home annie asked leaning forward to hear her words but she didnt need to erin sat bolt upright and looked directly at her speaking in a clear though trembling voice not that but i killed him she said my father it was my fault i now wait a minute chambers blustered looking over at irene lightholm who remained perched on the edge of her chair enthralled instead of telling her client to shut up erin ignored chambers and the solicitor annie could tell she was trying to get out what she had to say before she completely lost control it didnt matter whom she was talking to she just had to have her say it was my fault what happened to dad she glanced at chambers then at her solicitor we heard the banging at the door the calls for us to open up dad asked me to answer because his knee hurt and he was starting to have chest pains from all the stress angina ii told him to fuck off i said he could bloody well turn me in if he wanted to i couldnt stop him doing that but i was fucked if i was going to answer the door to the gestapo myself she put her hands to her face and started to cry i did it she said between her fingers oh god forgive me i killed him i killed my dad it was all my fault finally irene lightholm found her voice i think you can see she said that my client is upset over the death of her father i take it that she hasnt been charged with anything yet and as far as i can tell you dont have enough evidence to charge her with anything in that case i think we should bring this interview to a close right now and you should release my client on police bail i agree said chambers this interview is terminated now annie wondered if he realized he was agreeing with a defense solicitor she ignored them both walked around the desk then bent over and put her arm around erins shoulders she expected resistance a violent reaction but she didnt get it instead erin turned her face into annies shoulder grasped hold of her and sobbed her heart out jaff had a onebedroom flat with a balcony on granary wharf down by the river aire and the leedsliverpool canal tracy had never been inside before but erin had pointed out the converted warehouse with the restaurant on the ground floor as they had passed by one night very chic people sat at tables on the quayside outside the cafés under umbrellas advertising campari or stella artois sipping wine and chatting in the softening evening light tracy pressed the intercom button next to his name jaff answered and sounded pleased to hear that it was she he buzzed her in and she took the lift to the third floor jaff welcomed her at the door and led her into the modest but open space of the living dining and kitchen area where light flooded through a window that led to the small balcony the place was messy with newspaper sections magazines cds and empty cups and glasses scattered here and there dirty dishes piled in the sink and a few old wine or coffee stains on the fitted carpet the color scheme shades of blue and green was a bit too dark and cold for tracys taste a number of framed photographs stood on a shelf above the television set which was tuned to the bbc news at six a couple of the photos were of jaff clearly in exotic places but there was one of a beautiful woman in a colorful sari she had golden skin long glossy black hair high cheekbones large eyes a perfect straight nose to tracy she looked like a model one of jaffs old girlfriends perhaps sorry about the mess jaff said the cleaning lady doesnt come till thursday tracy smiled no need to apologize to me its not as if im exactly the tidiest person in the world whos that beautiful woman in the photograph over there she asked jaff looked toward the shelf thats my mother he said dont beit cant possibly be said tracy it is he said honest she was thirtysix when that was taken four years before she died oh jaff im sorry it was a long time ago she was an amazing woman grew up in the slums of dhaka and ended up one of the biggest bollywood stars of her day as he spoke staring at the photograph he seemed choked with emotion sorry he said with a wan smile i still dont find it easy to talk about her lets go outside okay said tracy following him i understand it was clear from the cigarette smoldering in the ashtray and the halffull glass of lager that jaff had been sitting on his balcony tracy sat in the opposite chair good to see you babe jaff said touching her shoulder lightly i was going to ring you soon as the dust settled thing is i had to go away for the weekend bit of business amsterdam and london just got back an hour or so ago drink tracy accepted more out of politeness than anything else jaff went back inside to pour her a gin and tonic tracy gazed out over the city beyond the railway tracks so much had changed since she had first arrived there at university more years ago now than she cared to remember she could see several distant building sites where the giant cranes had remained stationary for months since their funds had dried up the ambitious towers only halffinished the closer view only confirmed what she had felt before about the canalside development being claustrophobic and ugly it was too near to the railway lines for a start just at the back of city station and below the balcony was the canal a ribbon of murky stagnant water on which floated plastic bottles fastfood wrappers and other things she would rather not think about there was still plenty of activity at the moment the area seemed to be one enormous building site everything was crammed together cheek by jowl god only knew what the mishmash would look like when the builders had finished if they ever did finish tracy doubted that the planners had ever thought of sketching out the whole picture it was a warm evening but she kept her denim jacket on against the chill that always crept in at this time of year when darkness fell jaff came back outside with her drink and sat down tracy hadnt stayed at the headingley house long enough to get changed after work and as usual she felt quite scruffy compared to jaff who was wearing designer jeans and a loose white shirt hanging out at the waist it stood in sharp contrast to his golden skin not for the first time tracy found herself admiring his long dark eyelashes gelled black hair smooth complexion lean body loambrown eyes and the lithe way he moved he was beautiful she thought like some exotic cat but there was nothing at all effeminate about him she also sensed that he could be a dangerous enemy and there was a hardness in his eyes at odds with the humor and intelligence that also dwelled there but that combination and contrast excited her too he picked up his glass cheers cheers said tracy they clinked glasses ever been to amsterdam no ive been to london though used to live there amsterdams a great city all those canals and the clubs melkweg paradiso mindblowing enlightened too you can get hash brownies in the cafés and there are places you can sit and smoke dope and listen to music cool said tracy maybe someday for sure so what brings you here is it just a social visit or what tracy leaned forward and frowned im not certain she said but i think somethings wrong the police came around to our house today and searched the place erins room in particular jaff sat up erins room police why i dont know i was at work rose was there and she told me about it but you know what shes like im not sure she got all the details right apparently they also asked questions about who her friends were including boyfriends did rose say anything she says she mentioned your first name but she doesnt know the address only that you live by the canal shes scared stiff jaff theres something else what i rang erin at home and a strange voice answered i thought it was a cop why did you think that tracy couldnt tell him why that she had grown up listening to cops and recognized the tone the thrust of the questions as far as jaff was concerned she was called francesca and he knew nothing about her father it just sounded like a cop thats all trust me she said whats it all about jaff looked at his watch and stood up lets see if theres anything on the local news it should have started by now tracy followed him inside he cleared away a pile of magazines and they sat next to each other on the sofa there was nothing of interest on until the headline recap at the end before the weather and then all they got was a little grainy jerky video footage taken with a handheld camera or a mobile and a voiceover that didnt really explain what was going on except that an armed police raid had taken place on a quiet leafy street in eastvale laburnum way tracy felt her jaw dropping in shock at the familiarity of it all as she watched she recognized all the houses knew almost everyone who lived on the street when it was over they were not much the wiser erins name hadnt been mentioned nor any possible reason for a police search of the house in leeds whats going on tracy asked again jaff turned off the tv and stood up i dont know he said but i dont like the look of it an armed police raid why it seems serious what was erin doing at home anyway after last thursday tracy said she didnt come back to the house that night i thought shedyou knowjust stopped the night with you on friday she came by to pick up a few things to go home for a while so she said rose was there jaff paced she did stop with me on thursday night well she stopped here at any rate crashed passed out on the sofa whatever you care to call it we werent on speaking terms by then it was late we had a row because of what happened earlier partly but its been brewing longer than that shes been getting too possessive too clingy i hate that so what happened i had to leave early drive down to london she was asleep i left her here he paused something seemed to dawn on him i left her here alone stay here a minute please would you tracy did as he asked while jaff hurried into the bedroom he came back moments later and seemed even more agitated than before shit the stupid bitch what is it tracy asked picking up on his sense of alarm ive got to get out of here they could turn up any moment the stupid stupid woman she doesnt know what shes done why what were they looking for at the house jaff turned and touched tracys hair so gently that she felt a little shiver run up her spine you ask too many questions he said you sound like a policewoman yourself youre not are you i wouldnt put it past them to plant such a pretty girl on me dont be silly he smiled at her flashing those sowhite teeth of course not then he went back into the bedroom will you please tell me whats going on tracy called after him i would he answered popping his head around the door but i dont know i havent seen or heard anything of erin since last friday morning and you know quite well what happened on thursday night tracy felt herself blush with shame at the memory im sorry it was all my fault like i said it had been building up for a while that was just the last straw it doesnt matter i should never have left her here alone now look what shes gone and done the stupid bitch she took something of mine somethingreally important now i have to go and lie low for a while until i know whats what i just need to put a few things in a bag first will you wait here please of course if theres anything i can do tracy walked back out to the balcony leaned on the railing sipped her gin and tonic and stared down into the oily canal laughter rose from a group of people under one of the umbrellas the drink tasted good better than she remembered why had jaff asked her to wait did he want her to go with him wherever he was going to london an adventure the idea both excited and scared her she couldnt just take off with him surely but why not what had she got to hang around leeds for what prospects what future her lousy job in the bookshop an absentee mother and a father who seemed incapable of growing up besides she was beginning to feel at least partly responsible for whatever it was that had happened between erin and jaff even though she had no idea what was upsetting him at the moment what she had taken it didnt take jaff long to pack a holdall in less than five minutes he was back in the living room again tracy joined him they checked that everything was switched off that his cigarette was properly extinguished and that the french doors leading to the balcony were securely locked where are you thinking of going tracy asked i honestly dont know he said but i have to get away from here till things cool down its not safe if i were you id just go home its really nothing to do with you look tracy said hesitantly i wish i knew a bit more about what was going on but i know somewhere we can go i mean if you want to you do where my dads place ive got a key hes away on holiday till next monday thats a whole week we can at least stay for a few days until you figure out your next move well be safe there nobody will think to look for us jaff considered this for a moment then said all right if youre sure but i have to stop at vics on the way to pick up a few things i need from him well borrow his car too he wont mind he can keep mine in his garage that way nobody will be after us vics number wont mean anything to the police this sounds great where does your dad live gratly huh its in the dales a little cottage very isolated perfect jaff said then he patted her between the shoulder blades what are we waiting for babe lets go the shadows were lengthening when annie approached laburnum way she knew that she shouldnt be visiting juliet doyle on her own like this that she was risking chamberss wrath not to mention gervaises and mclaughlins but she had a few more questions for juliet before chambers cut off access entirely she should have gone home hours ago or called at bankss cottage to water the plants and take in the post but she had sat instead in the half moon on market street not far from laburnum way sipping a pint of daleside bitter and picking at a vegetarian pasta after mustering up the willpower to order it instead of fish and chips anyway she consoled herself pub fish and chips were never anywhere near as good as those from the chippie when she had finished she decided that being so close to laburnum way she would drop in and see how things were erin was staying at a guest house near the castle she hadnt wanted to be anywhere near her mother bankss potted plants could wait another day or two and if he got any parcels theyd only be cds or dvds from amazon and they would wait safely in the wheelybin storage area where the postman usually left them there was still a strong police presence on laburnum way patrol cars unmarked vehicles soco vans uniformed officers on guard mostly keeping the media at bay a couple of local reporters one from the paper and one from tv recognized annie and asked for comments but she said nothing harriet weaver answered the door just moments after annie had rung the bell annie isnt it she said alans friend please come in she closed the door for a moment and annie heard the chain slide off you cant be too careful with all those reporters creeping around the place harriet said weve already had to take the phone off the hook annie followed her into the house and waited while harriet put the chain back on and locked the dead bolt they had met before a few times through banks but they didnt know each other well harriet annie knew was somewhere in her fifties and had recently retired from driving a mobile library in the dale her husband david had something to do with computers she remembered and banks thought him a crashing bore annie had never met him they were also sophias aunt and uncle and banks had met sophia through them at a dinner party at their house he had told annie that he and sandra and the kids used to live next door and harriet had been one of the first to welcome them to the neighborhood over twenty years ago sophia had been visiting her aunt for years probably since back when she was a student or even still a schoolgirl annie found herself wondering if banks had fancied her that long ago too he would only have been in his thirties it wasnt beyond the realm of possibility when shed been seventeen she had gone out briefly with a man in his early thirties until her father had found out anyway there was no time for such speculation she told herself nor any point in it she wondered how harriet and her husband felt about the whole banksandsophia affair uncomfortable probably no need to bring it up lets go inside harriet said leading annie into a cozy living room with an upholstered threepiece suite and a largescreen tv i was just doing the dishes she went on davids out on a rush job and juliets upstairs lying down as you can imagine shes exhausted poor thing its been a terrible day a wretched ordeal so you know whats happened annie said more or less most of it anyway juliet hasnt said much i think she must still be in shock but what can i do for you first of all im not supposed to be here annie said the independent police complaints commission will be working with our professional standards department on setting up a separate inquiry into patrick doyles death that makes sense ive heard about that sort of thing anyway dont worry your secrets safe with me oh its all right plenty of my colleagues probably saw me come here though i doubt theyd think anything of it i just wanted you to know that im here unofficially really i just wanted to see how things are how juliets doing and you of course i feel partly responsible you see i was the first one to see juliet this morning and i was out in the street in front of the house when it happened that hardly makes it your fault dear said harriet im sure you did your best for her anyway as i told you shes exhausted its been a long confusing day for them with patrick gone and erin not talking to her poor juliet doesnt know whether shes coming or going the doctors given her a mild sedative she shook her head slowly its going to take them a long time to come to terms with this juliet blames erin for patricks death and im sure erin must blame herself too to some extent but she must also feel betrayed by juliet i mean her own mother informing on her quite a conundrum said annie its good of you to put juliet up where else could she go tonight shes got a sister in durham so perhaps shell go and stay with her later but for nowdo you have any idea how long all this will take how long theyll be shut out of their home im sorry said annie i dont days weeks months ive known houses to be locked down for weeks annie said but i doubt that will happen in this case it looks fairly straightforward legally i mean as far as an investigation is concerned i understand that it has far more of an impact emotionally but youd say a few days at least yes oh look at me im so sorry ive been sitting here picking your brains and i havent even offered you anything to drink cup of tea coffee something stronger a cup of tea would go down a treat said annie i have to drive back to harkside just give me a minute make yourself at home annie relaxed on the sofa while harriet went into the kitchen to make tea the kettle must have boiled very quickly because she came back with a teapot and two cups and saucers on a tray in no time harriet had no sooner put the tray down on the low table than juliet doyle drifted in behind her wearing a long green dressing gown that trailed around her black slippers her eyes were puffy from sleeping pills or crying or both and her skin was pale and dry who is then she saw annie you annie stood up yes she said i wanted to come and see how you were how do you think i am besides if anyone should know its you it was supposed to be quite simple look im sorry about what happened annie said but we have our procedures she knew it sounded lame the moment it came out and deserved the contempt it got your procedures got my husband killed it wasnt true of course annie knew there were many contributing factors to patrick doyles death the perfect storm but there was no use in saying that here and now to his bereaved wife as the day had progressed annie had found herself feeling more and more guilty first as she had faced erin doyle and now as she faced erins mother she had begun to resent warburton and the entire afo team for what they had done and for putting her in such an awkward position an injured man with a bloody walking stick and a dicky heart for crying out loud how could anyone mistake that stick for a sword even if the hall light had decided to burn out at the very moment they switched it on but she bottled up her feelings and her guilt and carried on as best she could im sorry she said again then sat down and accepted her cup and saucer from harriet sugar no no thanks harriet turned to juliet can i get you anything love some tea juliet managed a flicker of a smile maybe some hot chocolate if youve got any coming up she gave an anxious glance at annie who nodded then left for the kitchen again juliet doyle sat down and wrapped her robe around her what do you want she asked nothing said annie i cant believe it was just this morning juliet said it seems so distant so long ago grief can do that juliet looked at her sharply how would you know besides i dont think i can even feel grief yet i dont know what i feel those drugs she laughed harshly my husbands dead and i dont even feel anything itll come annie said and when it does youll wish it hadnt she thought i suppose youve got more questions one or two but i honestly did just want to see how you were doing and how harriet was coping but as far as erins future is concerned you can help she hasnt been charged with anything yet what do you mean how can i help the gun right now its a mystery we know nothing about ithow it got on top of her wardrobe how it fell into her possession if it did its something were going to be looking into very closely and if you could help that would go a long way toward influencing the cps and any charges they might bring but i dont know how it got there or where it came from juliet protested besides why should i want to help erin she was partly responsible forfor what happened but shes still your daughter harriet came back with the steaming mug of hot chocolate and handed it to juliet then glanced at annie again who gave her the okay to stay with them you said you thought there was a boyfriend involved annie went on geoff do you know anything more about him no said juliet only what i told you you cant think hes involved in this too well its one explanation i find it hard to believe that the gun was erins but geoff hes got a good job a proper job he sounds like a nice lad hes certainly been a positive influence on our erin so you said before did she usually have problems oh erin always has a boyfriend the boys flock to her moths to a flame but she always seems to be having boyfriend trouble too she certainly knows how to pick them ive been there myself annie said smiling so perhaps an exboyfriend is involved can you help me there any names juliet put her hand to her brow i cant really think now she said my brain feels too soft but ill try later all right thats all im asking said annie it could really help erin she put her empty cup down on the tray stood up and smoothed the front of her skirt thank you for the tea mrs weaver and for your time mrs doyle i really must go harriet please youre very welcome ill see you out juliet doyle sat gazing into space with the mug of hot chocolate at her lips she didnt say goodbye harriet saw annie to the door im sorry she said shes very upset as you can see i understand said annie i honestly didnt come to grill her she opened the door the light was almost gone and a chill breeze ruffled the evening air you know you could do a lot worse than ask tracy banks harriet said annie paused on the doorstep tracy banks yes alan and sandras young lass they share a house in leeds her erin and another girl i dont know her name they did anyway have done for ages didnt you know that dci banks doesnt tell me a lot about his family life annie mumbled i wonder why juliet didnt mention it when she came to the station to see me too upset too agitated i should imagine juliets quite highly strung under that capable and efficient surface if i found a gun in my daughters bedroom i have no idea how id react what id do or say i doubt that id be thinking very clearly true said annie its a tough one anyway ive known both the families for years erin and tracy have been friends since they were knee high to a grasshopper used to be inseparable have they really annie had to think very carefully how to play this one she smiled thanks very much maybe ill have a word with tracy she checked her watch as she headed down the path it was too late to go to leeds tonight annie thought but she would go tomorrow after work on her own time just a social call to see how tracy was doing make sure she wasnt in any trouble too and if she was see if there was any way of sorting it before banks got back park at the other side of the garage there tracy said pointing ahead its by the woods and nobody will see the car there not that anyone passes by here it was almost dark and the headlights showed an impenetrable tangle of branches and tree trunks ahead just beyond the cottage and its small garage fuck me this is isolated said jaff coming to a halt downright bloody creepy if you ask me how does your old man stand it out here itd drive me insane he likes being alone said tracy sad isnt it they got out of the car and she stood for a moment listening all she could hear was the sound of gratly beck trickling over the terraced falls the occasional rustling of an animal in the woods and the distant call of a night bird the waterfall was a sound she liked and she remembered sitting out there on the wall chatting with her dad on summer evenings when she visited during term time muted music playing in the distance billie holiday or miles davis she saw a couple of bats fly across the moon in the cloudstreaked sky she didnt mention them to jaff because you never knew some people were scared of bats and he might be one of them they had never bothered her jaff trod out his cigarette end and heaved his holdall out of the back of the car tracy wondered what was in it it certainly looked heavy shall we go in then she said jaff nodded tracy felt in her pocket for her keys she knew that her dad had installed a new security system over the summer but he had told her the code in case of emergencies as soon as she opened the front door she tapped in the numbers she had memorized the beeping stopped and the green light came on she shut the door behind them and switched on the lamp on the small table to her left tracy had always thought it odd that the front door opened immediately into her fathers small home office where he worked at the computer or sat quietly to read over files and reports it used to be the living room she remembered until the reconstruction after the fire when he had the entertainment room added on at the side and a conservatory built at the back he probably spent more time in those rooms now reading and listening to music the builder had cut a doorway in the wall beside the fireplace over to their left which led to the entertainment room another door to their right led to the narrow wooden stairs up to the bedrooms and the door straight ahead led into the kitchen which was where tracy first took jaff she knew there would be no food around the place so they had picked up an indian takeaway on the road out of leeds it would be cold by now but tracy could reheat it in the microwave jaff took out his mobile and checked for a signal then he turned to tracy have you got a mobile he asked course he held out his hand let me see it why just let me have a look at it please puzzled tracy searched through her bag till she found the mobile she handed it to jaff got an account with the provider yes thought so dont you know they can trace you through this tracy crossed her arms i cant say i do its not something ive ever really had to worry about jaff gave her an amused glance well you do now were both fugitives he switched her phone off then put it in his holdall hey said tracy reaching her hand out just a minute i need that jaff held the bag behind his back no you dont radio silence any emergencies well use this one i picked up at vics its a burner okay a what dont you watch the wire well actually no i tried it once but i dont like any of the characters theres no use watching something if you dont have someone to cheer for jaff laughed i suppose thats one way of looking at it though i cant say i care myself anyway its disposable a throwaway payasyougo no contract nothing in my name or in vics for that matter tracy felt annoyed about being separated from her mobileher lifeline as erin had always teasingly called itbut there was something rather exciting in jaffs talking about radio silence and burners and the fact that they were on the run fugitives as he had said trying to avoid detection she had never done anything like that before had always been little miss goody twoshoes more or less i didnt think it mattered she said there didnt even used to be any coverage out here trust me there is now jaff stretched out his arm and traced the line of her cheek down to her chin which he cupped briefly between his thumb and forefinger and gave her a quick kiss on the lips your old man got any decent music just old stuff mostly tracy said giving a delicious little shudder at his kiss you know sixties pop and jazz lots of opera too nothing wrong with a bit of miles davis or puccini where does he keep it tracy led him into the entertainment room with its large flatscreen tv at the far end surround sound and shelves of cds and dvds hes got the whole place wired for sound she said bit of an anorak really i think its cool said jaff as he flipped through the cds and took them off the shelves in handfuls he would glance quickly at the title then make some comment about it being naff and toss it on the floor finally he seemed to find something he liked and slipped the disc in the player tracy recognized the music my morning jacket evil urges erin had played it constantly back in headingley what on earth was her father doing with that it must be something to do with his last girlfriend sophia tracy thought sophia had more modern tastes in music than he father who seemed stuck in the sixties time warp when he wasnt playing jazz or bloody opera anything to drink jaff asked when they went back into the kitchen well theres some wine tracy checked the fridge for beer but it was empty then she opened bankss drinks cabinet and gave a little curtsy and this trala jesus said jaff likes his booze doesnt he your old man good taste too he picked up a bottle of highland park well save that for later then he went over to the wine rack on the floor by the door to the conservatory and knelt down stonewell shiraz saintémillion côtes de nuits vacqueras amarone barolo ripasso châteauneuf du pape not bad not bad at all none of your cheap asda specials here we can have a real party i think im starting to like your old man what does he do for a living retired civil servant he goes on cruises i think some of the wine belonged to my uncle roy tracy said he was rich but he died dad got the wine and some of his money she found jaff a corkscrew in the drawer and he opened a bottle of châteauneuf du pape while she put the takeaway in the microwave to heat up tracy wasnt sure the wine would go well with vegetable samosas chicken tikka masala and naans but she was willing to try it she noticed that jaff had poured them both a large glass and was busy sitting at the pine breakfast nook rolling a joint when he had finished he licked it put it in his mouth and lit it tracy smiled to herself to think they were doing this in her fathers house she went over to join him and he offered the joint to her she took a hit it was strong stuff it made her head spin but in a nice way she drank a mouthful of wine and nearly choked on it but she got it down the curry wont be long she said want to go in the conservatory to eat its nice out there and the music pipes through sure said jaff sucking on the joint and passing it back to her he edged off the bench then he turned on the small television set that sat on one of the bookcases above the nook lets see if we can find some more news first they caught the brief local broadcast after the news at ten and the days events in eastvale were the lead item this time the reporter seemed to know a little more about what was going on jaff turned up the volume so they could hear what was being said over the music first came the now familiar image of laburnum way crowded with vans and police cars apparently an armed police unit had entered number erins parents house at ten fortyfive that morning and there had been an incident within the house involving the discharge of a weapon one man believed to be the owner of the house had been taken on a stretcher to eastvale general infirmary there was no further word yet on the weapon on the condition of the wounded man or on how or why it had happened but the police said they would hold a press conference in the morning neither erin nor jaff were mentioned one of the neighbors reported that she had seen an armed officer carrying what appeared to be a gunshaped object wrapped in a tea cloth out of the house tracy thought she could see detective inspector annie cabbot on camera in the background talking to someone in uniform of all her fathers girlfriends since he split up with her mum she had liked annie the best jaff turned off the tv damn he said stubbing out the roach its exactly as i thought theyve found the gun gun echoed tracy but jaff ignored her what gun the microwave beeped they took their cartons of food and glasses of wine through to the conservatory where librarian played through extension speakers banks had set up and settled into the cushioned wicker chairs nice said jaff scooping up a mouthful of chicken tikka with his naan im starving tracy noticed that he had found a serviette in the kitchen and had tucked it into the neck of his shirt to catch any sauce that might drip while he ate he might not care much about a clean and tidy flat tracy thought but a dazzling white shirt was obviously important to him and he looked good in it he finished his wine in one long swig go get the bottle will you babe he said to her might as well polish it off tracy laughed and shook her head at himit was a long time since a man had given her orders like thatbut she went to get the wine well its a fine mess youve gotten us into said jaff when she came back what do you mean tracy asked what mess i havent done anything whats erin been up to what gun are they talking about whats going on you know technically one could argue that this is all your fault tracy pointed her thumb at her own chest and laughed moi how do you work that out what happened last week thursday night thats when it all started it was true that last week was when the trouble had begun when erin had left for home she had always been insanely jealous about jaff and she had always suspected that tracy had her sights set on him which she hadnt really though she did think he was fit theyd been at a club in the city center that thursday night wasted on e and hash and it was really late nearly time to go home erin had gone to the loo and tracy was dancing a slow dance with jaff feeling his warmth feeling the sexy sensual edge of the drugs work on her the hardness under his trousers pressing against her she hadnt even been thinking about it it had just happened all of a sudden it seemed they were kissing on the dance floor under the disco light so romantic tongue and everything then someone grabbed tracys arm and pulled her away it was erin of course and she was furious she yelled at tracy hit her across the face called her a slut and a slag a slapper and a whore then ran off jaff dashed after erin leaving tracy alone on the dance floor people staring at her she started to feel nervous and paranoid then her cheek burning the good rush and the sexy glow all gone she grabbed her bag and went after them but they were nowhere in sight they had disappeared down one of the alleys off vicar lane tired and disoriented she had walked to the station and taken a taxi home then crawled into bed where she had slept only fitfully erin hadnt been there when she got back and she wasnt there in the morning when tracy got up to go to work either but tracy thought nothing of that at the time she assumed erin must have made up with jaff and stopped the night at his place but she still wanted to talk to her wanted to apologize and explain that it had just been the mood the e the music blame it on the bossa nova on rio or whatever it was only when tracy got back from work that friday evening that rose told her erin had been by to pick up some things and had said she was going to stay at her parents house for a while tracy had rung erin at home but she wouldnt talk to her except to say that she had split up with jaff and it was all tracys fault it was only a kiss tracy said to jaff dont you think erin overreacted a bit sure but that doesnt help me now does it look whats happened whats wrong tracy asked nobody mentioned you well they wouldnt would they theyd hardly want to tip me off but whats wrong what are you so worried about what was erin doing with a gun or was it her fathers it sounds as if hes been hurt pour me some more wine and ill tell you all about it tracy poured the gun was mine jaff said and now thanks to dear erin the police have got it what jaff paused then said the gun was mine all right that woman the reporter talked to was right it was a gun wrapped in an old tea cloth was it registered of course it wasnt you cant register a handgun in this country these days but why did erin take it jaff ran his hand over his hair and sighed i dont know to spite me to hurt me she must have taken it after that night we had the row the morning after when i left her alone in the flat and you didnt notice it was gone its not exactly something i look at every day besides i told you i was away on business all weekend i only noticed when i checked after that piece we saw on the news back at the flat but where did you get it from what do you need a gun for jaff put his hands to his ears will you stop it with the third degree please too many questions that doesnt matter you dont need to know i was doing a favor for a friend thats all the point is that the police have got it now and if i know erin shell be blabbing away to them in no time if she hasnt already hell hath no fury and all that do you think theyd know to look here for you nobodys looking for me and no they wouldnt think to look here even if they were were safe dont worry besides erin would never tell them your name how do you know she just wouldnt thats all well i appreciate your loyalty to her especially after what happened but they give out stiff enough penalties just for thinking about a gun these days what would you do if pc plod says he can make a nice deal with you if you tell him what you know she wont tell what are you going to do now i need time to think ive got some contacts down south useful contacts but these things take time right now im going to roll another joint bring in the highland park will you the wines finished and a fresh glass this ones got lees in it tracy went into the kitchen she leaned against the fridge and put her head in her hands the weed was misting up her brain she needed to pull herself together what was going on what did she think she was doing here was good little tracy the apple of her daddys eye practically breaking into his house drinking his best booze making a mess with a man she barely knew who had just told her that her best friend had stolen his gun and run away with it how had she got mixed up in all this it was all so confusing but she hadnt been the apple of her daddys eye for quite a while she realized for a few years now ever since she had graduated with a less than desirable degree it had all been about brian brian brian brian the blue lamps my son the rock star and tracy with her lousy degree and her deadend job could rot in hell as far as he was concerned that was the truth of it they exchanged texts occasionally even phone calls but she didnt think he had visited her once since june she wouldnt mind so much but all the time they had been growing up she had been the one who worked hard at school who stayed in night after night to do her homework who was called a swot by the other kids who came top of the class always got great exam results was expected to go places brian was a lazy sod who did everything at the last minute or copied it from one of his mates and then dropped out to start a rock band she had done everything right so why did her father love brian more well screw him she was having her own adventure now and she was damn well going to see it through shed show him shed show them all tracy thumped the fridge and picked up the highland park from the table where jaff had left it she took a long swig from the bottle and it burned all the way down then she grabbed two crystal glasses from the cupboard and tottered back into the conservatory the woman at the wine tasting was definitely smiling at banks he had seen her there yesterday too and had thought she was by herself right now she was talking to an elderly couple from lansing michiganhe knew because hed chatted with them yesterdaybut she was definitely looking his way perhaps she needed rescuing banks smiled back and walked over the man from lansing michiganbob banks remembered who worked in farm machinerysaw him coming well if it isnt my old buddy al what a pleasure to see you again banks said hello to bob and his wife betsy waiting for them to introduce the mystery woman who stood by rather shyly he thought eyes cast down looking into her almostempty wineglass she had appeared tall from a distance but when he got closer banks saw she was probably only about five feet three or four she was asian but banks had no idea where exactly she might have come from or what age she was there was no gray in her glossy black hair which hung down over her shoulders and no lines around her almond eyes this heres teresa said bob all the way from boston teresa looked up at banks and held out her delicate hand he shook it her skin was soft and silky but her grip was firm and dry she wore a couple of rings on her fingers and a silver bracelet that matched her hoop earrings pleased to meet you said banks likewise said teresa can i get anyone another drink i need one myself bob and betsy declined but teresa handed him her glass and said yes ill have a sauvignon blanc please the glass was warm from her palm and banks noticed a little semicircle of pink lipstick on the rim the hotel called it a wine tasting but banks thought it was more of an excuse to get a couple of glasses of alcohol under his belt before dinner a bit of a social mixer and a cheap promotion for the winemaker it wasnt that you actually had to discuss the wines forward leathery nose or fill out a tasting card it was definitely a nice gesture on the part of the hotel as was the tarot reader who sat poring over an arrangement of cards with a portly bearded anxiouslooking man in baggy shorts sitting opposite her on the whole banks had decided he liked america having spent plenty of time back in the pubs in england listening to his mates slag off the usa and its people he found that while americans were easy to ridicule and could often appear obnoxious abroadwhich is something you could just as easily say about the british and the germansat home they were mostly a delight from the family diners and roadside honkytonks with local country bands to the city wine bars hotels and fancy restaurants and they understood the concept of a service industry like now the woman at the bar collected his glasses asked him what he wanted and handed him full fresh ones smiling as she did so saying she hoped he was enjoying the wine maybe she didnt mean it but banks said he was sometimes a smile and a little politeness go a long way try that in your average english pub he thought where the concept of wine runs about as far as red or white and sweet or dry and a grunt is the most likely response to a hello he carried a pinot noir and the sauvignon blanc carefully back through the throng look said bob glancing at his watch im afraid we have to skip out now the show starts in half an hour you folks have a good time and with that they were gone banks handed teresa her glass and the two of them stood in rather awkward silence as the conversations buzzed around them she was wearing a sleeveless flowerprint dress which curved in to accentuate her narrow waist and ended just above her knees cut low enough to show a tantalizing glimpse of smooth cleavage around her neck she wore a string of colored glass beads and had fixed some sort of coral pink flower in her hair just above her right ear her complexion was flawless and smooth her nose small and straight her lips full curved slightly upward at the edges banks would hazard a guess that she had her origins in thailand or perhaps vietnam but he didnt know enough about the differences in the physiognomy of the far eastern countries to be of any certainty she looked as if she smiled a lot but banks sensed there was also a seriousness and sadness about her he probably had an instinct for such things he thought given the way his life had been going lately but it was definitely getting better its a nice hotel isnt it said teresa after a sip of wine yes banks agreed looking around at the mediterraneanthemed decor with its warm terra cotta glow shaded table lamps ornate ceiling and cornices paintings and giltframed mirrors they were standing near a painting of earth resting amid a cornucopia of fruit and foliage in what appeared to be a desert landscape the monaco was a nice hotel banks thought and it also had the advantage of being in one of the most interesting cities he had visited so far on his twoandahalfweek odyssey san francisco banks especially liked cities he could walk around and san francisco was one of the best once you got used to the hills he had already taken the cable car and strolled along the waterfront to golden gate bridge and halfway across it all on his first day finishing the evening with a very expensive martini at the top of the mark looking out on the bay area lights way in the distance tomorrow he planned to walk along fishermans wharf and then perhaps go up coit tower for another view how long are you staying he asked teresa just until wednesday me too said banks youre english arent you yes banks said thank you for not guessing australia or new zealand not that i have anything against those places mind you but i get it a lot oh i wasnt guessing my grandfather was english from hull really i know it in fact i dont live all that far away from hull if you dont mind my asking how on earth did youyou know teresa laughed how does a girl who looks like me have relatives from hull easy dont laugh they owned a chinese restaurant banks couldnt think of anything to say you should see your face she said laughing at him im joking of course im not chinese my grandfather was a sailor and somehow or other he found himself on a french merchant ship he made many visits to the far east and ended up settling in vietnam so you see i too have english blood in me hull blood banks lowered his voice and leaned closer to her its not something id boast about in public he said you know what they say about hell hull and halifax he caught of whiff of her perfume delicate but a little sweet and heady cut with a hint of jasmine no tell me it was the thieves litany from hell hull and halifax may the good lord deliver us sixteenth century there was a particularly nasty jail in hull and the gallows at halifax i think hell rather speaks for itself teresa laughed again you english people are so strange she said ive never been there but id like to go sometime just to see it banks couldnt imagine why anyone would want to go to see hullit wasnt exactly a major tourist destinationthough he enjoyed its rough charm the docks and its downtoearth people hull also had a premier league football team a big plus in the northeast these days maybe one day you will he said look i know this probably sounds a bit forward but are you here by yourself he thought teresa blushed before she averted her eyes yes she said ii then she made a dismissive gesture with her free hand im sorry its a long story maybe youd like to have dinner with me tonight and tell me i dont have any plans and im a good listener teresa put her hand to her chest oh im sorry she said i mean i would you know really but i cant ive already goti have to be somewhere of course said banks embarrassed that he had asked i understand she rested her hand on his arm no its nothing like that she said really im going to have dinner with my son and daughterinlaw and their kids its one of the reasons im here in fact i must hurry i just felt i needed another drink before facing the little terrors my grandchildren that is banks didnt think she was old enough to have grandchildren but he thought it would sound like a terrible comeon line if he told her that i see he said she widened her eyes tomorrow i mean thats if youre not you know you dont tomorrow would be perfect said banks my last night here mine too teresa knocked back the rest of her drink set the glass on a nearby table and took a packet of breath mints from her handbag or purse as they called them in america banks had learned she caught banks looking at her its all right im not an alcoholic im not in the habit of doing this its just with the kids you know and my daughterinlaw is so disapproving religious her fathers a baptist minister shall we meet here fine said banks same time seven shall i make a reservation somewhere let me do it said teresa i know the city okay said banks see you tomorrow then teresa hurried off and banks was left alone the tarot reader glanced over at him with a conspirational smile and for a moment he considered having his fortune told he quickly dismissed the idea it would either depress him or give him false hope he smiled back finished his drink and headed out to see what the evening had to offer the first thing he saw around the corner on taylor was an old street lady being sick in the gutter after she had staggered away three pigeons swooped down and started pecking at the chunks sadly it wasnt such an unusual sight in this area of the city as banks walked along geary a homeless black man in rags followed him for about half a block raging about how mean people were it could have been london banks thought until he got to union square and saw the cable car go by with people hanging off the sides laughing and whooping heard the bell clanging the underground cables thrumming with no particular destination in mind he crossed the square and started wandering the downtown streets sooner or later he knew he would find a friendlylooking bar or restaurant where he could while away the evening the room on the ground floor of the western area headquarters that the officers always used for their press conferences had a small elevated area that passed for a stage and contained all the wooden chairs they could rustle up annie and superintendent gervaise had gone over the developments with acc mclaughlin in regard to what should be mentioned and what they should keep to themselves for the moment the best they could hope for annie thought was to dispel a few rumors and douse the flames before they roared out of control already she felt it was getting a bit late for that patrick doyles death had thrown a spanner in the works not only because it had occurred during a sanctioned police operation but because a taser was involved one piece of information that had come to light at the hospital was that patrick doyle had suffered a heart attack two years ago though he had been responding well to medication and his recent ecgs and echoes had all been good there remained some minor damage to the heart that would never repair itself they should have known that before sending warburton and powell in with tasers thats what the media would say too when they got hold of the story the taser debate sold a lot of newspapers in addition to the local press and tv there were reporters from the major national dailiesmail sun guardian telegraph express times independent mirrorand one or two feature writers looking for something a bit more indepthgun crime todays youth or policerelated deaths the small room was buzzing with speculation and excitement when annie and gervaise entered that tuesday morning and stood by the door to observe acc mclaughlin in action the space wasnt so large that anyone needed a microphone but the conference had been set up so that the proceedings could be recorded on digital video and there were also a couple of tv cameras discreetly positioned in the back corners annie surveyed the room and noticed the backs of a few familiar heads including some she had seen at laburnum way yesterday she leaned against the back wall by the door and sipped coffee from the mug she had brought with her as the reporters settled down and mclaughlin began his prepared statement yesterday morning at ten fortyfive am he began police were called to an address on laburnum way where a loaded firearm had been reported unable to gain permission to enter from the occupants of the house the authorised firearms officers effected entry and during the ensuing operation a man was injured by taser fire he later died of complications in eastvale general infirmary a loaded gun was recovered from the scene now im sure you have many questions and im sure you also understand that my replies have to be necessarily restricted at this point in the investigation hands went up all over the room and the man from the daily mail got the first question i understand that a mr patrick doyle was the registered owner of the house in question was he present at the time of the police assault was he the one who died if so how did it happen i must object to your use of the word assault as unnecessarily inflammatory mclaughlin said the officers were dealing with a potentially very dangerous situation but let me do my best to give you a clear and succinct answer seeing as you know most of it already mr patrick doyle was indeed the registered owner of laburnum way he was on the premises at the time the afos entered he was injured by the discharge of a taser and has sadly since died of unrelated injuries in eastvale general infirmary reactions buzzed about the room and more hands went up mclaughlin picked a local reporter next annie noticed yes ted ted whitelaw from the eastvale gazette stood up you said unrelated injuries was mr doyles death directly caused by the taser discharge or wasnt it that we cant say at the moment said mclaughlin cant or wont someone shouted mclaughlin ignored the lone voice mr doyles body is awaiting a postmortem examination he went on calmly and until that has been carried out we wont be able to say with any degree of certainty exactly what caused his death but isnt it likely whitelaw persisted we all know that tasers can kill this is neither the time nor place to enter into a debate on tasers said mclaughlin well have to await the postmortem results before we know any more i understand that taser deaths are often related to drug use or preexisting heart conditions whitelaw went on did mr doyle have a heart condition did he use drugs patrick doyle had a heart attack two years ago said mclaughlin but according to his doctor he was in excellent shape were the armed officers who entered his house aware of this heart attack they had not been advised of his condition no said mclaughlin why was that its not for me to speculate that remains to be determined was it because you didnt know about it mclaughlin said nothing so would you say the taser could have been responsible for his death whitelaw pressed on this was a very unfortunate incident and it will be investigated thoroughly now youve had more than your fair share of questions ted its time to sit down whitelaw sat smirked and began scribbling on his pad you said the incident would be investigated thoroughly said the daily mirror man can you tell us who by the actions of the officers involved will be investigated by superintendent chambers from the professional standards department who will be working with an outside team brought in by the independent police complaints commission according to protocol but it will be a police investigation wont it asked the woman from the guardian the last time i checked maureen said mclaughlin the police were the best qualified organization in the country to carry out such an investigation whom do you suggest we bring in the librarian a local antiques dealer the little old lady down the street who takes in all the stray cats his scottish accent grew more pronounced with his sarcasm the woman smiled i was merely pointing out that its simply another case of the police investigating their own she said then sat down mclaughlin searched around for another raised hand he didnt have far to look yes you len it was len jepson from the yorkshire post my question is a simple one he began why was a team of authorised firearms officers breaking down the door of a pebbledash semi in a nice middleclass street in eastvale on a quiet monday morning a ripple of laughter went around the room as i said in my statement we had reliable reports that there was a loaded firearm on the premises said mclaughlin and when our duty officers got no response to their requests for peaceful entry the afos were called in its standard procedure len you should know that how many afos were involved asked a reporter from the independent four two at the front and two at the back as per usual sop another hand yes carol you mentioned in your statement earlier that a loaded gun was recovered from the house had it been used the weapon had not been recently discharged who does it belong to that we dont know where is it now asked another voice its been sent to the forensic science services in birmingham for further examination any idea how it came to be in the house that matter is under investigation was it anything to do with erin doyle im sorry but i cant make any further comment at present more hands mclaughlin picked the woman from the darlington stockton times jessica youve been singled out before for your rather shall we say left wing views on some subjects of public concern such as racial profiling overcrowded prisons and the use of police force can you tell our readers what your personal thoughts on this matter are mclaughlin managed a tight smile some people annie knew called him red ron and he pretended not to like it though she thought he was secretly rather proud his father who had worked on the glasgow shipyards after the war had been a strong trade unionist and some of the old socialist ideals had rubbed off on his son my personal opinions on the matter in hand are hardly relevant mclaughlin said the point at issue here is that a life has been tragically lost and a family is in mourning i ask you all to respect their grief do you respect it someone called out isnt it true that youve been interrogating and harassing the doyle family since yesterday morning i cant discuss the details of the ongoing investigation at this stage but i can assure you that there has been no harassment on our part more grumbles and shuffling then another voice spoke out this time it was luke stafford of the sun what part did erin doyle play in all this he asked patrick doyles daughter was the gun hers im not at liberty to discuss such the detail of an ongoing investigation so you think it was she was seen by a neighbor being led out of the house in handcuffs stafford went on and isnt it true that she was mixing with some pretty bad company in leeds drug dealers and such scum annie could see that this was the first mclaughlin had heard of it it was the first she had heard of it too they must have sent a reporter to dig around i cant comment on that mr stafford said mclaughlin but if you have any information pertinent to our investigation i hope youll do your duty as a citizen and come forward with it then he stood up im afraid thats all for now ladies and gentlemen this conference is over annie could tell that the crowd wasnt happy with the way things had gone they had wanted blood and had got merely the scent of it god only knew what they would write now mclaughlin was also clearly not happy on his way out of the door he leaned toward annie and gervaise and said between gritted teeth just what the hell was all that about what do we know about erin doyles life in leeds nothing yet sir said gervaise weve hardly started our investigation yet the newspapers obviously have i suggest you get a move on with it lets bloody well find out whats going on before the red tops get there shall we i want results and i want them fast i also want them first yes sir said gervaise when mclaughlin had gone she turned to annie and said in my office in an hour this could be interesting annie thought she had planned on going down to leeds on her own after work to talk to tracy banks anyway but now the leeds connection was an official part of the investigation she should tell gervaise that erin doyle and tracy banks shared a house there was no doubt that she would find out soon enough anyway but annie also thought that she owed it to banks to keep his daughter out of trouble if she was in any trouble if that was at all possible she decided to tread cautiously and keep her own counsel for the moment at least until she had a better grasp of exactly what it was they were investigating of course the inevitable had happened tracy and jaff had stayed up most of the night first drinking bankss highland park and smoking joints in the conservatory laughing and playing animal collective fleet foxes and my morning jacket then ransacking the dvd collection for something to watch they had settled on one of the jason bourne films basically just a long chase punctuated by closecombat fights and shootouts again jaff had chucked the dvds he didnt like on the floor which was getting quite littered by then tracy remembered the jewel cases crunching and splintering under their feet as they stumbled toward the stairs after that things had got very blurry when tracy awoke at about half past ten in the morning she was lying naked under the duvet in her old bedroom and jaff was nowhere in sight her head ached but if she tried she could piece together most of what had transpired they had taken the bottle of whiskey upstairs to her fathers bedroom and there she had tumbled onto the bed with jaff soon he was kissing her and his hands were groping all over her body she had struggled a bit and thought at one point she might have told him to stop because she didnt feel well she remembered that she felt weird about doing it in her fathers bed and her stomach didnt feel too good after all the whiskey and wine but jaff was urgent soon hed got her blouse off and his hand wandered down the front of her jeans then they were coming off too andwell that was when she was sick she had managed to turn away just in time and do it over the edge of the bed she had thought that would stop him put him off especially when she had to go and rinse her mouth and brush her teeth but when she had come back jeans all zipped up blouse straight and buttoned he had been lying there on his back stark naked smiling and huge and he had started all over again her head had still been spinning and she hadnt been able to find the will or the strength to stop him not that she had really wanted to she didnt want to be thought a tease and she was quite flattered by his attentions she had also felt a little bit better by then and she had quite liked it after all she had fantasized about sex with jaff often enough had even kissed him on the dance floor a lot of girls tracy knew would have swapped places with her in the blink of an eye and she was doing it in her fathers bedroom tracy couldnt really remember what it had been like but she recalled that jaff hadnt taken long despite the amount hed had to drink it had all been over in a matter of moments jaff had then fallen fast asleep or passed out when tracy had been sure that he wasnt going to wake up for a while she had crept out of her fathers room and gone to the other bedroom the one she used to sleep in when she visited and that was where she woke up to bright sunshine and birdsong she had forgotten to close the curtains for a moment she panicked not knowing where she was then she realized she also remembered what she had done and where her clothes were tracy wandered back into bankss bedroom and got dressed jaff was nowhere to be seen and the house was silent after using the bathroom and taking some of bankss paracetamol tracy went downstairs calling jaffs name softly she found him in the conservatory curled up in one of the wicker chairs a halffull glass of whiskey and an overflowing ashtray on the table by his side he looked almost angelic she thoughtlong eyelashes moist lips slightly parted making breathy snuffling sounds she felt like kissing him but she didnt want to disturb him tracy made some tea and toast in the kitchen as quietly as she could then she decided to set about tidying up first she took a bowl of water and a cloth upstairs to clean the sick off the bedroom floorthank god it was wood and not a carpetfeeling herself flush with embarrassmenthow could shethen she moved down to the entertainment room not sure where to begin there she wandered back into the kitchen to refill her cup with tea that was when she thought of her mobile and she realized that while jaff was asleep she could probably get it back it could be ages before he found out what she had done jaff had put it in his holdall she remembered he was probably right about it being dangerous to use she had heard about people being traced through their mobile signalsher dad had mentioned it more than onceand jaff seemed to know what he was talking about it would be nice just to have it with her though it would be a great comfort and she would keep it switched off surely that could do no harm surely jaff couldnt possibly object to that even if he did find out tracy was just about to go over and open jaffs holdall on the breakfast table when he emerged in the conservatory doorway stretching yawning and rubbing his eyes ah well tracy thought maybe later morning she said cup of tea jaff grunted clearly not a morning person tracy made tea anyway he drank it with milk and two sugars pulled a face and told her he preferred coffee she made coffee when he had poured his first cup he said im starving is there anything left to eat tracy had checked both the fridge and freezer not to mention the cupboards there were a couple of tins of baked beans and some soup but that was it they ate cold baked beans from the cans after this weve got to go shopping if we plan on staying here tracy said theres absolutely nothing left to eat we have to go to eastvale how long did you say your old mans going to be away until next monday were all right for a bit have you had a chance to think things out yet sort of and i reckon we should stay here as long as its safe jaff said say till the end of the week well let things quiet down a bit its nice and isolated here nobody to come around asking awkward questions and nobody will think to look for me here even if someone does come you can talk to them tell them everythings okay and send them packing after all its your dads house youve got every right to be here havent you theres even some decent music and movies not to mention the booze i reckon weve lucked out but we cant stay here forever tracy argued vague images in her mind of the further damage jaff might do to her fathers home shed enjoyed last nights careless abandon and wild freedom but it couldnt go on indefinitely i know that babe jaff ambled over and ran his hand over her hair her cheek her breast i just need to put a few plans into operation thats all i know people ive got an old college mate down in clapham who can get us fixed up with new passports no questions asked but i need a few days to make some calls and set things up these things dont come cheap im just saying weve got a good hideaway for now and thats all we need soon as im organized we can go down to london then get out of the country once were over the channel were home free not these days said tracy theres interpol and europol and god knows what other pols ive seen programs on telly you worry too much dont be a drag babe all im saying is that if you know how to disappear you can do it over there and you know jaff kissed her trust me and maybe you should get a different lipstick while were in eastvale pink maybe i dont like that dark red color same goes for the nail varnish it looks slutty get something lighter is there anything you can do about your hair i liked it better without the colored streaks theyll wash out easily enough tracy said she touched her hair and licked her lips selfconsciously then examined her scarlet nails still she felt uneasy she wasnt sure that she wanted to change her appearance and go into forced exile over the channel with jaff much as she fancied him after all she didnt know him very well and she hadnt done anything illegal she wasnt on the run in fact she wasnt even sure what she was doing or why all shed done wrong so far was help make a bit of a mess of her dads place and drink some of his booze but she decided to concentrate on the moment on the now she could deal with the rest later not so far away in his eighteenthcentury manor house on the northwestern fringes of ripon farmer george fanthorpe stood at his picture window and surveyed his domain as he mulled over what he had just been told he could see his own flushed craggy face round shoulders and thick curls of graying hair reflected in the glass beyond his reflection lay the garden his pride and joy with its beautifully trimmed lawn swings slide and a seesaw for the kids topiary hedges cinder paths fountains flower beds and vegetable patches where zenovia liked to spend her time though today she was on a shopping trip in york the high walls that enclosed the garden were mostly covered by climbing vines and partially hidden by trees though where the garden sloped down there were enough gaps in the foliage to make the view of the wensleydale hills beyond masham a magnificent one today the frozen waves of hills had become gray muted humps each higher than the one before it undulating into the far distance fanthorpe loved that view could watch it for hours it was even more spectacular from the bedroom window without any obstruction in the way at all but the walls were necessary they were also topped with broken glass farmer fanthorpe had enemies the grayness of the weather reflected his mood that afternoon there were things happening in the farflung reaches of his empire that he didnt like didnt like at all he prided himself on running a slick operation and the snippets of news that darren had just given him were disturbing his equilibrium to say the least youre certain its jaffs girlfriend he asked half turning certain said darren who had been standing behind him in silence arms folded fanthorpe knew that darren wasnt an alarmist not one to exaggerate or get in a tizzy over nothing cool darren was even in a scrape especially in a scrape and he understood the value of intelligence and they found the shooter in her house parents house it was on the news just a shooter i mean they didnt mention just a shooter the cops shot her old man with a taser he died fanthorpe turned his back on the view and moved closer toward darren tough titty you know this is the last thing we need right now dont you the last thing what with negotiations with the russians going so well the lithuanians falling into line and the albanian deal what does that stupid bastard think hes up to giving his shooter to his fucking girlfriend and where is he he was supposed to be here with the stuff last night last fucking night i dont know said darren maybe he didnt give the gun to her maybe she took it and the stuff the cops arent saying what do you want us to do is ciaran with you in the car fanthorpe paced the room thinking furiously he didnt want to do anything that would draw further unwanted attention to himselfand pretty much all attention was unwanted in his line of work which involved criminal business of astonishing breadth and variety from the merely gray to the outandout black moving things around matching demand with supply whether drugs dirty money luxury cars or unwilling sextrade workers his daughters went to the best school in the county and his beautiful young serbian wife didnt have to get dishpan hands fanthorpe wanted to keep it that way and the manor house too that was a given it often amazed him how utterly still darren could stand he didnt even blink while he waited for the answer and this was all on the news this morning yes has jaffs name been mentioned not yet we think the girl must be keeping shtum it wont last said fanthorpe it never does shes on bail we might still be able to get to her we could fanthorpe held his hand up palm out no he said no i appreciate the sentiment darren i really do and if anyone can do it you and ciaran can but its too risky i know weve done similar things before with witnesses and other problems but the risks far outweigh the advantages this time if she doesnt name him someone else will you cant tell me they dont hang around with other people like themselves dont like to show off a bit flash the cash around you know kids today clubs pubs loose tongues a social circle no if she doesnt tell them someone else will then what first i want you to pay a visit to jaffs flat you know where it is that posh place by the wharf in leeds heres the key hes still got something of mine and i want it back maybe he heard what happened to his girlfriend and took off somewhere took it with him even though he must know what that means butwell have a butchers anyway darren pocketed the key he didnt ask where fanthorpe had got it from it didnt matter no sweat boss and then jaff hes not as tough as he thinks he is once the coppers get to him and they will its only a matter of time before he talks if he hasnt already maybe theyll offer him a deal too and he knows too much about us way too much fanthorpe shook his head i can hardly believe what im hearing jaff you know hes practically my partner ive treated that boy like the son i never had groomed him and this is how he repays me we dont know that hes done anything yet fanthorpe turned red hes given me fucking indigestion for a start and hes a let a gun fall into police hands all because of some stupid tart if thats not enough i dont know what is hes a liability so what do we do darren asked again whatever damage is done we make sure it stops with jaff is there anything concrete to link him to us tenuous at best said darren rumors innuendo nothing we cant deal with no loose ends we cant tie up fanthorpe nodded as i thought well rumors and innuendo are about as much use as a fart in a force nine gale but they can cause a lot of peripheral damage so it stops with jaff see to it right boss find him pay him a visit dont bring him back here take him somewhere nice and quiet find out exactly whats going on let ciaran loose on him if you have to he must be getting thirsty for blood again by now its been a long while get what you can out of him get my stuff back for me give me a bell when youve done it and ill give you further instructions then think you can you handle it darren gave him a look of wonder that he should ask such a question course you can said fanthorpe patting darrens shoulder course you can my lad you havent let me down yet remember it stops with jaff first get my stuff back thenthen he paused and drew the edge of his hand across his throat it stops detective superintendent gervaise occupied her predecessor gristhorpes old office as befitted her rank but it was far less cluttered than it had been when the old man was in residence annie thought far more spickandspan light and airy a fresh coat of pale blue paint had worked wonders the bookcases held works mostly relevant to the job rather than the rows of leatherbound classics gristhorpe had kept there and the volumes were interspersed by the occasional cup or mounted award for dressage and fencing along with silverframed family photographs a white macbook sat open on her orderly desk pushed slightly to one side street sounds drifted in through the open windowa car starting schoolchildren calling out to one another across the market square the sliding door of a large delivery vanalong with the occasional breath of fresh air and the aroma of warm bread wafting up from petes bakery sit down annie said gervaise ive already sent for tea earl grey all right with you fine said annie she crossed her legs and leaned back in the chair gervaise toyed with a paper clip unbending it slowly her cupidsbow lips pursed i like the blond highlights she said finally turning her blue eyes on annie what made you do that i dont know blondes have more fun annie was far from certain that shed done the right thing having her hair cut short in the first place was one step toward a new look but the highlights were quite another and she was still feeling selfconscious about them and are you having more fun not at the moment i must admit me neither gervaise paused and put the paper clip down annie noticed a bubble of blood on the tip of her index finger look annie weve had our ups and downs you and me but i like you annie i want you to know that despite your often misguided loyalty to dci banks taking precedence over correct procedure and even simple common sense at times i like you and i want to build on that how are things what do you mean its a simple question how are things your life in general how are you doing im fine maam and would you tell me if they werent probably not so i havent earned your trust yet its not a matter of annie began then she stopped of what go on annie shook her head i suppose what i meant gervaise went on was you and alan dci banks in the short time ive been here it could hardly have escaped my attention that the two of you have a somewhat special relationship and theres nothing untoward about it if thats what youre getting at annie said no romantic involvement no impropriety whatsoever whoa there gervaise held her hand up palm out methinks the lady doth protest too much but thats by the by i wasnt referring to your sex life ah heres the tea come in sharon put the tray down here please thank you the wpc who had brought the tea smiled nodded and left the room well just let that mash awhile shall we gervaise said then ill play mother no what i meant before was that you actually complement one another quite well in your work i know things have a tendency to go awry once in a while especially when dci banks is around and some things dont always look too good on paper but your cases get solved you get results both of you thank you maam gervaise leaned forward and linked her hands on the desk the tiny bubble of blood smeared the knuckles on her left hand her diamond engagement ring sparkled as it caught the sunlight let me tell you quite frankly that im worried about alan ive been worried about him ever since that business with mi last spring theres somethingdifferent about him and one hearsrumors i understand he split up with his girlfriend too yes sophia annie had never really taken to sophia had always believed she could see right through her see her for what she wasvain and shallow used to being desired and celebrated as a muse by men sophia needed their adoration she fed on it and the attentions of an older attractive man of bankss stature had flattered her ego for a while until a better offer came along someone who would write poems or songs for her perhaps but she couldnt say that to gervaise it would sound like sour grapes as if it were born out of envy and jealousy which it partly was since banks had split up with sophia and become uncommunicative annie had found herself frequently thinking of their short time together he had been hers once could she have hung on to him should she have tried even taken a transfer to some other county force not too far away so that they wouldnt have to work together because that had been the problem she had discovered she hadnt been able to work alongside him and be romantically involved is there more to it than that annie snapped herself back to the present im sorry i asked if there was anything else that was worrying him im not asking you to betray any sort of trust you understand i ask entirely out of concern for his welfare and for yours too of course for the team no i dont think so said annie not that i can think of at least theres nothing hes said anything to me about its just gervaise leaned forward a fraction more what oh nothing i had the same feeling too thats all that something else was going on that he was haunted by something or that hed reached the end of something but he doesnt confide in me maybe hes gone away looking for new beginnings then lets hope he finds some when exactly is he due back at work its in my files somewhere monday isnt it thats right as gervaise shuffled some papers on her desk she noticed the blood picked up a tissue and wiped it off she pressed a couple of keys on her macbook im just a bit concerned about him walking right into the middle of all this especially as he knows the doyles hell deal with it said annie with more conviction than she felt and hes resilient whatever happens hell come through we shouldnt worry about him too much i suppose we have enough to worry about as it is what are we going to do do as were told of course which is to work in conjunction with superintendent chambers and his team and not to step on his toes i understand hes bringing in a couple of psd officers from greater manchester to conduct the investigation for him firearms cadre superintendent trethowan will continue to manage the scene the doyle house and us our job remains the gun found in the possession of erin doyle or should i say found in her bedroom as yet we have no proof who put it there gervaise looked at her watch i think the preliminary report on the firearm from birmingham should be with us before todays over ill be sio on this and you will be my deputy which means that you and winsome and harry potter will be doing most of the work as you can imagine things being what they are around here you can have dc masterson too she needs to get her feet wet im guessing but i think much of my time will be taken up by meetings and discussions of various kinds not to mention bloody paperwork i dont want any complaints about you from the family or from superintendent chambers do i make myself clear yes i trust you have appointed a family liaison officer patricia yu shed done the requisite courses and has over a years experience very well id like you to proceed very carefully with the investigation and keep me posted regular reports she tapped her desk here in my office yes said annie she stood up to leave and annie annie turned at the door and raised her eyebrows watch your back i dont trust chambers any more than you do she paused and about dci banks if anythingwell you know what i mean yes i know said annie it was after lunchtime before tracy got jaff on the road to eastvale he had dragged his feet so much that she had offered to go and do the shopping alone which would have suited her far better but he wouldnt have any of it she wasnt leaving his sight he told her such devotion she replied he missed the sarcasm the roads and the swainsdale villages were busy with tourist traffic and nobody paid vics silvergray ford focus any special attention as they passed through gratly helmthorpe or fortford jaff drove cautiously hovering just above the speed limit the whole way like most of the other cars except when he got stuck behind a tractor and slowed to a crawl cursing so much that tracy cracked up laughing its amazing she said like youve never been in the country before jaff laughed with her ive been on worse roads than this babe but youre right tractors and caravans im with jeremy clarkson on that when they got to eastvale the sky had clouded over they parked in the payanddisplay under the swainsdale centre and took the escalator up to the shops the center itself was bustling with people for a moment tracy worried that she might bump into someone who recognized her then she realized it didnt matter if she did nobody knew what was going on with her and jaff nobody knew they were lying low until a spot of bother passed over sometimes tracy wondered if anybody actually went out to work anymore she knew the economy was bad but it seemed strange to her that if people were unemployed or simply hadnt any money they were in the shopping center all the time unless they just came there to sigh through the windows at things they couldnt afford which seemed stupid most of the people she saw were young enough to have jobs if there were any some were mothers pushing their kids in prams of course or trailing them around by the hand but others didnt look much more than schoolleaving age and very few of the shoppers seemed old enough to be pensioners the two of them blended in easily to the crowd they bought newspapers at wh smiths and picked up a couple of cds and dvds at hmv jaff bought three white shirts a boss sports jacket and a new pair of designer jeans he eyed tracy up and down you know you could do with some new clothes too babe he said i cant say that charityshop look really does a lot for you tracy felt hurt it was true that most of the clothes she was wearing came from charity shops but no one had told her before that they didnt look good on her it wasnt as if she bought grannys castoffs or anything like that but jaff led her around the shops and she ended up with some levis a blue silk blouse a burgundy pencil skirt with a matching top and several expensive tshirts of various colors he also bought her a fitted kidleather jacket to replace the ripped denim one she was wearing jaff said he hated it so she threw it in a rubbish bin when tracy tried the clothes on she felt sophisticated more like a francesca than ever and when she examined herself in the changingroom mirror she realized that she would probably look even better when she had washed the streaks out of her hair she would do that when they got back to her dads cottage she had her mothers coloringnatural blond hair and dark eyebrowsand now that she had her hair cut short in a sort of pixieish spiky style and was wearing good clothes she resembled a professional young woman more than a student the pencil skirt emphasized her slim waist and hips and the top made the best of her small breasts she liked what she saw and it amazed her that jaff had such immaculate taste even regarding the clothes she should wear he even bought her some sexy underwear and a nice leather gucci shoulder bag to carry everything in instead of the fraying canvas book bag shed been using for ages that followed the denim jacket into the rubbish bin tracy needed to buy shampoo and conditioner pink lipstick the shade jaff had said he liked some nailvarnish remover and a toothbrush and toothpaste she had none of these things in her shoulder bag which was all she had brought with her from leeds and had had to use her fathers toiletries that morning they went to superdrug where tracy found what she needed when she reached for her debit card ready to pay jaff took hold of her hand what do you think youre doing he whispered are you crazy or something ive got no cash left jaff tracy protested i need these things ive got to pay somehow well you cant use your debit or credit cards he whispered glancing around they can be traced its like the first thing they do didnt you know that arent you taking this seriously but you used yours i saw you its corporate and it cant be traced to me but why never mind tracy realized that she hadnt got used to thinking like a fugitive perhaps she wasnt taking it seriously more as a fun game as makebelieve she wasnt sure that she wanted to grasp the full reality of the situation either but for the moment she knew that she had to go along with jaff soon she was certain everything would be settled and they could all go back to the way things were whatever that was but for now she had to be up to the adventure nobodys looking for me she said doesnt matter they might be they will be its best to be cautious okay babe here its not very much take this jaff gave her a lopsided grin and pulled a wad of cash from his pocket he discreetly peeled off a couple of of twentypound notes and handed them to her this should cover it keep the change in case you see anything else you fancy dont even think of using your plastic if you need anything come to me tracy took the money she knew better than to ask where it had come from just as she had known not to ask him why he was carrying an untraceable credit card this whole shopping expediton was making her head spin making her feel a bit scared and perhaps a bit excited last of all they went to the tescos and bought lots of readytocook meals things they could just nuke in the microwave like pizza quiches chicken kievs and curries mostly along with eggs bread bacon milk chocolate bars and biscuits for when they got the munchies more tins of baked beans cheese and packaged meats for sandwiches that would see them through until the end of the week tracy thought they didnt need to buy wine jaff said because her father had more than enough quality stuff for them to be going on with back at the car they loaded their purchases in the boot that was fun tracy said what do you want to do next im hungry said jaff want to go for a pub lunch or something sure said tracy well stop somewhere on the way back she was standing by the car looking down over the terraced gardens and the river which rushed along over rocks in little waterfalls below the steep castle walls to her right she remembered walking there with her father when she was younger holding his hand tight as they passed near the edge of the sheer drop afraid of falling asking him how the little flowers could grow out of the crumbling stone he told her they were called rosebay willow herb and they could also grow after forest fires she thought what a lovely name that was for something so strong and durable sometimes the wind was so wild that she thought it would blow them both away like autumn leaves but he had said he wouldnt ever let her go and he never had not until now when she turned to jaff she had tears in her eyes what is it he asked just the wind and the sun i should have bought some sunglasses back at superdrug look theres still an hour left on the meter would you like to go and have a look at where erin lives you know the street on the news last night we can see if theres still anything going on there is it near here not far okay sure said jaff but lets be careful they left the shopping center by the york road exit and crossed the cobbled market square past the queens arms and left along market street tracy was wearing her new tightfit levis and a crisp white tshirt that felt soft and sexy against her skin she felt good jaff took hold of her hand they passed the police station where her dad worked but of course she couldnt say anything to jaff she saw a sudden image of the bed and the mess they had made back at the cottage whiskey stains and worse on her fathers sheets they hadnt gone far when jaff started to complain about the distance and how hungry he was but tracy just laughed at him again youre a real city boy she said ill bet you dont walk anywhere thats what cars are for he said is it much further just past that next zebra crossing even before they got to laburnum way careful to stay on the other side of market street tracy could tell that the police hadnt finished there yet the culdesac wasnt blocked offthe people who lived there could come and go as they pleasedbut police cars and vans parked at awkward angles would make it difficult for anyone driving in and out and would certainly discourage sightseers erins house had police tape on the gate and over the doortracy could just see the blueandwhite patternand two uniformed officers stood on guard as tracy and jaff gazed surreptitiously just two young lovers passing by some men came out of the front door wearing white coveralls and elastic covers for their hair and shoes the socos tracy realized she had met some of them and she hoped that no one recognized her but how could they the way she looked now besides she reminded herself she wasnt wanted for anything and there was no way theyd know who jaff was even if they were looking for him nobody seemed to pay any attention to them it was one thing to watch it on tv tracy thought but quite another to see it like this at close quarters as it was happening jesus christ said jaff picking up the pace a bit when he saw the socos is that where she lives this looks serious they did find a gun tracy reminded him they take that very seriously and you dont often get that sort of thing in a nice middleclass street like laburnum way i dont suppose you do said jaff it is a bit baywindow but even sodoes it really take that many of them tracy could have told them that it did and why what each one of them did and how long they might be there but she held her tongue how would i know we can go back another way if you like she said leading him down a street to the left that linked up with york road near the college its a bit longer but we dont have to walk past the police again anyway she said we dont even know that anyones looking for you yet do we they will be jaff said if not now then soon even if erin keeps quiet someones bound to talk theyll track down her other friends people from the clubs the restaurant where she works we have to be careful he looked around and gave a little shudder come on he said lets get back to the car and find somewhere to eat outside town ill feel safer away from here banks walked along fishermans wharf in the morning sunshine eating fresh crab cakes in a piquant red sauce from a paper carton the golden gate bridge at his back he watched the tour boat sailing over to alcatraz and wondered if he should go maybe not he decided after all historic or not it would be too much like a busmans holiday touring a prison and being shut in a cell even if al capone had once been there held no real appeal for him not even for a minute and he was supposed to be getting away from all that or so he had thought he knew he couldnt run away from his problems that he would take them with him wherever he went but a change of scene and time to think had at least seemed essential a trip would give him new sensations new experiences and at best it would inspire him at worst it would be just another collection of holiday snaps he would download to his computer and probably never look at again the horror of the bomb blast he had witnessed in london and the sense of guilt that he had been responsible for an innocent mans death still kept him awake at night he could smell the smoke see the blood and hear the screams every time he laid his head down and his car crashed in slow motion time after time he stared at the body sprawled bleeding on the bonnet of his porsche while government agents told him it was probably the best thing that could have happened for all concerned he remembered the rain blood and tears that streaked down his face on his long walk home in the dark could he have handled things differently should he have probably but he hadnt what was done was done and he couldnt run away from it simply by taking a flight to america then there was sophias betrayal the image of her sitting across the table from another man in the wine bar and later on at her front door of the mans hand resting proprietarily on the small of her back as she put her key in the lock glanced quickly up and down the street and invited him into her house still lingered her subsequent silence had hurt even more he had left phone messages written letters but he had heard nothing it was like dropping a stone into a deep dark chasm and waiting for a splash or echo that never came no cry in the dark nothing she had said she needed time space and she was certainly sticking to that after nearly two months of silence banks received a banal chatty email from sophia which ended ive moved on you should do the same have a good life it was sent from her blackberry for gods sake or so it informed him at the bottom definitely not with a bang much more of a whimper at least that quickly put paid to any lingering hopes of romantic reconciliation he might have been harboring after that he felt mainly contempt for sophia he didnt like feeling that way about someone he had once loved so he was working on indifference it was the closest he could come to forgiveness banks leaned against the wooden railing of a pier and stared across the bay at mount tamalpais the sleeping maiden he could make out her shape easily enoughthe long flowing hair the soft curve of her breasts the flat belly and thighs she had drowned while swimming to meet her lover or she had lain down there in dejection after being spurned and had wept her tears into the bay depending on which version you believed banks glanced down into the ruffled blue water then back toward the majestic bridge more orange than gold to his eye he felt a sense of inner peace that he hadnt had before he came away and he thought of that night in the desert it was the third or fourth day of his trip and he was in arizona he had visited the grand canyon and sedona and he now planned on driving across the desert from phoenix to los angeles then up the coast to san francisco as he drove he played desert music on the car stereo through his ipod adapter or what he thought of as desert music captain beefheart lucinda williamss car wheels on a gravel road and dylans soundtrack from pat garrett and billy the kid he also played a lot of handel oratorios very loud somehow they seemed to chime with the sense of the place for him he had driven a meandering course on and off interstate stopping occasionally to visit various attractions here he had experienced the desert landscape the way he had always imagined it mile after mile of nothing but sagebrush tumbleweed clumps of prickly pear and and tall gangly saguaro cacti unrelenting dry heat in the evening the long range of jagged peaks that never seemed to get any nearer caught the fading light all earthy shades of terra cotta red and brown that night he had found a motel off the beaten track it wasnt quite the bates motel but it had a similar creepy rundown atmosphere about it fortunately without the big eerie house on the hill behind the desk clerk was sixty if he was a day a bald mexican with a paunch a pancho villa mustache and a case of five oclock shadow so advanced it was probably six or seven oclock on his face though it still stopped short of a beard when the clerk smiled banks noticed that he was missing his two upper front teeth at least he didnt resemble norman bates in the slightest and there wasnt a stuffed animal in sight the room banks took was clean and quiet and the small friendly diner next door served a good steak though he would probably have had to travel a long way for a decent bottle of wine to accompany it instead he settled for a jug of cheap california burgundy around two in the morning unable to sleep banks got up and walked outside the desert nights were cool but in august that meant the temperature went down from about anywhere between and to or so still tshirt weather for a british tourist even so banks found he needed his light wind cheater that night as he struck out from the motel across the road into open desert the stars shone bright and clear more than he had ever seen before so close he felt he could reach out and grab a handful along with a yellow sickle moon not for the first time banks wished he could recognize more constellations than orion and the big dipper he could see the milky way and trails of distant nebulae between the stars was that the crab nebula overhead in front of him he could just make out the sawtoothed silhouette of a mountain range in the far distance he hadnt really known what to expect from his journey but that night he realized there was something he wanted something ineffable inchoate and suddenly it didnt seem so unbelievable that he might get it from a place such as this he felt an odd tingle of anticipation as if he was on the verge of what he had been waiting for his revelation his epiphany someone had once told him that there were places you could go that would change you which was probably why so many kids in the sixties set off for india or kathmandu it might be a country a culture religion or perhaps a certain kind of landscapethe ocean mountains a desert it might be a place associated with a powerful childhood experience or with a dream sometimes perhaps you just didnt know but it changed you banks had been having a dream from time to time since his childhood and it stayed with him he was swimming underwater through waving fronds that tried to grab him and pull him down the dark rocks below terrified him with their shifting shapes and with the thought of what lurked in the depths between them through underwater tunnels that led to other tunnels narrower deeper and darker he was running out of air his lungs straining his strength failing when he finally broke the waters surface and found himself on the edge of paradise the damn thing was that he couldnt remember anything about it it was a special place he knew that much one that had the power to change him and heal him but all he remembered was the journey the darkness the fear and agony of his bursting lungs and that blissful moment when water ceased to be water and became air when darkness became light and the white sand ledsomewhere green and pure for so long he seemed to have been struggling in the dark and in that desert night when the motels blinking red neon was nothing but a dot on the horizon he found an epiphany of a kind but it was nothing momentous no road to damascus no lightning strike of revelation or enlightenment as he had hoped for first he was aware only of the silence when he stopped a silence unlike any he had ever knownnothing rustling no animal sounds no birdsong no distant cars or lorries nothing just the smell of dry earth and the tall still silhouettes of the saguaro cacti arms reaching out and up all around him the epiphany when it came was nothing more than a simple fleeting ripple of happiness that went through him as a light cool breeze might brush ones skin on a hot day he felt as if something had clicked into place like the final number of a combination lock the tumblers finding their positions that was all he wasnt even sure whether it was something opening or closing but he knew that he would be okay that he was okay that he could deal with things his problems didnt matter in the midst of the desert nightthe myriad stars above and grains of sand under his feet he would still hurt he would still carry the burden of his past mistakes he would still feel the deep ache of loss and betrayal and guilt and horror paradise would always remain just beyond his reach but he would go on somehow perhaps not in the same way he had been doing the job he did but somehow future uncertain prospects unclear end always near he remembered thinking that he was a long long way from home but oddly enough he didnt feel so far away at that moment banks took one more look at the dark range of peaks on the horizon then he turned and walked back to the blinking pinpoint of light he slept like a baby until the blinding sunlight found him through a chink in the curtains at nine oclock the following morning after a huge breakfast of eggs and ham and hash browns at the diner he checked out and headed for the interstate to los angeles with vieux farka tourés slow jam playing loudly through the car stereo the satnav got annie to leeds easily enough after work on tuesday but it had a difficult time negotiating the twists and turns of headingley once off otley road and she found herself getting more and more frustrated that it was the tail end of rush hour didnt help either but she wanted to time her arrival for roughly that period between when people get home from work and before they go out again for the evening she knew that tracy banks worked at waterstones on albion street in the city center and that her hours were probably irregular but she didnt think the shop stayed open particularly late the preliminary gun report hadnt told them much except that they were dealing with a mm smith wesson automatic over twenty years old and the serial number had been filed down there were ways of recovering it of course but they would take time as yet too there was no record of a registered owner it would also take some time to run the weapon through the national firearms forensic intelligence database and check it for fingerprints to run through ident if they wanted to know whether the gun had been used in the commission of a crimewhich of course they didit would have to be fired under controlled circumstances and the bullet compared with the information in the integrated ballistics identification system if the result was positive to be absolutely certain the bullet would then have to be compared with the actual bullet andor cartridge casing fired during the crime rush or not this would all take time there was no explanation yet of how the gun had come into erin doyles possession and erin still wasnt talking a boyfriend was everyones natural assumption juliet doyle had mentioned someone called geoff but rose preston had told the leeds police that erins boyfriend was called jaff an easy mistake to make if you didnt see it written down whoever he was they hadnt got a line on him yet when the satnav told annie that she had reached her destination she was still two streets away but she managed to find her way easily enough with the aid of a simple a to z the house was the kind of property that had probably belonged to a moderately wealthy family between the wars annie guessed as she took in the weathered sandstone gables and slate roof the lawn surrounded by a low wall was overgrown and weeds were poking between the flagstones of the path when annie got out of the car she noticed that it had just begun to rain more of a fine drizzle really so much for the latesummer sunshine she knocked at the door and a young woman she didnt recognize opened it she was wearing oval glasses with black rims a short skirt black tights and a black tshirt emblazoned with the logo scars on a rock band annie guessed her light brown hair was tied in a ponytail annie introduced herself and showed her warrant card the girl said her name was rose preston and asked her in as if a visit from the police were the most natural thing in the world i was just having my dinner if thats all right rose said fine said annie following her into the living room where rose picked up a fork and a plate of pastaprobably microwavedfrom the coffee table and sat with her legs folded under her on the armchair opposite the tv where emmerdale had just begun sorry to interrupt your program annie said oh that its nothing just company while i eat rose picked up the remote from the arm of the sofa pointed it at the tv set and pressed chastity dingle disappeared in the midst of an angry tirade directed toward paddy id have thought you had more than enough company sharing with two other girls annie said remembering her own student days if they were ever here anyway thats what ive come to see you about im looking for tracy banks is she home yet rose seemed confused tracy banks did you say theres no one with that name lives here annie confirmed the address with rose again she was certain it was the same one that harriet weaver had given her the previous evening though she could have transposed a number the area was full of student housing are you sure she asked theres francesca banks said rose maybe its her sister or something or her middle name annie suggested she didnt think tracy had a middle name but it was possible shes about five foot five twentyfour blond hair to her shoulders dark eyebrows has a degree in history from the university of leeds comes from eastvale works at waterstones she grew up with erin doyle the other girl who lives here that sounds like francesca rose said must be her middle name then but it must be a while since youve seen her rose added what do you mean she got her hair cut short a few weeks ago and put a few colored streaks in it pink purple you know nothing permanent but she looks different she got a tattoo and a couple of piercings as well piercings yeah nothing drastic eyebrow and just below the lower lip rose paused and smiled i mean there may be others she hasnt told me about more intimate ones but i dont think so that didnt sound like the tracy banks annie knew a bright sensible hardworking young woman with good prospects working at a temporary job in a bookshop until something more like a career came along banks was always so proud of her still people change and fashions especially among the young dont necessarily mean that much annie had worn some pretty weird clothes in her time including torn jeans and a safety pin through her ear some of the nicest most creative intelligent people she had ever met had had green mohawks ragged tshirts and rings though their noses even so it was a bit of a shock to hear about tracys makeover the new name too francesca what was all that about had she joined a cult or something is she here annie asked no shes gone gone where i dont know i dont know anything nobody ever tells me anything hold on a minute rose what are you talking about rose put her bowl down on the table im the new girl erin and francesca have been friends for years they grew up together jasmine left to get married and im the new girl ive only been here since just before francesca had her hair done and all i dont think i fit in do you know where trawhere francesca is no when did she go out last night did she come home no i havent seen her since teatime yesterday and ive been here all the time i dont have a job yet so youre saying she went out yesterday evening and hasnt been back yes she came home from work as usual i told her the police had been to search the place then she got all panicky and dashed off is that unusual or does she often stay out all night well it wouldnt be the first time if you know what i mean did she take anything with her an overnight bag or something you know as if she were going away for a few days no just her ripped denim jacket and her tatty shoulder bag she didnt even take a toothbrush mind you the shoulder bags probably big enough to get the kitchen sink in if you wanted to i dont know what all she keeps in it and youre sure youve no idea where she went whats happening with erin where is she erins fine shes being cared for you heard about her father rose nodded on the news tonight its terrible you shouldnt use those things on people you know theyre for animals even thats cruelty im worried about francesca said annie are you sure you have no idea where she went where she might be i think she might have gone to see jaff jaff yes erins boyfriend to be honest i think there was something going on there if you know what i mean i dont like to tell tales out of school but i think maybe francesca fancied him too you can tell about these things theres been a bit of friction between them lately erin and francesca this past week yes before erin went home so you think erin might have been jealous of francesca and this jaff getting too close i think so i cant be sure but i think so hes very handsome i know id be jealous all the time if he was my boyfriend some hope of that annie leaned forward and clasped her hands on her knees this is very important rose at what point did tracy or francesca start to panic and decide to go out it was after shed rung erins house in eastvale who did she talk to i dont know she didnt talk to anyone really i just heard her ask if she was speaking to mr doyle then she hung up in a hurry and dashed off if tracy had made the call to erins house at around seven oclock yesterday evening annie thought then a police officer would have almost certainly answered the phone as the doyle house was already under lockdown patrick doyle was dead juliet was at harriet weavers and erin herself was on police bail in a bandb near the castle the officer who answered would have asked who was calling and why something about that phone call had scared tracy off but why what was she hiding had you already talked to her about jaff annie asked thinking that this was probably the geoff to whom juliet doyle had referred yes she asked if i had mentioned him or her to the police and had you why wouldnt i ive got nothing to hide but maybe jaff and tracy had annie thought is jaff erins boyfriends real name she asked its short for jaffar i dont know his last name is he asian half indian or something do you know where he lives granary wharf but i dont know the address its an old converted warehouse with a restaurant on the ground floor the three of us were walking past once just when id decided to take the room wed been out celebrating with a drink somewhere nearby anyway erin pointed it out like she was really proud you know showing off that her boyfriend had money and does he seems to have granary wharf was certainly a posh address even annie had heard of it now was the time she should ring the station she realized and report her findings to superintendent gervaise but if she did that it would be out of her hands beyond her control if bankss daughter was in trouble annie wanted to see what she could do to nip it in the bud if it wasnt already too late and she couldnt do that with gervaise holding her back do you mind if i have a quick look at francescas room while im here she asked no skin off my nose its the second door on the left at the top of the landing annie climbed the stairs and opened the door it was a spacious enough room painted mauve and furnished like the usual student bedsit with a desk and chair bookcases chest of drawers full of underwear and tshirts and a closet built into the wall where tracy hung her dresses skirts tops and jeans there were a compact cd player and a small stack of cdsflorence and the machine adele emmy the great kaiser chiefs arctic monkeys the killers beside them stood a few books mostly history which had been tracys subject at university and a few modern novels the kite runner the time travellers wife the thirteenth tale there was no sign of a computer or a mobile if tracy had a phone as annie was certain she must have then she had taken it with her annie opened the drawer on the bedside table and found some personal items tampons condoms an old prescription for a yeast infection and some cheap jewelry when she went back downstairs rose was on the living room couch and the tv was on again eastenders do you happen to know francescas mobile number annie asked sure rose picked up her own mobile from the low coffee table and read out a number annie called no response she thanked rose then said good night and set off home for harkside banks sat in vesuvios tavern at the table beside the door with his back to the window sipping his pint of anchor steam and examining the copy of the maltese falcon that he had just bought at city lights next door it was one of his favorite films but he had never read the book hammett had written about san francisco in the thirties and apparently there were still places associated with him maybe banks would offer to take teresa to johns bar grill where sam spade had enjoyed his chops banks had read about it in the guidebook and knew the restaurant was still in business and not too far from their hotel for now though he was visiting an old beatnik haunt on columbus and the man at the bar in the beret talking to the frizzyhaired barmaid looked as if he might have been there since jack kerouacs time the bar had a high ceiling and an upper balcony empty at that time of day a screen behind the bar flashed random surreal images and the walls were covered with old framed newspaper articles about san franciscos history banks had walked all the way from fishermans wharf through north beach with its italian cafés and weddingcake houses and the cold beer was going down nicely los angeles and his twoday drive up the pacific coast highway were just memories now that he was in san francisco near the end of his trip his thoughts drifted from the book he was reading to that night in the desert as they often had to that strange fleeting kiss of happiness at first it had surprised him that he was a stranger to it that it was something he barely remembered feeling before except perhaps once or twice as a child he had always possessed too restless a nature and restlessness precludes lasting happiness he had never stopped to smell the flowers or listen to the ocean and if he wasnt restless he usually felt a kind of vague mellow sadness punctuated by the occasional eruption of anger or irritation there had been moments of bliss of course but they were infrequent and ephemeral and he often wondered if such moments could ever be sustainable was that the nature of happiness that it came and went like a breath of desert air that it was something we might only define by its absence or was it just his nature he would probably never know and what did it really matter anyway everything changes nothing changes his revelation was that there was no revelation to change his life in any significant way he would have to make a leap of faith and accept such new tenets new versions of the truth cultivate new patterns of behavior bow to some authority even he would have to believe and he didnt think he could do that he didnt even think he wanted to so he would go on uncomfortably inhabiting his own skin taking happiness like that allsobrief desert breeze where he could find it beauty where it revealed itself to him and try not to dwell too much on his failures and losses the count was way too highkay linda sandra annie michelle sophia and if he did get a little maudlin and sentimental once in a while so be it he could revel in the lovelorn wisdom of dylan billie holiday nick cave and leonard cohen with the best of them and drink fine wine or whiskey till he fell asleep on the sofa with finely wrought phrases about lifes sadness and irony love lost or unrequited ringing in his ears the rest of the time there were beethoven schubert bill evans miles and trane and that was about as much revelation and enlightenment as he was likely to get in this lifetime he decided banks stretched like a cat in the sunlight through the window and drank some anchor steam a cigarette would have gone down nicely too but they were a thing of the past now not just for him but even for pubs like this kerouac and ginsberg would be turning in their graves eastvale seemed lightyears away though banks realized that he was actually starting to look forward to going home he didnt miss the job but he missed annie winsome gristhorpe hatchley even gervaise and harry potter they were the closest he had to friends outside his parents and brian and tracy whom he also missed he missed his cottage by the beck and woods his cds and dvds to hell with sophia la belle dame sans merci let her grapple with her own demons he had had enough everything comes around but before he left for home tomorrow he had a date with a beautiful interesting woman called teresa he finished his pint and headed out on to columbus noticing the sign on the corner jack kerouac alley he plugged in his ipod which played a jaunty live version of the grateful deads scarlet begonias from winterland perfect for a beautiful day in san francisco then he walked down the hill and bore right through the lower end of chinatown across union square toward his hotel christ what on earth do you lot want this time rose preston said when she opened the door to let the two men in about an hour after annie had left she was just in the middle of watching holby city which she did like and she really didnt want to be disturbed the two men exchanged puzzled glances sorry rose said its all right come in i just hope it wont take long thats all ah watching holby city i see said the tallest of the two he had big shoulders and a tanned shiny bald head whereas his colleague was slight and roundshouldered with wispy ginger hair and a pale almost albino complexion i dont mind that myself though its a little gruesome for my tastes sometimes still i wish i got to see it more often but with the hours on this jobanyway im ds sandalwood and this heres my colleague dc watkins just pretend hes not here sandalwood flashed a warrant card rose didnt even bother to look shed seen enough of them over the past two days to last her a lifetime what is it this time she asked honest theres nothing more i can tell you im new here i dont really know the other girls what do you mean this time well you can hardly fail to be aware that this isnt the first visit ive had from the police lately can you or dont you even talk to each other the lines of communication do get jammed up once in a while i must admit said sandalwood as he spoke watkins was busy poking around the room looking under cushions and in the sideboard drawers whats he doing rose asked like i said dont mind him he cant help himself habitual nosey parker stands him in good stead in this job sometimes though i can tell you like a bloodhound any chance of a cuppa love id hoped you wouldnt be staying long enough watkins glanced toward sandalwood from over by the bookcase shes got quite a gob on her dont she he said he had a thin squeaky voice which reminded rose of fingernails grating on a blackboard now now said sandalwood theres no need to fall out why dont you go and have a good shufti around the rest of the house while the young lady here and i have a little chinwag watkins grunted and left the room rose could hear him climbing the stairs whats he doing she said he cant just poke around wherever he wants like that wheres your warrant rose made to go after watkins but she felt a grip like a circus strongmans around her upper arm first it hurt then her whole arm went numb ow she yelled trying to yank her arm away gerroff but sandalwood held on and dragged her down into a chair none too gently sit down young lady he said between gritted teeth and speak when youre spoken to it was remarkable how still he remained through all this rose thought not moving a muscle that didnt need to be moved she straightened her glasses who are you she said youre not police youre the blow wasnt hard but it was enough to stop rose in her tracks and she hadnt seen it coming shut up said sandalwood pointing a stubby finger at her just shut the fuck up or ill get dc watkins back down here and youll know what real pain is he enjoys hurting people watkins does for me its just a part of the job rose didnt need telling twice her arm was beginning to ache and her cheek stung she started to cry and you can shut off the waterworks too sandalwood said they wont get you anywhere with me what do you want rose instinctively crossed her legs aware that her skirt had ridden up and she was probably showing far too much thigh sandalwood caught her gesture and laughed its all right love he said dont worry thats not what were after tempting as it looks rose flushed and curled her fists tight on her lap she felt powerless and scared if shed had a gun she would have shot sandalwood right there and then she could hear the other one watkins moving about upstairs he was in her room now going through her things and the thought made her flesh crawl a couple of simple questions straight answers from you and were gone said sandalwood deal rose said nothing just started down at her fists watching her knuckles turning white deal sandalwood said again rose nodded all she wanted was for them to be gone the doctors were working desperately over a bloody patient in holby city suddenly it didnt seem as exciting as it once had wheres erin doyle you must know said rose its been on telly and in all the papers shes in eastvale probably in jail now sandalwood nodded encouragingly as if the question had been a test and rose had managed to pass do you know a bloke called jaff paki bastard ive met him a few times hes been shagging this erin bint right theyve been going out together yes you dont need to be so crude now were getting somewhere where is he wheres jaff i dont know youd better not be lying why would i lie i hardly know him like i said ive met him once or twice hes erins boyfriend you ever been to his place never well weve just dropped by and hes not there the bloke down the hall says he scarpered with some woman last night seemed in a bit in a hurry any idea who that is or why hed do a moonlight no watkins came back and stood in the doorway shaking his head then he held up three fingers sandalwood gave him a nod then turned back to rose dc watkins tells me there are three of you living here whos the third francesca francesca banks but i think her real names tracy francesca but her real names tracy what the fuck are you talking about i dont know rose put her hands to her face and started crying again youre scaring me tell me about this francesca she knew jaff too i think she fancied him she disappeared she went out last night and she hasnt come back please go away please leave me alone i dont know anything is she the woman jaff scarpered with dont lie to me this time she might be shes got short blond hair with a few colored streaks she was wearing jeans and a denim jacket stud under her lower lip and a ring through her eyebrow thats right sandalwood looked at watkins thats the one that was with jaff where are they i dont know said rose in exasperation dont you understand shes gone probably with jaff thats what the policewoman kept asking me but i told her the same i dont know i dont know what policewoman the one that was here just before you we dont know nothing about any policewoman look i dont know whats going on honest its none of my business i think erins in jail and i dont know where francesca is or jaff i dont understand any of this all i wanted was a room i could afford this is all so not my problem seems like its very much your problem at the moment young lady said sandalwood looking around the room seeing as youre the only one here apart from us dont please dont said rose holding her hands over her face again and sobbing but instead of the blow she was expecting or the sound of a gun cocking the next thing she heard was the front door slamming she put her hands down and opened her eyes were they really gone could it be true she turned off holby city no longer interested in doctors and bleeding patients and checked every room theyd left a bit of a mess upstairs but they were definitely gone well that was the bloody limit rose decided she went to her room and threw what few clothes and books she had into a suitcase packed her toiletries and makeup into her holdall then paused for a moment to look around and see if she had forgotten anything she hadnt she had obviously had the misfortune to end up in a house full of bloody lunatics and her nerves couldnt stand it anymore she would post the rent she owed later right now if she hurried she might just be able to catch a train or a bus back to oldham and her mum and dad at worst she could phone home and her dad would drive over and pick her up hed complain and hed lay on the itoldyouso guilt trip long and thick but hed do it anything had to be better than stopping a moment longer in this madhouse she thought then she slammed the door behind her and pushed her key through the letterbox annie was sitting crosslegged on her living room floor focusing on her breathing letting the thoughts come and go like bubbles holding on to none of them her mind fixed on her breathing in out in out a knock at the door broke her concentration irritated she glanced at her watch after ten who would come calling at this time the spell was broken anyway so she got up slowly aware of her knees cracking from lack of practice and answered it was nerys powell the female afo what are you doing here annie asked you shouldnt be here chambers will go spare nerys held up her hands i know i know she said and im sorry but can i talk to you please just for a minute or two theres no reason mr chambers has to know about it is there how did you find out where i live ive got a friend in human resources who just a friend i could find out easily enough you know why do you say that what do you mean annie sighed nothing she said just that you shouldnt be here its inappropriate what are you so afraid of being seen with me if thats the case the quicker you let me in the better besides were miles from eastvale i know its late and im sorry i did come earlier but there was nobody home ive been wandering around getting lost trying to pluck up my courage to come back i stopped for a couple of drinks i just want to talk to you thats all nobody has to know i dont know i shouldnt annie chewed on her lip and thought for a moment still disoriented from being snapped out of her meditation nerys certainly didnt appear drunk then she made a snap decision and stood aside okay you can come in but just for a couple of minutes nerys entered the room cozy she said looking around just another word for cramped bijou another word for too small nerys laughed no i like it seriously sit down can i get you a cup of tea or something coffee nothing thanks you sure my body is a temple well im having a glass of wine in that case said nerys annie went into the kitchen and took a bottle of pinot grigio from the fridge she felt uncomfortable with neryss visit and knew she shouldnt be talking to her or even listening but she was feeling rebellious after todays excitement she was also frustrated by her visit to tracys house in leeds and her later one to jaffs flat in granary wharf it had been easy enough to locate there had been nobody home there of course and one of the neighbors had informed her before slamming his door in her face that the police had already been around asking questions that he had told them all he knew and that he was damned if he was going to repeat it all again to her so she decided she might as well lend her ear to nerys for a while you never know she told herself you might even learn something she opened the wine and took it through to the living room along with two glasses nerys was on her knees by the small selection of cds on the lower shelves of the bookcase she was wearing blue jeans that showed a bit too much arse crack and a light wind cheater over a black tshirt none of which did much to disguise the muscles or hide the bulge at her waist when she stood up probably pure muscle too annie guessed see anything you like she asked nerys glanced over at her nope she said but then im not much of a one for music not like your boss i hear alan yes he does have a bit of a reputation i cant say ive got a clue what hes listening to half the time some of it sounds pretty good but some of it well to put it frankly it just sounds like a bull with a pain in its testicles to me nerys laughed and accepted her wine before sitting down she was a good three inches shorter than annie though much stockier and her hair was so short and spiky that it resembled a military crew cut her eyes were green cheers she said holding out her glass annie clinked hers against it cheers hes got quite a reputation in other areas too around county hq your dci said nerys oh what do you mean bit of a cowboy likes to do things his own way i suppose so but dont we all if we think ours is the right way true enough its so hard to be certain though isnt it im more used to following orders the firearms cadre is very discipline oriented i suppose it has to be said annie but that wouldnt suit alan youre right still i dont suppose it was alan banks you came to talk about in a way it is said nerys mmm this is nice annie shrugged just cheap italian plonk nerys stood up again and walked over to a framed watercolor of eastvale castle in the evening light thats good she said whoever painted it really caught the light at that time of a winter evening thank you said annie neryss jaw dropped you mean you i never dreamed she smiled honest honest said annie feeling herself blush why would i lie its all right why should you know anyway its just a hobby thats all but youre so good so talented have you ever thought look nerys i appreciate the compliment and all but can you just get to the point im sorry i dont mean to appear rude but nerys sat down again no no of course youre right i suppose im just nervous thats all i tend to blather on a bit when im nervous why should you be nervous well youre a di and im just a lowly pc youre hardly lowly besides youre the one with the gun im not carrying honest she held her arms out want to check the point said annie nerys finally let her arms drop sat back down in the chair and seemed to relax a little she ran her finger around the rim of her glass that stuff at the meeting yesterday about mrs doyle asking for dci banks is it true yes its true said annie theyre old friends neighbors would he have gone i think so probably but hes not here where is he america a long way away nerys took a sip of wine pity he wasnt here it would have saved us all a hell of a lot of trouble not what chambers thinks chambers is an arsehole nerys put her hand to her mouth sorry i shouldnt have said that in front of you annie couldnt help but laugh no you shouldnt she said but you hit the nail right on the head i understand you worked for him once for my sins you know a lot when the shit hits the fan like this i make it my business to know as much as i can annie raised an eyebrow your friend in human resources again nerys grinned another one this time records my my but you must have a lot of friends no thats the problem i dont ive never felt so alone so isolated but thats ridiculous said annie you afo teams have a reputation for being close and tightknit your lives depend on one another its true enough on the job said nerys its our training but it doesnt always work that way off duty she leaned forward in her chair and looked annie in the eye the directness and intensity of her gaze were disconcerting look im a woman in a mans world more than that im a gay woman in a mans shooting club you might think they treat me like one of the lads but they look at me more as a freak im sure thats not the case neryss upper lip curled in a sneer what do you know nothing i suppose said annie what got you into it in the first place then i mean the firearms cadre i didnt really know what i wanted to do i mean in the force i did all the coursessurveillance vehicle pursuit worked undercover even traffic i was all over the map and i suppose it was my dad really he was a para real macho got killed in iraq two and a half years ago another sniper dad was really a perfectionist a technician i grew up around guns the smell of them the mechanics christ i could dismantle and reassemble a hechler and koch or a parkerhale in the dark going by sound and touch alone that sounds like a useful skill said annie well you never know but you never thought of this before when you first joined not really it wasnt as if i wanted to follow in my dads footsteps not until he got killed then it all seemed to make sense and im good at it they fasttracked me im the youngest on the unit apart from warby they let the silence stretch for a while as nerys no doubt thought about her dead father and annie thought about banks where was he los angeles reno tucson she knew he was somewhere in the american southwest she wished she were there with him i dont want to be on firearms cadre forever though nerys said ambitious a bit i suppose id like to work in counterterrorism eventually sounds challenging i like a challenge thats also why im worried aboutyou knowall this a big blot on your copybook yes theres probably not an officer in the service who hasnt made a mistake i mean theres some people would say dci banks is a walking disaster area our friend chambers for a start whats he really like chambers yes he reminds me of that fat comedian with the bowler hat the one in those old blackandwhite films oliver hardy thats the one but seriously do you think he supports gay rights has a soft spot for cuddly lesbians anne couldnt help but laugh she topped up their wineglasses the level in neryss was much lower than hers she noticed no i shouldnt think so hes more the kind who thinks every woman he meets cant wait to drop her knickers for him and he probably believes that all a lesbian needs to cure her is a good stiff twelve inches of reginald chambers though my guess is its closer to three or four inches nerys laughed but what do you really think about him annie swirled the wine in her glass then drank some more she didnt like remembering her time with chambers the memories werent good ones lets just say we didnt get along too well and leave it at that shall we so what can i expect hes going to try to crucify us me and warby isnt he oh for crying out loud said annie dont be so bloody melodramatic hes not that bad there are plenty worse than him around i said we didnt get along thats all it was probably as much my fault as his it wasnt exactly my dream posting i dont get on with very many people if you must know so ive heard why doesnt that surprise me annie checked her watch look i hate to rush you but if youve finished there was no way she would be able to get back to her meditation now not after this disruption not to mention the wine but at least she could watch tv or something and veg out almost anything would be better than this im sorry said nerys her lower lip quivering i didnt mean to spoil your eveningi mean i just wanted to know if i could count on you if youre on my side im sorry to waste your time im just worried thats all then annie saw tears in her eyes and softened she hated herself for it but she was a sucker for tears worse than any man shed ever met come on she said pouring more wine it was going down quickly the bottle was almost empty pull yourself together nerys look chambers isnt going to crucify you after all it wasnt you who fired the taser hes an arsehole yes and a bully and a male chauvinist pig but as far as i know he plays straight at worst hell play up to the media and give them what they want hes a pr man at heart not a copper but hes not going to fit you up for crying out loud hell discover the facts and play it by the book obnoxious bastard as he is but thats just it isnt it thats the problem the facts what are they and doesnt it all depend on how someone else interprets them what version will the media want there could be as many different stories of what happened on monday morning as there were people present annie knew that was true she had once seen a film called rashomon one of her fathers favorites which told the same story from several different viewpoints same facts different stories perhaps she admitted but theres nothing you can do about that and hes got his team from greater manchester to keep him on the straight and narrow hes not a law unto himself much as he might like to think so i just need to know what to expect so i can be prepared what did he do to you when you worked with him didnt your friend in human resources tell you nobody really knows but you annie took a deep breath and followed it with a draft of wine it was a long time ago she said seven eight years or thereabouts and why does it keep coming back to haunt me she wondered she thought she had finally seen the end of janet taylor lucy payne and the chameleon case over a year ago when it had come into her life again with a vengeance now chambers was back chambers himself didnt do anything to me she went on back then he was simply a lazy lecherous timeserving arsewipe who got others to do his dirty work for him while he got all the glory whatever glory there is in a job like that mostly he got his jollies from what he saw as his vindication in the gutter press he always swayed with the wind of public opinion why didnt he retire when hed put in his twentyfive i heard he was practically living on the golf course the reorganization gave him a new lease on life a renewed purpose more power now he just seems to want to put as many coppers away as he can before he retires but its not as if some of them dont deserve it and like i said hes not bent he plays by the book but he has an agenda oh yes with chambers youre always guilty until youre proven guilty especially if the newspapers say so so im right to be worried the two cases are very different said annie pc janet taylor the one i was working on killed a notorious serial killer who had just hacked her partner to pieces in front of her eyes and was about to do the same to her unfortunately a civilian called john hadleigh who had shot a burglar in his home about three hundred miles away was convicted of murder around the same time it would have appeared bad if a police officer had simply walked away scotfree after killing someone end of story even a serial killer the chameleon i know about that case ive studied it then youll know what im talking about said annie but you had to be there to understand the political climate and the media circus anyway i convinced the cps to lower the charge against janet taylor to manslaughter you know the rest so it was politics this woman janet taylor was a sacrificial lamb hardly a lamb but yes partly it always is politics where the chamberses of the world are concerned you should know that the higher you climb up the greasy pole the more desperate you are to keep your grip nerys swallowed and sat for a moment apparently contemplating what annie had told her can i count on your support she asked finally in a small voice annie spluttered on a mouthful of wine and patted her chest as she coughed christ what on earth do you mean by that she said when she could talk again i told you i feel so alone so isolated ive got nobody to talk to youre not alone youve got your team beside you your boss behind you besides its not you chambers is after is it its pc warburton he fired the taser dont kid yourself its all of us if warby hadnt tasered the bastard id have shot him or one of the lads coming through the back would have was it that bad uhhuh it was dark the hall lightbulb blew when warby turned it on you dont expect something like that we knew there was a loaded gun in the house we were already on hightension alert nobody even thought youd have to go in that way said annie and nobody could have known the lightbulb would choose that particular moment to blow we have to be prepared for eventualities like that act as if we are going in annie topped up their wine the bottle was empty now it was dark nerys went on you could cut the tension with a knife like warby said at the meeting we didnt know what might have happened since we were called in they werent talking to us the girl could have lost it grabbed the gun anything when he came out of the kitchen patrick doyle he was just a silhouette with what couldve been a raised sword or baseball bat in his hand even a shotgun warby just reacted first thats all i might be the best marksman but warbys got the fastest reaction time of us all she smiled to herself wouldve made a great gunslinger in the old west fastest draw in the wiske we call him why was the walking stick raised he was angry doyle i think hed already been having a row with his daughter theyd been absorbed in their own little dramaand when we broke his door down and he heard that bloody almighty racket well people dont take kindly to things like that do they he was just mad at us thats all waving his stick about understandable i dont suppose he knew we were armed he was just expecting an old mate to drop bydci banksnot armed officers in full protective gear he couldnt see us either the light was on in the kitchen so his eyes wouldnt have adjusted that quickly we probably looked like martians in the darkness of the hall its not something you expect is it it certainly isnt said annie so you know whose side public opinion is going to be on i can take a guess nerys shook her head slowly then finished her wine its not fair you can do all the training scenarios you want she said just like dirty harry walking through a movie set shooting at cardboard cutouts but when its real its different in training you know you cant get shot or cut but when its realyou dont aim for an arm or a leg warby did the right thing ill stick by him i just want it to go down that way i want them to see it for what it really was mistakes and all not set out to crucify one of us or sacrifice us to the press or public opinion we do a necessary job and a damn good one but its messy sometimes and for better or for worse people need us but that doesnt mean they want to acknowledge us or give us medals they certainly dont have to like us mostly they want to forget we exist or to bury us i cant control that annie said but there are enough checks and balances im still sure theyll do a good job remain impartial i wish i had your faith id better go annie stood up but not so fast that she seemed as eager to get rid of nerys as she really was the thought crossed her mind that nerys had drunk the lions share of the wine was she going to drive perhaps annie should offer her a bed for the night but she didnt want to do that best just leave the subject alone entirely and not even ask about driving maybe it was irresponsible of her but the alternative was a minefield of complications okay she said i hardly need see you to the door its not far but i will nerys smiled thanks you okay im fine nerys opened the door for what its worth she said pausing and resting her hand lightly on annies arm ive heard good things about you and ive seen you around county hq a few times i always rated you i thought you were all right i liked you from the start she leaned forward and quickly pecked annie on the cheek then glanced down shyly at the doormat annie thought nerys was looking at her legs and she shifted awkwardly on her feet suddenly she felt selfconscious that she was only wearing the black leggings and baggy white tshirt she had put on for meditation and yoga the tshirt only came down as far as her hips and she felt exposed look nerys she said im flattered and all i dont knowyou knowwhat ideas youve got about me or anything what you might have heard but im notyou know oh no i know youre not gay its okay dont worry i wasnt making a pass honest anyway youre not really my type i just said i think youre all right thats all appearances can be deceptive i take my chances where i find them when she had gone annie closed the door and leaned back against it not my type what had nerys meant by that should she feel insulted what was wrong with her was it even true neryss actions had seemed to belie her words she had definitely been flirting at times annie was also struck by the troublesome thought that if nerys powell warburton and the rest of the afo team were going to be sacrificed on the bloody altar of public opinion then the detectives who were supposed to have briefed them thoroughly would be lucky if they got to walk away the walking stick the dicky heart should annie or gervaise somehow have been able to find out about those and warn the team that went in and whether they could have or not would they be expected to have done so because that was ultimately all that mattered what chambers and public opinion thought they should have done not what had actually happened or why these were not comforting thoughts annie locked the door opened another bottle of wine and settled down to a nature documentary about elephants on bbc banks offered to pay the bill but teresa would have none of it my country my treat she said in the end there was nothing he could do but capitulate they had enjoyed a marvelous dinner at an intimate italian restaurant she had chosen in north beach and the last thing he wanted to do now was spoil the mood with an argument over the bill thank you he said it was a great choice wonderful somehow i think the company helps dont you she said giving the maitre d a quick smile as he discreetly whisked away the tray banks shared the last of the wine between them and set the bottle down on the red tablecloth yes he said yes it certainly does whats wrong teresa said you suddenly sound sad do i banks shrugged maybe because its my last night here you mustnt think that way i mustnt no of course not the waiter returned with the credit card receipt teresa added a tip and signed it with a flourish then she picked up her purse let me just visit the powder room she said then i want to show you something banks nodded while she was away he sipped his wine and glanced at the slightly garish commercial painting of lake como on the wall opposite him annie wouldnt like it he thought finding it odd that he should suddenly think of annie when she was thousands of miles away maybe it was time to go home but he was certainly enjoying his evening with teresa she was recently divorced she had told him over dinner with grownup kids and grandchildren and she worked as a child psychologist back in boston this trip was a present to herself on her decree absolute coming through and an excuse to visit her family she was also she told him thinking of moving permanently to california and had been making a few exploratory calls regarding jobs and accommodation the little restaurant bar was to the right of banks and he could see out of the corner of his eye the rows of bottles gleaming should he suggest a cognac perhaps it would be best to wait until they got to the hotel bar after all teresa had already paid the bill here and there was something she wanted to show him teresa took his arm as they walked out on the quiet side street and made their way toward columbus busy and brightly lit past the condor on the intersection with broadway instead of taking grant with its arches pagodas restaurants and cheap souvenir chops they walked down stockton a street of small grocery stores with piles of exotic vegetables and dried goods out front even at ten oclock it was still crowded with shoppers haggling over their purchases and testing the quality spilling from the sidewalk onto the road banks remembered his old sergeant in london ozzy albright telling him that san francisco had the biggest chinatown outside of china itself they had been in the london chinatown at the time much smaller during his last case down there in it was a case that had come back to haunt him just before he came away as such things often did which was why he thought of it now you might have to wait a lifetime for justice but sometimes you got it in the end like karma teresa was chatting away at his side and banks realized he hadnt been listening had been drifting into times past where did you say we were going he asked she gave him a sharp glance i didnt she said its a surprise i told you right soon they left the crowds behind there were fewer shops and the street became darker this is the stockton tunnel were walking on teresa said and what we want is she looked around her as if verifying something with her memory over here she pointed to a small alley over to their right atop the tunnel off bush street running parallel to stockton it was called burritt street banks noticed as they approached sorry teresa said its been a long time what is it banks asked are you leading me down a dark alley teresa laughed not very far down she said its here look and she pointed to a plaque on the wall banks could just about read it from the ambient streetlight on approximately this spot miles archer partner of sam spade was done in by brigid oshaughnessy banks stopped and stared so this was the place where it happened he turned to face teresa and grinned well you did say you were a detective she said i just thought you might find it interesting i do ive just started reading the book too id never realized i mean i know the story isnt true but the city is so vivid in the book almost a character in its own right i never thought idim stuck for words he read the plaque again but it gives away the ending yes it does rather doesnt it but is that so important ive never thought so said banks besides ive already seen the movie and so far the book is following pretty closely i think youll find it was the other way around here teresa said fumbling in her purse stand right next to it im going to take your picture banks stood first came the flickering of the antiredeye then the flash itself while banks was still blinded by the light a voice came from the end of the alley would you like me to take one of the two of you together by the time banks could see again teresa had handed her camera to the man whose wife or girlfriend stood looking on smiling and she took her place next to banks resting her head on his shoulder by the plaque the camera flashed again the man checked the display to see that it had come out all right and handed the camera back to teresa who thanked him how did you know he wouldnt just run off with your camera banks asked as they went down the steps beside the tunnel oh dont be such a cynic you have to have a bit of trust in people sometimes or its hardly worth living i suppose so said banks besides they were walking along hand in hand people like that arent usually petty thieves banks laughed maybe youd make a good cop after all he said teresa smiled surely its just common sense they continued down stockton street crossed union square and walked along geary back to the hotel a cable car bell dinged up powell toward the mark hopkins where banks had drunk his martini on his first night in the city and a crowd was coming out of the geary street theater as they passed they were staging noel cowards brief encounter banks noticed there were a few of the regular street people aroundbanks recognized the black man in rags and the old womanbut nobody bothered them when they got to the monaco banks asked how about a quick nightcap in the bar teresa paused still holding on to his arm no i dont think so she said too many people they would spoil the mood too noisy ive got a bottle of good napa valley cabernet sauvignon in my room why dont you come up with me and well have that nightcap there was no mistaking the promise in her eyes banks swallowed well he said that would just about make the perfect end to the perfect last day of a perfect holiday jaff yeah babe what is it what exactly is going on tracy asked i mean why are we doing this why are we on the run why do you want to go to london and get across the channel so badly its better you dont know too much jaff said like i said its my problem not yours im only grateful youve found me a place to lie low for a few days while i get things in motion down there but its my problem too now said tracy besides i wont say anything to anyone i wont talk were in it together now arent we ive helped you so far but im still in the dark sometimes you make me feel like a prisoner maybe i can do more to help youre not a prisoner we just have to be extra careful thats all and i know how to do it its better if you listen to me youve already been a great help fran dont think im not grateful thats why i dont want to burden you with too much knowledge you know what curiosity did dont you just believe me its safer this way okay now come on babe oh jaff no not now jaff not again we just but before tracy could say another word jaff had pulled her toward him and clamped his lips firmly on hers she offered only token resistance he was a good kisser she had to admit that and the rest of their lovemaking was pretty spectacular too when they had finished jaff seemed to drift off to sleep again and tracy found herself returning to her growing concerns this was the start of their second day in her fathers house and she was beginning to feel a little uneasy about being there she was hoping that jaff would get bored with being in the country and decide they should leave for london soon he had already made a number of long phone calls and seemed to sound pleased with the way things were going down there whatever those things were it had been okay at first just a bit of harmless fun and a chance to vent her spleen against her absentee father but now every moment longer they stayed the more uncomfortable she began to feel what had yesterday seemed like a mildly exciting lark was now turning out to be something more serious and tracy wasnt sure if she could get out of it jaff needed her to get rid of any unwelcome callers for one thing though he said she wasnt a prisoner she could just walk away she supposed and leave jaff to his fate but for some reason she didnt want to do that it wasnt only the thought of leaving him in her fathers house alone she really wanted to be with him wanted the adventure so see it through whatever it was she did care about him she just hated being kept in the dark she wanted a bigger part in his plans and she felt cut off from the world without her mobile it scared her the cottage was also a total mess already with empty wine bottles all over the place stains on the carpets and furniture and those cds and dvds scattered all over the entertainment room floor tracy wasnt by nature a vandal or even a messy person and this chaos disturbed her she had tried to clean up a bit last night but had been too stoned to make much of a dent she was probably a fugitive too now or at least people might start to think so rose for example the police knew all about erin and the gun certainly though there had been nothing on the news yet to indicate that they had found out it belonged to jaff or that they were even aware of his existence but tracy knew from her dads work that they often kept things back from the public it doesnt always do to put your sirens on at full volume when you want to sneak up on someone and catch them unawares they could be closing the net at this very moment tracy thought the cottage might already be surrounded then she admonished herself for being paranoid most likely erin had gone into one of her long silences and the police couldnt be too hard on her because theyd just killed her father which had been on the news late yesterday that had knocked tracy for a six mr doyle was a nice man she remembered he always gave her and erin money for ice cream when they were kids playing in the street and the mr whippy van came around hed taken them both to the easter fair in helmthorpe once tracy remembered when her dad had to work as usual and mr doyle had let tracy and erin go on rides like the waltzers the dodgems and the speedway her dad would never have let her go on them at her age then just the boring swings or the merrygoround with all the little kids jaff stirred threw the sheets back and got out of bed it was almost midday but then it had been another late night of wine joints and movies and sex im hungry he announced why dont you go down and make us some breakfast while i have a shower what did your last servant die of tracy muttered as she dragged herself out of bed what said jaff what was that you said nothing tracy replied yes it was jaff held her chin you made some remark about servants you think i should be a servant or something is that what you mean because my mothers from bangladesh because of the color of my skin tracy shook herself free jaff that wasnt what i meant at all and you know it wasnt its just a saying we have here when people ask you to do things they could easily do for themselves for crying out loud get a grip i know what fucking sayings you have here said jaff pointing his thumb at his own chest where the fuck do you think i come from straight off the boat i fucking grew up here all right jaff i didnt mean people never do they just assume all my life people have assumed things about me he pointed at her dont assume tracy held her hands up in mock surrender yes sir she said sorree and dont take the piss jaff glared at her tracy could hardly believe at that moment that she had once thought his eyes gentle and beautiful they were cold and hard now his mouth sulky youd better mean it francesca he said at last his voice a little softer but still not without a trace of menace i hate people who make assumptions about me you dont know what i am who i am you know nothing about me fine said tracy beginning to wish shed never brought jaff to her fathers house wishing shed never met him never fancied him never kissed him on the dance floor never made love with him all night she felt like crying ill just go and make some breakfast shall i bacon and eggs do you okay jaff smiled fantastic and a big pot of coffee too babe good and strong im off for that shower then he simply turned and walked away whistling as if nothing had just happened between them tracy stood there slowly shaking her head she would have liked to have used the bathroom to clean herself up a bit first but it was a small cottage and there was only one instead she went downstairs and washed her hands and face in the kitchen sink she realized she was still trembling a little jaff could be cruel without knowing it tracy could hear the shower running upstairs as she gathered together the food for breakfast a fryup was the easiest option she thought if not healthiest so she dug out a couple of frying pans and put them on the rings adding liberal dollops of cooking oil cooking wasnt exactly one of tracys fortes but she did know how to fry eggs and bacon and you needed plenty of hot oil to splash over the eggs to get the tops done properly first she put the coffee on then she got the bacon crackling and turned her attention to the eggs but before she put them in the pan she fed two slices of toast into the toaster then glanced toward the breakfast nook tracy bit her lower lip as she thought about what to do jaffs holdall was on the bench behind the breakfast table if she wanted her mobile back which she did now was probably the best chance she was going to get he probably wouldnt even notice it was missing the bacon was spitting and sizzling and the coffee pot making its usual gurgling sounds as it turned water into black gold tracy hoisted the holdall onto the table and unzipped it what she saw inside took her breath away but not so much that she didnt first reach in and rescue her mobile slipping it into a zipped pocket of her new shoulderbag then she went back to make sure that her eyes werent deceiving her but no there it all was laid out for her to see wad after wad of twenty and tenpound notes fastened with rubber bands and mixed in with them several bricksized packages of white powder wrapped in plastic she counted four altogether cocaine tracy thought or heroin four kilos probably she delved deeper thrusting her hand between the wads of cash until underneath everything it touched something cool hard and metallic it was only when she had her hand around the handle of the gun still deep inside the holdall that she noticed jaff leaning against the doorjamb a white towel wrapped around his waist and a sheet of paper in his hand head cocked to one side watching her a curious smile on his lips but not in his eyes she noticed not by a long chalk christ she thought i should have trusted my instincts and run while i had the chance as annie had expected western area headquarters was starting to feel like the main concourse at kings cross by early afternoon on wednesday chambers was skulking around with his imported mancunian sidekicks whom annie had christened dumb and dumber and several afos were wandering around the corridors aimlessly or cluttering up the small canteen including nerys powell who gave annie a conspiratorial smile then blushed and lowered her gaze as they passed each other on the stairs just what she needed banks had once told annie that chambers reminded him of the vincent price character in witchfinder general and when annie had watched the film with him later she had seen what he meant there was no great physical resemblance of course but he had that same air about him the barely controlled pious zeal that hinted he was satisfying unsavory personal appetites through his work as well as serving public morality annie would catch him staring at her now and then with a strange hungry look in his eyes that was only partly sexual and occasionally he would go into a whispered conference with dumb and dumber who would scribble notes all calculated to cause maximum anxiety and paranoia which it did she knew that she and chambers had parted on bad terms after she had told him exactly what she thought of his handling of the janet taylor case and now she was beginning to think that he was the sort who bore a grudge more than that he was the type of person in whom slights and grudges fester for years ultimately bursting out into vengeance superintendent gervaise had sent around a memo announcing a meeting of all the senior serious crimes staff at three oclock in the boardroom when they could expect a visit from the ballistics expert who had been working on the gun before that annie thought she would take the opportunity to slip away for a quiet lunch and a pintknowing that it might be her last chance for some timeand she would take winsome with her they had a lot to talk about winsome had been concluding the paperwork on her investigation into the hit and run and she needed to be brought up to speed the queens arms was out of the question as was the hare and hounds superintendent gervaise had proved to be rather adept at tracking down the various watering holes annie and banks had started using but with winsome drivingshe refused to drink a drop on duty and hardly drank much at any other timethe whole of swainsdale was their oyster well within reason annie thought but at least they could get out of the town center and find a little village pub with tables outside and a nice view so many had closed down recently after the smoking ban the floundering economy cheap booze shops and easy trips to fill up the boot in calais some of the best pubs in swainsdale opened for lunch only on weekends but there were still a few good ones left they found a suitable place halfway up a hillside in a tiny village off the fortford road it faced a small triangular green of wellkept grass with a couple of park benches under an old elm tree the pub had picnic tables out front where annie sipped her pint of dalesman bitter and winsome her diet pepsi as they waited for their food if any of the other lunchtime customers were astonished at the sight of a sixfoot black woman long legs stretched out encased in blue denim they were much too polite to show it which indicated to annie that they must be tourists locals usually gawped at winsome it was a fine enough day warm and sunny again though a few dark clouds were gathering in the west and the only nuisances were the flies and the occasional persistent wasp the swallows were still gathering annie admired the pattern of drystone walls that straggled up the hillside to the sere reaches where the limestone outcrops began to her right she could see the lush green valley bottom and the village of fortford itself a couple of miles away near the meandering treelined river she could also see the flagstone roofs and the whitewashed facade of the rose and crown beside the mound of the old roman settlement the roman road cut diagonally up the daleside and disappeared in the far distance the air smelled of freshmown hay tinged with a hint of manure and smoke from a gardeners fire despite the activity at the police station and the harbingers it brought annie nevertheless felt this was a good day to be alive as she breathed the late summer air all mists and mellow fruitfulness the kind of day that sticks in your memory it made her think of the final lines of the keats poem she had had to memorize at school hedgecrickets sing and now with treble soft the redbreast whistles from a gardencroft and gathering swallows twitter in the skies zoo time back at the station i see said winsome thats why i wanted to get away for a while annie said that and winsome raised a finely plucked eyebrow come on give i was thinking things have been dull around the place for a while now she said ever since you dropkicked that drug dealer over a fourthfloor balcony it wasnt a dropkick and it was only the third floor annie took a sip of beer winsome had got quite a bit of press out of that escapade which was probably the main reason why the locals knew who she was and gawped at her theres actually been quite a lot going on annie said only i havent been in the loop doug and i have been investigating that hitandrun on the lyndgarth road and case closed witness got a partial number plate and it was easy sailing from there course it didnt help that our two victims werent talking oh why not up to no good off their faces on drugs werent they winsome said with a smile well its time to get you in the loop now hows harry i mean doug coming on all right said winsome yeah hes all right maybe he lacks the killer instinct and that extra edge you need if you want to be a good detective she shrugged and grinned in some ways hes like a little brother i try to keep him out of trouble i never took you for the maternal type winsome anyway you cant play nursemaid forever i know i know hes a good detail man though memory like a steel trap and lets face it how often does the job get physical around here we cant all be fearless warriors i suppose said annie its my heritage my ancestors were fearless warriors its in my genes im thinking of investing in a spear annie laughed youre scary enough without she drank some more beer besides id love to see madame gervaises face if you did walk in carrying a spear it would certainly give her something to think about a pale skinny young girl who looked as if she ought to be in school came with their food burger and chips for winsome and cheese and tomato sandwich for annie so what should i know winsome asked after the first bite its hard to know where to begin annie said what does the boss think madame gervaise shes being cagey wants to see which way the winds blowing i cant say i blame her with matthew hopkins running around like a man on a divine mission matthew who hopkins the witchhunter general chambers its a pet name i wouldnt have him as a pet or even name one after him anyway annie went on chambers may very well be the least of our problems things are complicated and its going to be difficult to keep everything in its proper compartment first off and high priority as far as im concerned is that we found a gun on our patch as you probably know already rather the parents found it and shopped their daughter i do know about that wouldnt you if i had a kid and i found a gun in her room yes probably said annie i dont know somehow it goes against the grain tough one though not for me said winsome id do it in a shot no pun intended your dads a cop mines an artist what difference does that make i dont know said annie but were both cops i just meant that i might try and deal with the situation on my own you know talk to her try to understand the way things are between mother and daughter now any chance of anyone understanding anything has gone right out the window sometimes its not the most important thing what is then that no one gets shot annie gave a little shudder fair enough maybe im overplaying the liberal mum maybe id just shop the little bastard and have done with it thats probably why im lucky i dont have any children yeah i could just see you turning in your own kid softie anyway annie went on the house is still in lockdown and were waiting on ballistics should know more by this afternoon the girls on bailbedandbreakfast arrestand the mothers stopping with a friend and you know what happened to patrick doyle yeah said winsome its terrible plus i had a visit last night from one of the afos involved wanted to know if i was on their side are you id like to say i was on the side of truth and justice but somehow with chambers around words like that turn to ashes in my mouth but youre not going to lie for anyone are you you dont even know them annie put her hand on winsomes forearm no winsome im not going to lie for anybody christ knows i wasnt in the house i dont know much to start with but when chambers gets around to me ill answer all his questions honestly to the best of my ability and if i dont know the answers ill say so cant say fairer than that who said fair had anything to do with it cynic yes welldont forget i worked with chambers once winsome gobbled up her burger and started picking at her chips where do i start she asked glancing up at annie from her plate you know dci bankss daughter tracy is that her name thats right though she seems to have taken to calling herself francesca these days thats nothing kids often go through periods of dissatisfaction with the names their parents gave them said winsome i know i did i called myself joan for years in school tracys twentyfour shes not a kid annie shot winsome a glance you did though really joan yeah i wanted an ordinary name i hated winsome didnt you ever change your name no somehow or other ive always been just annie so you know tracy then ive spoken with her at the station once or twice nice girl or so she seemed i cant say i know her is there a problem maybe not only has she changed her name annie said but shes changed her appearance too so people do look at you you got your hair cut and highlighted you used to dress like a hippie and all right i get your point annie touched her head selfconsciously true enough im not trying to make anything out of it in itself youre right sometimes people just like a change its just that she also seems to have disappeared seems to have yes well this is where we enter the realm of total conjecture or fantasy as madame gervaise would say which is why im talking to you here and not to her at the station because im more gullible no because i cant think of anyone more levelheaded hear me out winsome you can tell me if you think im talking rubbish annie pushed her empty plate away and drank some more beer her glass was close to empty and she fancied another given what chaos the afternoon might bring though she decided to abstain and ordered a coffee and some sticky toffee pudding and custard instead juliet doyle the mother of the girl who had the gun in her room told me that her daughter erin shares a house in headingley with two other girls she began rose preston and tracy banks the leeds police searched the place on the afternoon of erins arrest rose was present apparently when tracy got home from work that evening and rose told her what happened she went ballistic she seemed most concerned about some bloke called jaff erins boyfriend erins not talking so we cant get anything about him from her tracy took off almost immediately rose gave her the news and she hasnt been seen or heard from since how do you know all this i paid a visit to the house yesterday evening and talked to rose i also called at this jaffs flatnice place down by the canalbut it was all locked up and there was nobody home one of the neighbors told me the police had already been around asking questions he seemed in a bit of a huff kept his door on the chain said he didnt have to answer any more questions he was right there wasnt a lot i could do so i went home some people are like that said winsome i rang di ken blackstone in leeds this morning and guess what he checked and told me they hadnt sent anybody to granary wharf yesterday winsome frowned so what do you thinks going on i dont know this is where it becomes pure conjecture on my part rose got the impression that there was something between jaff and tracy or so she told me tracy certainly seemed unduly concerned about this jaff at any rate whether she knew about the gun or not i have no idea i know this is all mere speculation but given that both tracy and jaff seem to have disappeared from view its my bet that theyve gone off somewhere together probably headed south if the gun does belong to jaff then hes obviously scared that erins going to tell on him or that the police are going to track him down through it so its easy to see why he might want to make himself scarce so hes on the run makes sense you really think hes used this gun not recently according to the preliminary ballistics report the point right now is that he was probably the one who owned it whatever the reason and tracys part in all of this annie ate some more pudding then washed it down with coffee dont know she said either she is involved and shes gone with him or shes not involved but shes gone with him or shes gone somewhere else on her own maybe said annie but unlikely dont you think the timing is just too coincidental circumstantial is what it all is said winsome but youve got a point the thing is i cant believe tracys mixed up in anything bad not the dcis daughter i agree she always seemed like a decent kid but people change winsome fall in with the wrong company develop a chip on their shoulder start to resent their lives or the way they perceive theyre being treated rebellion it comes in many shapes and sizes and not only when youre a teenager twentyfour isnt all that old if she really fancies this jaff blokechrist what nothing just remembering my own bad boy phase bad boy yes dont you know what bad boys are winsome i dont think ive ever really had much experience of them a bad boy is unreliable and sometimes he doesnt show up at all or if he does hes late and moody he acts mean to you and he leaves early he always seems to have another iron in the fire somewhere else to be but always while youre waiting for him you cant really concentrate on anything else and you have at least one eye on the door in case hes the next one to walk in the room even though you think he might be seeing someone else and when youre with him your heart starts to beat a little faster and your breath catches in your chest you might be angry but it wont last and youre happy for a while when he gives all his attention to you and then it starts all over again sounds awful said winsome but its exquisite agony annie said sometimes he doesnt turn up for days on end and your heart aches for him he goes to bed with your best friend and still you forgive him still you want him you had a badboy phase of course paul burroughs but i was only sixteen i got over it early annie didnt want to talk about the later bad boy who turned out to be a psychopath she certainly didnt have a great track record when it came to choosing the men in her life winsome knew about the psycho anyway and would be far too diplomatic to say anything it was much easier to talk about paul burroughs was he unfaithful of course he was bad boys are always unfaithful thats the first rule what else did he do that was so bad annie smiled fondly as she remembered paul oh nothing serious really not at first just minor stuff fun stuff runofthemill but he was a daredevil he couldnt care less like what well one night after midnight for example we broke into the local marina and borrowed a speedboat annie couldnt help but laugh at winsomes expression of horror if the harbor police hadnt caught us wed have ended up in france or more likely wed have crashed on the rocks or something and drowned he knew how to get it startedhe could start anything with a motorbut he hadnt a clue how to handle the wheel what did the police do obviously not very much or i wouldnt be here with you today annie shrugged a slap on the wrist that was all really or it would have been except what well paul had a lot of problems with his family his dad had gone off with another woman and his mother was a bit of a zombie she drank a lot and took tons of valium he was so mixed up and angry you just wanted to hold him and make it all go away did you no me im not the type besides you cant cuddle bad boys the problem was that he picked a fight with the biggest harbor cop when we got back on land and he ended up in a cell for the night that was only the beginning after that i didnt see him anymore but i heard later that he had a lot of problems with the lawstealing cars joyriding then muggings assault burglaries stuff like that and now no idea prison perhaps so he was a bad boy in the making yeah but bad boys arent always criminals its more a state of mind it never happened to you sugar the bad boys where i grew up were really baaad not just some sissy skinnyass white boy stealing a motorboat they carried machetes and aks annie laughed anyway who knows maybe it all goes along with this change in tracys appearance the piercings the name like i said rebellion can happen anytime take many forms all i know is that id like to find her and get things sorted and id like to do it before shes got the combined police forces of the whole bloody country on her trail either shes thumbing her nose at us all or shes scared but she maybe needs help whether she knows it yet or not and alan annie shook her head he wont be back until next monday though ive got his mobile number for emergencies only i could call him wherever he is as long its not some remote farflung desert outpost and that reminds me i should drop by his cottage after work today its been a while those poor plants of his will be fair gagging for a drink of water by now but you arent going to ring him im not sure its that kind of emergency yet its my gut feeling that if i can get tracy out of all this before he gets back and finds out about it the better all around so what do you want me to do walk softly and carry a big stick keep under the radar even though were only doing our jobs youre not tarnished by the firearms business so youre still in something of a privileged position so keep my head down and my eyes and ears open thats about it once this business gets into top gear theyll probably be scrutinizing me as closely as a bug under a microscope soon i wont be able to go to the toilet without filling in a form first off if you could find a way to uncover as much as you can about this jaff it would be a great help you might start with rose preston in headingley she doesnt know a lot but im convinced she knows more than she was telling me i take it youve got their addresses annie gave her them as for jaff im afraid i dont have anything except the address right now and i dont think theres much point in going there again his first names jaffar by the way and the name next to his bell says j mccready well need to know a lot more than that i can always use my natural charm annie smiled yeah theres that annie wagged her finger at winsome but absolutely no dropkicking it wasnt a dropkick i dont understand said tracy holding up the gun by its long barrel i thought erin had taken your gun put that away jaff took the gun from her and put it back in the holdall she did he said sitting down at the breakfast table and placing the sheet of paper facedown beside him this is a different one another one i got it from vic those eggs will be like rubber if you dont get a move on i like my eggs runny as if she were in a trance tracy served up the bacon and eggs and poured two mugs of coffee but why do you need another gun she asked ta dunno protection i just feel safer that way tracy regarded him through narrowed eyes she had felt scared at first seeing him standing there in the doorway knowing how unpredictable he was becoming but somehow now he seemed just like a little boy naked from the waist up tucking into his bacon and eggsbecause clearly no matter what tracy felt it wasnt going to stop him from eating his breakfast or from doing exactly what he wanted tracy wasnt hungry her stomach was too full of butterflies so she just munched on a slice of dry toast and sipped black coffee she had expected an explosion of rage when he caught her going through his holdall maybe even jaff hitting her or something but nothing had happened except this definitely an anticlimax have you ever used it she asked of course not this one but one like it you have to get the feel of it to shoot someone dont be silly just out in a field like tin cans target practice i dont like guns you dont have to nobody in their right mind does but sometimes theyre useful for what i told you protection from whom its better you dont know the person that stuff belongs to tracy gestured toward the holdall the heroin or coke or whatever it is did you steal it its coke said jaff he paused with a forkful of bacon and egg halfway to his mouth the yolk dripping wiggled his eyebrows and looked her in the eye wanna try some tracy couldnt help but laugh not right now thank you very much im serious jaff she had tried coke a few times first at university to stay awake during her exams then later at clubs and bars she liked it well enough and it usually made her randy but it soon wore off and left her feeling shitty for hours she certainly didnt want to feel randy again right now and she was feeling shitty enough already look i told you before jaff went on youve no idea whats going on youve do you think im stupid jaff is that what you really think the only reason i dont know whats going on is that you wont tell me ive asked you but you wont if were going to keep on being in this together i need to know more youd be surprised perhaps i can help just how deep are you into all this all what you know what im talking about the drugs the money the guns what are you some kind of wannabe gangster a gunrunning coke dealer like you just walked out of a guy ritchie movie or something a rock nrolla is that it i dont because im not stupid jaff maybe all i know is that im on the run from the police in my dads house with a lad i hardly know who just happens to have a few kilos of cocaine several thousand quid and a loaded guni assume it is loadedin his holdall it certainly sounds like a movie to me jaff smiled at her it was supposed to be his charming arentianaughtylittleboybutyoucanthelpbutlovemeanywaycanyou smile but it didnt work this time i suppose you think i owe you an explanation well yeah that would do for a start look i didnt ask you to come with me did i it wasnt my dont give me that load of bollocks jaff you know damn well that if it wasnt for me you wouldnt be sitting here at my dads breakfast table eating bloody bacon and eggs youre beginning to sound a bit like a fishwife you know jaff said why dont you just shut it chill out and go with the flow tracy snorted and gave him as disgusted a look as she could dredge up then she took a deep breath there was one thing she had to be grateful for jaff had been so concerned about her finding the money the coke and the gun that the mobile seemed to have completely slipped his mind when he checked the holdall youre right she said so how do you suggest i go about doing it chilling and i mean what exactly is the flow what should i do to go with it nothing babe thats the beauty of it you dont have to do anything because id just like to know what our plans are for a start thats all our plans well not so long ago you were going to make a few phone calls get things organized then we were going to hook up with some mate of yours in london who does dodgy passports and disappear over the channel right or did i get that bit wrong too no thats still the general idea then i hope you werent planning on carrying that holdall with you give me a break im going to get rid of all that stuff in london except the money of course including the gun including the gun thats why this takes time to organize why were still here do you think id be crazy enough to try and carry a gun and four kilos of coke across the border i dont know jaff i really dont know just how crazy you are right now i think maybe i dont know you just trust me thats all jaff reached out his hand but tracy didnt take it you keep on saying that she said but you dont give me much reason to trust you holding things back from me jaff waved his fork in the air it was for your own good what was i dont see how lets not fight babe jaff said polishing off the rest of his breakfast he tapped the sheet of paper beside him with the tip of his fork besides i was about to say something to you before i was so rudely interrupted suddenly tracy felt more nervous than angry she fingered her necklace oh what was that this here piece of paper i found it in a desk drawer in the front room it you shouldnt go rummaging through peoples drawers its not jaff slammed his knife and fork down so hard he broke the plate and the cutlery clattered to the floor will you just fucking shut up with your whats right and whats not right bullshit jaff yelled so loudly and his eyes turned so cold and hard that tracy felt herself on the verge of crying again she was sure that her lips were quivering and she struggled to hold back the tears she wasnt going to let him see her cry even if he could sense her fear she wouldnt give him that satisfaction is it clear now jaff went on are we on the same page tracy nodded chewing the edge of her thumb right he went on as calmly as anything as i was saying i found this letter in one of the drawers and it turns out to be interesting very interesting indeed what is it tracy asked in a small voice your name is banks right francesca banks thats right and your father is dci alan banks of the north yorkshire police yes i mean jaff let the sheet of paper drop your fathers a fucking cop and you didnt see fit to tell me it didnt seem important hes not here is he what does it matter who he is what he does what does it matter jaff tapped the side of his head you lied to me babe are you certain youre not stupid because thats not what im hearing from where im sitting theres no need to be insulting so hes a policeman so what not just a policeman a dci thats detective chief inspector he laughed ive been shagging a dcis daughter i cant believe it you dont have to be so crude about it make up your mind babe are you an angel or a whore on first impressions between the sheets id definitely go for the latter but you seem to talk a whole lot of rubbish about morals and duty and me being insulting and crude so just what exactly are you how would you notice what i do or dont do between the sheets as you so crudely put it all youre interested in is your own pleasure i might as well be an inflatable doll for all you care youve got about as much enthusiasm as an inflatable doll isnt that what its all about fucking you take your pleasure where and when you can oh youre a marvel jaff you are a philosopher too jaff pointed at her shut up bitch im warning you i dont like sarcasm tracy glared at him anyway what does it matter if my dads a dci she repeated it matters because when a coppers involved they pull out all the stops thats why they stick together it matters because it makes everything ten times harder youre a coppers daughter theres nothing he wont do to get you back nothing this is personal for him and hes got the whole bloody countrys police force on his side get it were seriously outnumbered what do you mean get me back from where from who i can just walk out of here anytime i want cant i get real things have changed as you said were in this together and nobodys going off anywhere without the other until it all gets sorted tracy felt a chill and a tightening in her chest so it was true in his eyes she was a prisoner now a hostage or a burden i told you hes on holiday he wont be back till monday how could he come looking for us hes got no idea whats going on but he soon will have when he gets back or hell hear about whats happened from his mates and come back early he could be on his way now no he wont be he doesnt care about me that much just shut up and let me think look said tracy as calmly as she could manage why dont i just go really ill go back to leeds right now as if none of this ever happened i can get a bus to eastvale from the village you can drive on down to london in vics car get your passport and finances sorted and disappear itll be all over and done with before my dad gets back from holiday he neednt know a thing the words sounded hollow and desperate to her even as she spoke them now its you who must think im stupid said jaff why do you think im going to let you just walk out of here and tell the cops everything you know i wont tell them anything i dont even know anything remember you havent told me anything you know about the coke the money and the gun thats enough but youll be even worse off with me as a traveling companion you can hardly take me with you can you ill only slow you down just let me walk away now jaff please then tracy saw the look on his face and froze well jaff said it seems to me that gives me just two options either i dont let you out of my sight for a second from now on or and tracy went cold to the marrow of her bones when she realized exactly what the second option was this is naomi worthing said detective superintendent gervaise to the serious crimes team assembled in the boardroom late that afternoon shes come up from birmingham to tell us all about the gun we sent down many thanks for the quick work naomi naomi smiled at gervaise not a problem she said we got a lucky break she was a plump middleaged woman with graying hair and a benevolent manner hardly what annie would have expected in a ballistics expert she seemed more like miss marple than a member of the csi cast her audience was smallonly gervaise annie winsome harry potter and geraldine masterson who was new to major crimes and dead keen to make a good impression im not going to bore you with all the technical details naomi began but basically were dealing with a mm smith and wesson automatic or more correctly semiautomatic this particular model dates from the mideighties it has a fourinch barrel a sixteen round capacity and it weighs just under two pounds unloaded any questions so far isnt smith and wesson an american company asked annie yes the pistol in question was manufactured in the usa replied naomi which perhaps makes it a little rarer around these parts than a czech or a russian model i mean you wouldnt find one for sale in the local pub and of course a smith and wesson would cost you a lot more money are they readily available over here on and off though theyre certainly not as common at street level as the eastern european models i mentioned look if i can perhaps make a guess at where youre going with this detective cabbot di annie cabbot yes well i wouldnt let the fact that this pistol is american in origin influence your search for its owner and user the odds are that it has been floating around the uk since the nineties if not before its a very popular simple and practical piece of equipment and ammunition for it isnt hard to come by did you say user naomi gervaise asked naomi turned to her yes thats what i was about to get to the reason i came up here rather than simply filing a written report not that a trip to eastvale isnt always a pleasant prospect do tell said gervaise naomi helped herself to coffee added milk and sugar and opened her file folder there were two rounds missing from the magazine bullets and casings thats often the case with automatics as you probably know they eject the casing after firing a clever criminal picks up his spent casings and disposes of them but sometimes people are careless or in a hurry and leave them lying around any idea when the shots were fired annie asked naomi shook her head we cant ascertain when they were fired by examining the pistol she said only that they were fired from that magazine but perhaps even from a different gun its possible i suppose but unlikely unfortunately as i said we dont have the spent casings so we cant check them against the firing pin to make sure unless someones trying to pull a very elaborate trick though i would say theres no reason to doubt that the bullets were fired from this pistol i see sorry please go on naturally we then consulted the national firearms forensic intelligence database which is a bit of a mouthful so ill refer to it as the nffid in future there we discovered that a pistol of this description had been used to commit an unsolved murder in november this information of course is not conclusive it merely refers to a case number and the general model and kind of ammunition consistent with that we found in the magazine but it piqued our curiosity the next step involved shooting the gun under controlled circumstances in order to obtain a sample of a used bullet we could then run through ibisthats the integrated ballistics identification systemdont we just love acronyms the result is that we found a definite link between this pistol and the crime the next step we need to carry out for absolute certainty is to get hold of one of the actual bullets retrieved from the victim and do a physical examination side by side through a comparison microscope this is the kind of thing you see on tv crime programs lands and grooves looks very sexy on screen and where would you get hold of one of these bullets annie asked west yorkshire im not sure exactly where they are but they should still be locked in an evidence room somewhere where did the shooting take place woodhouse moor leeds im not sure where they keep their cold case exhibits said gervaise but thatll probably be weetwood on otley road on the other hand you might be better off trying the homicide and major enquiries team first we may be the largest single county force in the country but west yorkshires got a much bigger urban population than we have and theyve got all the specialists weve got wildlife crime officers and they have a homicide squad theyd probably be the ones to handle a case like that thanks said naomi ive dealt with them before thatll be my next stop so what can you tell us pending a physical comparison naomi sipped her milky coffee not much more im afraid youll have to get the rest of the details from the investigating team all i know is that on the fifth of november a suspected drug dealer called marlon kincaid was shot to death near a bonfire site on woodhouse moor any witnesses annie asked not according to what little information ive got as i say though the nffid and ibis files are skimpy on details im sure the detectives involved will be able to tell you a lot more bonfire night though said annie fireworks might be useful to cover up the noise of gunshots indeed said naomi oh there is one more thing it may be important we examined the pistol for fingerprints of course and we found only patrick doyles the ones you sent us on the grip and barrel which is consistent with his checking to see if it was loaded we did however find two clear sets of prints on the magazine itself only one of them belonging to patrick doyle people often forget that they have to load it by hand you see and they hardly ever think of wearing gloves the magazine remains protected inside the handle and the prints are preserved there are also several partials on the cartridges and they also appear to match the mystery prints on the magazine anything there we ran them through ident of course but im afraid theyre not on file so no name and address said gervaise no easy arrest naomi smiled is there ever no im afraid youll have to sweat this one through when you do come up with a suspect of coursewell the prints are there for comparison even then im afraid all it means is that the person handled the magazine and the cartridges not that he or she committed the murder gervaise looked at annie i suppose wed better start with erin doyle she said can you get in touch with vic manson and deal with it annie of course gervaise checked the time its getting a bit late now but if you and winsome could head down to leeds first thing tomorrow and see what you can find out from the case files and the investigating officers we might start getting somewhere it was almost seven oclock by the time annie got out of the station and into her car the little purple astra had finally given up the ghost earlier that summer but she was quite pleased with the megane she had bought as a replacement especially with the price since the meeting she had tracked down a sulky and passive erin doyle at her bedandbreakfast by the castle and brought her back to the station accompanied by the family liaison officer patricia yu where her fingerprints had been taken after all the paperwork and running back and forth annie felt like nothing more than a large glass of wine and a nice long bath when she got home so numb was her mind that she had driven almost a mile in the wrong directiontoward her own cottage in harksidebefore remembering that she was supposed to go to bankss cottage to water his plants and pick up the pile of post from the floor for a moment annie wavered weighing the wine and the bath against a lengthy detour surely she could postpone the visit until tomorrow the plants would survive and the post was mostly bills and special offers on magazine subscriptions and cases of wine but she felt guilty enough of her neglect already he would be back soon and if it seemed that she hadnt discharged her duties she would feel even worse no matter how forgiving he might be she drove as far as the next roundabout and turned back the way she had come as she passed the police station she thought of chambers who had been strutting around all afternoon with dumb and dumber in tow giving everyone the evil eye annie was down for her official interview the following morning and she wasnt looking forward to that at all she knew how it would go chambers would get dumb or dumber or both of them to conduct the interview because they were supposedly unbiased while he would sit there ogling her as she squirmed loving every minute of it thinking he was setting the world to rights she would have to remember to wear trousers or a long skirt and a loose top that came all the way up to her chin maybe even her poloneck jumperthe loose one not the tight one she turned onto the main helmthorpe road and left the town behind she would drive home over the moors she decided she loved the purity of the bleak landscape in the soft evening light the unfenced roads where sheep wandered the broad sky and magnificent vistas the heather would be in bloom too which was always a bonus and sometimes you could just make out the pale moon in the milkyblue evening sky when she got home she would have the wine and bath cheered by the prospect of an evening drive over the moors and by her decision not to take the line of least resistance and go straight home annie turned left in helmthorpe by the school and drove up the hill to gratly a hundred yards or so past the little stone bridge over the beck she turned right into bankss drive a narrow dirt track with a few patches of gravel here and there it led under a canopy of lime trees and came to a halt in front of the cottage beyond were the woods and to annies right behind the low drystone wall gratly beck ran over its terraced waterfalls then on through the village and down into the center of helmthorpe on the valley bottom it was a beautiful spot and she had often envied banks it annie parked outside the small cottage when she turned off the engine and got out of the car she could hear birds singing in the woods and down the valley over the beck she could also hear music it was some sort of modern rockdistorted guitar thrashing drums and pounding bass what was odd was that it seemed to be coming from the cottage just next to the garage she spotted a car she didnt recognize a ford focus maybe a little the worse for wear and certainly in need of a good wash there was a dent in the rear wing and rust around the wheel arches she knew that banks had been talking about trying to sell the porsche all summer but as far as she knew he hadnt been able to get the right price the ford certainly hadnt been there the last time she had called to water the plants banks had complained to her that when youre trying to sell a porsche people either assume that youre loaded already or that you really need the money consequently they think they can get away with a quick deal at a low price he wasnt loaded but neither did he need the money he just wanted to sell the car annie suspected it might be because it still reminded him too much of his brother whom it had belonged to even though roy banks had been dead for some time now banks had never really got used to it but even if he had sold it he wouldnt have bought a bangedup ford focus hed have probably gone for a volvo or even an audi she thought he wasnt exactly a top gear kind of blokehe had driven an old cortina until it practically fell apart for crying out loudbut he wouldnt be seen dead driving a car like this she had a quick peek into the garage and indeed the porsche was still there which raised a question whom did the focus belong to annie made a note of the number then she dug in her bag for bankss front door key and put it in the lock when it was open she stood on the threshold and shouted hello hello is anybody there there was no pile of letters on the floor so she knew that someone must have been in since she was last there nothing happened at first then the music got quieter and the door to the entertainment room to her left opened out walked tracy carefully shutting the door behind her tracy said annie i didnt know you had a ford focus i dont said tracy i just borrowed it from a friend i see tracy did look different but not that much annie thought it was the haircut mostly a little punkish she wore little or no makeup perhaps a trace of pink lipstick and was dressed in a simple outfit of blue jeans and a light blue sleeveless vneck top leaving an inch or two of bare midriff the piercings werent extreme just a ring at the edge of one eyebrow and a stud under her lower lip like thousands of other young women she did look older than annie remembered though and there was a certain sophistication about her she hadnt noticed before tracy also seemed nervous is something wrong annie asked no what could possibly be wrong what do you want nothings happened to dad has it no said annie shutting the door behind her nothing like that i said id water his plants and pick up the post while he was away thats all how about a cup of tea or coffee or something cup of tea annie gestured toward the kitchen yes you know the little bag you put in a pot and add water to in there oh right sure annie followed tracy to the kitchen noticing how she wasnt entirely steady on her feet her voice had seemed a little slurred too her eyes unfocused and her concentration didnt seem what it normally was annie suspected drugs or perhaps it was just booze anyway she said its a stroke of good fortune finding you here i was getting a bit worried about you worried why surely you must know about erin your housemate theres still some coffee left in the pot i dont know how long its been there will that be okay itll be fine said annie plenty of milk and sugar please even the milk and sugar didnt disguise the bitterness of the burned coffee oils but annie sipped politely and leaned against the kitchen doorjamb its a nice evening she said shall we go into the conservatory thats where the plants are too i still have to water them unless youve done it plants yes the ones i came to water green things in pots oh right yeah annie filled an empty jug by the sink and walked through to the conservatory tracy followed her the room was a mess unwashed plates and cups sat on the low table along with halffull wineglasses one on its side sticky red wine drying on the glass surface been having a party annie asked that oh no just an accident i was meaning to clean it up just havent got around to it yet want some help no its okay ill do it later do you want to sit down i think i will if thats okay annie set her water jug on the table and sat i was saying about erin thats nothing to do with me tracy said quickly biting on a fingernail i saw it on the news but you already knew what had happened before that didnt you how what do you mean rose told you when you got home from work the other evening oh yeah thats right she said the police had been round or something like that she didnt seem to know much you dont seem very clear about it yourself like i said its nothing to do with me is it what are you doing here i just came to get a bit of peace and quiet thats all whats wrong with that im entitled its my dads house annie held her hand up all right hold your horses tracy nobodys saying youre not did you come straight here after you left the house in headingley of course i did where else would i go its just that i got the impression you were rather concerned about erins boyfriend jaff jaff but how do you tracy let her sentence trail off i should have known youve been spying on me for dad havent you i had no idea you were here said annie as i told you i came to bring in the post and water the plants she cast her eyes over the various pots and hanging baskets it looks as if they could do with it too im not very good with plants they all seem to shrivel up and die if i go near them so i see annie paused and tracy showed no interest in prolonging the conversation annie picked up the jug and began to water the plants where is he tracy she asked casually over her shoulder who you know who jaff is he here here why would he be here i told you i came for a bit of peace and quiet maybe you fancy him maybe you thought youd help him hide out for a while until the spot of bother hes in passes over bother what bother i dont understand it was his gun erin had wasnt it i know nothing about any gun it was used in a murder six years ago tracy a young lad by the name of marlon kincaid ring any bells we need some answers here i dont know what youre on about erins fathers dead did you know that well jaff didnt kill him it was you lot who did that the police fair enough said annie anyway i liked him tracy said in a soft voice annie thought she could see tears in her eyes he was always good to me mr doyle im sorry hes dead look im not here to throw blame about annie said but i dont think this is the answer do you i havent done anything youd better go i know you havent done anything but dont you think its time you went back home maybe your friend needs you erin have you thought about her tracy bit her lower lip annie stood up okay tracy she said no more messing about i know jaff is here with you and hes wanted for questioning in the murder of marlon kincaid ive never heard of any marlon kincaid thats probably a good thing ill bet jaffs heard of him though look the only issue is are you both going to come with me peacefully or do i have to send for a patrol car no you cant do that you dont understand you have to go now hes gothe wont he wont what tracy he doesnt have a choice he wont like that cant you just let us go please well leave here ill tidy up honest then well just go but please leave now i cant do that tracy you know i cant annie thought she saw a shadow flit beyond the frosted glass of the conservatory door quickly she moved forward and opened it are you jaff she said as she glimpsed the dark figure reaching into a large holdall on the breakfast table be careful shouted tracy hes got but annie wasnt listening because if you are i think its time before she could finish the sentence she heard two dull pops and felt as if someone had punched her hard in the chest and shoulder then her body started to turn cold and numb her legs wobbled and gave under her then she became aware of falling backward like floating through space onto the table which smashed beneath her weight shards of glass stuck in her back pottery crashed on the terra cotta tiles glasses broke someone screamed far away annie tried to call out and reached up her arms to cling on to some sort of imaginary lifeline but she couldnt grasp it exhausted and fighting for breath a great weight on her chest she fell back on the broken glass and pottery and everything swirled from her mind like water down the drain her chest and throat felt wet and bubbly when she tried to breathe then the lights went out when winsome got to leeds the house in headingley was locked up tight with no sign of rose preston or anybody else a neighbor said she had seen rose walking toward the bus stop with a suitcase the previous evening after a few calls on her mobile winsome was able to track down roses parents address in oldham it wasnt far but the traffic on the m was dreadful at that time of the evening and it was going on for half past eight when she arrived at the small terraced house just around the corner from gallery oldham the shiny new arts center and library rose answered the door herself and on seeing winsomes warrant card she rolled her eyes and said what now id just like to talk to you for a few minutes thats all winsome said rose grabbed a light jacket from a hook by the door okay she said i dont suppose ive got much choice but ive already told you lot everything i know my parents are out and i certainly dont intend being alone with you so lets go to the pub round the corner when they turned the corner all winsome could see was another hill with redbrick slateroofed terrace houses on each side but one of these had a sign outside and it turned out to be the local pub winsome felt as if she were walking into someones living room when they stepped inside but the interior was done out like a proper pub complete with customers bar video machines pool table plush banquettes and ironlegged tables it was on a split level and either took up two houses or it had the same powers over dimension as doctor whos tardis winsome was a secret doctor who fan she would never tell her colleagues at work because they were sure to make fun of herthey all thought her so straight and logicalbut she had always dreamed of being the doctors companion of traveling the universe through space and time meeting shakespeare battling monsters and egomaniacal madmen arriving back on earth before she had even left she bought an orange juice for herself and a pint of lager and lime for rose and they sat down on one of the banquettes why were you so upset when i turned up winsome asked and why would you be so afraid of being alone with me am i that scary looking no its not you im just being more careful thats all i mean its not because youreyou know its nothing to do with that well im glad to know its not because im tall said winsome rose managed a weak smile i meant because youre black you know i did youre teasing anyway its nothing to do with that ive just had it up to here with the police if thats what they really were winsome frowned what do you mean surely nobodys given you a hard time during all this what reason would they have maybe not at first rose said sweeping back a stray tress and tucking it behind her ear i mean it was a bit of a shock the police coming around and searching the place and all that right but they were okay and di annie cabbot didnt she come by to see you yeah she was all right too just wanted to chat about erin and francesca you know so whats the problem rose turned away the other two what other two winsome had no idea that the leeds police had sent anyone to interview rose after the search of the house annie certainly hadnt mentioned it she had mentioned that two men had turned up at jaffs flat passing themselves off as police officers when nobody had in fact been sent out there she could check with di ken blackstone when she went to leeds with annie in the morning of course and she would but for the moment it seemed a promising place to start her chat with rose dont you know rose said dont you ever talk to each other winsome smiled not very often no especially if theyre from another county force i mean theyd be west yorkshire while annie and i are north yorkshire thats what they said more or less but it still seems weird to me all wrong i had a feeling they werent real policemen right from the start anyway they said their names were sandalwood and watkins but i suppose they were lying about that too i dont remember what they said their ranks were but they wore plainclothes yes did you get a good look at their warrant cards did you see if they said west or north yorkshire no they sort of pushed their way in it all happened so quickly i didnt really catch what was written on them i dont think they looked liked yours though how were they dressed suits casual casual jeans buttondown shirts one of them wore a tan wind cheater and the other had a sort of linen sports jacket on light blue thats good rose said winsome making notes youve got a good eye for detail i like to draw you have to really look at things if you want to draw them winsome glanced up from her notebook do you think you could draw them for me now could you do that head and shoulders rose nodded winsome went to the bar and asked the bartender for a few sheets of unlined paper he managed to find some in the office and handed them to her without question when she got back she put them on the table and handed rose a pencil from her briefcase roses hand moved deftly and confidently over the paper sketching an outline filling out the details finally she slid the pages over to winsome thats the best i can do from memory winsome didnt recognize either of the men rose had drawn but that didnt necessarily mean much especially if they were from west yorkshire but somehow she doubted that they were she didnt think they were police officers at all one of them was burly and overbearing with hardly any neck and a shaved head perched atop his broad shoulders he was the biggest rose said and he had a tattoo on the back of his neck it looked like a dagger or a cross or something like that im not sure exactly what it was some sort of symbol anyway it was small but you could see it above his shirt collar winsome studied the other sketch this man was slighter thinner more ferretlike in his features perhaps more intelligent too in a feral sort of way with fine unruly hairginger rose told hera very pale complexion and cold eyes he was the scariest rose said as if reading her thoughts watkins i mean the other one looks big and mean and he wasnt very nice but this oneshe tapped the sketchim glad he was out of the room most of the time he gave me the creeps he didnt say much but hes the one i was really afraid of and the other one told me he really likes hurting people did they hurt you threaten you the big one sandalwood shoved me down in the chair once and gave me a slap across the face that hurt we wouldnt do that rose not real police i know people say things about us sometimes and its easy to be cynical but really she thought of her famous dropkick and went on i mean if were dealing with hard cases who want to hurt us maybe wed get a bit physical but not in a situation like this not with someone like you i told you i didnt think they were real policemen but there wasnt much i could do though was there i felt threatened by them it was much safer just to go along with them and do what they said i thought they were going to beat me up or kill me or what well he leered at me once the big one and i was scared he might be going to rape me or something did he try anything like that no he just laughed at me when he saw what i was thinking like and said not to worry about that tempting as it was i felt dirty she hugged herself totally powerless they could have done anything winsome noticed that her glass was almost empty another she offered i shouldnt but yes please talking about it brings the feelings all back can i have a bacardi breezer this time sure winsome brought her the drink and a diet coke for herself what did they want to know she asked sitting down again did they ask about the gun erin had no they never mentioned it did you know anything about it not until i saw it on the news did they ever mention someone called marlon kincaid no did erin or francesca ever mention him no youre certain marlon kincaid its a funny name id remember what other sort of questions did they ask you one of them had a good look round the place watkins upstairs and everything the other one asked me the questions he wanted to know if i knew where jaff had gonethats erins boyfriend i told him i didnt then he wanted to know about francesca he said someone had seen jaff and her leaving the flat by the wharf together i said i didnt know where they were which is true how did they know about francesca that she was with jaff they didnt they were only guessing from what theyd heard at the flats but they knew there were three of us living in the house and they must have worked it out they wanted to know who she was so you told them what else could i do rose pleaded you werent there you dont know what it was like a couple of the regulars were giving them curious looks okay said winsome stay calm its all right im not blaming you rose sipped her drink im sorry was the gun jaffs i dont know how would i know i never even knew it existed erin certainly never mentioned anything like that what do you think i wouldnt be surprised i never did trust him too flash for my liking why would erin take it do you think i dont know to make him mad maybe she was pissed off at him something was going on between the three of themerin jaff and francesca i dont know what it was they didnt tell me anything but something wasnt quite right winsome made a note then asked what did they do next i cant remember nothing they wanted to know where francesca was where jaff was but i kept telling them i didnt know i was so scared they were going to hurt me anyway but they just left youre one lucky young woman said winsome they must have believed that you didnt know anything else and thought there was no percentage in harming you they also werent worried about you being able to identify them they were pros by the sound of it pros yes professionals amateurs often hurt people theyre careless impulsive professionals are more careful they know that can only bring trouble and attention and thats not what they want yes but professionals in what winsome paused that i dont know she said but im going to have a very good crack at finding out now tell me more about this jaff my god what have you done tracy could only stand there staring down at annies body lying across the broken table among the smashed glass and pottery annies face was ashen covered in a sheen of sweat there wasnt much blood just little smears around the two small holes in her yellow top but that didnt mean much there would be internal bleeding youve killed her what choice did i have jaff said from the doorway the gun still in his hand she wasnt going to just go away you know she knew but tracy continued to stare down at annies immobile form for a moment she thought she could see her chest heave and make a gurgling sound with the effort of trying to breathe but it could have been an illusion we have to call an ambulance like hell we do besides its too late what weve got to do is get out of here fast jaff grabbed tracy firmly by her upper arm and dragged her out of the conservatory into the kitchen he tossed his gun back into the holdall and hefted the bag onto his shoulder while still holding her with his free hand tracy squirmed and tried to wriggle out of his grasp but she couldnt he was wiry but strong her arm was starting to go numb finally he put the holdall down and gave her a sharp stinging slap across the face stop it he said pull yourself together were leaving now tracy grabbed her shoulder bag from the bench before he pushed her through the door into the living room she stumbled and banged the side of her thigh against the sofa it felt as if someone had kneed her hard right on the muscle jaff pushed her again and she tripped into the front door face first blood trickled from her nose she thought it might be broken he grabbed her jacket and thrust it toward her you might need this the nights are getting cold tracy felt dazed as she stumbled outside she wiped the back of her hand across her face jaff please let me call an ambulance nobody could have heard those shots if shes not dead already shell die for sure if we just leave her here thats her lookout jaff fumbled for his car keys letting go of tracy for a moment she walked around to the passenger side perhaps if she took off into the woods made a dash for it but no he would give chase and find her then he would kill her besides if she did that she would never even get a chance to try to save annie if that was even possible there was one thing she could do with her moment of freedom while jaff was at the drivers side opening the door and she was at the passenger side she took out her mobile keeping it low hidden by the car and her body and pressed there was no way she could do it without jaff hearing so she had to be really quick there was an ambulance station in helmthorpe she knew so it shouldnt take them too long when she heard the answering voice she put the phone to her mouth and said ambulance newhope cottage beckside lane gratly come quickly please someones been shot before she could say any more jaff had dashed around the car and snatched the phone from her hand in his anger he threw it to the ground and crushed it with his heel again and again until the pieces were scattered over the gravel that was it tracy thought her heart sinking even lower her lifeline gone she was alone now alone with a killer he shoved her into the passenger seat and started the car tracy began to shake she couldnt get the image of annie out of her mind just lying there pale still and bleeding on the broken glass table but at least she had made the call however dearly it had cost her if there was any hope at all that was it now she had to turn her mind to her own predicament which it didnt take a genius to work out was a lot worse than it had been only half an hour ago she had thought jaff was going to kill her after he had discovered that her father was a policeman but he had come up with another option to keep her as a hostage until he had got to safety he had told her he could use her as a bargaining tool in negotiations she being a dcis daughter was a doubleedged sword he went on and he intended to be the one who was wielding it but annies shooting changed everything hed be far less concerned about killing a second person now and far more worried about his own escape and safety she could still be a bargaining tool but she had just become more expendable than before especially after making the phone call what are you doing she said snapping out of it when she saw jaff was about to turn right at the end of the drive do you think im stupid jaff said since your little act of rebellion with the mobile that main road down there is going to be full of police cars and ambulances im going the other way jaff turned right and headed for the open moors the sun was still up but the shadows were lengthening and the light was turning softer streaks of faint pastel coloring the pale blue sky soon it would dip below the hills and the sky would darken tracy thought she could hear a siren in the distance god she hoped she was right hoped they were in time dont you realize how what youve done changes everything she said one of their own theyll pull out all the stops on this what the hell else was i supposed to do jaff snapped hold out my hands for the cuffs anyway you should know he went on giving her a sidelong glance coppers daughter traitorous bitch but they dont know whats happening yet they dont know about me shed never have come by herself if shed known the truth maybe she had no reason to suspect youd got hold of another gun or that youd shoot her tracy said maybe she did come to water the plants but it didnt take her long to suss out the situation she knew more than you think and that means others will probably know too you cant be certain of that i know how they work would you rather take the risk jaff didnt reply tracy contemplated her position perhaps it was for the best that he had turned right at the end of her dads drive she knew the moors she had come out here with her father many times after his divorce walked the hidden paths with him for hours explored hidden clefts and gullies the abandoned quarries and old lead mine workings there were twelve miles of open moorland between bankss cottage and the next village of any significance jaff was like a fish out of water here dependent on her to show him the way it gave her an advantage especially if she could find an excuse to get him to stop after dark she was still wondering how the hell she could get out of his clutches for as long as it took to disappear when just two miles along the narrow unfenced road the car gave up the ghost jaff tried to start it up again a few times then cursed got out and started kicking the tires fucking vic fucking idiot he kept repeating it like a mantra though the sun had just set there was still too much daylight left but tracy took advantage of jaffs tantrum by edging toward the drystone wall beside topfleet woods perhaps if she could escape into there she could keep far enough ahead of him to double back down to cobbersett a tiny village on the daleside just to the west of gratly from there she could easily make it to helmthorpe and get help she doubted that jaff would pursue her for very long through the woods if he thought the police were after him he would want to go forward not back nimbly she hopped the wall and ran into the trees but tracy underestimated both jaffs intentions and his speed he had kept his eye on her in no time at all she could hear him behind her and soon she felt a tight grip around her neck she jerked to a halt her head snapping back and screamed in pain shut up or so help me ill strangle you here and now said jaff between gasps for breath you stupid bitch youre losing us time get back to the road get us the fuck out of here not back where we came from let go i cant breathe youre breaking my neck promise you wont run anymore i promise i promise let go jaff let go he caught his breath hands on knees while tracy massaged the back of her neck it obviously wasnt broken or she wouldnt still be standing but it certainly hurt like hell finally jaff turned and started walking back to the car cocky and confident enough simply to leave her to follow she hated him at that moment more than anyone ever in her life and she was tempted to take off again but he was faster than she thought and this time if he caught her he would probably kill her she paused and stooped to look for a stone she could smash his head in with but there was nothing he turned and looked at her shook his head then carried on walking again head hung low still massaging her neck she followed like a shameful eve following adam out of paradise some paradise weve got to get rid of the car jaff said theres a gate up ahead you can help me push it there and through then well see if we cant hide it on the other side tracy felt too defeated to respond her nose hurt her neck hurt and her heart ached so she followed him banks had been on the plane since five to five on wednesday afternoon and by his watch it was three oclock in the morning when they finally stopped circling heathrow and began the slow descent it was broad daylight outside banks hadnt slepthe never did on planesbut at least he hadnt drunk any alcohol he had heard that abstinence helped to alleviate jet lag the food had been pretty dreadful and the choice of movies not much better mostly he had read the maltese falcon until his eyes got too tired then he took out his ipod and listened to angela hewitt playing bachs keyboard concertos the noisecanceling headphones he had bought before flying out had been expensive but they were well worth it the music came out loud and clear while everything else was a distant background hum somehow bach managed to calm and relax him on a flight in a way that most other music didnt but soon came the instructions to turn off all electronic devices along with the information that the time in london was am on thursday morning and the temperature was eighteen degrees celsius banks packed up his ipod and headphones and took out his book again for the last few minutes at least they hadnt barred people from reading oldfashioned print on the final descent yet he could see london spread out below him between the clouds as they came in to land from the east the meandering thames the green sward of a large park tower bridge busy streets and clusters of buildings all the familiar landmarks gleaming in the bright sunshine it looked like a fine day but all he really wanted to do was crawl into bed he had booked a hotel room in the west end and planned on spending the weekend in london seeing old friends before taking the train back up north on monday morning he hoped the hotel room would be ready for him when he arrived the plane bumped along the runway and after a lengthy ground journey came to a halt beside a jetway in no time at all banks was shuffling along the miles of airport corridors with the rest of the weary passengers to passport control the eu line wasnt very long and it was soon bankss turn to walk up to the officer and present his passport she checked the photograph against his face scanned it through her computer checked it again then turned around and two burly men who had been hanging back keeping an eye on the arrivals walked forward mr banks can you please come with us sir one of them said in a voice that made it clear that he wasnt asking a question what is please sir the man took his arm and led him away from the queue banks had done the same thing to enough people himselfalbeit in slightly different circumstancesthat he knew not to expect any answers maybe they thought he was a terrorist maybe they would waterboard him they could do what they wanted and there was nothing he could do about it most likely he thought it was something to do with that business with mi earlier in the summer hed made a mess of things then and he had also made some dangerous enemies they had long memories they didnt forget was this some kind of payback for what he had done and how serious were they whatever it was he certainly wouldnt get to say anything until they got where they were going he felt panic rise in his chest his heart thumped and he found it difficult to breathe he also felt faint and lightheaded from jet lag and lack of sleep and fear they led him down the corridor toward the baggageclaim area and through a heavy door to the left marked authorised personnel only after a few more twists and turns along dim and airless passages they got to an unmarked office door one of the men opened the door and with a gentle but firm touch to the small of bankss back the other made sure he went inside then the door closed behind him the office was larger cleaner and betterappointed than he would have expected but there were no windows and a little fan sat on the desk slowly churning the stale humid air it was who sat behind the desk that surprised banks perhaps it shouldnt have detective superintendent richard burgess was somehow connected with special branch and he had helped banks out with a case earlier in the summer the one that made him so nervous about all this security business to start with at the sight of burgess he relaxed a bit and his heart rate slowed closer to normal but there was still something wrong about this because ds winsome jackman was also in the room what on earth was she doing here you all right alan asked burgess you look a bit peaky its not every day i get picked up at passport control by airport security what the hells going on banks realized that dirty dick only knew a part of what had happened earlier that summer and that winsome knew nothing so they couldnt really have any idea of the sort of images that went through his mind or the level of terror he felt when two burly plainclothes security officers dragged him off without explanation after the experiences he had had he could easily believe that people had been led into those very same corridors and had never been seen again take a pew said burgess pushing a bottle of laphroaig and a plastic cup toward him sorry about the lack of crystal ware this is still your tipple of choice isnt it im not sitting anywhere or drinking anything till someone tells me whats going on im sorry about the welcoming committee burgess went on had to be done though i cant go out there and they had no idea why they were doing it they were just following orders its the only way they do things around here winsome will explain what orders whose orders winsome pour yourself a drink first and sit down said burgess go on believe me itll help though he had switched from whiskey to red wine a couple of years ago banks did as burgess suggested immediately he smelled the acrid peaty malt he felt his throat constrict and his skin burn but he managed to take a sip the warmth flooded his veins he could get used to this again just get on with it then whats going on winsomes expression was grave and now banks feared that something might have happened to tracy brian his mother or his father this was the way they told you about a death in the family the solicitous tone a drink a chair to sit on the sepulchral expressions im sorry too said winsome but i think it was the best way detective superintendent gervaise knew what flight you were returning on and mr burgess was kind enough to help out with airport security otherwise id be standing out in arrivals holding up a sign with your name on it i think id have spotted you without the sign winsome come on give what is it its annie winsome said leaning forward theres no easy way to break this shes annie shes what get it out annies been shot banks fell back in his chair and put his hands to his burning cheeks shot last night i didnt want to risk you seeing it in the paper sir it even made some headlines thats whyi mean if youd gone wandering in the concourseyou might have banks instinctively reached for the laphroaig tipped the cup toward his mouth and took a large mouthful it burned as it went down but it helped bring his mind into sharper focus how serious is it its very serious winsome said theyve sent for her father but shes still alive yes but its touch and go one of the bullets nicked her right lung it collapsed the lung and chest cavity filled with fluid she almost didnt make it to the hospital one bullet she was shot twice once in the chest and once in the shoulder the second bullet shattered the clavicle and fragmented itll cause mobility problems but they say itll heal in time the surgeons were operating most of the night they may have to go in again good god whispered banks have you caught whoever did it not yet our informations a bit sketchy where is she now cook university hospital middlesbrough they dont have the facilities at eastvale general to deal with that kind of trauma not many people get shot in eastvale banks pointed out there was a pause burgess reached for the laphroaig bottle and banks saw him exchange a glance with winsome what banks said is there something else it didnt happen in eastvale said winsome she glanced at her watch look do you want to head up to middlesbrough and see her now we can pick up your suitcases at the baggage claim on the way out and ill fill you in on everything i know theres a helicopter a helicopter burgess cleared his throat least i could do mate i put in for a lear jet but budgets being what they are these days he managed a weak grin banks stared at him and swirled the remaining whiskey in his cup before finishing it off thanks he said then he held up the empty cup before he set it down on the desk and for this too burgess just nodded then he got up and opened the door to have a brief word with the two security guards who were still waiting outside theyll escort the both of you out of here he said winsome got to her feet right then said banks lets go he paused in the doorway just one thing if annie wasnt shot in eastvale where exactly did it happen in gratly sir winsome said in your conservatory tracy didnt know exactly what time it was when she awoke from a terrifying dream that skittered off back into her subconscious the moment she opened her eyes leaving her wide awake and afraid she must have dozed off for a while she realized going by the height and position of the sun through the bare roof beams and gaps in the stone walls she guessed it was midmorning her face and arm hurt she felt dirty and wanted a shower but most of all she needed desperately to go to the toilet they were in a ruined barn though most of the roof was gone and large sections of the stone walls had collapsed it had provided some shelter for the night and more importantly a place to hide and remain unseen in the early daylight hours but they had no food and tracy realized now that she was also desperately hungry jaff slept on snoring and snuffling occasionally tossing and turning on the hard floor how could he tracy wondered her hands and feet felt numb from the rope he had found in the boot of vics car and used to tie her up she couldnt even move enough to dislodge the fat black spider that was crawling over her bare midriff she hated spiders it tickled and seemed to her to be deriving some pleasure from the discomfort it was causing her though she knew that was ridiculous maybe it would bite her it just wouldnt go away all night she had fought off panic attacks by deepbreathing but she still felt on the verge of some sort of breakdown as she watched the spiders progress and she knew that if she caused any trouble now jaff would certainly kill her she was here under sufferance because she might be useful he now felt he had nothing to lose he had already shot annie probably killed her and who knew whom else he had shot with the gun erin took annie had mentioned someone called marlon kincaid so maybe jaff had shot him too her only chance was to take to the open moorland the first chance she got and she couldnt do that while her hands were tied behind a post and her ankles bound as she sat there waiting for jaff to wake up tracy cried and longed for her father perhaps he had ignored her neglected her in favor of brian perhaps he hadnt really understood her and sympathized with her failure realized how much it had meant to her especially in the light of her brothers success but she couldnt really blame him for all that at least she didnt want to anymore he had his own life and she knew it had been difficult enough since her mother had left not that she blamed her mother either but the baby had been a bit hard to take growing kid now a half sister but she should have been kinder more understanding she would be if ever she got out of this the birds had started early and the cacophony of their different voices continued through the morning tracys bladder hurt more and more with every second that passed but she wasnt going to sink to the indignity of peeing her pants she had been hoping for hours to hear the sound of a tractor or some other vehicle approaching before jaff awoke but there had been nothing so far but the birds nor had she heard any human voices they were too far from the road besides she realized what chance would a poor farmer or a couple of ramblers have against jaff and his gun anyone who approached them would most likely be walking to their death about an hour earlier she thought she had heard a helicopter overhead but it hadnt swept close enough to see them through the bare roof maybe it would come back and if there was a helicopter there were others searching on foot and in cars it had been hard work but they had managed to hide the car the wall was just high enough to obscure it from the road and they had covered the top with branches and scrub it wouldnt stay hidden for long though someone would enter through the gate and see it soon enough with any luck tracy hoped that would be sooner rather than later and the police would realize they were out on the moors somewhere only a few miles from where they had dumped the car they had come across the barn and as the sun was already rising jaff had said they should hole up there for a while tracy had known by then that he was stumped that he hadnt come up with a plan to get out of this situation he was lost without wheels what did he hope to do hide in the barn all day and then tramp off through the heather again when darkness fell jaff had almost broken his ankle twice last night tripping over heather roots or clumps of springy grass so he wouldnt want to try that again in a hurry it would take them days at this rate and the net would surely be tightening the whole country would be alerted to the search by now tracy hoped but it was best to keep her mouth shut about that she realized if jaff hadnt thought of these things of the full extent of what he had done she wasnt going to tell him the longer they were out here in the wilds the more chance she had of escape or of being found tracy struggled against the ropes once more but they didnt give they just tightened and caused her more pain the spider fell off her stomach and scuttled away she felt the hot tears trail down her cheeks jaff must have sensed something because suddenly his eyes were open and he was dragging himself up into a sitting position clearly stunned tracy thought probably not sure where he was at that moment he had the littleboylost air about him the kind of look that had once made her want to hold him and smooth his hair now she just wanted to smash his head in with a lump of stone and run away as far and as fast as she could if she got the opportunity she would do it too she checked the ground for a loose rock perhaps when he untied her she would get her chance i need to go to the toilet tracy said jaff rubbed his eyes then go tracy squirmed i cant you tied me up it hurts he seemed to think about that for a moment then he got to his feet and walked over to her youd better not try anything i wont slowly he untied her feet first then kneeling behind her her hands carefully winding up the rope and putting it back in his holdall he clearly intended to use it again tracy thought which probably meant that he wasnt going to shoot her just yet unfortunately there were no handy stones to smash into his head and she wouldnt have been able to manage a surprise attack anyway finally tracy was able to get haltingly to her feet she jogged up and down and rubbed her wrists to get the circulation moving the movement made her bladder hurt even more she turned to walk outside where do you think youre going jaff said outside jaff shook his head im not letting you out of my sight for one second not after the stupid stunts you pulled last night but i want some privacy and i want a plate of bacon and eggs and a pot of hot coffee but neither of us is going to get what we want if you want to go you go here at least turn away tracy begged jaff folded his arms no she tried to stare him down to hold back her need but the pressure was too much in the end she turned her eyes away from his stare and face burning with shame turned her back to him let down her jeans and squatted george fanthorpe didnt like being seen in public with darren and ciaran but he didnt like them coming to the house too often either especially if zenovia and the kids were home he tried to balance things as best he could family and business and when they did go out in public as they were doing now having lunch at the wheelwrights inn just outside the village he insisted that darren wear a poloneck jumper to cover the tattoo on the back of his neck and that ciaran wear a suit and comb his hair that way they gave an almost credible appearance of business colleagues luckily the wheelwrights inn had a tiny private snug and the landlord was always happy to accommodate mr fanthorpe if he rang ahead after all fanthorpe was the local squire in all but title the lord of the manor and the locals were deferential to him practically doffed their caps when he walked by it was a role he loved and he didnt intend to jeopardize it by taking the risk of anyone finding out how and where he got the money to run his legitimate businesses such as the dairy he owned which helped support a good number of the areas cattle farmers not to mention a great deal of the land thereabouts which he leased to farmers at reasonable prices with their food on order and three pints of sam smiths old brewery bitter before them they got down to business fanthorpe wanted a cigarette but you couldnt smoke in pubs anymore not even in the snug couldnt smoke bloody anywhere zenovia wouldnt even let him smoke in his own house the one hed paid for with his money all he had left was the garden shed a shabby musty dim and dusty domain for a multimillionaire to escape to for a smoke and a quick gander at the economist three or four times a day right lads so what do we have so far fanthorpe asked after wetting his whistle and wiping the mustache of foam from his upper lip darren gave him the details of their visits to jaffs flat and the girlfriends house where they had had their little chat with rose preston ciaran as usual said nothing merely nodded occasionally so hes definitely done a runner then fanthorpe concluded looks like it with one of his girlfriends housemates thats right the dirty cheating bastard still it shouldnt be too hard to find out who she is darren cleared his throat er we already know that boss good work i wont ask you how you didnt hurt anyone did you ciaran ciaran gave a twisted smile not yet good lad she calls herself francesca said darren but young rose told us that her real name is tracy tracy banks tracy banks said fanthorpe suddenly alert did you say tracy banks right boss why fuck i suppose it could be a commonenough name but if its the one im thinking of shes a coppers daughter alan banks dci alan banks the one up eastvale way thats the one remember him i remember him now said darren ciaran and i did a bit of research into his family a few years ago i just couldnt place the name mr banks and i have crossed swords on a couple of occasions as you know i make a point of finding out everything i can about my enemies nothing proven mind you he never got anything on me but a few years ago when he was local cid he was sniffing a bit too close for my liking youll both remember that hes second in command of western area major crimes now under that new woman superintendent gervaise quite a reputation he has bit of a maverick too by all accounts which is why they say hell never make superintendent doesnt always play by the rules or go by the book all the more fun for us then said darren would you like us to have a word with banks are you fucking insane thatd be a red rag to a bull no no we leave him well out of it the last thing we need is the police knowing any more than they do already right now theyve no reason to come talking to us im just saying be careful if his daughters involved it could mean more trouble than we expected hell be mental things could escalate what about the girl we talked to rose shell remember us should we deal with her permanently i dont want you dealing with anyone right now keep a low profile either theyve already talked to her or shes too scared to say anything either way it doesnt matter lets stay focused here jelena the czech serving girl brought their meals it took her two trips and fanthorpe flirted with her as usual and ogled her arse as she wiggled away darren and ciaran didnt seem interested but they never did sometimes fanthorpe wondered about those two if truth be told he wouldnt have minded half an hour in a haystack with the lovely jelena even a full hour but he knew how far to push it he had plenty of opportunities to play away from home on his business trips no point doing it on his own doorstep around these parts he was a wellrespected family man and it was in his best interests to keep it that way so he stuck to flirting and drew the line at anything further though he wondered if she might be interested in a quick trip to london next week dinner at the ivy take in a west end show the problem is said darren bringing fanthorpe back to the matter at hand that if it is her this tracy banks then shes gone over to the dark side hasnt she the dark side jaff is that meant to be some sort of a fucking joke no darren seemed genuinely nonplussed because if it is its not very funny no boss what i mean is jaffs hardly the sort of bloke you associate with nice girls is he i dont suppose he is now you come to mention it said fanthorpe hes a bad un through and through but these young lassessome of them like that sort of thing got minds of their own these days they have between their legs more like said darren you watch your tongue ive got daughters of my own i didnt mean just watch your tongue thats all sorry boss have you seen the news today havent had time said fanthorpe who found most news except the economic kind boring all they could talk about was sport sex and politics anyway or crime there was a copper shot in swainsdale last night theyre not saying much except it was a woman a di no less and she wasnt even on active duty at the time theres rumors she might not survive jaff well hed have had to get hold of another gun if his girlfriend took the one he had easy enough for him said fanthorpe hes got a mate imports them by the crate load from lithuania baikals with silencers right pieces of shite if you ask me converted from firing teargas pellets i ask you but theyre deadly enough in the right hands no the shooters no problem not for jaff fanthorpe rubbed his stubbly chin i always thought there was something not quite kosher about our jaff much as i loved him like my own a bit too independentminded i wouldnt be at all surprised if he had a few of his own little enterprises going on the side a few irons in the fire we dont know about then its not our problem is it it is now hes made it our problem hes taken something of mine and hes got himself in trouble with the law i dont take kindly to any of that hes opened us up to the kind of exposure and attention we dont want sooner or later when the police come knocking someone talks right now i wouldnt trust jaff as far as i could throw him hes capable of anything look how bloody moody and unpredictable he is and that temper of his like a barrel of dodgy dynamite ready to go off at any moment no i dont want jaff on the loose but this tracy banks business adds a whole new dimension you sure the copper getting shot is connected has to be doesnt it darren said i mean that part of the world swainsdale bit of a backwoods really innit nothing much happens there now all this itd be too much of a coincidence if they werent connected wouldnt it jaff i wouldnt be surprised said darren you said it yourself hes a loose cannon and you think the banks girl is on the run with him along for the ride by the sound of it ill bet hes giving her plenty too bit of a randy goat our jaff maybe she just likes a bit of rough what a fucking idiot hes on the run like an animal hes not thinking clearly not acting rational desperate well that gives us an edge doesnt it said fanthorpe detaching some flakes of crispy batter from his fish the soggy white meat tasted oily there was something not quite right about it and his stomach was already making grumbling sounds maybe he should follow his doctors advice and lay off booze and fatty foods an edge because were going to remain cool calm and collected about this arent we gentlemen both men nodded right where was this policewoman shot i dont know boss they only said her wounds were life i dont mean that you idiot where in swainsdale eastvale helmthorpe lyndgarth they didnt say boxing clever eh fanthorpe sipped some more beer and finished his fish and chips which tasted better now then he said right this is the situation as i see it the way i put the pieces together our jaff was on the run or hiding out somewhere in swainsdale with tracy banks running from a gun charge his girlfriend was no doubt helping to bring against him which as we know not only means a fiveyear stretch which is bad enough but the kind of police scrutiny a lad in jaffs business couldnt survive and hes running with something of mine something of great value not to mention the fifty grand he was supposed to deliver as alan banks works out of western area headquarters in eastvale i think we can safely assume its the same tracy banks somehow or other one of the local plods caught up with them and jaff silly lovable impulsive bugger that he is pulled a gun and shot her that means tracy banks is either with him all the way or shes suddenly become a distinct liability id guess the latter either way shell slow him down unless he just shoots her and dumps her possibly said fanthorpe but hell know she might be useful to him jaffs not stupid we need to find them before the police do or weve seen the last of our little commodities and the money darren added lets not forget the money itll end up under some coppers mattress but where are we supposed to start swainsdales a bloody big place and its mostly full of nothing if i know jaff fanthorpe said hell be heading for the city hes a city boy at heart hes got contacts in london the old boys network youd be surprised how many of them are crooked hes got people who can get him anything he needs for a price no questions asked thats the class he comes from remember he always thought he was a cut above you and me but hes got to get there first i assume hes got a car you cant get around in that part of the world without wheels but he wouldnt use his own car he wouldnt want every patrol car in the area looking out for his number plate would he he might have stolen one darren suggested only if he could be certain the owner was well out of the way for a few days so he couldnt report it stolen but point taken now i happen to know hes got an old mate in leeds called victor mallory the baikal boy as it happens ive used him ourselves for freelance jobs once or twice just small stuff nothing important they went to school together down south one of those posh bumboy places eton or harrow or whatever anyway theyre close this mallory lives just north of the leeds ring road near harrogate road where all those golf clubs are alwoodley something like that according to my sources hes as dodgy as jaff and not only with the guns clever with a test tube they say alwoodleys not so far from the airport is it said darren maybe jaff got on a flight to benidorm or somewhere dont be a fucking idiot darren he couldnt get on a plane to anywhere not with what hes carrying everyone has to go through them security scanners now they can see what you had for breakfast sorry boss forgot no wherever hes going hes got to drive and hes got to unload the stuff in this country unless hes a lot more bloody organized than i think he is and has his own network of couriers and mules which i very much doubt he might risk a bus or a train but hed be worried theyre already keeping an eye on the stations so my guess is hes driving a car nobody knows hes got so heres what you do you go pay this victor mallory a visit ill give you his address be discreet find out all you can from him and give me a buzz on the throwaway the throwaway mind you not the landline and see if you can find out exactly where that copper was shot if jaffs behind it itll give us at least some idea of what route he might be taking but its my guess hes headed for the bright lights he could be there by now said darren fanthorpe clapped his hands well all the more reason to get moving right away isnt it and ask jelena to bring me another pint and a plate of them profiteroles on your way out would you maybe now would be a good time to ask her if she fancied a couple of days away no strings he thought banks felt queasy after the helicopter ride as he followed winsome along the hospital corridors toward intensive care across the hall from the large modern operating suite during the flight winsome had tried to fill him in on the general outline of what had been happening in his absence but the helicopter had been noisy they had had to wear earmuffs and conversation had been all but impossible banks felt numb too partly from lack of sleep and jet lag but also because of the news he had been given about annie he needed to get back into gear fast but he somehow couldnt quite persuade his body or his brain to make the shift as a result everything seemed slightly out of phase movements in his peripheral vision distracted him sharp sounds jarred him and he started to develop a throbbing headache if he was going to collapse he thought he was in the best place for it a short muscular woman with spiky hair came up to them as they neared annies room dci banks ds jackman banks stopped he thought he recognized her from somewhere but he couldnt put a name to the face was she a bearer of bad news you wont remember me she went on im pc nerys powell with the afo team i was with the unit that went to the doyle house banks didnt understand what she meant but winsome seemed to be following all right i know you she said ive seen you around hq and you were at the meeting on monday were spending a lot of time there these days nerys said she turned to banks look sir she said the officer on the door wont let me in to see annie she spoke very highly of you will you let me know how shes doing why do you want to know banks asked he knew he sounded brusque but he was anxious to get past her to annies bedside we were working on the case together she was kind to me thats all its beenthings have beenvery difficult i sort of feel responsible things are difficult for me right now said banks brushing past her then he half turned ill keep you informed pc powell i promise go home now get some rest intensive care had facilities for about sixteen patients but an arrangement of curtains and screens allowed for a certain amount of privacy bankss knees felt weak when he approached annies bedside she seemed so small frail and lifeless lying there against the white sheets amid the machines and tubes but the monitors were beeping steadily and the lcd lights were all on he thought he could see her blood pressure at and her heart rate at which wasnt so bad as far as he knew probably lower than his at any rate a nurse stood by the bedside adjusting one of the tubes and banks asked if he might hold annies hand just for a few moments she said so banks sat there holding the limp hand winsome standing behind him the other hand was bandaged up and held fast in the brace along with her injured shoulder the iv needle was taped to the back of her good hand and several tubes were attached banks could see that she was getting blood and some sort of clear fluid probably saline with whatever medication she was being given there was a yellow clip on her finger also attached to a machine to measure the oxygen level in her blood the lower half of her face was covered by the tube in her mouth and the tape that held it in place her eyes were closed her pale hand was warm to his touch but there was no grip no life in it for a moment his universe shrank to that small space defined by the steady in and out of the pump that was giving her breath if he looked closely he could see her chest gently rising and falling with its rhythm banks felt a stir of air behind him and turned to see a slight asian man he hardly seemed old enough to be out of medical school but he was wearing a charcoalgray suit white shirt and tie not the bright turquoise scrubs that are the sign of a medical student banks had seen plenty of them on his walk down the corridors to intensive care thats enough now said the nurse putting her hand on bankss shoulder this is mr sandhar hes the star surgeon on our trauma team and he operated on the patient perhaps youd like to talk to him banks thanked her kissed annie on the forehead and left her side mr sandhar led banks and winsome through another maze of corridors into a small consultation room there was only one chair so banks and winsome sat side by side on the examination table its tissuepaper cover made a crinkling sound as they sat a chart on the wall depicted the circulation of the blood sandhars chair was next to a weighing machine can you give it to us in plain english banks asked sandhar smiled of course believe it or not we usually do try to translate medical jargon into laymans terms wherever possible for friends and family obfuscation is not our business glad to hear it perhaps it would be easier if you were to ask me questions i should imagine you are quite used to being in that position well im hardly going to interrogate you said banks but i can certainly ask the questions if you prefer first of all can you tell me what happened ms cabbot has been shot twice one bullet entered her chest passing through the middle lobe of her right lung and the other hit her left clavicle and fragmented causing a fracture she was perhaps fortunate in that neither bullet exited though that very fact alone caused an entirely different set of problems those being sandhar crossed his legs and rested his hands on his lap from my information he said the response time of the ambulance was within ten minutes which is excellent for a rural area and for a category a emergency which this most certainly was whoever made that call probably saved the patients life as i understand it that person has not been found but i think thats your domain rather than it is mine to continue the patient had already lost a significant amount of blood by the time the paramedics arrived but had the weapon been more powerful and had the bullets exited theres no telling how much more blood she would have lost with an entrance wound only you see the skin has a certain elasticity and it closes around the point of entry he used his thumb and forefinger to mimic the puncture hole closing not so much blood is spilled so annie was lucky the bullets didnt go all the way through banks repeated i see thats probably the good news what about the other problems most of ms cabbots bleeding was internal and the leaking fluid put pressure on her lungs not allowing them to expand again he used his hands as he talked moving his open palms close together as if about to applaud or mimic the action of bellows one of her lungs collapsed and as you can imagine she experienced serious breathing difficulties as a result if the other lung had stopped functioning she would have died before the ambulance arrived luckily it didnt the paramedics acted quickly and had the knowledge and equipment to deal with the situation en route they managed to stabilize her in eastvale general infirmary and then airlifted her here but shes going to be all right said banks you fixed it i mean you operated sandhar paused we operated but i must stress that the patient is far from out of danger yet it could go either way what you mean right now theres a struggle going on if shes strong enough shell win it at the moment no one can predict the outcome shes strong banks said the doctor nodded good she will need to be when will you know more the next twentyfour hours are crucial well be monitoring her constantly looking for any signs of decline or improvement theres nothing else we can do right now but wait im sorry is there anything we can do if youre religious you can pray and if not you can hope victor mallory was pleasantly stoned after a few drinks at lunchtime and a nice spliff when he got home he had just put toru takemitsus i hear the water dreaming on the cd player and was about to lie down and drift off for a while when he heard the doorbell ring if he had already lain down he thought he might not have bothered answering but it could be important maybe jaff had brought his car back or maybe the nubile marianna from the golf club had taken him up on his offer after all so he answered it immediately he opened the door he knew he had made a mistake and desperately wished he could close it again stoned or straight he wouldnt have liked the look of the two men who stood there they could mean nothing but trouble panicking he did try to shut the door but his reactions were too slow and they easily pushed their way into his hallway they would probably have broken the door down anyway he realized in his business he met some nasty types from time to time and he generally found that he could talk his way out of most situations but this time he wasnt sure they didnt look like good listeners the smaller one with the ginger hair resembled a speed freak bad teeth and all and victor didnt like speed or speed freaks they were wild and unpredictable that was why he stuck to making e and the good old psychedelics like acid mescaline and psilocybin not a huge market these days it was true but in his eyes they beat crystal meth and crack cocaine and the kind of people you had to deal with in that world people like this it could only have to do with jaff who wasnt anywhere near as fussy about what he took or what he sold to make a living come in gentlemen he said make yourselves at home they didnt appear to have a sense of humor they pushed him into the living room and sized the place up the smaller one checked out the rest of the house to see if anyone else was there while the big bald one sat silently eyeing the modern art on the walls prints by dali hockney magritte rothko the smaller one returned and satisfied that they were quite alone with their quarry they first closed the heavy curtains and turned on the standard lamp then they got down to business first said the big bald man will you turn that fucking racket off it makes me feel like i need a shit confused victor turned off the cd player i like it he said its really quite soothing if you let id also ask you to turn those bloody paintings around if you could the man went on ignoring him they have about the same effect on my bowels but we dont have time to mess about ciaran the gingerhaired man came forward gestured for victor to sit on one of the hardbacked chairs from the dining table and proceeded to use heavy gray duct tape to fasten his legs securely to it and his arms around his back to finish off he ran the tape around victors upper body and fastened him tightly to the chair back victor sat passive and silent through all this he didnt want them to think he was going to cause trouble there was a chance that this was all a dream and he could close his eyes and make it go away he tried but it didnt they hadnt taped his mouth shut so he assumed they wanted to ask him questions which was a good sign the paranoia was building though getting its hooks into him but as long as he could talk there was hope gift of the gab thats what everyone said about victor he could charm the birds out of the trees this need not come to a bad end right said the bald one once victor was trussed up to the others satisfaction you may not know this but one thing ive learned over the years is that the secret of fear isnt the inflicting of pain not at all its to do with the anticipation of pain so what were going to do is this he took an object from the small grip he had put down on the sofa beside him and set it on the low glass coffee table know what this is an egg timer more properly known as an hourglass or a sand clock see how its shaped thats why they sometimes talk about women having hourglass figures did you know that victor did but he wasnt keen to appear too clever in front of these men he had dealt with similar types before and found that at the first sign of intellectual superiority they became more resentful and therefore more aggressive a public school education followed by an oxbridge degree was definitely not an advantage in these circumstances no he said i didnt i thought it was an egg timer you turn it over and the sand falls through the tiny hole from one glass bulb to the other very clever really sometimes i could watch it for hours of course it doesnt take hours it doesnt even take anywhere near an hour so why they call it an hourglass i dont fucking know except it looks like a womans figure and they talk about hourglass figures dont they now these you might find even more interesting ciaran the other man took a large folded pouch from the same grip set it on the table next to the hourglass and unfurled it this is ciarans collection of surgical instruments the man went on not that hes a surgeon or anything didnt have the latin did you ciaran thats a judge said victor what the bald man asked fixing victor with a blank stare he could have been a judge but he didnt have the latin victor regretted the words immediately they were out they smacked of superiority what the hell did he think he was doing correcting this yahoos quotation what the fuck are you talking about sorry the sketch its peter cook and dudley moore the two men looked at each other and shook their heads whatever the bald one said anyway like i said before i was so rudely interrupted our ciarans no surgeon bit of an amateur really but he likes the tools and he likes to dabble the collections a bit of a ragbag no rhyme nor reason to it except ciarans personal tastes the bald man picked up the sharp gleaming instruments one by one now i dont know what these all are but i do know that some of them are used in dermatology know what that is a clever boy like you should do university education latin and all no it means theyre sharp enough to peel an eyeball gives a whole new meaning to keeping your eyes skinned doesnt it others are meant for making deeper cuts through layers of fat or muscle and then there are things that keep the edges of the wounds open or hold back the underlying organs and tissue while the doctors do their business and put their hands inside or rip things out he held up a hooked instrument retractors of various sizes and designs clamps too to slow down the bleeding and most of these other blades are so sharp that they probably dont hurt very much at first like when you cut yourself shaving you dont really feel it but eventually the pain comes delayed reaction the bloods already there of course all over the place by then i should imagine as the bald man talked victor felt his spirits sinking and his heart rate rising he knew the kind of damage and pain these instruments could inflict even the dental probe terrified him his mouth was dry and his skin clammy why are you doing this he croaked what do you want i havent done anything you dont have to do this ciaran busied himself with the instruments lovingly and carefully polishing each one with a white cloth the bald man looked on smiling what a perfectionist i tell him not to bother theyll only get bloody again but every time without fail he has to polish his instruments maybe hes just an optimist maybe he thinks he wont have to use them this time he doesnt said victor licking his lips he doesnt have to use them what do you want ill tell you if its money take it we dont want your money and im sure youll tell us plenty said the bald one but im also sure you can understand that we have to be certain youre telling us what we need to hear not just what we want to hear theres a subtle difference ill tell the truth the man laughed hear that ciaran hell tell the truth thats a good one where have you heard that one before what do you mean victors mind was clear enough now for him to worry because the bald man had no hesitation about calling ciaran by name if that was his real name and that couldnt be good could it i wont talk i wont tell anyone he added for good measure no that you wont said the bald man see those tongs and that blade there very good for loose tongues those are victor swallowed his tongue felt too big for his mouth the bald man clapped his hands but thats all further down the road after weve reached what i call the point of no return first off lets just have a go shall we see how we start off starter for ten eh an educated lad like you ought to know university challenge lets see how far we can get without resorting to any serious unpleasantness thats fine with me said victor good the way it works is like this the man turned the hourglass until the sand started slowly sifting through the tiny hole into the other glass bowl im not sure exactly how long this takes he said to be honest ive never actually timed it but while the sand is still running ciaran here will hold back with his instruments thats the amount of time youve got to give me the answers i need understand yes yes please go on ask me anything hurry victor glanced at the sand it was moving far faster than the laws of physics allowed he was certain rushing through at an alarming rate calm down victor theres no hurry plenty of time please ask me what you want to know start now need to know all right need victor wanted to yell just bloody get on with it as he eyed first the cascading sand then the shiny curved retractor that ciaran was polishing he felt his bowels loosening he said nothing well start with questions we think we know the answers to already that way well know if youre lying a kind of litmus test youre a friend of jaff mccreadys yes or no yes right good start did he come to see you recently the other day yes monday i think well done what did he want to swap cars for a few days did you swap yes hes a mate he was in a jam you help out a mate in a jam dont you highly commendable tell me the make color and number of your car victor told him what else i dont understand what else did he want nothing tuttut victor the bald man tapped the hourglass it seemed to make the sand move even faster times running out all right all right he wanted a shooter and you just happened to have one lying around i have a source i help people out sometimes jaff knew that so you gave him a gun sold him one a baikal with a silencer im not interested in the make youre wasting time is that all yes i swear where is he i dont know he just drove off i didnt even see which way he went where was he going i told you i dont victor you dont have long left better stick to the truth ihehe said he had a girl waiting outside in his car tracy banks i dont know i didnt see her and he didnt mention her name i thought his girlfriend was called erin but you never know with jaff quite the ladies man eh yes where were they going all he said was that they were going to chill out at her dads place in the country for a couple of days while he got things organized then he was heading down to london where in london i dont know honest i dont he didnt say victor why would i lie i dont know your times running out i certainly wouldnt lie in your position but you are lying arent you victor licked his lips look hes got a mate in highgate bloke called justin ive only met him once hes involved in peoplesmuggling and all kinds of nasty shit its not my scene at all i dont know his last name jaff said justin would help him out if it came to it fake passport and all that thats all i know honest highgates a big place im sorry thats all i know maybe ciaran will be able to get a bit more out of you victor struggled at his bonds but it did no good i dont know any more the bald man watched the sand contemplatively for a few moments then he said what do you think ciaran ciaran stared at victor for what seemed like an age the sand flowed through the tiny hole it was almost all gone now victors mouth was so dry that it hurt his throat when he tried to swallow he felt that if this went on much longer he was going to start crying and begging for mercy nah said ciaran and rolled up his instruments not worth it he doesnt know any more victors mouth dropped the bald man picked up the hourglass and put it back in his grip close call victor he said going over and ruffling victors hair very close call well let you get back to your shitty music again but rememberwe know where you live i suppose i dont need to tell you whatll happen if theres any comeback on us for this do i victor shook his head good lad the bald man slapped victors cheek playfully but still hard enough to hurt two or three times then said ciaran they turned off the light and walked toward the door arent you going to cut me free victor asked in a small voice the bald man paused in the doorway i dont think that would be a good idea he said ciarans hand might slip with the blade like another layer of skin that duct tape i tell you what though he took the tape out of the grip and walked over cutting off a short strip with a pocket knife thisll help save you from yourself dont worry someone will turn up eventually they always do but how will i explain the man slapped the tape over victors mouth before he could finish the sentence use your imagination victor use your imagination then they left pausing only to turn on the cd player on their way out hospitals always depressed banks and sitting in the coffee shop watching the people taking a short break from dealing with sick children relatives dying of cancer or lying there senile in geriatric wards didnt help at all the couple at the next table were talking about the side effects of prostate surgery banks tried to shut it out and concentrate on what winsome was telling him at least the coffee was good and he got a chocolate rush from the kitkat it was well after lunchtime but he wasnt really hungry sleep seemed a long way off too after seeing annie lying there like that and hearing what winsome and mr sandhar had told him a nurse had told them that annies father ray was on his way up from st ives by train so as far as i can gather from what youve told me banks summarized annie was shot when she went to my cottage to water the plants didnt it also cross her mind that tracy might be there with her boyfriend probably not im sure she didnt really think that would be the case or she would have brought in backup not if she thought she was protecting me or tracy said banks gloomily not if she didnt want anyone else to know thought she could nip any problems in the bud go on hes not really tracys boyfriend he was erin doyles but erins been arrested for possession of a handgun yes shes out on police bail this boyfriend jaff his names jaffar mccready but everyone calls him jaff hes most likely the one who shot annie so we think and tracy made the call yes said winsome it was a female voice and it was her mobile number ive also heard the recording at the dispatch center it sounds like tracy as well as i can remember she sounds scared as well she might said banks we found her mobile phone at the scene close to where we think their car was parked it had been smashed to pieces the sim card was still in intact and it showed the phone hadnt been used since monday isnt that when this whole business started its when juliet doyle turned up at the station to report finding a firearm in her daughters bedroom yes according to annie she asked for you me yes i should think she hoped you would deal with it without making too much of a fuss that things would go better for erin i see said banks but i wasnt there and things went haywire erin got arrested and tracy went to tell the boyfriend looks that way said winsome and juliet doyle shes stopping with harriet weaver no charges against her naturally naturally i dont suppose this jaff would want tracy using the phone if he thought we might link the two of them and track her down through her mobile use but she loved that mobile she was never off it he must have taken it from her on monday kept it switched off was she there with him willingly she cant have been what do you think we honestly dont know winsome said she might have been in the first place i mean according to rose she went over to his place of her own free will after that we dont know how events unfolded but she must have been the one who took him to your cottage maybe he forced her to take him its possible all we know is what tracys housemate told us but we dont know what happened after they got therethe place is a bit of a shamblesbut like you i cant believe tracy would willingly have anything to do with annies shooting of course not said banks its absurd however this all started i think we have to assume that tracys under duress right now shes a hostage of this jaff mccready thats an odd name by the way know anything about him ive been doing a bit of digging his mothers from bangladesh was she died of breast cancer a few years ago she was only forty anyway she was a model very lovely by all accounts she married jack mccready he came from east kilbride originally but he built up an empire of bookmakers down south and did a bit of investing in the movie business thats how they met he liked to hang about with the stars and directors and such dont we all said banks ive heard the name seen his photo in the papers and his name in the gossip columns from time to time starlet on each arm sort of thing cant say as ive ever met a bookie i could trust dead though isnt he heart attack said winsome eight years ago there were rumors about him money laundering nobbled horses fixed races what have you nothing proven and the death was all aboveboard anyway the parents split up when jaffar was eight he went with his mother to india she became quite a famous bollywood star there i think jaffar himself got used to a certain amount of fame and celebrity rubbing off on him then his mother died tragically and he was sent back here he was thirteen then his father put him straight into boarding school no love lost there i imagine then he went to cambridge read philosophy bright average he got through they said that he could have applied himself more they said that about me too could have tried harder troublemaker winsome smiled i think mccready was more of a misfit really hes got no form definitely not your runofthemill disaffected youth no said banks perhaps a bit more deeply psychologically scarred how old is he thirtyone jobs never had one as far as we can determine was he on our radar at all no but i had a chat with ken blackstone and west yorkshire are aware of him thats all nothing concrete just a lot of suspicions drugs mostly they suspect hes linked with an illegal laboratory among other things something to do with an old mate from cambridge a chemistry student its an ongoing investigation a slow one ken says they havent found anything yet she took the two sketches that rose preston had made from her briefcase and these two charmers are also looking for jaff and tracy they pretended to be police officers gave tracy and erins housemate a hard time banks examined the sketches they were good qualitybold confident lines and subtle shading he was no expert but he thought rose showed talent as an artist she said their names were sandalwood and watkins thats a lie said banks theyre darren brody and ciaran french winsomes jaw dropped you know them i made it my business to know them weve met in passing they work for george fanthorpe better known as the farmer i know that name you should one of the best kept secrets in the county thinks of himself as lord of the manor gentleman farmer owns a dairy and acres of farmland stables and horse training too lives near ripon his crooked reach stretches as far as middleham beyond too probably they were asking about jaff and his dad was a bookie winsome said think there might be a connection i doubt it said banks perhaps at one time but jack mccready is long dead and fanthorpes main source of income is drugs cocaine and heroin mostly bulk never sees or touches the stuff himself of course mr big mostly deals with the student population the farming businesses are a nice facade handy for laundering the money hes probably the only dairyman making a healthy profit these days or any kind of profit the racehorses are a hobbythe sort of thing a country squire might be expected to take an interest in the stables might actually be profitable how do you know about him banks finished his coffee just one of those things i talked to a minor drug dealer called ian jenkinson at eastvale college about six years ago just a follow up for a west yorkshire case and he let the farmers name slip in connection with a murder on woodhouse moor another lowlevel dealer called marlon kincaid who catered mostly to the leeds student population apparently jenkinson got some of his supplies from this kincaid who in turn we think got them from fanthorpes organization or should have done as it turned out he was freelancing and this annoyed the farmer i paid the farmer himself a visit smooth bastard played the part well but you know how you get a feeling sometimes develop an instinct im getting one now winsome said it cant be a coincidence what cant that name you just mentioned marlon kincaid i hadnt got around to telling you yet but were almost certain that the gun we found at the doyle house was used in his murder on november fifth thats about the right time said banks very interesting winsome nodded indeed maybe we should have another chat with this ian jenkinson if we can find him what happened well it was like i said a hunch i did a bit of digging but i couldnt get below the surface all the snitches clammed up scared next time i went to see the farmer ciaran and darren here were with him lurking in the shadows business associates he introduced them as i noticed them on a couple of occasions after that following me parked over the street shopping in the same supermarket always said hello and smiled asked after the family that sort of thing mild intimidation and were you intimidated a bit those two have a nasty reputation darrens just a thug not without brains entirely but a thug nonetheless ciaran takes a genuine pleasure in hurting and humiliating people rumor has it theyve killed more than once and the killings are linked to fanthorpe but you know the way it goes sometimes no evidence perfect alibis then something else came up marlon kincaid was well known as a dealer to the student scene and most people felt the planet was a better place without him we got no further on fanthorpe or on the murder you know as well as i do that someone in that business can antagonize a lot of people from rivals to disgruntled parents whose kids have overdosed west yorkshire checked all the avenues but came up with nothing we were only marginally involved because of the ian jenkinson connection we had nothing on the farmer to start with hes never been charged with anything maybe the forensic accountants could have made a case if theyd got access to his books like they did with al capone but we didnt even have enough for a warrant the cps said forget it there were more urgent matters screaming for our attention fanthorpe faded into the background with a little flag beside his name ciaran and darren disappeared from my life i cant say as i ever forgot any of them but nor did i lose any sleep over them either winsome studied the sketches i can see that you wouldnt forget them in a hurry ugly customers i wonder why they arent more concerned about people giving descriptions of them after a visit they rely on the implied threat that theyll come back and take their revenge most of the people they deal with are the same sort of scum as they are so they know that rose isnt from their world will they go after her should we offer her protection i dont think so shes not important enough for that she was a means to an end whether they got what they wanted out of her or not its my bet theyd have no further interest theyve moved on they dont care if we know what they look like or find their prints all over the house they know that for one reason or another it wont go any further if the worst comes to the worst theyll have rock solid alibis do you have any leads beyond what happened at the cottage i need to find this little gobshite whos abducted my daughter and scrape him off my shoe if youll pardon the crude talk ill pardon it this once sir winsome said because i know youre upset thank you one thing ive been meaning to ask go ahead about tracy being involved are you going to call your family and let them know sandra brian banks thought for a moment and massaged the bridge of his nose with his forefinger and thumb the caffeine and sugar rushes hadnt lasted he felt exhausted again like lying down right here and now and curling up in the fetal position conversations hummed around him but they were all meaningless drivel i dont think so he said not yet at any rate the last thing i need right now is sandra on my back or even brian running around trying to help theyd only get in the way besides as far as i know hes on tour with the band somewhere but shouldnt they be informed by you before they read about it in the papers or see it on the tv news we cant keep the details of whats happened from the media forever i suppose they should but why worry them at this point worst case scenario ill tell them later best case all goes well and theyll never need to know what about your mum and dad they are tracys grandparents theyre on a cruise said banks theyre always on a cruise these days winsome shrugged its your decision theyll probably find out when they get back anyway probably but thats then and this is now whats the latest im not up to speed said winsome remember i got the airport detail okay thanks for doing that by the way lets head for the station and see what we can find out whats my role to be in all this i can hardly sit at home and twiddle my thumbs but i doubt that madame gervaise will want me on the case she wants to see you about that as soon as possible winsome said im sure shell find you something to do and as far as sitting around at home is concerned i think youd better organize some alternative accommodation to twiddle your thumbs in as soon as possible banks looked puzzled what why maybe youve forgotten the protocol sir but your cottage is now a crime scene its locked down you cant go home banks made the phone call to arrange for his accommodation on the way to western area headquarters in the patrol car winsome had arranged mrs haggerty was shocked by the recent shooting in the village in a policemans house as well she said what are things coming to and she proceeded to tell banks that the last and only other shooting they had had there was in when a local farmer mistakenly fired his shotgun at a tramp thinking he was a german spy the tramp suffered only minor injuries and no charges were brought luckily the flat that she had let to banks once before when newhope cottage was being rebuilt after the fire was vacant an american couple had booked it she said but the husband had lost his savings and his job in the recent financial collapses over there and they had had to cancel at the last minute at least banks thought he would be on familiar territory and he did still have all the clothes and toiletries he had taken on holiday with him there was a washerdryer unit in the flat he remembered so he could have clean clothes again by tomorrow western area headquarters seemed much more crowded than usual but annies shooting had cast a somber pall over the place a number of officers nodded grimly to banks as he walked in and winsome helped him carry his suitcase and hand luggage upstairs before heading for the major crimes squad room to check if there had been any developments when banks opened his office door he found that the space was already occupied by this time the shock and jet lag had eroded his patience to breaking point what the hell are you doing snooping around my office he said dropping the heavy suitcase and carryon bag on the floor get out superintendent reg chambers remained seated behind bankss desk welcome home he said nobody told me you were coming in today but now that youre here we might as well have a little chat banks glanced around everything seemed as he had left it as best he could remember and he knew that he had locked his filing cabinets and drawers there was a master key of course but detective superintendent gervaise had that and chambers would never be able to guess his computers password i still want to know what the fuck youre doing here my job dci banks im on an active investigation that means i have the run of the station i dont think so chambers waved his hand and stood up mere technicalities he said anyway lets not get off on the wrong foot its the only quiet haven in the building i needed a bit of peace and quiet thats all dont worry i havent touched anything you can have it all to yourself again he picked up his folders from the desk ill go now then he paused in the doorway unless unless what well i would like a word with you we could do it later of course but why not do it now seeing as were both here that is if youre up to it i understand youve been on holiday banks walked over to the window and looked out over the cobbled market square reassuringly it hadnt changed then he turned and rested the backs of his thighs against the cold radiator why do you want to talk to me he asked i wasnt here this has nothing to do with me your name was mentioned you know the people involved you might be able to help i doubt it even solook i heard what happened to annie cabbot chambers went on a deep frown wrinkling his brow im really sorry how is she touch and go said banks he walked back over and sat in his chair which was still unpleasantly warm from chambers and offered the superintendent the seat opposite lets do it now he said he would rather have waited but there was also a slim chance that he might pick up a useful scrap of information from a chat with chambers besides he wasnt going to show the man weakness or tiredness that was just the kind of thing chambers fed on chambers sat down and scratched his head right well i suppose you must have some idea of whats been going on around here in your absence i know said banks yes well its my job to get to the bottom of it youre after portioning out blame according to the demands of the media thats what youre doing basic public relations lets not try to dignify it remember who youre talking to well if youre going to take that attitude i cant see us getting anywhere can you dont get in a huff its you who wants to talk to me after all ask your bloody questions and make it quick just remember youre not talking to some frightened probationary constable whos forgotten to pay his tea money this week chambers puffed out his considerable chest its my brief to investigate the conduct of all officers concerned in the lethal discharge of a taser against patrick doyle and the events leading up to that tragic occurrence in case you dont know that incident happened on monday morning at the home of the deceased during a routine police operation routine there was nothing routine about it from what ive heard then perhaps youve heard wrong or you havent heard enough anyway said banks like i said im not involved i was out of the country its my understanding that a woman came to this police station asking for you juliet doyle yes i know her but as i said i wasnt here in what capacity do you know her we used to be neighbors is that all youre trying my patience chambers so your relationship with the doyle family was as a family friend yes the daughter too yes and patrick was a good friend so knock it off with the innuendos theres nothing there and no reason for it im concerned as to why this woman should ask for you in person when she came to report an illegal handgun its natural enough to seek out someone you know in a difficult situation isnt it dont you think she did it because she expected special treatment i dont know its not my place to speculate as to motive or yours as i said a familiar face goes a long way if youre upset do you think mrs doyle had any idea of the legal penalties involved in possessing a handgun i have no idea probably not most people dont because this is her daughter were talking about and theres no denying prison time would be involved she did what she thought was best thats easy enough to say banks got up and walked over to the window again the butcher over market street to his right was taking all the cuts of meat from his display window and his assistant was scrubbing the trays a last minute shopper dashed in through the door and the butcher looked up to smile and serve her banks turned to face chambers why are you asking me these questions what do you hope to gain ive already told you i wasnt here you should be concentrating on the afos involved dont tell me my job chambers thumped the table that woman asked for you specifically and i want to know what you would have done if youd been here oh thats it said banks were dealing in wouldhaves and whatifs now are we a man died you dont have to remind me he was my friend could you have prevented it could i i dont know what does it matter it would have been out of my hands you want to know what i would have done its easy i would have got as much information as i could from mrs doyle and tried to verify then assess the circumstances in all likelihood i would have logged the incident and it would have been passed on to our area control room the acr would no doubt inform the divisional duty inspector responsible for the area concerned and she would in turn make the force duty supervisor aware of the log they would discuss the circumstances and the fsup would then ask that more information be gathered once that had been carried out the fsup would request that the ddi deploy a conventional double crewed response vehicle ensuring that all officers have full personal protective equipment the fsup would thendo you really want me to go on no thats quite enough but thats the procedure dont try to teach your grandmother to suck eggs chambers you wouldnt have gone around there by yourself well that would probably have been the best course of action to take wouldnt it they would have been expecting me so they wouldnt have felt threatened mrs doyle would have been accompanying me and she would have let me in so i wouldnt have had to break down the door and i wouldnt have been carrying a taser or a weapon of any kind but thats not following the rules is it what the bloody hell did you expect me to say chambers looked fit to burst he made a noise somewhere between a huff and a snort then lumbered to his feet again youre not being helpful you know youre impeding the investigation ill be making a note of this im not impeding anything this is pure fantasy what happened happened i was five thousand miles away or more but you do that said banks calmly you go ahead and make your notes but before you do be aware of one thing chambers paused at the door and what may that be things have changed since you started this particular witchhunt i obj a policewoman has been shot annie cabbot my friend my partner he felt himself choke up and struggled for control even as he spoke the word partner it sounded odd to his ear blame dashiell hammett and three weeks in america he would normally have referred to annie as his colleague or oppo or even as his di but partner sounded good she was he would use it from now on he remembered a line from the maltese falcon about when a mans partner gets killed hes supposed to do something annie hadnt been killed thank god but he still knew that he had to do something and he could start by putting chambers in his place annie would approve a policewoman has been shot banks repeated the media and the politicians wont be all over the afos and their tasers from now on theyll be on our side the hue and cry will be about how many illegal handguns are floating around out there and you will have nothing to gain from crucifying anyone inside the department thats not what i so why dont you think about that circumstances change if you want to be a poster boy for the media get with the game and make sure youre on the right side close the door behind just then there was a tap at the door chambers stepped back and detective superintendent gervaise popped her head around didnt interrupt anything did i ah superintendent chambers i see youre finding your way around without any difficulty alan welcome back fancy a cup of tea and a chat my office now tracy could tell that jaff was fed up with walking he had been quiet and sulky for the past hour no doubt trying to come up with a new plan like growing wings they had been walking under cover of as many wooded areas as they could find which were few and far between up on the moors and as far from even the most minor unfenced roads as they could get at one point they had spent over an hour walking along the narrow bottom of a weedandnettlechoked gully getting stung all over surely somebody must have found the abandoned car by now and reported it to the police tracy reckoned she wondered how long it would take them to link it with her and jaff and annie would they have vics name on their records how was annie doing was she still alive there were too many questions she couldnt answer they had managed about eight or nine miles in all since theyd left the cottage having driven only the first two before the car broke down and they were now deeper into the moors than she had ever walked with her father tracy had lost the advantage of knowing the lie of the land she hadnt heard the helicopter again and they were too far away to hear cars on the road not that there were any roads to anybody seeing them from a distance they would probably look like a pair of ramblers though closer observation would have revealed they were hardly dressed for the part and that jaffs walking skills certainly left a lot to be desired most of the time he seemed to walk as if he were striding down a city street tracy thought without paying attention to the land beneath his feet which was why he tripped and fell so often tracy had been alert the whole time but there hadnt been a single opportunity to steal away without the certainty of jaff s catching her he wasnt going to let her out of his sight for a moment her failed escape attempt after the car broke down and the embarrassing experience that morning should have told her as much it was midafternoon when they came to the crest of a long grassy slope and saw the car park below there was no village no houses only the halffull car park with its public toilets stone walls and payanddisplay machines at the end of a rough track that wound away into the distance and disappeared over the next hill on the far side a stile in the drystone wall led to a public footpath with a wooden signpost which stretched for several hundred feet then dipped into a wooded area and disappeared from sight tracy recognized where they were now she had been here before what the fucks that jaff asked they lay on their stomachs looking over the brow of the hill a blade of grass tickled tracys nose and she rubbed it its popular walking country around here she said i think thats the car park for rawley force a local beauty spot a lot of people do a circular walk from there how long does it take about three and a half hours why do you fancy trying it dont be fucking clever but i do have an idea we could practically be in london in three and a half hours tracys heart sank when she realized what he was saying youre going to have to come up with something better than that she said havent you realized that every copper in the country will be looking for you since you shot annie cabbot stupid bitch asked for it tracy sighed im hungry she said hoping he would admit to feeling the same way and delay what he obviously had in mind me too he said but itll have to wait come on lets get closer they kept behind the brow of the hill and made their way in a sweeping curve toward the car park when they were directly above it about two hundred yards away jaff commanded her to stop and lie low again the deep cleft of a driedup streambed ran beside them down the hillside jaff pointed to it if we go that way no one will be able to see us from the road or the footpath can we get to the m from here and dont lie ill soon find out and youll regret it tracy pointed to their left we have to take that track its the only way out i think it ends at a b road and we turn left to get to the a it joins the m further south around leeds right i know that part thats what well do and youd better not be lying tracy started to get up but jaff pulled her down beside him again dont be too hasty we wait till the next car turns up that way we know weve probably got three and a half hours before they call the alarm resignedly tracy lay on her stomach again they didnt have to wait long it was a beautiful afternoon just enough of a light breeze to take the edge off the heat you build up on a good long walk an old white van pulled up and a young man and woman got out they wore walking boots and had tucked their trouser legs into their socks they also carried sticks and rucksacks and the man had some maps in a plastic bag hanging around his neck perfect jaff said anoraks but how are you going to get it started what about the alarm an old banger like that piece of cake and it was they scrambled down the streambed jaff only falling and cursing once and approached the van there was no one around jaff got the back doors open easily with one of the keys he carried in his pocket and once inside it took him no time at all to hot wire the ignition the inside of the van smelled of paint thinner and sawdust i can see youve done this before tracy said jaff grinned you could say that put it down to a misspent youth i used to work for a bloke who collected luxury cars for shipment overseas know what i mean years ago i was just a kid fresh out of uni some of the newer models are really tough because of all those computerized keys and alarm systems but these things are a doddle and its perfect everyonell think its a builders van no one takes any notice of crappy white vans he drummed his hands on the steering wheel and whooped all right london here we come then they set off toward the a you look terrible alan said gervaise as they sipped tea in her office later that afternoon nothing that a good nights sleep wont cure banks said only somehow i dont think ill be getting one for a while im sorry about the cottage but im sure you understand we have no choice we can arrange for alternate accommodation if you like not a problem said banks its sorted i could use a car though mines in the garage at least i assume its still there its there said gervaise dont worry you can sign one out from the pool in the meantime how are you doing alan seriously i feel i should welcome you back but im afraid its not much of a welcome i feel about as bad as i look banks said youre right about the homecoming seeing annie there in the hospital i he shook his head and turned away as his eyes filled with tears then he took a deep breath felt his anger stir and sipped some tea but ive got to hold it together somehow it wont do anyone any good if i go to pieces its not your responsibility to hold everything together perhaps you should go and catch up on sleep i really dont think i could do that not with annie at deaths door and tracy out there with some homicidal creep could you perhaps not how was the holiday it was great really just what the doctor ordered im sure it did me the world of good a bit of a distant memory now though it was hard to believe that only yesterday he had woken up beside teresa in san francisco had breakfasted with her at the monaco and waved goodbye as she left for the airport in her taxi he had had time for one last walk around union square and a quick lunch at scalas bistro beside the sir francis drake hotel before packing checking out and heading for the airport himself it had been a beautiful fresh day the blue skies fluffy clouds and sweet gentle pacific breeze were no harbingers of what lay ahead i assume youre up to speed with whats been going on gervaise asked most of it this is a very delicate situation she went on making a steeple of her hands were understaffed and overworked and as you saw weve got superintendent chambers breathing down our necks oh i wouldnt worry too much about him but i do its very important that you dont go charging in like aa bull in a china shop gervaise smiled i was trying to think of something less crude than the usual cliché but thatll do for the moment yes softly softly catchee monkey good god give it a rest look you were out of the country when the shit hit the fan gervaise went on so you might think theres absolutely no reason why you shouldnt work on this but there are three reasons annie and tracy for starters yes youre emotionally involved and that should disqualify you from any active roll in these investigations you also know the doyles dont you yes our kids more or less grew up together pat was a good mate though i hadnt seen him in a while im gutted to hear what happened to him its a terrible business youre also very close to annie and we dont know how deeply tracys involved yet surely the main thing right now is that shes in danger and that we need to find her yes yes of course it is and were sparing nothing our budgets already gone to hell in a handbasket the local air search and rescue team is involved and theyre sending the helicopter out again as we speak but what im saying is that there might be some surprises ahead and i dont want you on a short fuse i also dont want you to give chambers or anybody else even the slightest impression that youve been in a position to tamper in any way tamper with what you know damn well what i mean fix things if it turns out your daughter is in this nasty business up to her eyeballs i appreciate your plain speaking on this but i dont think you know either me or my daughter as well as you think you do dont go all defensive on me alan i dont need that what do you expect you accuse my daughter of being a criminal and me of being corrupt enough to tamper with evidence just what the bloody hell do you expect me to say okay okay im sorry perhaps i went a bit too far put it down to pressure these last few days have got everyones nerves in a tizzy i was simply trying to stress that superintendent chambers is already dead set against you having any involvement at all in this im going out on a limb here i know damn well what youre like if i warned you off youd do it anyway and that could cause problems for everyone we can hardly lock you in a cell until its all over and if you go off on your own halfcocked god only knows how much damage you could end up doing now ive talked to acc mclaughlin hes talked to the deputy chief constable and we all agree that there are good reasons you should be brought in assuming you want to be but that you have to play down the personal angle you have to toe the line you cant let your personal feelings drive you objectivity alan thats what we want from you your brain not your brawn do you think you can manage that well all be keeping a sharp eye on you and you have to stay away from the taser business altogether you must be aware of the risk were taking in doing this superintendent chambers chambers can go back to his kennel and lick his balls as far as im concerned an interesting image but not one i care to dwell on look i know theres no love lost between the two of you but hes not without influence with the dcc or even the chief constable people like him never are alan im trying to help you here i know i know said banks and im grateful yes i want in yes ill keep my personal feelings under control ill behave myself ill stay away from the taser business and ill try not to throttle the toe rag thats got my daughter when i find him no i wont tamper with any evidence and ill try to keep out of chamberss way good enough itll have to be wont it shall we get down to business absolutely anything more on the gun yes naomi worthing from forensic science services rang me from leeds a short while ago she got the bullets that killed marlon kincaid from west yorkshire homicide and major enquiries sio was a detective superintendent quisling retired now lives in shipley better still our killer also left the spent casings at the scene so shes got them too that should provide an exact match of gun and cartridges used in the crime when she gets back to the lab prints nothing new no matches on ident and we checked them against erin doyles and her mothers no matches there either we need to check them against jaff mccreadys too said banks its in motion leeds police are getting a warrant to enter his flat in his absence theyll get prints from some of his personal effects ask them if they can find a photograph of him too the media theyre still frothing at the mouth over the taser incident and annies shooting christ alan its hard to believe i know but it only happened last night everythings moving so fast anyway that should distract them for a while but not for long theyre already watching us like hawks were keeping a lid on this manhunt as best we can certainly on the fact that a senior police officers daughter is involved i appreciate that but tracys not involved shes been abducted alan theres no concrete evidence of that yet just the broken mobile you cant tell me that tracy would willingly have anything to do with the shooting of annie cabbot or any shooting for that matter thats not what im saying and you know it im with you on this stop being so bloodyminded we have to play it carefully as i said were still keeping a lid on it but they have a way i know their ways it means we need to move even faster than they do we also need to talk to ian jenkinson and hang on hang on alan youre going too quickly for me already didnt winsome explain explain what she hasnt had a chance to explain anything yet banks told her about the marlon kincaid murder ian jenkinson and the connection with ciaran and darren who were now looking for jaff and tracy and who were connected with the farmer george fanthorpe gervaise whistled curiouser and curiouser okay she said in the light of what youve just told me youre right we do need to talk to ian jenkinson and to detective superintendent quisling ill send doug wilson and geraldine masterson what was erin doing with the gun banks asked i take it you do believe it belonged to mccready from the start and that she didnt come across it through some other means we dont have any concrete evidence of that and we havent charged her with anything yet shes on police bail but thats what we think annie thought so and winsome agrees were still digging into mccreadys background but were not sure why it was in erins possession well said banks id guess that he either gave it to her for safekeeping or she took it why would he need her to keep it safe for him maybe he was expecting trouble from the police banks suggested we can ask ken blackstone in leeds maybe he got nervous about having it around the flat in case he got caught doing something else he was planning and they searched the place and if she took it angry with him trying to make him mad get his attention there is some evidence that they were involved in a dispute at a leeds club the day before erin arrived home with the gun gervaise cleared her throat then said im sorry but theres also evidence your daughter was involved in that dispute too tracy said banks i hadnt heard about that how jealousy tracy and erin were fighting over mccready sounds that way banks put his head in his hands suddenly he felt more weary than he had ever imagined he could i thought she had more sense im sorry said gervaise not your problem well it is actually what do you think happened from what ive been able to piece together i think erin and mccready ended up back at his flat after the fracas at the club maybe they made up but somehow or other they got to fighting again maybe the next morning and tracy at this point home in her own bed we think mccready was in amsterdam and london over the weekend its likely he left on friday morning and if erin was alone in his flat for a while she could easily have taken the gun out of spite and decided to go home for a few days to chill out as they say that would explain why mccready didnt go looking for her that weekend yes he didnt know she had it gervaise agreed he wasnt home and it probably wasnt something he checked on every day anyway why did tracy go to mccreadys flat in the first place we think she dashed over to warn mccready that the police might soon become interested in him why would she do that your guess is as good as mine better perhaps why do you think the question assumes that tracy knew he was dodgy if she felt she needed to warn him maybe she did how were pretty sure that mccready supplied a good deal of e to the club scene in leeds maybe other things too are you suggesting that tracy takes drugs who knows maybe she does who knows what kids get up to alan but my point is only that maybe she knew somehow that mccready was involved in drugs and she liked him enough to want to warn him young people have different priorities then she took off with him it appears that way i suppose it seemed like a bit of an adventure nobody had been killed or shot at that point remembera least the news of patrick doyles death hadnt been announced before the time they would have left mccreadys flat and his death was a taserrelated accident anyway i suppose if hed chucked erin and taken up with tracy that might explain some of it banks mused would tracy have known about the gun how much had been on the news by then we hadnt given the media any information by then but the tv cameras on the evening local news showed the afo walking out with a gunshaped object wrapped in a tea cloth it wouldnt have taken a lot of imagination to figure out what had happened if they were watching so mccready would immediately check on his gun and find it was gone yes but he might not have told tracy what the problem was we just dont know i can tell you one thing for certain banks said tracy might have gone with mccready willingly at the start but shes not with him of her own free will now not after what happened to annie tracy may make mistakes maybe she even takes drugs and has rotten taste in men but shes a decent girl at heart i ought to know im not here to argue with you alan as a matter of fact i agree that shes in serious trouble and probably in danger too i dont say that to alarm you and i wouldnt mention it if i thought you didnt know it already we need to find them and bring this to a peaceful conclusion as soon as possible hows the search going we need more men theres a lot of countryside out there where said banks well youd know better than i would but we doubt they took the road to eastvale from your cottage because theyd have been seen the patrol cars sent in response to the call kept their eyes open that leaves the moorland to the south and the wild areas to the north and west weve had the helicopter out but they spotted nothing well be doing more aerial sweeps as the day goes on weve got men on foot patrol cars the lot but as i said theres a lot of ground to cover and they could have gone in almost any direction is there anything more you can tell me about erin doyle had you seen much of her lately not a lot said banks you dont when they grow up do you im afraid ive been a bit neglectful of even my own daughter too obviously its been a hard summer personal problems so would it surprise you to hear that erin had a reputation for running a bit wild no more so than any other attractive girl her age i shouldnt think but no i wasnt aware she had that reputation liked bad boys thats hardly unusual it explains mccready youre assuming she knew how bad he was if she took the gun and knew he dealt drugs she had to have some inkling are you suggesting that whatever he was into erin was involved its a possibility we need to consider she was hardly an innocent bystander tracy too im not saying that if tracy does have any sort of relationship with mccready its a very recent one maybe they just fancied each other and he was tired of erin doyle but hes shown his true colors now she cant be too happy about it she must know shes made a very bad error in judgment im sure she does said banks whats going to happen to erin no idea shes still not talking i remember when she was a little kid banks said erin she used to wear pigtails and she had freckles across her nose and on her arms cute i took her and tracy to blackpool illuminations once they loved it though i think it was more the staying up late after dark than the illuminations themselves they both fell asleep in the car on the way home brian too banks shook his head to clear the memory sorry he went on youre right its a bit close to home when juliet doyle came to report the gun she asked for you so chambers said made quite a big deal of it in fact but it makes sense to me she knows me turning in her own daughter must have been a terrible decision for her do you reckon she thought youd go easy on erin probably said banks but id like to think i could have defused the situation without anyone getting killed maybe you could have but you werent here and hindsights no use to us now the phone rang gervaise answered it listened for a moment then thanked the caller and hung up that was winsome she said weve just had a bit of a break we found the car or a car up behind your cottage on the moors road banks gripped the arms of his chair abandoned hidden in the woods behind a wall local birdwatcher found it remembered the news about the shooting and reported it preliminary examination indicates the gears were stripped so theyre out on the moors on foot they cant have got far dont get too excited we cant be sure its their car yet though there is confirmation of sorts what the last entry in annies notebook it was the cars number plate she must have made a note of it when she dropped by my cottage seeing a strange car there would have struck her as odd under any circumstances maybe but thats all there was a car number no time place or date she could have seen it anytime that day or even before this wasnt her official notebook you understand but stillits a bit too much of a coincidence isnt it yes weve got men out on foot and in patrol cars looking as well as the search and rescue team now we can narrow our search concentrate on the moors but its pretty wild up there as you know it looks as if they may have spent the night in a ruined barn about three miles from the cottage what do you think banks asked i think a city boy like mccready will be feeling too exposed up there twelve miles of bad roads or no roads at all for the most part hell want to find the nearest large village or small town and probably steal a car head for the city risky everythings a risk since he shot annie and the stakes are high i know said banks the nearest village is baldersghyll its not very big though the local station theres been alerted theres more the cars registered to a victor mallory lives in horsforth leeds stolen gervaise shook her head i dont think so maybe but according to winsome victor mallory comes up on west yorkshires radar as one of mccreadys suspicious cronies any connection with the farmer or with ciaran and darren not that we know of so jaff borrowed the car from this mallory looks that way its the best lead weve got so far anyone talked to him yet the leeds police are keeping an eye on his house for us i thought perhaps it would be a good place for you to start and while youre down there you could have a word with the farmer too but tread softly i promise said banks and thanks i mean for letting me in on this i wont let you down better not said gervaise or youll be the one in the kennel licking your balls theyll hurt so much on his way back to the office banks bumped into the female afo officer he had met in the hospital she looked as if she had been lurking in the corridor any news she asked as he opened his office door come in banks said and she followed him sit down pc newell isnt it nerys sat powell sir right said banks i remember now you must excuse me im a bit jetlagged usually i have a much better memory for names and faces thats all right sir i wouldnt expect you to remember me i was just worried about annieabout di cabbot thats all i wanted to ask if you have any news no good news im afraid its just a matter of waiting the doctor said theyll know more if she makes it through the first twentyfour hours you mean theres a chance she might not theres always a chance nerys bit her lip im sorry to hear that she said i know that you and her wereyou know i know she means a lot to you it was a long time ago said banks yes sir but im sure she still means a lot to you you couldnt just forget someone like her could you if i might ask banks went on why all the concern on your part i mean other than that for a fellow officer wounded in the line of duty nerys turned away and began to fidget like i said at the hospital sir i feel a bit responsible we were working together and we talked she gave me some advice thats all responsible how could you be i dont mean its logical sir its justyou knowthe callthe taser youre the officer who no sir it wasnt me that was warby pc warburton but i was with him im his partner hes a mate right i see and just how does that make you responsible for what happened to annie it doesnt not directly sir i just feel partly to blame if things had gone differently banks leaned back in his chair look pc powell he said if we all adopted that attitude wed never get anywhere if if if i could just as well blame myself for not being here when juliet doyle came to see me if i had been things would have been different again wouldnt they and my daughter probably wouldnt be god knows where in the grip of some psycho or annie lying in a hospital bed close to deaths door he thought you were only doing your job he said dont start assuming the burden of guilt second guessing theres no future in that yes sir i mean im not complaining everyones been very good theres lots of support lots of choices its nowhere near as bad as i thought it would be banks smiled he knew she meant chambers who liked to pride himself on the fact that his name and reputation went before him and sent a chill up everyones spine put the fear of god in them hang in there id like to help help what the investigation di cabbots shooting the hold on a minute said banks arent you under suspension no sir they offered me a spot of gardening leave but i dont want it i dont think we did anything wrong and i want to keep working theres no requirement says i have to take leave or should be suspended its just that nobody quite knows what to do with me where to reassign me and i like to think di cabbot is a friend i understand your position believe me said banks and i appreciate it but its not going to happen why not for a start youre a pc and an afo youre not cid or major crimes its not as if dc would be a promotion i know that but those transfers take time paperwork official approval and we dont have time there must be something i can do other things than just shoot guns temporary assignment surely theres some way i could help she seemed so crestfallen and forlorn that banks felt sorry for her but there was nothing he could do he knew he was already in a precarious position himself and if he encouraged young pc powell in her ambitions he could get them both dismissed im sorry he said theres no place for you here right now besides i dont have any power in the matter its not my case but you could put in a good word for me it wouldnt be any use im a trained firearms officer im good at what i do im sure you are said banks suppressing a smile but thats another problem right there what is that youre a firearms officer and that you were one of the firearms officers who entered the doyle house whether you agree with it or not you and your partner are under investigation also we dont need an authorised firearms officer on this case with all due respect sir this man youre after is armed and dangerous im aware of that there are rumors what rumors just stories going around that your daughter is somehow involved that makes you emotionally involved in the case so the word was out banks wasnt particularly surprised in many ways a police station was just like any other workplace rumors and gossip abounded i wouldnt believe everything you hear he said stiffly i dont sir but ive heard that this jaff mccready is a nasty piece of work if it was his gun at the doyle house and if he was the one who shot di im sorry pc powell nerys im really sorry but were ending this conversation right now i cant give you what you want i promise ill do my best to keep you informed about di cabbots progress but thats all do you understand nerys got to her feet and dragged them toward the door yes sir she said if you change your mind at all i wont said banks and he stared thoughtfully at the closed door for almost a minute after she had left youre using the throwaway mobile right course boss okay go on the farmer was walking his favorite path in his garden it was a warm evening but still he wore one of the chunky cableknit jumpers he loved so much the neatly trimmed hedges of topiary and crinkling sound the cinders made underfoot always calmed him down not that he needed it he was confident that ciaran and darren would do their jobs and the jaff problem would be dealt with quickly the only angle that caused him any worry at all was bankss daughter he remembered bankss tenacity and realized hed had a lucky escape last time they had crossed paths it wouldnt be so easy this time especially if anything happened to the girl jaff could be a mad bastardthe farmer had seen him at workand if the girl became a liability her chances werent very good banks would certainly connect him to jaff in time and had probably already connected him with ciaran and darren they never usually left a trail of bodies behind them which was usually a good thing but it also meant that the girl they had talked to rose would probably be able to identify them and that would be enough for banks he was a tricky copper and he wouldnt give up this time the farmer had to weigh what the girl might know against the possible comeback on getting rid of her along with mccready before he came to his decision if banks got his daughter back alive and if he knew that the farmer had a hand in it then a senior coppers gratitude might not be a bad thing to have in the long run we got a name said darren bloke by the name of justin lives in highgate thats not much to go on is it said fanthorpe hes bent involved in peoplesmuggling and dodgy passports an old mate of jaffs well well said fanthorpe you need a bit of intelligence for fake documents and people trafficking dont you knowing jaff that probably means hes a mate from public school or university isnt that where you meet most of your dodgy friends wouldnt know said darren never went to either never went to the comprehensive much either come to think of it it was a rhetorical question shit for brains whats that youd know if youd been to school wouldnt you what do you want us to do now boss quiet im thinking fanthorpe reached the fountain where the four cinder paths met and stood for a few moments watching the barebreasted mermaids around the edge spout water from their oshaped mouths and the little boy pissing at the center zenovias idea if this justins bent he went on and if hes involved in peopletrafficking the odds are that he traffics in other things too stands to reason doesnt it i mean i do if youve got the routes secured and the right people paid off you use them am i right you are boss either way gavin nebthorpe will know he knows everyone in the business justin in highgate you say leave it with me lads i want you two to head down to london fast as you can set off now and youll probably be there before dark where in london its a big place i know its a big place darren thats why its the capital of the united kingdom thats why the houses of parliament are there big ben buckingham palace thats why the queen of fucking england lives there i know its a big place well where then youll hear from me before you get there keep the throwaway turned on if for any reason you dont hear from me before you arrive get yourselves a hotel something inconspicuous and anonymous out of the way youd stick out like spare pricks at a wedding in the dorchester you might be doing a bit of wet work down there know what i mean yes boss were on our way fanthorpe ended the call and stood by the fountain a frown creasing his brow then he keyed in another phone number as he waited for an answer he looked at the fountain again little boy pissing indeed silly cow before heading down to leeds to talk to victor mallory banks wanted to see if he could get anything out of erin doyle he also wanted to see how erin was bearing up under the strain of all that had happened over the last few days shed done a stupid thing certainly but hed watched her grow up she was a close friend of his daughters she and tracy had skipped and played hopscotch and whipntop in the street what erin had done neednt ruin her whole life he wasnt going to write her off and abandon her to the likes of chambers if he could help it he wanted to talk to juliet too but she would have to wait he wasnt a family liaison officer or a guidance counselor finding tracy was his priority right now and he doubted that juliet could help with that erin and victor mallory just might banks strode across the cobbled market square and started to climb the hill that wound up to the norman castle overlooking the river swain it was a fine day for a walk and the fresh air and exercise helped clear his foggy mind on his way he passed the burgundy facade of the café de provence where he had enjoyed his first date with sophia it seemed so long ago now but it had only been last march so much had happened in a mere six months now this thrown straight back to work in the thick of a crisis the only thing to do was to carry on he turned off castle hill onto lamplighters wynde just past the café and looked for number seven it was a narrow cobbled street which wound back down to york road in a steep curve not even wide enough for cars and the limestone terrace houses there were among the oldest in eastvale dating back in their foundations to norman times when the castle was built in later years they had been wealthy local merchants houses and now they were a tourist attraction and a source of accommodation like many houses on the street the one where erin was staying had originally consisted of two separate dwellings which had been knocked into one the doorway was low enough that banks had to be careful walking through it but inside he found a greater sense of space and far more light than he had expected the landlady inspected his warrant card and pointed upstairs to where erin was staying room she called after banks as he walked toward the stairs she hasnt been out once poor thing she said and she wont eat she just stays up there in her room fretting all day long where is ms yu banks asked thinking he should talk to the family liaison officer before he talked to erin shes out the landlady lowered her voice i think shes visiting the poor girls mother banks made sympathetic noises and carried on up the narrow creaking flight of stairs the landing wasnt quite flat as in so many of these old houses one of the floorboards wobbled and the walls were out of true miniature watercolors of local landscapes hung on the flockpatterned walls and banks recognized hindswell woods lyndgarth village green eastvale castle at sunset and the little stone bridge in his own tiny village of gratly he knocked on the door heard nothing then knocked again erin he called erin its alan alan banks can i come in nothing happened for a few moments then the door swung slowly open as if of its own accord on squeaky hinges erin who must have got up to open it had gone back to sitting on the window seat staring out at the view her head turned banks shut the door behind him and sat on the only chair by the small writing desk the room was stuffy the window shut tight at first he didnt speak leaving an opening for erin to have the first word but she kept her gaze averted and her mouth closed erin he said finally im so sorry about your dad he was a good mate at first erin said nothing but banks thought he noticed her head move slightly then in a small voice she said it was my fault you know it was all my fault i dont think you werent here you dont know the sudden fury of her reaction stunned banks you werent here she said again quieter this time as she stood up to face him her face streaked with tears hands curled into tight fists im so sorry her body relaxed and her shoulders slumped she gave him a sad glance oh im not blaming you thats not what i mean how could you know but i was there i was the one whoi there seemed only one thing to do banks got up moved forward and took erin in his arms at first she stiffened and resisted then she went limp and threw her arms around him holding on for dear life and started to sob convulsively when she managed to take control of herself she broke away embarrassed and took a tissue from the box on the bedside table to wipe her face look at me she said then she turned to face banks again i must be a sight i am glad to see you really its been awful nobodys been to see me except patricia shes nice but its not the same nobody understands ive got nobody to talk to what about your mother erin started to bite her thumbnail banks noticed that all her fingernails were chewed into ugly half moons raw and bloody around the edges erin i know you must be angry with her for what she did but she is your mother she reported me to the police the anger was gone replaced by disbelief and pain how could she do that how could my own mother do that when she knew id go to jail she looked directly at banks her bluegray eyes disconcerting would you do that if it was tracy i dont know what id do banks said the law against handguns is there for a good reason but shes my mother she was concerned banks said she didnt know what to do and she wasnt thinking about the consequences she certainly didnt intend you to go to jail how do you know because she asked for me she didnt know how to cope with finding a gun in your room she was scared so she came to me but youre a policeman what did she expect you to do im also a friend of the family what do you think i would have done i suppose youd have followed the rules i might have been able to help her to help you too have you talked to her i havent had a chance yet i will but you have to promise me youll try to forgive her i must at least have something positive to tell her something to give her hope think how she must be feeling her daughter hates her her husbands dead you cant expect her to make all the moves youve got to try to meet her halfway she moved quickly enough to turn me in she was scared confused have you never felt that way i dont know i dont know anything anymore erin turned away and rubbed the tears from her eyes look said banks youve been cooped up here for ages do you fancy a walk a bit of fresh air maybe get a bite to eat a drink erin nodded a walk would be good she said just let me wash my face first i must look a mess banks gazed out of the window as erin went over to the washstand and bent over the houses opposite were almost close enough to touch and just beyond their flagstone roofs he could see the jagged top of the castle keep every once in a while a cloud would obscure the sun casting a shadow over the scene erin tied her hair back in a ponytail grabbed a light jacket and put it on over her tshirt she was wearing jeans torn at the knees and a battered pair of trainers banks guessed that most of her good clothes were either back at laburnum avenue or in leeds she hadnt been taking care of herself that much was obvious she had purpleblack bags under her eyes from lack of sleep her eyes were dull and her complexion pasty she also seemed listless and tired no doubt from shock and lack of food they left the bandb and walked back up to castle road just a few yards farther ahead a flagged pathway led up to the castle itself and another branched off along the crest of the hill circling the castles outer walls and looking out over the woods down the hill to the river there were plenty of tourists enjoying a day out and couples and families were picnicking far below on the grassy riverbanks by the terraced falls birds twittered in the trees some of the leaves were already turning at the edges banks remembered his first months in eastvale also around this time of year how he had walked here many times with sandra brian and tracy slowly getting used to their new home watching the leaves change color day by day until at last they broke free and drifted down into the river neither banks nor erin talked at first erin kept her head down and her hands in her pockets she seemed a slight and vulnerable figure to banks far more frail than he had expected even given the circumstances more like a little girl again but then he reminded himself of the problems she had to facenot only her fathers death and her mothers blame but the gun charges the unfaithful boyfriend her best friends treachery it would be more than enough for anyone at the end of the path a chip van stood outside the car park and banks asked erin if she would like a burger or a hot dog she chose the hot dog and he got one for himself too piling on the fried onions and hot chili sauce along with a couple of cans of cold coke queuing at the van reminded him of buying ice cream for erin and tracy when they were kids they found an empty bench below the castle walls and sat down to eat looking out over the treetops the foliage almost obscured the east side estate and the railway lines beyond but not quite even so it was an idyllic scene and from that height far in the distance on a clear day like this he could see the long anvil of sutton bank rising across the vale of york banks pulled the tab on his tin and the coke foamed and fizzed over his hand he laughed erin offered him a tissue from her pocket and he wiped it off the tin had felt cold but the coke was too warm still the sugar hit was so good it made him feel a bit giddy at first tourists wandered by and a few curious dogs attracted by the smells sniffed and strained at their leads food finished banks collected the rubbish and dropped it in the bin beside the bench ive got to ask you a few questions he said sitting beside erin again and crossing his legs she gave him a sly sideways smile i should have known there was a price to pay for that hot dog the hot dogs free talkings optional erin sat silent a moment lips pursed looking out over the panorama her eyes squinting shut against the sun finally she leaned forward and rested her elbows on her knees propping up her head why not its a nice place for it i was just thinking do you remember that time we went swimming in the river in the shallows over there by the woods she pointed in the general direction of hindswell woods to the west there was me tracy brian mum mrs banks and you and dad keeping an eye on us we had a picnic too pottedmeat sandwiches and dandelion and burdock and blue riband chocolate biscuits they tasted so good yes said banks but im amazed you remember you cant have been more than six or seven he remembered the day well he and patrick doyle were just getting to know each other then typically enough through their children patrick had said he was happy to have a police detective living in the street now hed know where to go if he ever got a parking ticket or had a problem with the law they had all walked through magical woods dappled with sunlight filtered between fluttering leaves and at that riverside picnic sandra had chilled a bottle of white wine in the water and they had sipped it from colored plastic cups with chunks of old cheddar and soft brie on baguettes the spot was also close to where some schoolchildren had found a man hanging earlier in the summer and that had marked the start of the case that had almost finished banks but it was behind him now along with the rest of that troubled time do you remember blackpool illuminations vaguely said erin its not quite as clear i think i fell asleep in the car brian was with us then too wasnt he yes erin shook her head sadly she wont even mention his name anymore i talk about the blue lamps she doesnt want to know who why tracy i mean if i had a rock star like brian for a brother id be telling like everyone i do anyway tell them i grew up with him the blue lamps are so cool do you know she likes to call herself francesca now because she thinks tracys too corrie no i didnt know that said banks and somehow knowing it hurt him to the quick her name the name he and sandra had given her why wont she mention brian he asked shes jealous id say but she wont admit it because hes successful and sheswell lets face it she didnt do very well in her exams did she i mean she knew how much was expected of her and she feels shes let everyone down especially herself ever since then shes been on hold sort of dithering she likes working at the bookshop well enough but she doesnt see it as a career or as what she thought shed be doing by now but she can still take her academic career further if she wants she mentioned teaching once surely she could still do that sure if she had the will but shes changed theres a lot of negative stuff there anger low selfesteem i dont know i just cant seem to talk to her these days i mean you know beforeanyway what do you want to know its hard to know where to begin said banks still trying to digest what he had just heard about tracy he had failed her he should have paid more attention to her when she needed it spent more time with her instead of getting bogged down in his own personal and professional problems and feeling sorry for himself im not sure myself yet he went on i just arrived back from my holidays this morning and im still jetlagged youll have to help me a bit where did you go america arizona nevada and california mostly la san francisco yes wicked ive always wanted to go there banks smiled me too and it really is wicked erin paused a moment then began my father you dont have to talk about him said banks quickly thats not my case i mean im not saying that im not interested or i dont care but because armed police officers were involved we have to have a special investigation and im not allowed to interfere do you understand i understand that makes sense but you shouldnt blame yourself nobody could have foreseen that combination of circumstances yes i know ive been trying to convince myself its just that whenever i think about it i cant help but feel that upsurge of guilt it just floods through me like a dams burst and i dont have the strength to hold it back thats probably a good thing said banks my psychologist friend always told me it wasnt a good idea to hold things back but you have to sometimes dont you anger hatred disapproval otherwise wed all be at each others throats half the time what about love said banks should we hold that back too sometimes she said it might not be a bad thing in some circumstances when you think about it love probably causes more trouble than hate she sounded far too wise for one so young thought banks who had been patiently waiting for years now for the wisdom that was supposed to come with age to no avail it seemed anyway he said no matter how bad things seem now your mothers going to need you before long do you think you can cope dunno said erin waving away a troublesome wasp not much i can do from jail is there why did you take the gun erin i trust you did take it from your boyfriend jaffar mccready and that you hadnt already got it from somewhere else jaff erin said he goes by jaff i was pissed off at him i knew he had ithed shown it off to me onceand i thought if i took it hed be angry you know like it was his favorite toy or something i wanted to hurt him i wanted to make him notice me want me back now banks thought she didnt sound so wise but its not a toy not like an ipod or a mobile or something didnt you think he might be so angry he wouldnt want anything to do with you again or that maybe hed hurt you no i dont suppose i was thinking all that clearly i just took it and went back to the house and picked up some clothes and went home i was going to give it back to him okay said banks do you know why he had it in the first place not really just for show i think i dont think hed ever actually used it or anything he just liked to play at being a tough guy thats all i mean he did hang around with some pretty shifty characters and i dont know how he had made so much money but i dont think it was from working nine to five did you meet any of these shifty characters sometimes banks took copies of roses sketches of ciaran and darren from his briefcase did you ever see either of these two for example they came to the flat once jaff told me to stay in the bedroom but the door was open a crack i saw them and heard them they were arguing how long ago was this couple of months something like that what were they arguing about i dont know money some delivery or other i think maybe jaff did a bit of dealing nothing serious but he knew everyone on the scene the club scene yeah and the student scene is that how you met no it was after uni i was working at one of those posh restaurants in the calls and he used to eat there regularly alone sometimes ever with the two in the drawings no if he did have company it was usually some expensive suit not thugs like that she smiled im not sure theyd even get past the door the place i worked business it seemed that way and he did come in by himself sometimes he didnt like to cook or even to eat at home by himself we got to chatting you know one thing led to another he seemed fun smart cocky ambitious wed go to clubs sometimes after the restaurant closed like i said everybody knew him mr big around there mr flash always carried a thick roll of twenties it felt good to be seen out with him never boring but it was hard to keep up with him sometimes he always seemed to have something else going on you know somewhere else to be or someone else to be with she shrugged now i know who it was tracy banks said yes or someone else i doubt that she was the first sometimes he was gone for days without explanation not that he owed me one oh dont think i blame tracy i was mad yes who wouldnt be she kissed him she stole my boyfriend its not as if shes such an angel anyway its not as if she hasnt been sui more than once sui erin glanced at him sideways shagged under the influence does that shock you it didnt so much shock banks as hurt him to think something like that about his own daughter to imagine the things that had happened to her when she was too far gone to be in control made him feel sorry for her protective erin was basically talking about date rape his own daughter it made him angry why the hell couldnt she have come to him with her problems was he that distant and uncaring do you mean drugged and raped he asked not the way you imagine it i mean im not saying youre always up for it when youre so off your face but its no big deal its just a shag sui anyway erin went on picking at a hangnail like i said if it hadnt been tracy it would have been someone else i know that jaff was just but its tracy hes got with him now banks said what do you mean it hasnt hit the front pages yet but hes on the run armed and tracys with him we think he shot a policewoman annie cabbot maybe you know her i remember her yes you were close at one time after mrs banks left werent you but jaff i cant believe it we need to find them annie could die and tracys in danger but jaff wouldnt hurt her have you ever seen him be violent well no i mean yes but onlyyou know someone who tried to rip him off or put him down because of his color call him a paki or something he really hated that so he can be violent he has a quick temper but he never hurt me i cant imagine him harming a woman not tracy we found a car up on the moors it belongs to someone called victor mallory have you ever heard that name vic yes of course hes jaffs best friend they went to public school together then cambridge vics what well hes like a sort of oldfashioned hippie really with his long hair and stuff but hes weird too and a bit scary sometimes hes very clever he studied chemistry but i think drugs have fried his brain like hes always looking for new chemical compounds and hell try everything himself first hes definitely blown a few connections did he have a gun i dont know if he had one but he and jaff used to talk about them sometimes you know like computer nerds or techies as if they knew what they were talking about maybe they did said banks did jaff ever say anything about that gun you took if it was ever used anything at all no i dont think so i dont remember anything i dont suppose i really know him at all do i when it comes down to it probably not how long have you known him six months look i know ive been a fool but im not stupid and im not a bad person i want to help i want to make things right i know erin right now things are difficult and my priority is finding tracy and making sure shes safe can you understand that of course but how can i help i need to get some idea of what jaff might do in a situation like this where he might go how intelligent is he oh hes very bright he went to cambridge so i understand that didnt mean very much banks thought certainly not when it came to drug dealing and evading the law on the other hand some cambridge graduates had quite a good reputation in both those areas where would he go do you think does he have anyone he might turn to anyone who might help him i dont know said erin but hed probably go to london i mean thats where he comes from and hes got friends down there hes a city boy anyone in particular im trying to remember he took me with him for a weekend once but we stayed in a nice hotel in mayfair not with any of his friends he knows hes in a lot of trouble banks went on its my guess that he would probably want to leave the country as soon as possible maybe even try to head back to mumbai if he still has contacts there but if hes at all bright as you say he is he knows well be keeping an eye on the ports stations and airports theres justin erin said justin yes in london another old pal from his uni days we had dinner with him while we were there one of those fancy places where you get one little plate after another justin was there with his girlfriend she was slovakian or something like that beautiful very exotic she didnt speak much english i remember looked like a model or an actress do you remember anything about justin just something jaff said i think he was showing off and he said something to me about justin being the man to know if you needed a new passport justin didnt like it i remember he gave jaff a nasty look but i thought maybe he was involved in forging stuff and maybe smuggling people into the country that sounds like the sort of person jaff might want to contact right now banks said do you know where he lives no we didnt go back to his place we went on to a couple of clubs in the west end i dont remember where im afraid i was a bit drunk by then did you get his surname no we just used first names what was his girlfriend called martina did this justin have any sort of accent too how was his english his english was excellent sort of posh like jaffs he did have a slight accent though but you really had to listen what accent i dont know im not good at that sort of thing eastern european same as his girlfriend maybe erin shrugged i dont know and youve no idea where they live i do remember we were talking about property values once back in the restaurant jaff was thinking about buying a flat in london and he was asking this justin about it he said something about highgate but thats all i remember i got the impression that was where he lived but its big isnt it highgate big enough said banks but he felt a rush of excitement there was every chance that if this justin was involved in peoplesmuggling and dodgy documents one or other of the mets intelligence units would have a watching brief on him and even pinpointing him as living in highgate might help them narrow their search banks hardly had any points with the intelligence services but he knew that dirty dick burgess would help him out at a pinch especially if tracy was in danger did jaff ever talk much about his family his background banks asked im just trying to get a better sense of who im dealing with not a lot jaffs a mummys boy really and i dont mean that in a bad way hes not a nancy boy or a sissy or anything but i think he really loved his mother and his father was more distant tougher less involved with him emotionally when he was growing up jaff didnt talk about his family or his background much when we were together except sometimes if the mood came on him you know the right combination of booze and e or whatever then he tended to ramble and you had to sort of piece it together i could be wrong anyway he wasnt too happy about ending up back with his dad after his mother died and when he went off to boarding school and then university that was his opportunity to make the break to grab for his independence hes got a photo of his mother in the flat you should see it she was beautiful there are none of his dad thank you banks said youve been a great help erin shrugged whats going to happen to me now i dont mean to be selfish or anything but i couldnt stand going to jail nothings going to happen not for a while whens your court date next month get a good solicitor banks said its true that the law comes down hard on possession of firearms but youve got a better chance than most you havent been in trouble before youre from a good family you have character witnesses it could be worse hard to imagine said erin but thanks that helps ill help you as best i can if you dont know a solicitor i can recommend one and if this business with jaff and tracy comes to a satisfactory conclusion and no one gets hurt that could go in your favor too youve helped us a lot erin nodded they both stood up what are you going to do now banks asked i think im going to go to the swainsdale centre and buy some new clothes and makeup i cant believe youd allow yourself to be seen with me looking like this banks laughed it is all right isnt it she asked what to go to the swainsdale centre you know i dont have to go straight back to the bandb and report in do i youre not going to put an electronic tag on my ankle are you of course not said banks youre on police bail you report when youre told to and youll be fine i wouldnt advise leaving town though believe me there will be more questions a lot more but you can go anywhere you want in eastvale except home said erin except home banks leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes as the car slowed to a crawl at the roadworks on the a just north of wetherby winsome had offered to drive him to leeds normally he would have preferred to go alone and drive himself but this time he had accepted her offer he didnt trust himself behind the wheel he was too wired and too anxious they hadnt spoken much on the way down but he was glad of her company and that she had tuned the radio to radio vaughan williamss variation on a theme by thomas tallis was playing at the moment banks had never felt so weary lights danced behind his eyelids he felt as if he could see the electrical pulses jumping around in his brain projected there flashing arcing shortcircuiting there was simply too much to take in too much to comprehend and it was getting more and more difficult for him to focus every moment spent tracking down nuggets of valuable information meant more time in fear and danger for tracy but it had to be this way the real problems might only begin once they had located jaff and tracy and he needed to go into that situation with as much information as he could get it was his only weapon his only armor after all jaff had a gun and a hostage it was the tail end of rush hour and the traffic on the leeds ringroad slowed them down luckily they didnt have far to go victor mallorys house turned out to be between west park and moortown golf club it was seven oclock when winsome pulled up outside the rambling detached house with its cream stucco facade large garden gables and mullioned bay windows not bad said winsome not bad at all for a thirty something maybe were in the wrong business banks suggested or maybe his business is wrong more like it banks agreed if hes a mate of mccreadys theres a lot you can do with a cambridge degree in chemistry and it doesnt all involve teaching or working for pharmaceutical companies but thats for the locals to worry about banks gestured to the silver skoda parked down the street theyve been keeping a discreet eye on him hard to appear inconspicuous in a skoda in a neighborhood like this said winsome they got out and walked over to the parked car the window was open and banks caught a whiff of fresh cigarette smoke it wasnt a pleasant sensation the way it used to be anything he asked flashing his warrant card as discreetly as possible nor a sausage replied the driver waste of bloody time if you ask me anyone come or go no he in there no idea right you can get off to the pub now we go when our guv says to go banks rolled his eyes and looked at winsome who shrugged suit yourself he said anyone would think they enjoyed sitting there doing nothing said winsome as they walked toward the house dont assume everyone shares your work ethic winsome besides theyre sitting on their brains so maybe that cramps their thinking style i suppose we got what we asked for thougha watching brief i mean we didnt ask for politeness or intelligence did we winsome laughed ill make a note of it next time maybe a better model of car too they walked up victor mallorys flagstone path and rang the doorbell no sound came from inside curtains are closed maybe theyve been watching an empty house wouldnt surprise me said banks he pressed the doorbell again still nothing happened but he thought he heard a stifled groan or a muffled call from somewhere inside the house he glanced at winsome who frowned and nodded to indicate that she had heard it too the door seemed formidable but when banks turned the handle and pushed it opened he checked the lock which was a dead bolt and saw that it hadnt been secured there was also a strong chain and an alarm system too but the latter wasnt activated with the door closed behind them there was only enough light in the hallway to make out the dim shape of a chair and the outline of a broad staircase leading upstairs bankss eyes adjusted and he saw three doors leading off the hall when he heard the sound again he realized it was coming from the first door on his left the front room the heavy door was already ajar and when he pushed it opened slowly the room was even darker than the hall so he walked over and opened the thick velour curtains early evening light flooded in and illuminated the floortoceiling bookcases against one wall framed contemporary prints and an expensive bang olufsen stereo system on another and the figure lying on the floor at the center of the room gagged and bound to a hardbacked chair victor mallory i presume said banks all he got by way of a reply was muffled growling and cursing winsome he said could you see if you can find some scissors or a sharp kitchen knife winsome headed back out into the hall banks heard doors opening and closing and moments later she came back with a pair of scissors excellent banks said he bent over mallory he smelled the sharp animal stink of urine and noticed a wet patch down the front of the mans trousers first of all victor he said its important that you know were police officers and were not going to hurt you so when i cut you free and take off that gag you dont start screaming and try to make a run for it got that mallory nodded and made more grumbling sounds youd never make it anyway banks went on winsome here is our star rugby player flying tackles and dropkicks are her specialty banks heard winsome mutter something under her breath i didnt catch that he said nothing said winsome with a sigh banks then showed mallory his warrant card and began to cut him free he left the gag until last loosening one of the edges and then ripping it fast mallory screamed and put his hands to his mouth if the police outside heard him they certainly didnt come rushing in to put an end to the police brutality youve ripped my lips off mallory moaned there was a small amount of blood on the carpet where he had been lying and a patch of his hair on the left side was matted dont be a baby said banks you okay otherwise do you need an ambulance a doctor no no i dont need an ambulance or a doctor ii just banged my head when the chair tipped over i dont think i have concussion i didnt lose consciousness or anything mallory rubbed his wrists and ankles i could do with some water though winsome went and brought him a pint glass filled to the brim some of it dribbled down mallorys front as he slurped it greedily but he didnt seem to mind banks gave him a while to get his circulation flowing again and to compose himself mallory avoided winsomes eye er look here he said to banks when he had finished the water ieri had a small accidentdo you think i might possibly have a quick shower and change before we talk he spoke with an educated accent public school a little too posh and plummy for bankss liking we dont have time for that banks said but i look why dont we compromise you can dry yourself down and have a quick change but ill have to stay with you best i can offer okay itll have to do wont it ill make some tea while youre gone winsome volunteered excellent said banks youre lucky he said to mallory she doesnt usually do tea he followed mallory into the hall and up the stairs nice house youve got here thanks how much did you pay for it too much no come on quarter half a mill four hundred k a bargain at the time banks whistled he followed mallory into a nondescript white bedroom with an en suite bathroom and walkin cupboards and waited while he undressed and threw his clothes in a laundry basket then rubbed himself down with a green fluffy towel which joined his clothes and pulled on a navy blue tracksuit when mallory was ready banks gestured for him to head back downstairs winsome was waiting on the sofa a pot of tea milk sugar and three mugs on the table in front of her ill play mother then shall i she said pouring victor banks said settling down opposite mallory who sat in the winged armchair by the fireplace tell us what happened two men came victor said theythey trussed me up the way you saw with sticky tape then they just left me i could have starved or choked to death if you hadnt come well cheerfully accept the praise for saving your life banks said but id say youre exaggerating just a wee bit how long have you been like that i dont know i lost track of time they came just after lunch maybe five or six hours then said banks with a glance at winsome who had started to take notes something like that i tried to struggle free but all i succeeded in doing was making the tape tighter then i rocked the chair so hard trying to pull away it fell over i was helpless like a tortoise flipped on its back so we saw look do you mind if i get myself a drop of brandy this teas very nice and all but ive really had quite a shock you know not at all can i geti mean would either of you like anything no thank you said banks holding up his mug tea will do fine for me winsome nodded in agreement okay mallory went to the drinks cabinet and poured himself a generous measure of rémy into a crystal glass thats better he said after the first sip i suppose you already know that well probably want the same information your previous visitors wanted id guessed that already but youre not going to tie me up and threaten me with surgical instruments are you is that what they did mallory gave a theatrical shudder on second thought banks realized perhaps it wasnt so theatrical one of them did a real psychopath ciaran one of his persuasion techniques mallory almost choked on his remy you know who they are i can make a pretty good guess said banks winsome winsome took roses sketches from her briefcase and passed them to mallory good god he said yes thats them he passed them back to winsome then youre a lucky man said banks you still have all your organs intact he put his mug down on the table leaned forward and cracked his knuckles the thing is victor we dont have a lot of time to beat about the bush theyve already got five hours or more start on us and theres a lot at stake a lot more than you can imagine but who are they why me are you going to arrest them thats a lot of questions and im the one supposed to be doing the asking did you know that your friend jaff mccready works for a man called fanthorpe better known as the farmer fanthorpe no whos he all you need to know is that hes also the employer of ciaran and darren the men who just paid you a visit and they may have supplanted jaff in fanthorpes favor in recent days mallory swallowed banks could see his adams apple bob up and down they wanted to know where jaff is thats all do you know where he is no i dont honest i dont but you must have some idea the ciaran and darren i know wouldnt believe that at face value theyd have cut at least a little finger off or sharpened it like a pencil just to make sure and they dont really seem to have harmed a hair on your head all the damage that was done you did to yourself they terrorized me tortured me in my own home my guess is banks went on that you talked and that you talked very quickly indeed so wed like you to do the same with us you owe us that courtesy at least i mean they only tied you up and threatened you with mutilation we set you free let you change your wet clothes gave you a cup of tea and a glass of brandy you owe us something victor you must see that you sound just like them dont be silly wheres jaff mccready victor turned away i dont know thats better now i know for certain youre lying i like to know where i stand banks read out the number of the car that had been found hidden off the moorland road that mean anything to you yeah its my car good im glad you didnt try to deny that now were getting somewhere what was it doing on the moors above gratly i dont even know where gratly is that wasnt my question how did it get there and dont try to tell me it was stolen okay so i lent it to jaff i assume you already know that or you wouldnt be here so what hes a mate of mine i didnt know what sort of trouble he was in but you must have known he was in some trouble well sure but like i said hes a mate you help out a mate in trouble dont you banks thought of juliet doyle who had turned her daughter in to the police when she found a handgun in her possession who was going to help them out of their trouble lets not get too philosophical about it victor we dont have time what else did you lend jaff nothing i dont know what you mean was he with anyone there was a girl she stayed outside in his car i only saw her when they swapped cars and got into mine he said her name was francesca she just stayed outside in the car of her own accord mallory frowned of course why not she didnt appear under duress or anything no not that i could tell banks could feel winsomes gaze on him he had to tread carefully he knew show no emotion if he used tracys true identity to browbeat mallory it could all backfire on him if it came to court gervaise had warned him he was on thin ice and he was already beginning to feel it splintering under his feet did jaff tell you why he needed to borrow your car not specifically no he just said he was in a spot of bother and he had to get away it was only later when i watched the newsheard about erin you know erin met her a couple of times crazy bitch i told him she was trouble and what did he say to that just gave me that knowing smile of his and said he could handle it why was she trouble mallory scratched his temple she was dead jealous impulsive fiery and obsessive too possessive its a dangerous combination sounds like a young woman in love to me said banks but jaff doesnt like to be tied down he likes his freedom likes to come and go as he pleases with whom he wants so i gather did he tell you where he was going mallory sipped some rémy and looked away not specifically no but he gave you a general idea well he said he needed to lie low for a while ring a few people and get some business deals organized he had some bonds he wanted to sell he said he was going to london that there was a bloke he knew there in highgate name of justin peverell i remember him vaguely from uni but i wasnt part of their scene he was a foreign student i think somewhere in eastern europe anyway this justin can fix things like fake passports and that i knew jaff was in with some pretty shady people but i wasnt involved in any of that i didnt want to know about it what business deal was he talking about banks asked what are these bonds he mentioned do you know anything more about this justin peverell other than that he lives in highgate and deals in dodgy passports no honest thats all i know i lent jaff my car and he said he was going to london to see justin hed get it back to me somehow he said and in the meantime i could use his wheres jaffs car in my garage he asked me to keep it out of sight for a while did you tell ciaran and darren about justin yes i had to they were going to cut me to pieces man but i didnt tell them his last name i just remembered it so fanthorpe had almost the same information and about five hours start thought banks that didnt bode well fanthorpe would also have the resources to find this justinthe criminal network in fact it would probably be a damn sight easier for him than it would be for banks if justin hadnt registered on the mets radar yet and no doubt ciaran and darren were down in highgate already awaiting instructions still this sounded like the same justin of whom erin had spoken and they not only had his last name peverell but also the name of his girlfriend martina it might just give them the edge they needed they could check the electoral rolls the phone book even of course if peverell was from eastern europe he probably wasnt using his real name and if he wasnt a british citizen or resident that might make him difficult to track down but where the hell were jaff and tracy banks wondered they could be in london themselves by now theyd certainly had enough time to get there victors car had been found on the moors only two or three miles from bankss cottage where annie had been shot and from there on they must have been on foot for a while they could still be up there wandering in circles people had been lost for days on the moors had died there it didnt even take a bad storm or a major snowfall on the other hand tracy knew something of the lie of the land from their walks up there and if they had got hold of another vehicle they could be anywhere it was one thing to know where they were going but it would be much better to know where they were especially as tracys value to mccready declined with every mile they got closer to justin peverell jaff certainly wasnt going to fork over for two passports did he even know who she was who her father was and if he did how would that affect his strategy i want to know about the gun victor banks said mallory seemed nervous what gun all i did was lend my car to a mate in trouble i dont know anything about any gun i dont know if your last visitors asked you about it or not they probably werent interested once youd told them about justin but i am very interested we dont know if jaff had a gun with him when he left his flat but we think its very unlikely partly because erin doyle had already run off with it and her mother had found it and handed it over to us which is the main reason why jaff was running away in the first place he was certain shed name him and he didnt want the police poring over his dodgy business deals so if he didnt have two guns at home to start withand why would hethen he must have got the second one from you stands to reason as far as we know this is the only place he stopped before he banks was about to say went to my house but he pulled himself up in time before he went on the run that gun was used to shoot a policewoman victor the gun we think you gave him a baikal in all likelihood and he might have added it is probably now being used to threaten my daughter into doing what he wants that makes you an accessory mallory turned pale jaff did that no i cant believe it you cant lay that on me i never gave him any gun ive never had a gun i dont believe you said banks but i dont have the time right now to thrash it out of you if i find out that youre in any way connected with that gun or that youve lied or withheld any information from us ill be back and ill prove it in the meantime dont even think of going on your holidays banks gestured to winsome who put away her notebook and stood up when they left mallory was sitting in ashen silence with his glass of rémy in his slightly trembling hand outside the watchers were still sitting in their skoda plumes of smoke drifting out through the open window banks walked over to them and leaned on the roof weve finished for now he said gesturing with his thumb back toward vics house but if i were you id get your guv to send in a search team and take his house apart brick by brick youre looking for handguns and possibly an illegal lab of some kind if you dont find anything there then try to find out if hes got another place a business property perhaps or a secret lockup somewhere maybe under another name you never know it might earn you a few brownie points and by the looks of you both you could do with them bye when banks got back to the car winsome was listening to her mobile frowning she said goodbye and folded it shut ive asked geraldine to check the electoral rolls and telephone directories for a justin peverell she said and theres good news do tell weve got a report from the local police station at baldersghyll a white builders van has been stolen from the car park near rawley force about three miles away its a national park spot and apparently people park there and do the circular walk it takes about three and a half hours so what happened couple came back a bit early after only about two hoursseems they hadnt a lot of time so they did the short versionand they found their van gone madame gervaise has acted quickly and all units have the number and description it makes sense too much of a coincidence that someone else would have just come along and nicked it it was in the vicinity and general direction jaff and tracy would have been heading good said banks theres more seems the vans a bit of an old clunker according to its owner it doesnt go more than about forty banks smiled not having a lot of luck with his motors our jaff is he if the speedometer of the stolen van crept up toward fifty the chassis and engine block started shaking so much that tracy feared it would fall apart or that the wheels would drop off this only increased jaffs frustration along with the wetherby roadworks on the a and now an accident blocking the southbound lanes to the m it was starting to get dark by the time they finally crawled onto the m east of leeds and already it was close to two and a quarter hours since they had stolen the van time was definitely not on jaffs side tracy noticed that he was getting edgier by the minute it was partly the frustration and partly the coke he kept stuffing up his nose the motorway was plagued by more cctv cameras and police patrol cars than anywhere else he complained and an old white builders van hobbling along in the slow lane couldnt help but attract unwanted attention these days too he told her many of the motorway cameras used the anpr systemautomatic number plate recognitionwhich meant that they automatically informed the police if a car was stolen pretty soon he was certain they wouldnt stand a chance on the m and it would be at least a five or sixhour drive at the speed they were going now more likely the van would clap out before sheffield and theyd be stuck on the open road fuck it jaff finally said thumping the steering wheel were not going to make it at this rate we wont even be south of wakefield by the time the vans reported stolen weve got to get rid of this piece of shit before they find us theyre bound to know we took it pretty soon if they dont know already maybe those people were fast walkers or they didnt do the whole route for some reason the cops could be on to us at any moment but where can we go tracy said theyll have the railway and bus stations covered i need time to think and make some calls said jaff but first weve got to dump this van he drove on in silence for a few more minutes then indicated a turn at the next junction what are you doing tracy asked ive got an idea well go to leeds leeds are you insane jaff shot her a hard glance think about it leeds is one of the last places theyll be looking for us theyd never expect us to go back there in a million years but tracy knew they would the police didnt always think in quite so linear a fashion as jaff seemed to imagine when he thought he was being clever especially her father fine she said a glimmer of hope now flickering inside her leeds she knew leeds it was home turf your place or mine neither im not so stupid as to think they wont be guarding our places or that the neighbors wont be vigilant and report any sounds vics is out of the question too theyre bound to have traced the other car to him by now what if he talks vic he wont talk hes an old mate weve been through a lot together like what crosscountry running with your backs to the wall or showers with games teacher after rugger you dont know fuck all about it so just shut the fuck up besides vic doesnt know anything he doesnt know where we are ill bet he knows where were going though and who were going to see jaff just glared at her which told her she was right and he was worried the coke paranoia was kicking in there was a short stretch of road through a desolate industrial estate in stourton between the m and the m into leeds and jaff concentrated on making the correct turns at the roundabouts then he pulled into the entrance of a deserted warehouse yard what are you doing tracy asked why are you stopping no need to piss yourself were getting out of these filthy clothes and putting some clean ones on you go first tracy crawled into the back of the van and opened her bag it was a relief to change out of her old clothes and put on some of the clean fresh ones jaff had bought her at the swainsdale centre just the other day hard to believe only such a short while ago things had been so good between them now he was like another person jekyll and hyde she changed her underwear too and only wished she could have a bath first the best she could do was get back in the front and use the mirror to put on a little makeup while jaff changed quickly after her and then climbed into the drivers seat thats better he said laying out another two lines of coke on a mirror and snorting them through a rolledup twentypound note sure you dont want any no thanks said tracy where are we going now first off well dump this piece of shit in beeston it wont last five minutes there then well find a nice hotel in the city center and ill make some phone calls theres no on else i trust up here but ill work out a plan dont you worry how are we going to get to london tracy asked so many questions i think i know where i can get us a clean car first thing in the morning bloke i know owns a garage in harehills mot road tax no questions asked then well be down to london in no time tracy was thinking furiously leeds might be her best chance yet if jaff got a bit too cocky about their safety there she had been hoping for her break on the moors but it hadnt come now she couldnt see an easy way out at all no matter where they went or what they did they would either get to london in which case she would be at the mercy of jaff and his friends who would certainly want to leave no witnesses behind or they would run into a police roadblock and jaff would try to shoot his way out or put the gun to her head and use her as a hostage whichever way she looked at it things were bad and her only possible hope was her father if they had got in touch with him it was thursday and as far as she could remember he was due back in the country today he was planning on staying the weekend in london but surely someone must have got news of annies shooting to him by now theyll be looking for two of us you know tracy said an asian male and a white female were making it easy for them so what do you suggest i bleach my skin white you tan yours brown i suggest we split up theyll never find you alone in leeds you could probably even take a train down south and they wouldnt find you not on your own you dont think theyve got my picture out everywhere and you a coppers daughter maybe they have tracy argued but theyre still looking for the two of us police get blinkered like everyone else some of them are pretty thick too as a matter of fact but not your dad and its my bet hell be the numero uno leading the search for you they wont let him do that its too personal they have strict rules against that think theyll be able to stop him jaff paused anyway lets say youre right youre still my insurance policy and id be a fool to leave my insurance behind if he is leading the search the way you say its because of me without me you stand a much better chance jaff shook his head maybe its partly because of you but its also because of that bitch i shot back at his house think hes going to give up on her he was probably shagging her they stick together its not like that you can drop me off right here or in the city center i can make my own way home im sure you can right into your fathers police station ill bet youve got plenty of friends there and youd be more than happy to answer all their questions youll have a much better chance of getting to london and out of the country without me who said i wasnt already planning on getting out of the country without you his words didnt surprise tracy but she still felt shocked all the same what surely you dont think im planning on taking you with me now after everything thats happened its not as if youve exactly proved to be an asset is it what are you going to do with me i havent decided yet ill think of something he gave her a crooked sideways smile justin might have some ideas who knows you might even be worth something theres still a market for young white female flesh in some places and justins specialty is getting people over borders with the minimum of fuss and maximum of profit or maybe ill just shoot you easier that way no loose ends anyway one thing at a time tracy folded her arms and shrank into her seat white slavery it sounded silly when she put it that way such an oldfashioned term but it still sent a shiver of fear through her it wasnt quite as farfetched as it sounded she had heard and read things in the papers recently about white girls sold into sexual bondage overseas and her father had worked on a peopletrafficking case not so long ago involving girls being smuggled from eastern europe he didnt discuss his cases in any detail with her but he had let slip one or two disturbing facts about the way these things were done and just in case you get any clever ideas about trying to escape when were among people again you can forget it if im close to being caught because of you and i think its all over anyway ill shoot you without a second thought if i think i can get away i might not shoot you in public but i will catch up with you or my friends will we have long memories every car that passes you on your way to work in the morning every suspiciouslooking person you see lurking on the streetget the idea youll never know youll never see it coming then one day the hardly felt needle prick and when you wake up youre in a stinking metal container on the way to some shithole country youve never heard of where rich men will pay unimaginable sums of money to do things so filthy to you youll wish you were dead so dont even think of trying to escape soon they were on the m under the sodium lamps when tracy closed her eyes she couldnt prevent the images of annies shooting from running again in her mind the shock in her eyes and the way she fell among the crockery breaking the glass table she thought about what jaff had just said whether he was only trying to scare her or not and she felt herself on the verge of panic maybe he was laying it on a bit thick but no amount of reason could hold at bay the images that now tormented her she had never been so frightened in her life had never wanted her father so much had never felt so far from home jaff turned off the motorway into beeston this is an unexpected pleasure do come and join me in the den mr banks and ms er jackman ds winsome jackman winsome what a delightful name and one that might i say most certainly does you justice banks glanced at winsome and he could tell by her expression that she was wishing she hadnt told fanthorpe her first name as fanthorpe led the way she put her finger in her mouth and mimicked vomiting banks smiled the den was an unabashedly masculine room from the dark wainscoting and the rosewoodandmotherofpearl chessboard with its intricately carved ebony and ivory pieces to the mounted brass telescope by the bay window the mounted stags head and the framed racing scenes on the wall four maroonred leatherupholstered armchairs were arranged around a solid oak antique table at the center mozarts eine kleine nachtmusik played from hidden speakers the farmer walked over to the cocktail cabinet and brought out three crystal tumblers and a decanter he was wearing baggy brown cords and a cable sweater knit from swaledale wool with his round shoulders and jaunty walk spare tire and mass of curly gray hair he reminded banks of a leprechaun on steroids drinks i do hope youll join me i have a rather fine old malt its not a social visit said banks settling into one of the chairs it was so comfortable that if he took fanthorpe up on his offer of a drink he thought he would probably curl up and go to sleep winsome crossed her long legs and took out her notebook pity the farmer poured himself a large measure sat down and smacked his lips its ardbeg airigh nam beist thats gaelic for shelter of the beast in case you dont know so what can i do for you banks caught a strong whiff of the peat and iodine he was getting used to it more and more and was rediscovering his taste for islays but he wouldnt be sampling any of fanthorpes wares even if he werent so tired the mozart ended and was followed by beethovens für elise a classic fm collection of the great composers best bits if banks wasnt mistaken were looking for an employee of yours he said name of jaffar mccready or jaff any idea where we can find him jaff im afraid i have no idea he just does odd jobs id hardly call him an employee casual labor perhaps then how do you get in touch with him if you need him by telephone of course mobile home number that was no use banks knew it already if jaff had a mobile it was payasyougo unregistered and untraceable exactly what sort of odd jobs does he do for you jaffs a jackofalltrades or should that be a jaffofalltrades fanthorpe laughed but neither banks nor winsome joined him he cleared his throat and sipped some malt sure you wont join me he asked holding up his glass it truly is magnificent goes down like prickly silk by the sound of him banks reckoned hed had a few already can you be a bit more specific about the nature of jaffs employment well he doesnt muck out the stables if thats what you mean bit of courier work the occasional security duty when necessary and when would that be necessary you might not realize this mr banks but racehorses can be valuable properties very valuable indeed and theyre vulnerable sadly there are some unscrupulous people in the business one has to be careful ive read dick francis said banks fanthorpe smiled then youll get the picture strongarm stuff hardly mr banks i have no call for that sort of thing in my business i thought you said there are some unscrupulous people around yes but actual violencestrongarm stuff as you call itis a rarity they have more subtle ways of making their needs known what exactly is your business banks asked i understand about the horses but thats merely the tip of the iceberg isnt it a hobby almost i suppose you could say that fanthorpe turned the crystal glass in his hands it caught the light from the shaded desk lamp and different colors flared and sank in its facets bit of this bit of that mostly dairy farming and productionwe own a cheese factory my wife and ithe stables and horse training of course i also partown a couple of thoroughbreds doing very well they are if you ever want a tip for drugs mr banks wash your mouth out only i heard youre quite a mover and shaker in the local coke trade it seems to be having quite a renaissance these days in case you havent noticed i wouldnt go around making unfounded accusations like that if i were you why not pal of the chief constable are you as a matter of fact we have been known to play the occasional round bring home the odd brace of grouse i own quite a nice stretch of moorland up lets cut the bollocks fanthorpe said banks leaning forward im looking for jaffar mccready simple as that to be honest i dont give a damn about your dairy farms thoroughbreds and coke business right now except in that they relate to jaffar mccready you may or may not be aware of this but hes wanted in connection with the shooting of a female police officer friend of yours was she fanthorpes eyes glinted with cruelty something a bit personal is it girlfriend even i thought that sort of thing was frowned upon in your line of work if youd just stick to the point sir said winsome she picked up her briefcase and passed over roses sketches of ciaran and darren and a glossy photograph of jaff they had got from erin doyles laburnum way room do you recognize any of these men fanthorpe picked up each one in turn made a show of scrutinizing it then passed it back to her thats jaffar mccready he said of the photograph and thats ciaran and thats darren but you know that already just need to make certain sir winsome said slipping the pictures carefully back into her briefcase banks gripped the arms of the chair and let his anger abate he was thankful for winsomes timely interruption and for the breathing space the pictures had afforded him he might easily have said or done something stupid otherwise he still might if he didnt get a grip fanthorpe turned his gaze to winsome i had a mate owned a sugar cane plantation in jamaica once he said wanted me to go into business with him i told him i couldnt stand the climate though or the people lazy sods the lot of them then he eyed winsome up and down seems things have come a long way since then yes indeedy mastah sir said winsome they even give us darkies warrant cards and let us arrest criminals the farmer laughed cheeky with it i like that wheres mccready banks cut in i wish i knew oh whys that he owes me money the bonds is that why ciaran and darren are looking for him fanthorpe swirled his whiskey in the glass you can draw your own conclusions you will anyway i dont know anything about any bonds i dont know where you got that from all im saying is that mccready owes me money and i want it before he disappears into a cell and it all ends up in a coppers pocket mccready was already on the run before he shot detective inspector cabbot we were wondering if that had anything to do with you me no something to do with a gun i heard said fanthorpe it was all over the news winsome made a note and spoke up again jaffar mccready was never mentioned in connection with the gun juliet doyle handed in to us she said we didnt tell the press that and they didnt broadcast his name so how did you know banks asked fanthorpe oh you think youre so bloody clever dont you the both of you do you think i dont have my sources a man in my position do you think i dont know what doesnt go into the newspapers or on the telly come on grow up chief constable tell you did he a brief chat at the ninth hole for crying out loud does this gun mean anything to you banks asked its a ninemillimeter smith and wesson is there some reason that its falling into our possession disturbs you not at all i have nothing to fear so you think youre clean on the gun okay what does mccready have of yours drugs cash i told you he owes me money apparently he told someone he was carrying bonds rubbish he was just trying to make it all sound legit like hes some sort of highpowered business broker he stole from me cash simple as that drug money i told you he does occasional courier duties sometimes that involves carrying and banking large sums of money he happened to have just such a sum in his possession when he disappeared when jaffar mccready disappeared winsome said hed just returned from a business trip to amsterdam and london or so he said how did he end up with so much of your money in his possession if you think im going to divulge my private business transactions to you youve got another think coming ms winsome do you usually use your farmhands as debt collectors banks asked ciaran and darren are men of many talents limited intelligence but many talents their appearance can be ratherintimidating as im sure you remember sometimes their mere arrival on a scene encourages people to do as they ask it can be important when large sums are at stake ill bet it can so far theyve terrorized an innocent twentyfouryearold girl and tied up and threatened a young man with torture real tough guys ever heard of a victor mallory cant say as i have hes an old university and public school pal of mccreadys the old boys network well jaff always did move in rarefied circles a bit too rich for my blood cambridge does that to people you know i came up the hard waysheer hard work getting my hands dirty i never went to university and west leeds boys high is hardly a public school so i wouldnt know about all that wouldnt know this mallory either jaff has a lot of friends i dont know about and dont want to know about theres a big age difference for a start then the employeremployee relationship hardly conducive to friendship i should imagine jaffs friends are more his own age do you know what information ciaran and darren wanted from the people they threatened enlighten me they wanted to know where jaffar mccready is heading well then were back to square one arent we fanthorpe spread his hands thats exactly what id like to know except nobody yet has mentioned the elephant in the corner of the room meaning said banks though he had an inkling of what fanthorpe was getting at and the thought chilled him like a shadow crossing the high daleside fanthorpe stood up poured himself another generous shot and pointed at banks your daughter banks tracy nobodys mentioned her part in all this yet have they he leaned against the wall and grinned now if you ask me youre a man in a lot of trouble mr banks a lot of grief and trouble i have daughters too i can understand that who knows if we put our heads together then maybe we might even be able to help one another what about it jaff left the van behind a doorless mini on blocks in a street of dirty redbrick terrace houses not far from beeston hill cemetery the tall prewar houses seemed to tracy to loom menacingly over them in the growing dark as they walked away watched closely by a gang of hooded youths congregating at the end of a ginnel looking shifty and threatening by turns there was a mosque on the corner with an ornate mosaic dome televisions flickered behind motheaten curtains canned laughter spilled out into the street and mingled with the beat of a distant pub band the streetlights had just come on a jaundiced yellow in the late twilight purple and they were surrounded by haloes of haze a hint of exotic spices filled the night air behind the highpitched slate roofs roiling dark clouds parted now and then to allow a lance of moonlight to break through there was an edgy feel to the night tracy sensed and the sky seemed to echo it perhaps a thunderstorm was on the way anything could happen one of the youths turned and called out something after them tracy couldnt make out the words she could see that jaff had one hand in his bag though and a grim smile on his face a just let them try something smile tracy felt her pulse quicken with her footsteps but nobody followed them nobody threw anything when they got to the welllit arterial road with its people pubs hairdressers asian shops and curry houses jaff relaxed his grip and removed his hand from the bag they caught the first bus into the city center and sat upstairs at the front there were hardly any other passengers at that godforsaken time of the evening well after office hours and before closing time isnt it dangerous going to a hotel tracy said i told you theyll be looking for the two of us together jaff gave her a sideways glance im not letting you go so dont start that again well be fine i suppose you just want to go home to daddy tracy said nothing she did well thats not going to happen so youd better make the best of things dont forget what i said back there in the van i mean it he looked her up and down at least youre reasonably presentable now youll just about pass muster just how about me jaff looked fine immaculate as usual youll do she said its a nice hotel ive got in mind jaff said not some fleabag place well be able to have a shower get room service minibar the lot the bus lumbered on around corners across intersections and finally made its way into the city center what about the cctv cameras tracy asked as she saw the familiar landmarks of the corn exchange and kirkgate market ahead theyre only useful if someones watching them and knows what to look for said jaff if you think how many of them there must be youve got to realize that there cant possibly be enough people to watch them all or wed be all watching each other all the time real big brother its a risk but a minor one especially here like i said no ones going to expect us to come back here and by the time anyone gets to checking all the cctv footage well be sunning it up on the costa del sol at least i will he grabbed the chrome rail come on our stop help one another where do you get that from said banks fanthorpe sat down and cradled his fresh drink a superior grin on his face i would have thought it was obvious he said winsome cast banks a puzzled glance go on banks said enlighten me fanthorpe sprawled in his chair we both know that jaff mccreadys on the run with your daughter tracy i havent the least interest in her but i do have a very strong interest in young jaff like i said hes got something of mine and i want it back so its i scratch your back and you scratch mine is that it something like that i can guarantee your daughters safety banksthat is if shes still in one piece when ciaran and darren find her can you do that with all your protocols and procedures and red tape can you go on fanthorpe leaned forward i thought youd be interested my proposal is a simple one leave me to find jaff and tracy when i do shes yours unharmed as i said i have daughters too believe me i understand how you must be feeling you understand nothing dont try to tell me you give a damn about saving my daughters life all you want to do is carry on making your illegal fortunes i cant help it if i make a good living off other peoples misery giving people what they want selling them drugs however you look at it you can hardly say that youve made a hell of a lot of people happy in your life so far can you i mean how many of the petty villains you banged up got rogered so often in prison that their arseholes turned black and blue how many scared young kids got stabbed by makeshift shivs in the showers you hardly go around spreading joy and sunshine mate so dont give me that holierthanthou shit im giving you a chance here a chance to save your daughters life dont you throw it back in my face i never make an offer more than once banks felt sick the farmers offer was tempting way too tempting and he could do as he said he could deliver with a lot more chance of success than any police intervention could offer you only had to look at the patrick doyle case to know that then banks would have tracy back and jaffwell jaff was a waste of space anyway who cared but it would mean ending up in fanthorpes pocket it wouldnt stop there either with tracys safe return there would be more demands a little insider information a tip here a tipoff there polite requests to turn a blind eye payments made before long banks wouldnt be able to bear looking at his reflection in the mirror and winsome was here too his moral compass a witness to it all she would never agree and she wouldnt lie for him no matter how rude the farmer had been to her earlier and jaff banks said what happens to jaff fanthorpe looked away what do you care i cant imagine why that would matter to you i have no real interest in harming him i just want my money back of course its always possible that darren and ciaran might see fit to teach him a lesson what he did reflects on all of us you see i wont lie to you what jaff has done cant go unpunished and ciaran doesnt always know where to draw the line i do see said banks theyre going to kill him or theyre going to take him somewhere where you can kill him fanthorpe laughed now dont be silly i wouldnt harm a fly besides its nothing as extreme as that he sipped some whiskey a short period of hospitalization perhaps a while before he can get back in the saddle so to speak a mere slap on the wrist surely even you can see the poetic justice in something like that i mean look what he did shooting that policewoman bit of a goat too is jaff your daughter before winsome could step in again banks held his hand up palm out dont he said quietly for all our sakes dont follow that line of thought any further fair enough i can see how you might find it painful as you say i simply thought you would approve of my intentions thats all if not i cant be in any way responsible for your daughters safety it felt like time for the if you harm a hair on her head ill rip out your spine and shove it down your throat speech but banks didnt see the point he was sure that he and fanthorpe understood each other already instead he said people like you cant let others steal from them you have to show your power exercise it you have to make examples jaff will be executed no doubt in a slow painful and terrible way and everyone you deal with will know it they will know what happened and why and who did it will know that they stray at their peril what you do to jaff will keep your troops in order till the next time some jackthelad thinks he can put one over on you i cant be a part of that what does it matter were splitting hairs what do you care about jaff mccready especially after what hes done to your daughter and your colleague for christs sake banks you must want him d i told you not to take that route fanthorpe stopped in mid sentence and sighed well come on he said isnt it about time you woke up and saw what was happening what youre really dealing with here fanthorpes face had flushed as he talked with anger and with drink banks wanted to hit him plant a hard heavy fist smack in the middle of his face and watch the claret flow and assuming i went along with this plan of yours he said just what would i have to do banks could sense winsome looking agape at him but he ignored her she would find out where he was going soon enough why nothing thats the beauty of it fanthorpes gray eyes glittered a mere slap on the wrist as i said you simply have to leave it to me to ciaran and darren you mean theyve got a head start and ill bet you anything my contacts are better than yours that i can find out where jaff and your daughter are going sooner than you can that may be true banks agreed so why dont you just share that information with me and we can do this all legal and aboveboard that should make everyone happy itll keep ciaran and darren from facing a murder charge and life imprisonment too and you if youre implicated fanthorpe shook his head you just dont get it do you you just dont get it and have whats mine disappear from the evidence room or get tied up in judicial red tape for the next twenty years no way that must be some dodgy fortune youre after getting back or maybe its a nice kilo or two of coke if thats the case well definitely be hanging on to it thats none of your business what is your business is that ciaran and darren dont know to leave tracy alone focus on that banks felt a chill run through him immediately followed by the raging impulse to hurt fanthorpe what do you mean by that he asked though he knew full well the meaning of fanthorpes threat he could sense winsomes empathy and her determination to hold him back if he suddenly snapped she was poised ready but he wasnt going to snap if there was one part of the job banks hated more than any other it was that feeling of impotence and ineffectiveness he so often felt by having dedicated himself to upholding the law following the rules he cut corners from time to time like everyone had occasionally acted rashly and even perhaps illegally but on the whole he was on the side of virtuous and good there was no way he would go along with what fanthorpe was suggesting he was going to get tracy back and he was going to take jaff down fanthorpe ciaran and darren along with him he was as certain of that as he had been certain of the true way things stood in his life that night out in the nevada desert he just didnt know how he was going to achieve it all yet i should have thought my meaning was obvious said fanthorpe as far as ciaran and darren are concerned jaff and your daughter are one and the same my enemies tarred with the same brush however you care to put it theyre in it together if i let my men know otherwise then all will unfold as i promised your daughter will be rescued unharmed and jaff will take his punishment like a man and if i dont thats asking for trouble events would take their course why would an otherwise intelligent man like yourself want to take the moral high ground here because im a policeman mr fanthorpe and as a policeman i could hardly turn a blind eye to murder could i because however you whitewash it thats what it would be what youre basically telling me is that youll make sure your men hurt my daughter if i dont let you have your drugs or your drug money back and leave you free to do what you want with jaffar mccready including kill him well he might be a criminal its true but if i do as you say i become like you nothing more than some twopennyhapenny gob of slime whos managed to raise his greedy maw a few inches out of the gutter at feeding time the farmer spluttered on his whiskey and dribbled some down his jumper hey steady on bloody hell thats a bit strong banks he said pointing his finger youll regret that whatever happens youll regret that ciaran and darren are in london already awaiting my instructions well why dont you call them were not stopping you but you dont have any orders to give them yet do you you dont know any more than we do probably less he looked over at winsome who smiled and shook her head fanthorpe stared at banks for a long moment i dont understand you he said finally i just dont understand i propose a simple deal i get my money back i give the thief a slap on his wrist you get your daughter back unharmed wheres the problem thats exactly the problem banks said gesturing to winsome that they should be going that you dont see it as a problem well trouble you no more tonight no need to see us out was that wise winsome said as banks got into the passenger seat beside her winding him up like that perhaps not said banks i dont know but fanthorpes not the answer if i could arrest him i would but weve got nothing on him not yet it wouldnt even do any good to take him in on sus and sweat him in an interview room for a while either much as id enjoy the opportunity first off we dont have a while and second hes too canny for that hed have his team of highpriced lawyers down there like a shot no well get the farmer when the time is right for the moment ill ask the locals to keep an eye on his movements at least we know now that ciaran and darren are in london because thats where they think jaff and tracy are heading can we put a tap on fanthorpes phone their mobiles not enough time said banks with a wistful grin besides hes bound to have a throwaway i suppose we could try hanging him upside down or beating it out of him or maybe pulling his fingernails out with pliers but that relinquishes the moral high ground pretty damn quickly doesnt it banks gestured toward winsomes briefcase and at least weve got his fingerprints i didnt think youd noticed im not that tired well done they might come in useful and we dont have them on record well hes never done anything illegal has he he certainly hasnt been caught what next back to the station regroup dont forget weve got justin peverells surname and the farmer doesnt were not without our contacts either im still willing to bet that our resources are better than fanthorpes i also have a sneaking suspicion that jaff and tracy are nowhere near london yet wasnt it you who told me that the van they stole was an old clunker wouldnt go more than forty miles an hour isnt that what you said yes fanthorpe doesnt seem to know that either it buys us time lets go see if madame gervaise and the rest have made any more progress with ian jenkinson and this quisling bloke as soon as tracy watched jaff walk up to the hotel reception desk and start talking to the pretty young blond receptionist in his best posh accent offering his corporate credit card the one that couldnt be traced back to him her heart sank he could do no wrong judging by the girls smile and her body language she was practically in bed with him already tracy seriously considered making a run for it at that very moment but jaffs words and threats came back to her and the images he had evoked a car door opening and someone dragging her inside the dark interior or tossing her into the boot smothering her with smelly old blankets the threat of the unseen pinprick in the thigh or hip waking up in an unfamiliar country standing on a sort of makeshift stage with other girls dressed only in pink diaphanous chiffon fluttering in a breeze from nowhere the leering eyes of the men on the front row crawling all over her she realized it was a ridiculous image of course but it kept her sitting where she was only a few feet behind him as he made the booking glancing occasionally back at her and grinning but giving most of his attention to the blonde he had the clothes the voice the gift of the gab the air of superiority all he needed to succeed despite his mixed race heritage the golden color of his skin he was public school and oxbridge establishment through and through and vicious criminal or not he acted just like one of them cocksure certain of his place of his due of his worth sure of his position a member of the right class to the manor born there was no way anyone in this jumpedup provincial hotel pretentious as it was was going to deny his demands let alone mistake him for a dangerous criminal on the run or associate him with someone wanted for murder if annie was dead tracy had no way of knowing as she hadnt seen or heard any news since they left the cottage tracys heart sank as she watched jaff yet she couldnt help but admire the performance if performance it was there were many sides to him she suspected and this was just one of them he turned back to her a key in his hand and a smile on his face and gestured for her to follow him to the lift they went up to the fourth floor in silence and walked along the deserted corridor some rooms with trays of empty bottles and glasses outside the remains of halffinished steaks and prawn shells scattered on plates no one saw them as they entered room the view was nondescript a back street so narrow you couldnt really see anything but the low slate roofs opposite and beyond them the windows of an office tower empty for the night though one or two lights still burned in the checkerboard pattern of windows the thunderstorm hadnt come yet but the sky still looked angry as a boil ready to burst jaff drew the heavy curtains their closing made tracy feel claustrophobic somehow at least having some sort of view however mean gave her some hope some snatched glimpse of a part of the world that was being kept from her a place she may never enter again she told herself to stop being so maudlin that the fears jaff had planted in her mind had taken too strong a hold and made her jittery jaff tossed his grip on the bench under the window then fumbled inside it and brought out the small plastic bag he had prepared for himself he held it up to her and raised his eyebrows tracy shook her head and sat on the edge of the bed hunched in on herself jaff shrugged and laid out a couple more lines on a mirror when hed snorted them he used his untraceable mobile and tracy guessed he was calling justin in london its ready greatterrifichey thats a bit steepno all right im not arguingyeah i understandokay look jus we wont come around to your place if thats all right with you just in case you know yeah in case were being followed or somethingyeah righthow about we meet somewhere the heaththats coolhighgate pond course i can find it no problem well have wheels in the morningyeah early afternoonill give you a bellsee you then mate youre a lifesaver he ended the call dropped the phone on the bed then clapped his hands and raised his fist in the air were away he said when tracy didnt react he turned on her were off to london in the morning and thenpoints exotic who knows well at least i am whats up misery guts are you planning on sulking like this from now on i mean its a difficult enough situation were in already without you sitting there with a face as long as a wet weekend in blackpool jaff tracy said im tired and im scared im not here to cheer you up or amuse you im your prisoner remember all i want is to go home please just leave me alone same old bloody record isnt it cant you change your tune you should do some coke have some fun while you can i dont want any have it your way weve got all night tracy shuddered at the thought she didnt think jaff noticed the room was spacious but it was impossible to ignore the fact that it was dominated by a king size bed tracy was quite happy to sleep in the bath if in fact she could sleep at all but she doubted that was what jaff had in mind he wouldnt want her out of his sight for one thing can we have the tv on she asked why i want to see the news they might say something aboutyou know they cant tell us anything we dont already know said jaff are you hungry shall i call room service what do you fancy i dont know whatever you want whatever i want yes okay how about pizza pizzas fine what do you want on it i dont know i dont mind mushrooms onions olives hot italian sausage anchovies pineapple thats fine right and a bottle of wine ill order a bottle of red wine too shall i if you want if i want its not just me francesca you know will you give me a little help and encouragement here what do you want a bottle of red wine is fine right ill order pizza and a bottle of red wine anything else not right now no maybe some bottled water too hey cant be too careful fizzy or still it doesnt matter said tracy tap waters fine with me fizzy said jaff right good good his leg was twitching from the coke now and he made no move toward the telephone what about madison madison yeah the blond girl on the desk shes american i bet shed be game for it shall i see if i can get her to nip up too for some fun and games a threesome dont bother on my account shes probably busy anyway i suppose so look do you want me to call tracy asked she stood up and walked toward the telephone ill do it if you like jaff wagged his finger as he swiftly intercepted her clever try he said no doubt theres some secret code you can use to communicate with madison and get her to put you through to your father you like your father dont you love him even i hated mine no way ill do it he went over to the phone and ordered a pizza with green peppers pepperoni and chicken and a bottle of chardonnay then hung up licked his lips and walked over to her coming a little too close for comfort tracy started to back slowly away while were waiting though he said why dont we i mean it has been a while work up an appetite know what i mean even if it is just the two of us you mean sex tracy said hoping she didnt sound as incredulous as she felt after everything thats happened you want sex youre sick you you must be joking but the expression on his face said not ill show you how sick i am he said and how much im joking tracy felt his hand grasp her throat and push her toward the bed behind the backs of her knees hit the edge of the mattress and her legs buckled causing her to fall back she knew then that he wasnt joking annie cabbot felt as if she were dragging herself up from the depths of the ocean huge shadows circling her in the dark green mist slimy fronds of underwater plants undulating in the water wrapping themselves around her arms and legs to immobilize her as she tried to float to the surface pulling her back she struggled in the grip of invisible tentacles that wouldnt let go no matter how much she kicked and thrashed the pressure of the water pushed down on her chest into her lungs so she couldnt breathe but only flail uselessly as the tentacles hauled her down she opened her mouth and breathed in deep gulps of salt water and suddenly she was floating free calm wrapped in a warm cocoon rising up up just as she was about to give in to the drowsy warmth that was spreading through her body she burst to the surface and her lungs were suddenly filled with cool air annies first sensation was of pain her second was panic there was something stuck down her throat and she felt as if it was choking her as she fought to control her racing heart she could hear the buzzing and beeping of the machines surrounding her okay she told herself opening her eyes and slowly adjusting to the dim light be calm youre in hospital hooked up to machines she had thought someone was with herray her fatherbut she soon realized that she was actually alone she couldnt remember how she had got there and she only had the poorest recollection of why but she was alone in a room her bed slightly raised propping her at a thirty degree angle there were tubes coming out of her chest as well as the one down her throat and ivs hooked up to a catheter on the back of her hand pouches of blood plasma and clear liquid hung on stands beside the bed beyond them was an illuminated screen which told her that her blood pressure was and her heart rate even as she watched the automatic sphygmomanometer strapped to her upper arm activated itself her bp was now heart rate she tried to relax that was better she thought not bad at all but her throat still hurt and her breathing felt the same way it had under the ocean in her waking dream as she took stock of herself and her various aches and pains needles and machines she realized that one thing struck her above all others she was still alive maybe she was dying a machine doing her breathing for her or maybe she had even died and been brought back but right now she was alive her brain felt slow and heavy as if it were stuffed with warm cotton wool and her memory felt tenuous and flimsy but it still worked her nose also seemed to be in the right place ears arms legs and torso too what really hurt most of all were her chest and her back painkillers dulled some of it but not enough from her neck down to her stomach front and back and inside she felt as if she had been beaten black and blue by a giant cricket bat maybe she had been maybe that was why she was here she could feel her toes though even wiggle them and she could clench and unclench her hands so she knew that her neck or her back werent broken annie had a hazy sense of people going about their business outside her room of muffled conversations laughter and tannoy messages but there was no clock and she didnt know where her watch was so she had no sense of time day or night she lay there trying to calm the images of fear and panic that had first crowded her mind on her trip back from the underworld she felt dreadfully thirsty and noticed a plastic cup of water on the bedside table complete with a bendy straw then she realized she couldnt drink anything with the tube down her throat nor could she call out feeling the panic rise again she looked for a bell or a buzzer and finding a button pressed it but even as she did so she became aware of people dashing into the room and there was no doubt that one of them was ray bearded and disheveled as ever she couldnt speak but her heart ached with love for him and she was sure the tears streamed down her cheeks as she lay back exhausted with her efforts and waited for the doctor and nurses to take out the tube that was choking her everyone in the boardroom close to midnight that thursday night was tired but none of them would entertain any ideas of sleep until annies shooter had been brought to justice and until bankss daughter was safe banks and winsome were present along with gervaise and doug wilson geraldine masterson vic manson stefan nowak and several uniformed officers from traffic patrol and communications they had already been cheered by the news that the fingerprints vic manson had taken from the photograph the farmer had handled matched those on the magazine of the smith wesson automatic found in erin doyles possession it confirmed the link they already suspected between the farmer jaff mccready and the murder of marlon kincaid but there was no sign of justin peverell on the electoral rolls i think were getting to the stage now where everyones feeling just a bit twitchy gervaise said when banks and winsome had finished telling everyone about their visits to victor mallory and the farmer there are just so many sides to the equation she glanced at doug wilson and geraldine masterson what did you get from west yorkshire homicide and major enquiries wilson indicated that geraldine masterson should do the talking not a lot maam she said clearly nervous to find herself performing in front of such a distinguished audience for the first time detective superintendent quisling was able to confirm that the body of marlon kincaid was discovered beside a bonfire close to woodhouse moor leeds in the early hours of sixth november by a jogger banks asked a dog walker no sir someone had to douse the flames make sure the fire was out health and safety so health and safety turn out to have their uses after all said banks miracles will never cease carry on geraldine masterson gave him a nervous smile and continued the body was partially burned but examination at the scene soon showed hed been shot twice you already know about the bullet and casing comparisons matching mr quisling said it was hard to track down everyone at the bonfire it had been quite a large party apparently with live music dancing lots of drink at first the people putting out the fire thought it was just some unfortunate drunk who had fallen down in the wrong place drugs were involved too no doubt gervaise suggested yes maam was ian jenkinson any more forthcoming than mr quisling geraldine masterson cast a sideways glance at doug wilson who was looking more like harry potter than ever tonight wearing what looked like his school tie and blazer with her long red hair green eyes high forehead and pale skin geraldine masterson could easily have passed for one his fellow hogwarts pupils but she hadnt been around long enough to be given a nickname yet annie cabbot who knew about these things had once suggested that she resembled elizabeth siddal a famous preraphaelite beauty and artists model immortalized by dante gabrielle rossetti and other painters but that was hardly nickname material doug wilson adjusted his glasses and picked up the story believe it or not ian jenkinson is studying for the ministry at the moment wants to be a vicar c of e gone quite religious not a fanatic or anything but its a bit of an about turn from his past i suppose we should thank heaven that there is such a thing as rehabilitation said gervaise go on according to jenkinson who went down from eastvale to the bonfire and who knew the victim marlon kincaid was bragging a bit that hed been warned off the territory by some bloke called the farmer but he wasnt planning on paying any attention to any country bumpkin marlon wasnt a big player apparently just sold a bit of pot and e to the student population now and again but he thought it was his patch word had reached the farmer whod been assuming he had the whole scene locked up and under control so he wanted to make an example of kincaid i guess so maam did jenkinson witness the shooting he says not do you believe him yes maam its not just the churchy bit he really does seem to genuinely regret his pastthe drugs the dealing there were a lot of loud fireworks going off that night he said a lot of loud music and a lot of drunkenness people passed out and fell asleep right there on the ground there was a good chance that nobody would have either heard the shot or noticed that kincaid was dead terrific said banks does jenkinson know jaff mccready he says not but he did say that he saw a young asian bloke slinking away at one point in the evening quite late on he was wearing a black leather jacket and he had one hand inside the front of it you know like napoleon as if he was carrying something he was trying to hide like a gun said banks did he tell this to detective superintendent quisling and his team at the time no he says that in the first place it was all very vaguehe was far from sober himself at the timeand in the second the last thing he wanted was the police following up on his accusations and bothering him again he was worried wed frame him or harass him or something he just wanted to give his statement and get back to eastvale hmm said banks he never mentioned it when i talked to him in eastvale either though he did hint at this feud between the farmer and kincaid thats how i first came across the name when i pressed him he maintained he had no idea who the farmer was or even whether it was a name or a nickname jaff mccready wasnt even on the radar then if the farmers fingerprints are on the magazine said gervaise and if mccready was possibly the shooter then fanthorpe must have given the gun to mccready and sent him to do the job a trial or an initiation ritual something like that prove himself its possible said banks and now were caught up in a falling out among thieves precipitated by erin doyles actions maybe mccready was using the gun as some kind of hold over the farmer gervaise suggested i doubt it said banks the farmers not the kind of villain to sit around and let something like that happen no if mccready had tried it on with him hed have had ciaran and darren round to his flat before you could say abracadabra and mccready would have ended up in bits and pieces in the canal you can be sure that if the farmer did give mccready the gun to shoot kincaid he had no idea that he was still holding on to it then why winsome asked insurance banks said or sheer bloodymindedness mccready and his pal mallory liked guns it was a hobby of theirs and west yorkshires still trying to find mallorys drug lab the odds are that when they do theyll find a cache of baikals as well the smith and wessons a nice gun the farmer no doubt told mccready to dump it when hed finished the job but the cocky young bastard decided to keep it he would have known that fanthorpes prints were still on the magazine once hed wiped it clean of his own maybe it gave him a feeling of power or security makes sense said gervaise anyway banks went on weve got a lot of scraps of information and they seem to be making some sort of a pattern but most of all if were to bring an end to all this we need to know justin peverells bloody address in highgate its a waiting game and nobody enjoys that when the stakes are so high we need to step up our road surveillance if their vans held out theres a good chance theyre still chugging along in the slow lane somewhere on the m and if not said gervaise then theyve holed up somewhere en route and mccreadys thinking furiously about how to get hold of another vehicle weve already got all the motorway patrol cars keeping their eyes open for a slow white van heading for london said gervaise and if they have stopped for the night somewhere on the way it gives us even more time to trace this justin hes the key once we know where he lives we can stake out his house true said banks but mccready wont want to linger one way or another hell be back on the road as soon as he can be mccready needs justin or needs what he can get from him then hell disappear like smoke or so he thinks and tracy asked gervaise i dont like to think about that said banks i cant see as it would be in his interests to hurt her or darren and ciarans no matter what fanthorpe said on the other hand when mccready has got what he wants i can also see that tracy would become an unnecessary burden thats why we have to get to them first weve got armed response units across the country on call said gervaise banks managed a grim smile now why doesnt that make me feel a whole lot better should we bring in the farmer right away suggested gervaise now we know those prints of his you got on the photos earlier are a match against those on the magazine of the smith and wesson we might be able to put a bit of pressure on him i dont think itll do any good said banks he wont tell us anything and the lawyers will spring him in minutes all it means is that he handled the magazine at some point theres no proof he shot the gun that killed marlon kincaid in fact he most likely didnt im certain he was never at the bonfire hell have a perfect alibi but you said yourself that the farmers name came up in that investigation said winsome from ian jenkinson who didnt really know what or who it referred to weve still nothing to arrest him for perverting the course of justice wasting police time suggested gervaise wed be better off waiting till we get something a bit more serious than that best just keep a close eye on him we do hav dont worry alan ripon are keeping a close watch on him hes not going anywhere he doesnt need to he can do all he needs from the comfort of his cozy little den anything on darren and ciaran we can hardly check all the london hotels gervaise said besides they could be staying at a private house all we know is what you told us that theyre in london somewhere waiting for orders have you checked fanthorpes holdings yes no london property at least not under his own name or any of his companies that we can find damn so its back to the waiting game at least we know theres a connection between fanthorpe the gun mccready and an unsolved murder said gervaise a few more missing pieces and we ought to be able to put something together and the met are on justin peverells trail said winsome the intelligence bureau theyve got men out talking to their informers people theyve planted in the trafficking business theyre taking some risks theyre doing what they can i know said banks and i appreciate it im not criticising just frustrated thats all why dont you go home said gervaise or back to your digs put your feet up for a while have a bit of a nap if you can youre doing no good here weve got the manpower we need for what we have to do you never know your eyes might close for a few minutes of their own accord well keep everything ticking over here and call you the minute anything breaks the minute the minute i might just do that and annie holding her own last i heard said gervaise her fathers with her again ill let you know as soon as i do she must have noticed banks hesitate dont worry she went on ill hold the fort here ill be passing out ties and actions momentarily winsome i want you to keep pushing on the london angle somethings got to give somebody down there has to know this justin peverell yes maam said winsome i have a few irons in the fire already good and lets not forget ciaran and darren are after justin too and i dont fancy his chances if they find him first me neither said banks or mccreadys and tracys ciarans been indulging in a lot of foreplay over the last couple of days and hell be just about ready to go all the way with someone he glanced sheepishly at winsome if youll pardon the metaphor winsome said nothing a quick tap at the door was followed by the appearance of a pc with a yellow message note in his hamlike hand sorry to interrupt maam he said addressing superintendent gervaise but its important and i thought youd want to know as soon as possible what is it lad give said gervaise its about di cabbot message from cook hospital shes regained consciousness gervaise turned to banks with a smile alan i imagine this will change your plans a wee bit of course said banks sleep can wait youll drive winsome my pleasure the farmer felt ill at ease after his visit from banks and winsome not that he was unduly worried by them they had nothing on him and they never would have he never touched anything he sold kept no paperwork and anyone who did know his name was usually wise enough not to repeat it well something had slipped out once but that was a few years ago and the surviving kid ian jenkinson hadnt known who or what he was talking about the farmer had heard that the young lad was training for the ministry these days good for him he liked to keep tabs on people whod crossed his path over the years and he never knew when it might be useful to have a vicar in his pocket besides the kid had been a drug user the farmer didnt employ druggies anymore in this business he had come to realize it pays to keep a clear head on your shoulders which means not indulging in your own merchandise for a start like a pub landlord once you start sampling the produce youre finished and your pub could burn down around you while you sleep it off on a bench in the public bar after the punters have all gone home no abstinence was a good policy the only policy the way it had to be which certainly didnt mean that he couldnt enjoy a nice malt now and then he thought topping up his glass this was also why jaff had always been a bit of a worry the farmer knew that jaff was a user coke mostly but the kid was so bright so quick so lethal and so ruthless that it somehow didnt seem to matter there were people who had a great capacity for mindaltering substances who functioned all the better or at least as well as ever under the influence and jaff was one of those or so he had appeared the farmer had told him right from the outset that if he ever saw him obviously off his face on anything at all hed get his marching orders on the spot and he hadnt not so far as fanthorpe knew whether jaff had actually been stoned at any of their rare oneonone meetings or not fanthorpe had no idea all he knew was that jaffs thoughtprocesses were always sharp and logical and his contributions helped fill the coffers the kid was cocky and he liked to see himself as more of an equal partner than an employee which in a way the farmer supposed he was he was certainly willing to let jaff go on thinking so up to a point but now things had gone way too far and that point had been passed if he didnt act quickly and decisively and do what had to be done to eradicate the source of his problem he might as well hand over the reins sources really because the banks girl was now part of the problem when he had tried to make her part of the solution now she would have to suffer the same fate as jaff then all would be on an even keel again ciaran and darren would disappear overseas for a reasonable period operations would be slowed down to the absolute minimum necessary to keep things ticking over like an animals system in hibernation and as soon as it all died down he would be back to normal again the farmer lounged back in the soft embrace of his chair sipped the ardbeg and surveyed the gleaming wainscoting the racing scenes the crystal decanters and ornate cabinets classical music was still playing though he had no idea what the piece was now it was soothing and quietstrings woodwinds no blaring brass and that was what counted he lit a cuban cigar he would never understand cops not if he lived a million years in the old days when everyone knew where they stood they beat confessions out of innocent men even hanged some of them took kickbacks bribes resold confiscated drugs and generally indulged in the madness and mayhem of power gone haywire but you knew where you were with them pace had tidied things up a bit but no one could convince george fanthorpe that these things didnt still happen that suspects didnt get beaten to a pulp or that coppers werent on the take and then you had someone like banks a known maverick a bad boy who wouldnt even lift his little finger to save his own daughters life some world bizarre and jaffhow he had turned fanthorpe remembered their first meeting over six years ago in a posh restaurant in the calls one of his dinner companions had pointed jaff out at the next table with two very attractive girls so youre jack mccreadys lad fanthorpe had said offering his hand bless my soul ive never met him but ive lost a bob or two to your old man in my days jaff had smiled at him but the smile hadnt reached his dark haunted eyes they had talked a little about racehorses on which subject jaff seemed knowledgeable enough and soon it had been obvious to both of them that they were the same beneath the skin though nothing was said there and then the farmer had given jaff his card jaff had given fanthorpe one of the girls and a room key for the discreet boutique hotel across the road what a night they hadnt looked back after that contact had to be kept to a minimum for business reasons but he always remembered that night and imagined jaff thrashing the sheets with gorgeous women like that every night while he stayed at home and worried about the bills and his daughters education zenovias increasingly extravagant shopping trips he knew he felt more than a little envious toward jaff that he lived life vicariously through him perhaps he had even once gone so far as to think jaff represented the son he had never had even in business jaff was perhaps the partner the farmer could never quite acknowledge that he had and he remembered a few months after their first meeting in this very same den where he was sitting now handing the smith wesson automatic to jaff putting in the magazine for him identifying the target and telling him to make sure he dumped the gun in the river afterward well it appeared as if he hadnt got around to that last part but what did it really matter the farmer thought so hed been a bit sloppy once so the cops might get his prints from the magazine so what jaff wouldnt be talking that was for certain the farmer was lost in this line of thought when his private mobile rang the one with the bell that sounded like an old telephone he picked it up and barked his name from the other end of the line came a name and an address followed by a click it was all he needed all hed been waiting for he keyed in the number of darrens throwaway sir said winsome on the way to hospital you dont need to call me that i know i just feel more comfortable sometimes oh does that mean you have a tricky question a complaint neither i hope sir i justwell i just wondered why you didnt take george fanthorpes offer im surprised to hear you of all people asking me that what if i hadnt been there you think id have gone along with him then no sir not that but would you have done the same after all you could always have agreed pretended to go along and then when tracy was safe you could have made your move when you sup with the devil you need a long spoon winsome and i didnt have time to go out and get one sir banks sighed and glanced out of the window beyond the buildings he could see lightning from a distant storm tracy had been scared of storms when she was a little girl he remembered he hoped she wasnt scared of them anymore she had enough to worry about right now he said were at a delicate stage of the game where fanthorpe jaff ciaran and darren hold most of the cards were also at that stage where things are tending toward chaos the still point its a bad place to be and an even worse place to make the sort of gamble that puts ones daughters life at stake i still dont understand sir im tired winsome there were many reasonsethical personal practicalwhy i didnt take the farmer up on his generous offer but when you get right down to it it just wasnt that good an offer but why not because fanthorpe couldnt guarantee tracys safety situations like the one ciaran and darren are entering into right now are volatile by nature full of uncertainty and chaotic in the extreme no one can predict what the outcome might be anything could happen a butterfly might spread its wings in mexico and change the world my gambling on fanthorpe would have been exactly that a gamble and the way things are now i at least maintain a modicum of control and more than enough selfrespect and thatll have to do for now you can get quite a long way on them actually were here arent we tracy banks lay awake in the dark the ropes that secured her hands and her ankles to the bedposts made her feel as if she were on the rack every time she moved whenever the thunder rumbled outside she felt a deep and primitive sense of unease ripple through her despite the stimulation of the coke jaff had fallen asleep quickly and easily she could hear his gentle snoring beside her see the outline of his sleek naked body glistening in the darkness four twentythree the devils hour her spirits were low and she felt used abused humiliated worthless and powerless jaff had had his way with her of course after he had tied her up and then he turned the tv on when he lost interest muttering something about ringing madison blaming tracy for just lying there like a sack of potatoes it could have been worse he could have beaten her but he hadnt he had just shagged her routinely and fallen asleep watching tv worse things had happened after a night in the clubs and a drunken trip home with a stranger awkward fumblings in the back of a minicab but this time she hadnt been drunk or stoned and jaff wasnt a stranger though in a way he was more unknowable than any of the predictable boys she had slept with before and this time it had been different this time it had been rape he had tied her down and had sex with her against her will that she hadnt screamed out or struggled changed nothing she was his prisoner and he had a gun she couldnt reach the telephone even if she tried it was on jaffs side of the bed even in his intoxication and his lust he wasnt stupid he never lost sight of the practical realities she wished she could at least get hold of the remote to turn off the bloody tv which he had switched on just before falling asleep it was an american football game and it was driving her crazy but the remote was on jaffs side too of course suddenly she sensed that he was awake beside her did you hear that he said all i can hear is the bloody tv said tracy jaff ignored her tone grabbed the remote and switched it off listen he commanded tracy listened i cant hear anything ssshhh i thought i heard someone outside in the corridor youre paranoid its just the thunderstorm or someone going back to their room after a night out jaff slipped out of bed he was wearing only his white underpants paranoia is a form of awareness and whose words of wisdom are those jaff gave her a knife blade of a smile charles manson he pulled the gun from his bag and went over to the door placing his ear against the wood then he looked through the peephole a few moments later he undid the chain and opened the door checked both ways up and down the hotel corridor and came back in i could have sworn i heard someone out there tracy couldnt very well tell him not to worry and come back to bed in her position there wasnt much point in saying anything she just kept quiet hoping he would leave her alone and fall asleep again he did lie down beside her but he didnt fall asleep she could feel the tension emanating from his body coiled on the bed beside her but he didnt touch her and she was relieved at least for that time dragged slowly on the storm abated and the dawn light started to show through the curtains tracy wondered how long they would stay there how long before they headed out to the garage where they would pick up a nice clean car and drive to london andwhen did the place open seven oclock eight nine it didnt matter how many cctv cameras recorded their journey if the car wasnt on the polices stolen list jaff was certain to obey all the rules of the road and to avoid speeding no matter how much of a hurry he was in because for him the journey meant freedom and for her it might mean death annie still seemed a small and pathetic figure as she lay there against the white sheets hooked up to the machines and tubes but her return to consciousness seemed to have given her more presence banks felt the tube was gone from her mouth and she even managed a taut grin when she saw him walk into her room he took her free hand and gave it a gentle squeeze how are you doing i feel like ive been hit by a tenton lorry two bullets from a baikal nine millimeter actually trust you to take all the romance out of it banks smiled and felt annie squeeze his hand she wheezed its still hard to breathe sometimes could you pass me the water please banks passed her the cup of water with the bendy straw i dont suppose the morphine does any harm either he said certainly not want some what would the doctor say besides if i had anything other than tea or coffee right now id probably fall down right in the bed beside you ier i the machines beeped into the silence that stretched between them annie squeezed his hand again that probably wouldnt be such a terrible thing she said if it werent for all these tubes and needles wed make an awful mess but i dont suppose thats why youre here believe it or not banks said im here because we just got the news youd returned to the land of the living and i wanted to come and see you with my own eyes im here because i care annie thats all we all do stop it youll make me cry she took her hand away for a moment to wipe her eyes wheres ray banks asked hes gone to get some sleep finally it took a lot of persuading ill bet by the way your girlfriend says hello girlfah so youve met nerys yes shes very smitten with you you know she told me i wasnt her type i guess she just didnt want to risk driving you away and you know all about these things youre the expert all of a sudden anyway nerys is all right tell her thanks dont you want to interrogate me about what happened oh id love to foremost thing on my mind seriously though if you feel up to answering a couple of questionsyou know seeing as im here bastard annie dug her nails into his palm a real mr sensitive arent you i dont remember anything really you know except except what except tracy what about her just that she was there at newhope cottage she opened the door we were talking how did she seem do you remember scared she seemed scared and nervous always looking over her shoulder biting her fingernails as if she wasnt in control as if she was playing a part and someone was watching her and she knew she had to get it right but she was offbalance a little stoned i think or drunk did you see anyone else jaff mccready you mean no i didnt see him just a shadow thats all it happened so fast after that nothing tracy may have saved your life banks said she phoned it in the call it cost her her mobile her lifeline and maybe even a beating but she did it annie smiled tell her thank you from me i will whats wrong banks shook his head and stroked the palm of annies hand looking down at the dry skin i dont know where she is only that shes in danger jaffs still got her with him yes oh alan im sorry well find them banks patted her hand look the doctor told me not to tire you out from where im lying youre the one who looks the most tired jet lag said banks its been a long day i suppose its no good telling you to go home and get some sleep i cant go banks let it trail what oh of course said annie and he saw the realization dawn on her face the shooting im sorry alan sorry i got shot in your lovely conservatory and turned your cottage into a crime scene banks was about to protest say it was all right or some such silly retort when he saw the mischievous smile curling at the edges of annies lips youre winding me up gotcha she said then she looked beyond banks and her expression brightened even more winsome wonderful to see you you too said winsome hurrying over and giving annie a gentle hug as best she could through the jumble of tubes she passed the mobile to banks you might want to hear this she said banks nodded said hed be back and hurried out of the room the line was open and superintendent gervaise was on the other end alan how is she stunning said banks magnificent whats the news dont get your hopes up nothing on jaff and tracys whereabouts yet but we think weve found justin peverell or rather winsome found him shortly before she drove you to middlesbrough only she didnt know it we just got the call back it was touch and go to get her contact to talk to me i must say he was rather rude excellent news said banks i didnt mean about the rudeness sorry yes im sure anyway the met are none too happy about shutting peverell down according to a bloke called burgess apparently commander burgess gave me a right earful i believe hes a friend of yours i know him said banks what did he say simply that his department which he wouldnt name by the way had been watching justin peverell for some time and hed led them to identify a number of couriers and traders they hadnt known about before in addition to a couple of routes and methods for smuggling in asylum seekers and sextrade women that nobody had thought of he didnt know they were watching him and if we shut him down all the good information goes with him and the ones theyve already identified scatter cant he round them up before we take in peverell put a rush on it yes said gervaise some of them that was what i suggested and thats exactly what hes doing but hes not happy about it and he wanted me to know it you know the way it goes theres always the hope of more peverell hasnt outlived his usefulness as far as burgess is concerned therell be plenty more where he came from said banks what next burgess says hell put a watching brief on peverells house in highgate theyve been faxed roses sketches of ciaran and darren along with photos of mccready and tracy theyll take note if anyone comes to the house and theres another team to follow anyone who leaves good said banks lets hope we can catch up with mccready and tracy before they get there but its good to know theres a second line of defense in place if we dont the only thing that worries me is they can be a bit quick on the draw down there if you know what i mean commander burgess has been fully apprised of the situation said gervaise heerhe knows mccready has your daughter and he asked me to pass on his sympathy he said he wouldnt be telling me any of this if it wasnt for you he also gave his word that hell see to it she comes out unharmed can you trust him i can trust him said banks i dont necessarily trust the company he keeps but i trust him all right best we can do for the moment then said gervaise get winsome to drive you back to your flat have a little nap ill be in touch as soon as theres any news winsome wandered over and joined banks just as he ended the call the nurse came in she said kicked me out told me we should leave and let annie rest she said to say good night to you winsome you devil said banks did you get in touch with dirty dick burgess behind my back was that one of those irons you had in the fire winsome grinned well i had a bit of contact with him over your return you remember when we pulled you aside at heathrow he said to stay in touch keep him apprised of what was happening from what youd told me about him and from my own conversations with him i thought he might be just the kind of bloke who would know something about the world we were investigating so i phoned him he must have fancied you said banks sir its all right theres no need to get your knickers in a twist burgess fancies anything in a skirt charmed im sure any chance of a lift back to gratly banks said only if you apologize and promise therell be no more such profane talk you drive a hard bargain winsome but i think i can just about manage that a slight figure walked up the corridor toward them mr sandhar banks said holding out his hand id like to thank you sandhar shook hands a little shyly youre welcome he said though i can hardly claim credit he cleared his throat i wonder if we could have another quick word same place as before exchanging curious glances banks and winsome followed sandhar to the examining room theres something else banks asked settling himself on the crinkly tissue of the examination table a problem im afraid so though i am extremely satisfied with ms cabbots progress the broken clavicle is a problem of course and it may severely limit her future range of arm movement usually these fractures heal quite well after four to six weeks in a sling but in this case there was some fragmentation of the bone structure as well as of the bullet weve removed the fragments but recovery could take up to three months and ms cabbot could experience considerable pain and discomfort but it will heal at the very least though it will require a great deal of physiotherapy before ms cabbot can play tennis or golf again or bowl for the england ladies eleven if indeed she ever can that wouldnt be a problem banks thought annie didnt much like playing sports she did love yoga though and the loss of flexibility would be a great blow to her what about the bullet fragments he asked did they stray far from the entry they caused an additional amount of muscle and tendon damage we could have done without sandhar said which compounds the problem of the fractured clavicle of course thats what makes recovery an even slower and more painful process but that isnt the worst of it banks swallowed what is the other bullet the one that didnt fragment it pierced the right lung as i said and it lodged in the spinal column close to t one of the central vertebrae in the anterior thoracic area do you i understand what youre saying said banks please go on there was no vertebral damage and fortunately the bullets werent hollowpoints but it is my opinion that ms cabbot will require further surgery and with such delicate surgery theres always a danger of damage to the spinal cord banks interrupted of paralysis yes said sandhar but i want you to know that we have in this hospital perhaps the best trauma specialists thoracic surgeons and spinal injury teams in the country if not in all of europe i know your reputation said banks with a wan smile but theres still a risk shell end up in a wheelchair to put it bluntly yes theres always a risk even without the surgery in fact some surgeons recommend against the operation they argue that removing the bullet could destabilize the spinal cord but you dont think so sandhar shrugged as i said theres always a risk a second opinion would be entirely acceptable given the circumstances her father already knows about this and hes thinking it over there are also many other factors such as infections and blood poisoning to consider too i think the last thing wed want is a doctor fight said banks when do you plan on performing this operation its hard to say said sandhar we certainly cant go in until the damaged lung has healed and ms cabbot has fully recovered from the trauma she suffered and we would like to see her recover from her other injuries shes young strong healthy in every other respect as she has already proven so i dont foresee any serious problems there but she needs to be stronger what kind of time period are we talking about if we operate the sooner we do it the better scar tissue starts to form in say two weeks and that makes the surgery more difficult of course it may not be possible to do it that soon depending on her general progress will she have to remain in hospital during this period oh yes she will also need to avoid unnecessary movement and for now well keep her under close observation well also be keeping track of the lodged bullet on the lookout for any movement any slippage and if it does slip sandhar smiled not to worry too much mr banks we still have as you say a little wiggle room just not quite enough to risk operating until some of ms cabbots other issues are resolved he stood up i hope ive been helpful now you really must excuse me i have patients to see thank you again said banks it was strange to be back in the old steadman house banks felt as he climbed the stairs to his upper flat it must have been close to five years since he had lived there after the fire when newhope cottage was under repair he opened the door walked into the hall and turned the lights on the place smelled fresh with a hint of some sort of lavenderscented air spray and apart from the meager furniture it was empty with nothing to show that anyone had ever lived thereno family photos only generic landscape prints in yorkshire trading frames no mess no phone message light blinking nothing not surprisingly being there made banks immediately think about his brother roy and that night he had wobbled back a little drunk from the dog and gun puzzled as to why penny cartwright had turned down his dinner invitation and found roys distress message waiting for him that had set off a chain of events that took him down to london and deep into the shady world his brother inhabited burgess had been involved in that case too as he had in so many banks dropped his suitcase in the bedroom noticing the bed was freshly made up covered in a green candlewick bedspread and glanced out of the curtains nothing had changed the room looked out over a tiny disused sandemanian graveyard no bigger than a garden and some of the tombstones leaned against the wall beneath his window he had often enjoyed a feeling of tranquillity sitting on the window seat looking down over the graves on moonlit nights listening to the gentle wind sough through the long grass but tonight he didnt feel like sitting there that night five years ago he hadnt known just how closely death was to brush against him but this time it almost had almost annie was alive though she might lose the use of her legs or even everything from the chest down tracy was alive though her life was in danger he was in no mood for memento mori banks took his smaller carryon into the bathroom where he unpacked his regulation plastic bag of toiletries before settling down in the living room then he took out the bottle of tenyearold cask strength laphroaig all dutifully sealed and stamped that he had bought at the san francisco airport duty free he hadnt been certain when he bought it that he would want to drink it himself but the little taste burgess had given him at heathrow had gone down very well indeed after he had poured himself a small measure into a glass he found in the kitchen banks opened the living room curtains and lifted the window a few inches to let in some air the room had a magnificent view north from the thin ribbon of gratly beck glittering in the moonlight past helmthorpe church with its square tower and odd turret attached then beyond the lights of the small market town to the opposite daleside peaking in the magnificent limestone curve of crow scar above the high pastures and drystone walls still visible white as bone in the silvery moonlight banks carried a portable docking station to play his ipod in hotel rooms and now he took it out and plugged it in the sound wasnt great but it was impressive enough coming from a unit the size of a paperback he docked his ipod selected norma watersons solo album and turned out the overhead light as that beautifully forlorn voice started singing black muddy river one of his favorite lateperiod grateful dead songs he sat down and put his feet up sipped laphroaig looked out toward crow scar and luxuriated in the music when he closed his eyes the backs of his eyelids seemed to fragment in discs and chips of bright shifting colors like a kaleidoscope he rubbed them but it only made them worse he sipped some more whiskey and tried to keep his eyes open it was about three oclock and he didnt think much was likely to happen until morning he felt so impotent unable to do anything for tracy and he agonized again over getting in touch with her mother his parents or brian if anything happened to her theyd never forgive him but if she came out of it as he hoped she would then they need never know her name hadnt been mentioned in the media yet norma waterson sang about how god loves a drunk and banks continued to follow the drift of his thoughts he didnt know if he even wanted to try to sleep or not it had been so long he feared that if he did drop off he might not hear the phone which sat on the chair arm beside him might never wake again it seemed ages since he had woken up in teresas bed at the monaco in san francisco surely it couldnt be only two days ago she would be back to her life in boston now and their encounter would start slipping slowly but surely from her memory the way such things do without further contact the flesh forgets when banks finally became aware of the mobile playing the opening notes of bachs brandenburg concerto no norma waterson had long finished and an earlymorning mist was rising from the valley in wraiths around the church tower like willothewisps slithering up the opposite daleside above crow scar the indigo sky was tinted with the rosy hues of dawn he awoke with a start from a dream that scuttled away into the dark recesses of his mind like some lightshy insect but left him feeling unsettled and edgy reaching for the phone he almost knocked it off the arm to the floor but he managed to hold on and flip the case banks he mumbled its winsome sorry for waking you but theres been developments madame gervaise wants you to come in now shall i drive over and pick you up please said banks tracy no no its not tracy or annie but it is important i cant tell you any more right now informations still coming in ill be there in twenty minutes ill be ready banks closed the mobile and ran his hand over the stubble on his chin twenty minutes just about gave him time for a quick shower and a shave which might help make him feel more human hed brush his teeth too he could still taste the laphroaig as he moved toward the bathroom he wondered what gervaise could be in such a tizzy about over two hundred and fifty miles away and not much more than an hour earlier commander richard burgess dirty dick to his friends was equally discombobulated when his phone rang at an ungodly hour of the morning and the officer commanding the stakeout team watching justin peverells house requested his urgent presence there the cheap lager burgess had been drinking earlier down the pub had turned his stomach sour and it rose up in a loud and tasty belch when he stood up he glanced back at the bed to make sure hed been sleeping alone that night he had been then he pulled on yesterdays clothes helped himself to three paracetamol two rennies and a large glass of water fizzing with alka seltzer grabbed a can of coke from the fridge and headed out to the garage if he had no time for coffee in a morning he always found that coke gave him the caffeine jolt he needed to get his brain into gear these days his body tended to lag a bit behind but his work was rarely physically demanding getting up early was usually the hardest part of his day the traffic around the canary wharf wasnt too bad in the predawn light and he was heading northwest driving through the fringes of limehouse and bethnal green then through hoxton and holloway in no time his destination was just off highgate hill past junction road and all in all it took him a little over half an hour the house they had commandeered for surveillance was on the opposite side of the street to justin peverells semi a few houses down luxury surveillance was one of the perks of burgesss new position which mostly involved counterterrorism and not shutting down a valuable peopletrafficking network for the sake of an old friends daughter not for him a shitty old subaru littered with mcdonalds wrappers and a plastic cup to piss in that national security was at stake was all they had to say these days that covered a multitude of sins and opened a multitude of doors including this one they had packed the occupiers off to a cheap hotel for the night moved in and made themselves at home according to ds colin linwood the surveillance team leader the owners couldnt get away quick enough visions in their minds of wildeyed barbarians aiming portable missile shooters so whats so bloody important you have to wake me up before dawn burgess demanded of linwood as he stormed into the house theyve gone boss linwood said burgess scratched his head whos gone where french and brody sir quipped dc jones who was now in burgesss mind about to remain a dc for an unusually long time ciaran and darren that is hang on said burgess let me get this straight i put you bozos on surveillance and the first thing you tell me is that the men were waiting to see arrive have left am i even close they must have been already inside said linwood there was no way we could have known geez i would never have thought of that burgess flopped on the armchair and swigged some coke fancy a coffee sir said jones theyve got one of those fancy bodum things and some of that nice fairtrade colombian might as well said burgess putting the coke can down on a smooth polished table where it made a sticky ring black two sugars and strong jones disappeared into the kitchen so what time did you lot arrive burgess asked linwood remind me eleven fiftyfour pm and ciaran and darren left when three thirtysix am thats a bloody long time you sure you couldnt have missed them going in no way boss weve even got a man watching the back he smiled not quite as comfortable as we are in here but someones got to get the short end of the stick anyway like i said they must have been already in the house when we arrived which means that their man in yorkshire tipped them off as to where to find peverell well before we did our little favor for our colleagues up north well boss said linwood in all honesty theyre pretty lucky we did it at all given the circumstances so they were in there for over four hours looks that way and you didnt clock anyone else coming or going no way jones came back with the bodum and cups on a silver tray well just let it brew a few minutes sir huh where did they go from here burgess asked ferguson and wilkes followed them to a hotel on the old compton road midrange nothing too ostentatious lot of tourists americans mostly i dont need the pedigree of the fucking hotel said burgess i hope fergie and wilkes are sitting tight they are boss nobodys going anywhere without us knowing jones poured the coffee and they all took grateful sips well done lad said burgess terrific coffee well make a detective of you yet the way i see it is like this brody and french were in there an awfully long time either peverell wasnt in and they were waiting for him or he was in and they worked him over got what they wanted something like that either way soon as weve finished our coffee wed better get over there and suss out the situation it might be an ambulance job boss said linwood if they were in there that long maybe we should go in right away after dc jones has taken the trouble to make us this wonderful coffee peverell is a scumbag who helps smuggle in underage girls forced into prostitution said burgess ever fond of the crude american slang he picked up from tv and movies letting him bleed a few minutes longer wont do anything but good for the human gene pool its brody and french wholl lead us to mccready and the dcis daughter now so they finished their coffee in peace as the light grew slowly outside a wearylooking shift worker got out of his car a few houses down it was still a dull overcast morning and bedroom lights started going on as people got up to get ready for work this was a decent neighborhood burgess thought people had worked hard for their little piece of england and while they werent rich they were mostly comfortable in their middle age despite the recent credit crunch perfect protective coloration for a smooth operator like justin peverell not that hed be home all that often anyway in his line of work but if peverell was expecting mccready and more to the point expecting handsome payment for forged documents then there was every chance he would have thought it worthwhile hanging around for a day or two okay said burgess putting down his empty coffee cup and getting to his feet lets go you got the dooropener col in the boot first they picked up the batteringram on their way they wouldnt use it unless they had to a quiet entry being far more desirable than waking up the entire street then they would have to send for reinforcements just to keep the neighbors back if anything went awry as things so often did when burgess was around the door was maroon with pebbleglass windows at the top first burgess knocked gently and rang the doorbell nothing happened he glanced over at linwood who shrugged then tried the handle the door opened the three of them paused a moment on the threshold then entered they found themselves in the hall with hooks for coats and a mat for shoes burgess calculated that the living room was off to the right through another door the front curtains had been drawn so they hadnt been able to see inside from the street burgess went in first and switched on the overhead light he stood transfixed and appalled for a split second then he turned and stumbled into linwood and jones before he doubled up and vomited up last nights curry and lager all over the hall mat the other two held on to him as he gasped for air and cursed it was the first time he had ever been sick on the job since hed been a cadet and he had seen some things in his time when burgess had regained his equilibrium helped by a glass of water jones brought from the kitchen at the back he took a deep breath and led them in the scene was so posed so markedly surreal that it took everyone a few moments to put the pieces together and work out exactly what they were looking at then jones and linwood staggered back handkerchiefs over their mouths the smell was awful piss shit and fear desecrating a nice uppermiddleclass london semi two hardbacked chairs the kind that had probably been at the dining table faced each other about eight feet apart in one chair sat what had once been a very beautiful woman probably peverells girlfriend martina burgess guessed long black hair trailing over her pale naked shoulders naked as the rest of her as far as he could see from what burgess could make out on a preliminary examination it had taken her a long time to die and it had been a very painful process gray duct tape covered her mouth and bound her hands to the chair behind her back one ankle to each front leg it was hard to say exactly what had killed her there were cuts and areas where the skin had been stripped or peeled from her flesh blood between her legs on her left hand her index and middle fingers had been docked at the first joint the flesh peeled off and the bone sharpened like a pencil point one eye was wide open dead and staring but the other socket contained only the raw remains of an eyeball a viscous trail streaked down her cheek like bloody unset blobs of egg white there was more much more things the likes of which burgess had never imagined before and would remember till the day they put his body in the ground he was crying he knew but he couldnt help it such beauty such pain and horror linwood and jones werent in any condition to notice his tears anyway in the other chair sat peverell fully clothed also gagged and secured with gray duct tape at first glance he seemed dead too nobody home behind the glazed eyes but burgess noticed that when he looked carefully he could see peverells chest rising and falling there wasnt a mark on him but if burgess had to choose he couldnt for the life of him decide in which position he would rather be right he said turning to his men stop staring at her tits jonesey get on to fergie and wilkes and tell them to bring french and brody back here right now back here got it i want a word with those bastards before we have to get the brass and the lawyers involved and col the socos will have our balls for this but get a sheet from upstairs and cover the poor cow up would you then somebody see if they cant find a bottle of decent whiskey in the place tracy awoke with a start jaff shaking her shoulder and realized that she must have dozed off in the early dawn light perhaps jaff had too but now he was wide awake fully dressed and looming over her fiddling with the ripped sheet to untie her come on wake up he said wake up its time to go tracy opened her eyes and moved her head groggily jaff was fresh out of the shower but she hadnt heard a thing the curtains were open and she could see people already at their desks in the office tower she gathered the sheet around her and headed for the bathroom what time is it she asked eight oclock get a move on youve got ten minutes tracy showered as fast as she could there was no time to do anything with her hair except give it a quick rub with the towel luckily it was short and it would dry quickly she wished she had more clean underwear but she was wearing the last of her new pairs of knickers the best she could do was turn them inside out before she put them on she binned her bra she had always thought her breasts were too small anyway so she really didnt need one the outer clothes she had put on last night in the van were still fine before she could even finish brushing her teeth jaff was standing at the door you ready yet coming tracy said coming she glanced desperately around the small bathroom for an escape hatch or a weapon of some sort there was nothing it would be no use anyway as jaff hadnt allowed her to lock or even to close the bathroom door resignedly she rinsed out her mouth and went back into the room jaff was just finishing off a line of coke probably not his first of the day everything went smoothly at checkout there was a different girl at the desk this morning a tanned brunette but the smile was the same the flirtatious body language when he had finished jaff strode over to tracy with that cocky confident walk of his holdall still in his hand and nodded toward the door she left with him tracy had expected that they would take a taxi to the garage but jaff clearly had other ideas taxis could be traced he explained when she asked and taxi drivers could be questioned caution or paranoia seemed to be his natural state of mind now they walked all the way to the corn exchange among the hordes of city workers dashing to their little hutches for the day how tracy wished she were one of them everything seemed so normal yet so completely unreal at one point tracy realized that she wasnt too far from waterstones where she worked and she wondered if she should make a dash for it then she remembered the things jaff had said the threats of retribution he had made and she believed them she couldnt live her life like that always feeling scared in fear always looking over her shoulder she had to go through with this right to the end whatever that end might be they caught a bus to harehills and jaff sat silently all the way tapping his fingers on his knee and gazing out of the window soon they would be in a new car racing down to london where jaff would get his new identity sell his wares pack enough cash to start somewhere else and disappear tracy didnt believe he would sell her into slavery and she still couldnt believe that he would just kill her in cold blood despite the evidence of his violence she had witnessed with any luck once he got where he was going and got what he wanted he would simply lose interest in her dump her and forget all about her she hoped next stop said jaff and they walked to the front she could see him scanning the faces of the other passengers processing them they got off at roundhay road and harehills lane then turned a few corners its down here said jaff finally turning left the small garage was sandwiched between a sewingmachine repair shop and an asian music imports emporium from which some very odd sounds indeed were drifting out into the air tracy couldnt even recognize what instruments were being played next to the music shop was a greasy spoon with plastic chairs and tables dead flies lay scattered on the inside window ledge and the mingled smells of cumin and coriander wafted through the door tracy liked curry but she didnt fancy it for breakfast on the opposite side of the street stood a closed school a latenineteenth or earlytwentiethcentury building tracy could tell which was due for demolition there were so many of them in leeds the old redbrick kind darkened by years of industrial soot like the houses around them surrounded by high pointed metal railings embedded in a low concrete wall weeds already growing through the cracked tarmac playground some of the windows were boarded up others simply broken and a liberal sprinkling of graffiti adorned both the boarding and the red brick a faded sign read harehills park tracy couldnt see any park the place gave her the shivers a few yards past the school was a redbrick mosque tracy was so busy looking at the school and the mosque that at first she didnt notice what had happened until she heard jaff kicking at the garage door and yelling for someone to open up then she saw the going out of the business sign half covered with pasted bills and graffiti theyre gone jaff she said theres nobody here jaff turned on her i can bloody well see that for myself why dont you stop stating the obvious and contribute something here like what like some ideas you seem to be forgetting im not in this with you im not here to help you im your hostage whatever were in were in it together make no mistake about that your fate depends on mine so a little contribution wouldnt go amiss ive already told you what i think let me go and you take off alone then youll have a chance jaff shook his head no no way im letting go of my greatest asset oh really i thought that was your gun guns are just tools youre a bargaining chip he paused goddamn thats it what is you ive been holding you in reserve all this time and now its time to use you of course what a bloody idiot ive been what do you mean youre scaring me jaff pulled out his mobile whats your fathers number his mobile not the fucking police station my father his mobile number now numbly tracy told him she could see his hand shaking as he keyed in the numbers and mumbled to himself then he put the phone to his ear are you alone this wasnt the usual opening of a telephone conversation and it alerted banks to possible danger yes he lied though he didnt recognize the voice he was actually in the boardroom of western area headquarters with gervaise winsome geraldine masterson harry potter and stefan nowak discussing the fate of justin peverell and his dead girlfriend martina varakova burgess had just reported from the highgate house again and ciaran and darren had finally been taken from their hotel in an ambulance under police guard ciaran had apparently broken his arm in two places while trying to escape police custody as well as sustaining other minor cuts and bruises including one groin injury that might impair his sexual performance for some years to come neither had given up the farmer but banks planned on paying the bastard another visit soon anyway now he had a little more ammunition up his sleeve and if they let burgess into the interview room down south anything could happen banks had never heard him sound so upset and enraged he excused himself from the conversation and went out into the corridor right said the voice on the phone ive got a job for you and you are never mind that heres someone you might recognize there was a brief pause during which banks could have sworn he heard sitar music in the background then a girls voice came on dad its me tracy please do what he says if you dont hell tracy are you all right but before she could reply the other voice came back on again jaffs voice banks now knew shes fine he said and if you want her to stay that way youll listen carefully to what i have to say were in leeds in harehills outside a closeddown garage opposite a boardedup school called harehills park got that leeds harehills park yes if you so much as lay a finger on her i know i know youll kill me how long will it take you to get here about an hour bollocks said jaff forty fortyfive minutes max but ill give you one hour not a minute more well be watching for you dont talk to anyone dont even think of bringing a friend or arranging a welcome party believe me if i see any signs of police activity in the area your daughter gets it understand i understand said banks what do you want from me ill tell you that when you get here youre wasting time get going and the connection broke banks popped quickly back into the boardroom and said that one of his informants had called and he had to go out for a while gervaise nodded and everyone got back to the conversation for a moment he was in two minds whether to tell gervaise the truth as he knew he should and let her organize the cavalry but he also knew from experience what the red tape was like the necessary levels of approval documents in triplicate he also had the recent example of the patrick doyle fiasco if he needed any concrete reminder of what could go wrong his daughters life was at stake this time he remembered jaffs warning and believed it he grabbed his jacket from the back of the chair dashed down the stairs and out back he had no trouble signing a car out of the pool it was just after nine oclock in the morning and what passed for rush hour in eastvale was already beginning to abate by the time he had negotiated the oneway streets and joined york road the weather was fine the traffic running smoothly and he made it to the leeds ringroad in about forty minutes he didnt even put any music on he didnt want any distractions he needed a plan needed to think banks knew the general harehills area but not the back streets and it was one of those rare occasions when the satnav actually proved its worth this time he didnt end up facing a brick wall while being told he had arrived at his destination nor was he in guiseborough when he had set the thing for northallerton the boardedup school came into view on his right about a hundred feet ahead as he turned into the street and opposite it stood the outofbusiness garage and a greasy spoon it was an odd place to arrange a meeting and banks guessed that jaff had come to the area looking for something he had expected but hadnt found the garage was the most obvious clue if it came to it he could find the owners name and see if he had any links to mccready or fanthorpe for now though he wanted to see for himself that tracy was unharmed banks came to a halt outside the garage as instructed he scanned the street in both directions but saw nothing out of place a few men in traditional costume coming in or out of the mosque a couple of women in black burkas chatting as they walked down the street carrying their shopping a normal day in a normal street there were plenty of parked cars facing all directions and most of them were in need of rust treatment and a new tire here and there but nothing stood out a silver honda hatchback had pulled into the street after banks and parked on the other side behind a yellow fiesta with a dented door but a youth in a dark blue hoodie and black tracksuit bottoms got out and went into the sewingmachine repair shop without so much as glancing in bankss direction in his rearview mirror banks saw two figures emerge from the greasy spoon huddled close together like lovers one of them carrying a bulky holdall the other a leather shoulder bag the slighter one was tracy and his heart lurched in his chest at the sight of her they got in the back door of his car and the voice from the telephone said drive banks drove give me your mobile jaff said when they were on the main road banks took it out of his pocket and passed it back he noticed jaff switch it off he was a tall goodlooking kid with long eyelashes a burnished gold complexion and big brown eyes banks could see why women found him attractive tracy sat huddled as far away from him as she could get at the far edge of the seat hunched in on herself pale and frightenedlooking banks wanted to tell her it was all right daddy was here everything would be fine but he couldnt force out the words in jaffs presence it had to be enough for him just to know that she was still alive and apparently unharmed seeing her like this reminded him of the time she was twelve and finally confessed to him in tears that one of the girls at school had been bullying her and extorting her dinner money from her banks wanted to hug her as he had then and make all her pain go away were heading for london jaff said i suppose you know the way banks nodded he also knew there was no point in going to london that martina varakova was dead and justin peverells reason had taken a hike maybe forever and the fake documents were in the hands of the metropolitan police but he wasnt about to tell jaff that everything depended on jaff believing he was on his way to freedom whereabouts kings cross you can drop us there and ill let her go in half an hour banks didnt like the sound of that but now was far too early to negotiate by the time they got to kings cross the balance of power might have shifted a little in his favor they were probably not meeting at the highgate house banks thought that was why ciaran and darren had left after they had finished with justin and martina they were going to lie in wait for jaff and tracy but they hadnt said where youve been causing us quite a bit of trouble jaff he said without turning his head its mr mccready to you and youve only got yourselves to blame for that live and let live thats what i say that what you said to annie when you shot her a sly smile spread over jaffs face she your girl was she i know its a waste a tasty morsel like that but needs must just drive im not in the mood for conversation are you okay tracy are you comf i said just drive banks felt a hard metallic circle push against the back of his neck and he knew it was the baikals silencer shooting me right now wouldnt be a great idea he said thats just to let you know that im still in charge besides i could shoot her not you maybe just in the leg or something or the gut i said just shut up and drive and dont draw attention to us by your driving or youll regret it banks drove east to the ring road then turned right and followed it down through seacroft killingbeck and cross gates to the m at selby road he knew that he would show up on dozens of cctv cameras but that no one would take the slightest bit of notice because his papers were all in order the car wasnt stolen and he wasnt a wanted man unless someone flagged him as a stray and questioned western area as to where he was going which wasnt very likely the police drove all over the place in unmarked cars all the time put some music on said jaff whats to your taste got any beatles i do yeah well i cant stand them what about some jazz banks didnt often listen to jazz when he was driving but he had plenty on his ipod anything in particular kind of blue no problem one of my mothers boyfriends in mumbai used to play kind of blue all the time jaff said so softly he might have been speaking to himself every time i saw him i used to say play miles for me play miles for me my mother had a lot of boyfriends i learned all sorts of things from them then he lapsed into silence as bill evanss piano intro to so what started up followed by the bass and soon the music filled the car miless trumpet coltranes tenorit was surreal banks thought here he was hurtling toward the m and only god knew what fate a desperate man with a gun holding him and his daughter hostage and one of his favorite jazz albums of all time blasting out of the speakers not a word was spoken banks chipped away at the edge of the speed limit but never went so much beyond it that he would raise any unwanted interest occasionally he would look in the rearview mirror and see tracy sucking her thumb with her eyes closed as she did when she was a little child clearly not asleep the tension still tight around her mouth eyelids twitching now and again jaff was just staring out of the window looking grim it wasnt until they had passed sheffield that banks became certain the silver honda hatchback he had seen in harehills was the same one that had been keeping a respectable distance behind him all the way down the motorway and when he came to think of it though he didnt want to appear prejudiced at all it had seemed odd at the time that a person dressed in a hoodie and a tracksuit bottom had gone into a sewingmachine repair shop in the first place detective superintendent catherine gervaise took off her reading glasses and rubbed her eyes it was years since she had stopped up practically all night catching only a quick nap in her office between two and three and she felt exhausted naps were all very well but these days they often left her more tired than before while she was proud of her origins as a street copper before she made the fast track and she liked to let people know that shed done many of the tough jobs they complained to her about she had to admit that for the most part shed been on training courses studying for a university degree sitting exams transferring back and forth to uniform and for the most part she had become an administrator rather than a working detective now her eyes were sore her brain slow and her body felt weak she just wanted to go home to bed but she had important decisions to make gervaise sipped the strong coffee that winsome jackman had brought her but it didnt seem to do much good now they were well into the morning her tiredness was beyond coffee still at least the taste and warmth of the dark liquid kept her at subsistence level consciousness though she still felt like one of those zombies out of the movies her son liked to watch so much winsome sat opposite her at the other side of the large desk she seemed fine gervaise thought but then she was twenty years younger and far more used to the hours ive just had dirty dicki mean commander burgesson the phone maam said winsome my my you two are getting familiar be careful that man sounds like a walking toxic waste dump to me gervaise said what did he say still nothing from the two suspects about the farmers involvement well im not surprised said gervaise winsome smiled but the one thing they did give uprather darren brody gave upwas the location for the meet justin peverell with jaff and tracy yes hampstead heath near highgate ponds gervaise thought for a moment that means mccreadys probably still on his way and he was being extra careful just in case someone had located peverells house but he cant have bargained for what actually happened no im sure he doesnt know or hed be heading as fast as he could in the other direction maybe he is gervaise shook her head i dont know winsome what the hell are we to do commander burgess suggested organizing an armed reception committee for mccready at the heath gervaise snorted he would what about tracy banks he said he thought he could keep it lowkey enough that mccready wouldnt spot what was happening until they were on him i doubt it we know how easily these things go pearshaped wheres dci banks anyway hes been gone ages i dont know said winsome hes not around here thats for certain gervaise frowned where did he say he was going to meet with an informant i think i dont really know where we were all so busy talking about what had happened to justin peverell and his poor girlfriend gervaise checked her watch whatever it was it shouldnt have taken him this long especially given his concern over tracy try his mobile winsome winsome keyed in bankss mobile number its turned off maam she said thats not like him why would he turn off his mobile at the crucial point of an investigation that involves him personally gervaise felt her brain springing to life though it was a chaotic sort of life sparks flying everywhere but none of them lighting up the bulbs they should or making the connections they were aiming for her thinking felt like a badly played game of pinball but something was definitely happening help me out here winsome whats going on i dont know said winsome unless unless what unless dci banks waslying about the informant dont sound so horrified at the thought people do sometimes for good reasons yes maam said winsome tightlipped so if alan was lying or making an excusehe did go into the corridor to take the callthen perhaps it was tracy he would certainly lie for her it could have been mccready either way he might be in trouble its mccready id be worried about said winsome hes had a lot of trouble with transport perhaps he needs dci banks to drive him to hampstead the neurons were firing a lot better now and the pinball score was racking up look said gervaise lets find out which car alan signed out from the pool and see if we can access automatic number plate recognition control find out where he is if youre right hell be on his way to london to hampstead heath and we should be able to track his progress should we alert all the motorway patrol units not yet we dont want a car chase on our hands not if alan and tracy are in one of the cars and mccready is armed lets keep it low profile for now until we know whats happened if theyre still on their way to hampstead weve got a while yet to work something out get on to burgess again too try to persuade him that softly softlys the way to go for now do you have a plan maam i wish to god i did winsome i wish to god i did banks was also desperately trying to work out a plan as he drove down the m with his silent passengers and loud music he had already figured out that jaffs mood shifts were volatile perhaps the pressure of being on the run was getting to him and he had also been snorting cocaine in the car so much had gone wrong so far that he had to be becoming increasingly worried about making it whatever plan banks came up with he knew he would have to take great care and choose his moment separating jaff from his gun was the key without it he was nothing the gun was in the holdall of that banks was certain there was something about the way jaff held it close to him all the time often thrusting one hand inside it for a while gripping something that gave him comfort and confidence that made it obvious it wouldnt be easy to get it away from him and there was no way it was going to happen if he dropped jaff and tracy off at kings cross he couldnt let that happen i need to go to the toilet it was tracy speaking up from the back banks turned the music down more miles someday my prince will come what was that love he asked well you cant jaff cut in were not stopping it wont take five minutes tracy argued i told you were not stopping what do you expect me to do piss in the car i expect you to wait i cant wait ive been crossing my legs for the past half hour i cant wait anymore theres a services coming up soon i need to go to the toilet jaffs hand dug deep inside his holdall i told tracy turned to face him what kind of a person are you what harms it going to do do you think im going to make a run for it across the car park after youve told me what youll do when youve got my dad here too do you think ill run away if youve got your gun on him what are you scared of what do you really think im going to do start shouting out that youve got a gun so you can shoot a few more innocent people for christs sake get a grip jaff i need to go to the toilet simple as that there was a short silence after tracys outburst banks held his breath admiring his daughter for her guts but uncertain about which direction it would tip jaffs erratic brain fine jaff said eventually he tapped banks on the shoulder i could do with a cup of coffee myself you heard the lady james next services banks thought furiously could this be his best opportunity how could he do it throw a cup of hot coffee in jaffs face snatch the holdall toss it to tracy take on jaff handtohand it was a possibility maybe the only one jaff stared out of the window tapping his fingers on his thighs he was working it out banks knew figuring out every angle every moment every move that could possibly go wrong for him like so many had before he would be at his edgiest his most unpredictable and dangerous from the moment they left the car as banks turned onto the slip road he looked for the silver honda hatchback in his rearview mirror but he couldnt see it maybe hed been imagining things the car park was only about half full as soon as banks had pulled into the spot jaff had chosen for him and turned off the engine he opened the door and felt the wind on his face it had just started to drizzle not so fast said jaff we need to set a few ground rules before we go anywhere banks closed the door again hurry up said tracy it hurts we stick together right jaff said francesca by my side you in front and ill have my hand on the gun the whole time so dont even think of making a break for it and both of you remember this if one of yous out of my sight the other isnt banks wanted to question jaff on whether he would really start shooting in a public car park but he didnt bother first of all tracy was desperate and banks wanted them all out of the car as quickly as possible to increase his chances of taking control of the situation secondly he suspected that at this point jaff was so wired that he probably would start shooting banks had noticed him snorting more lines of coke in the back of the car seen how twitchy he was becoming its your call said banks pulling the door handle again they all got out and started moving across the car park and the open space to the toilets and restaurant there were a few amusement machines near the entrance and a convenience store opposite next to the store were the ladies and gents toilets so how are we all going to stick together now banks asked looking at the flow of people coming in and out of the toilets dont be a clever bastard obviously we cant francesca goes in we stay here but i need to go too said banks and her name is tracy i know that i prefer francesca you can wait your turn go on francesca and no tricks dont try borrowing anyones mobile or trying to pass any messages remember what i told you your dads out here with me tracy dashed inside the ladies jaff stood close to banks with his hand inside his holdall eyes on stalks twitching in all directions youre not going to get away with this you know banks said casually trying to discover just how far he could push jaff what do you know you could stop it now it would count for you in court rubbish i shot a copper but you didnt kill her i cant do time in prison id never survive theres no way around that so we just do as i say he glanced at his watch shes taking a long time shes a woman said banks jaff actually laughed it was a slightly mad laugh and one or two passersby glanced curiously at him luckily tracy came out immediately after the comment and jaff gave her instructions to wait exactly where she was while he and banks went when they came out she was still there rooted to the spot so far so good said jaff lets get something to eat they went upstairs to the takeaway section and bought coffee and sandwiches which jaff directed banks to carry no doubt so he could keep a firm grip on his gun the food was in a bag which would make it more difficult for banks to remove the top from the coffee unseen and toss it in jaffs face but it was a long walk back to the car banks had had no time to talk to tracy alone to make her aware of what he might try he had to depend on her survival instinct and her quick grasp of the changing situation she would have to follow his lead slowly they walked back banks slightly ahead as he had been told jaff with his hand in his holdall tracy beside him banks didnt like walking blind to his adversarys exact position and movements but he thought he could shield the bag slightly with his body as he reached inside with his free hand and felt for the top of the coffee container he knew that some of it might splatter on tracy if jaff was sticking close to her but that couldnt be helped he would try to be as accurate as possible given the circumstances they made their way through the parked cars sometimes having to walk in single file through a narrow space getting closer and closer banks got the top off and the hot black coffee scalded his fingers he grimaced in pain but managed to avoid shouting out he must have stumbled a little though because jaff told him to turn around there werent any people nearby though banks could hear the cars whizzing by on the m and wondered if that was the last sound he would hear he turned the coffee cup in his hand spillage burning the stretched webbing between his thumb and forefinger jaff had the gun out of his holdall now and he was pointing it at tracys head as banks let go of the coffee and let the whole bag of food fall to the ground a woman shepherding her two kids back to a car about four rows away screamed jaff turned to face the direction of the sound but she had already dragged her children down behind their parked car jaff turned back to banks and pointed the gun toward him his arm around tracys neck there were more screams the sound of people running car doors slamming engines starting jaffs face contorted in anger and confusion he was losing it banks thought he was going to shoot as banks steeled himself to take the bullet the upper right quadrant of jaffs head disappeared in a reddishgray mist the gun clattered to the tarmac jaff shuddered like a marionette out of control spread his arms wide and lost his grip tracy threw herself forward into bankss arms banks dropped to his knees and held her close to his chest shielding her from the sight behind her he felt her arms around him clinging on tightly for dear life her face buried in his shoulder her little voice crying daddy daddy daddy how sorry she was through her tears there wasnt one smiling face among the six people sitting around the polished oval table in the boardroom under the equally unsmiling portraits of yorkshire wool barons in their tight waistcoats with their roast beef complexions and whiskery jowls banks was beyond tiredness now he didnt even know what time or day it was except that it wasnt dark but it was getting there it had been a long long day since the incident that morning at the motorway services tracy was out at bankss temporary accommodation sleeping under a mild sedative administered by the police surgeonat least he hoped she waswith winsome watching over her but there was dirty business to be done behind closed doors at the western area headquarters at one time banks would probably have been worried about the outcome but now he didnt care what happened he just wanted it to be over so he could get on with putting his and tracys lives back together what the hell did you think you were doing officer powell asked mike trethowan firearms cadre superintendent and neryss immediate boss using my initiative sir said nerys powell she had changed from the tracksuit bottoms and hoodie top into jeans and a crisp white blouse and black wind cheater and she was managing to put a brave face on things so far banks thought she looked scared but she had been unshakable in her conviction that she had done the right thing if she had to go down she might try to take a few of the enemy with her chambers gave a god save us all from initiative sigh all right he said why dont you just start from the beginning nerys glanced at banks who tried to keep a neutral expression on his face i overheard dci banks taking a call on his mobile sir she said when he was out in the corridor i was in one of the empty offices opposite just hanging around and waiting she gave chambers a dirty look theres been a lot of pointless hanging around with this investigation going on you never know when theyre going to call you back in to go over some minor detail again they never tell you anything anyway i couldnt hear what the person at the other end was saying but dci banks mentioned his daughters name and repeated the name of a school in harehills and he seemed nervous and furtive dci banks i mean sir he seemed upset and at one time he threatened the caller i knew that his daughter was missing and that the man suspected of abducting her was armed did you know the location of this school did it mean anything to you no but i grew up in leeds i know where harehills is yes yes we know where you grew up said chambers go on dci banks left hurriedly and i suspected he might have made someerprivate arrangements to help his daughter not that im blaming you sir she said to banks im relieved said banks dryly nerys narrowed her eyes at him as if she couldnt make up her mind whether he was acting as a friend or enemy banks wasnt too sure himself he needed to listen to all this neryss side especially before he planted his feet down firmly anywhere anyway she went on as i said i knew that jaffar mccready was armed and dci banks wasnt i also knew that dci banks wouldnt call in the fsu because of his daughter that hed want to try and settle this himself somehow try to take advantage of the situation overpower mccready if possible i thought it involved an incredible risk sir so iwell you decided to ride shotgun said trethowan nerys glanced from chambers to her boss i suppose so sir what do you mean you suppose so how else would you describe what you did well sir i was following my gut instinct taking an initiative here was an unarmed man a fellow police officer going up against someone we already knew had no qualms about pulling the trigger on a cop this wasnt anything to do with revenge for what happened to di cabbot was it officer powell trethowan asked sternly nerys blushed deep red i resent that sir whether you resent it or not isnt the issue was di cabbot on your mind at all when you went chasing after dci banks i wont say i didnt think of what mccready did to her but youve got no if your sexual feelings for annie cabbot clouded your judgment said chambers with obvious relish at the image and a hard glint in his piggy eyes then we have every right to question your actions and motives you had a crush on her didnt you ladies gentlemen said acc mclaughlin holding up his hand this line of attacking officer powell on the basis of her sexual preference will get us precisely nowhere in our unofficial adjudications and nor should it whether the officer in question had feelings for di cabbot or not isnt the issue here nor is the nature of those feelings the issue is what she did and what were going to do about it carry on pc powell thank you sir said nerys sufficiently chastised for the moment trethowan and chambers slumped into a sullen silence as she took a sip of water and went on i followed dci banks to harehills and there i observed his daughter tracy and jaffar mccready get into the back of his car it seemed as if mccready was clutching a gun in a holdall he was carrying but you couldnt actually see the firearm asked trethowan not at that point no sir but i knew he was very well thats all i need to know trethowan looked to chambers go on how did you know who they were chambers demanded well i didnt think he was picking up hitchhikers said nerys chambers reddened thatll be enough of that said trethowan yes sir sorry sir she glared back at chambers who was the first to avert his gaze did you have any idea at this point what you were going to do asked detective superintendent gervaise had a plan of any kind formed in your mind no maam all i knew was that mccready was armed that hed shot anndi cabbotand that he had dci banks and his daughter hostage and wouldnt it have made perfect sense right then and there to call me said trethowan or someone in authority there are procedures to be followed you know protocol why didnt you call me or superintendent gervaise with your suspicions about dci bankss course of action i know i should have done sir said nerys and i have no excuse but sometimes you just have to think on your feet and think fast in my judgment there wasnt time for protocol for getting the necessary wheels in motion i didnt have my mobile for a start and i would have lost them if id stopped to fill in all the necessary forms calling in the cavalry would have alerted mccready that we were on to him i considered him armed and dangerous and the last thing he needed was to feel that he was surrounded by armed police there was always a chance that drugs were involved too they tend to make people jittery and unpredictable as turned out to be the case hed been snorting cocaine on the journey said banks so you discharged your weapon in a public parking lot said trethowan ignoring banks a motorway service station risking injury to god knows how many innocent men women and children i targeted jaffar mccready sir im a good shot the best in the unit you know i am and my weapon is accurate up to nearly a thousand yards i was only three hundred yards away at most and after you hit your target did you have any idea where the bullet would end up chambers asked i was at the top of a hill from the angle of my shot sir i judged it would lodge itself in the body of the car behind mccready which it did do you want to charge me with damaging private property too now sir ill see if my insurance will cover it trethowan thumped the table ive told you officer powell thats enough of your bloody insolence this is a very serious matter your careers on the line youre not doing yourself any favors sarcasm wont get you anywhere not with me and not with superintendents chambers or gervaise or acc mclaughlin and were the ones holding your fate in the balance remember that one more remark like that and ill have you on disciplinary charges no matter what the outcome here this afternoon do you understand yes sir nerys mumbled head down what happened when you got to the services car park gervaise asked pouring oil on troubled waters i parked my car maam id checked out the surrounding area as best i could on my way in and there was a slope just across the slip road i could lie down just behind there unseen and get a direct line on dci bankss car and a good line of shot if it came to that i wasnt planning on shooting anyone i didnt want to alarm the public so thats where you went asked chambers the grassy knoll he beamed at his little joke but everyone else ignored it nerys bit her lip yes sir with the intent of shooting jaffar mccready as soon as you thought you had a clear shot with the intention of protecting the lives of dci banks and his daughter sir should the dci make any foolish or desperate moves i could tell mccready was wired when they first got out of the car banks raised his eyebrows im not saying that making foolish moves isnt entirely out of character for dci banks said chambers with a selfsatisfied grin but how could you know that he would do such a thing in this instance i didnt not for certain but i would have done if i were him it was his best chance at mccready out in the open if he was going to try anything i calculated that would be his opportunity with other people around his daughters a person too sir so is dci banks himself im quite aware of that said chambers lets move on gervaise interjected chambers seemed exasperated but he went on are you saying you knew dci banks was doomed to failure if he acted nerys shrugged i knew there was a possibility of failure and that mccready had a gun he wasnt afraid to use i just wanted to be prepared thats all to give the dci an added advantage i suppose now youre going to tell us that it all happened so fast you dont remember the details that youre not responsible for your actions said chambers on the contrary sir time slowed right down i knew exactly what i was doing i took my time pulling the trigger squeezed it slowly making certain of the accuracy of my shot and i take full responsibility for my actions i stand by them that reduced chambers to a reluctant silence and gervaise gently picked up the slack tell us what happened they were walking back to the car the three of them dci banks was in front and i could see him fiddling inside the food bag i couldnt know at the time exactly what he was doing of course but it seemed suspicious like he was preparing to do something and it would certainly look suspicious from behind to mccready who was already acting jumpy as hell so you saw dci banks fiddling with the paper bag gervaise went on yes and what did you do next nothing maam i watched and waited through the sights of your gun asked chambers through my scope yes the snipers rifle you just happened to be carrying with you he glanced down at his notes a parkerhale m if im not mistaken not exactly standard issue where did you get it it was my fathers sir i keep it locked in a special compartment in the boot of my car i practice with it sometimes in my opinion the park is that where youre supposed to keep your weapon officer powell asked trethowan in the boot of your car like some american redneck nerys turned away no sir the firearms cadre has proper storage facilities as do our transport vehicles but carry on said trethowan well deal with that infraction later nerys swallowed again as if her mouth was dry she still had a glass of water in front of her banks noticed but this time she didnt touch it she probably didnt want them to see her hand shaking i was watching them walk toward the car dci banks pulled a face and flinched i thought maybe hed burned himself or something that gave me an idea of what he might be about to try and asked gervaise nerys looked directly at banks her gaze was unnerving in my opinion he wouldnt have succeeded maam his awkward movements had already alerted mccready that something was going on dci banks was going to try and throw hot coffee in his face but he must have burned himself getting the lid off and he flinched mccready noticed knew something was wrong is this true alan asked gervaise banks nodded what did mccready do then gervaise asked nerys he took the gunthe baikal with the silencerout of his holdall hed had it in his hand all the time they were walking but now he pulled it out into full view one or two of the people around them in the car park noticed and screamed i could see that if it went on like that there was going to be a panic and that would only make mccready more volatile but at that moment there werent many people in that particular area certainly nobody really close where did mccready point the gun first he pointed it at tracy banks at her head i surmised that he was threatening her father that he would shoot her if he tried anything and then mccready was edgy maam erratic in his behavior he said something to dci banks and then pointed the gun directly at him by this time dci banks had turned around yes he was facing mccready who was using tracy as a shield and how did you respond chambers cut in i shot mccready sir nerys said dispassionately in the head it was the best shot i could get luckily he was quite a bit taller than dci bankss daughter you killed him chambers said yes sir a head shot is usually she noticed the storm brewing on trethowans face then turned back to chambers yes sir then you fled the scene then i returned to western area headquarters i handed over my weapon to detective superintendent gervaise told her what happened and you know the rest why didnt you remain at the scene gervaise asked there seemed no point mccready was dead dci banks and his daughter were safe the services would be swarming with police in no time at all and you might have found it rather difficult to explain yourself suggested chambers yes ill admit that crossed my mind too and if other armed officers arrived on the scene my presence could have caused a serious danger to the public how publicspirited of you said chambers do you know how long those officers spent questioning people looking for clues to the identity of the shooter do you want to add leaving the scene of the crime to the list of charges against me nerys said trethowan just shook his head chambers spluttered and tossed his pencil down i told you this would be a waste of time catherine he said to gervaise she needs to be suspended from duty right now without pay and we need to bring in an outside team ill be the judge of that said mclaughlin i dont think it was a waste of time reg said trethowan officer powells cheap repartee aside not when one of my officers is involved in a serious incident such as this and not if we can contain the fallout nor do i for what its worth said banks speaking up with a contemptuous glance toward chambers i dont think it was a waste of time at all one thing you all seem to be forgetting in all this mudslinging is that officer powell here saved my life and my daughters its a long time since ive been here said tracy the following lunchtime in the queens arms banks studied the drab decor the red plush on the benches was worn the stuffing coming out here and there the dimpled copper tables were wobbly and the wallpaper was peeling in places where it reached the ceiling the whole place could do with a lick of paint too still it was familiar and it was comfortable and those were qualities banks felt that both he and tracy needed right now it was also still hanging on when so many pubs were closing down for good and the food wasnt bad tracy picked at her chicken and chips in a basket and banks tucked into his giant yorkshire pudding stuffed with roast beef and smothered in onion gravy he had slept on his living room couch at the rented flat the previous night and let tracy have the bed but he hadnt slept well the jet lag was still with him and he kept experiencing waves of tiredness and dizziness at the oddest of times but he could live with that it wasnt so much different from when hed had to work shifts its a while since ive been here too said banks between mouthfuls he sipped his black sheep bitter the queens arms wasnt overly busy for the time of day and their table by the window was a little island unto itself sunshine filtered through the red and blue diamonds of stained glass a couple of young lads were playing the noisy machines in the passage to the gents and the usual oldies played on the radio or whatever it was cyril had rigged up as his source of music instead of the old jukebox substitute by the who was playing at the moment i understand you called yourself francesca banks said tracy blushed and stared down at her plate that was silly im sorry we never gave you a middle name im sorry for that banks smiled we couldnt afford one for you at the time tracy laughed and he saw an image of the daughter he knew and loved behind the attitude and the new look not that he cared how she did her hair or dressed as long as she was happy but she hadnt been happy that was becoming apparent enough i dont have one either he went on when i was young i called myself davy after davy crockett i must have seen the alamo a hundred times you didnt i did you know banks went on glancing at her sideways as he cut off some more beef and yorkshire pudding it doesnt really matter about your exams i mean i know youre disappointed and i cant do anything about that but you dont have to feel you let me or your mother down you worked so hard were proud of you i honestly didnt know you were beating yourself up so much about the results but you expected so much more tracy said me too and i do feel as if ive let everybody down i mean look at me now telling people where they can find the latest katie price or dan brown while brian is playing to sellout crowds in nagasaki or wherever hes the big success in the family i love both of you its not a competition i tried not to favor either of you but you did didnt you i mean im not blaming you its only human nature parents cant help it people cant help it if i did it was always you i favored until brian made it big thats not true banks said i spent half my time trying to keep brian in university i wanted him to finish his degree get a real job if anything i discouraged him from making music a career if he succeeded its despite me not because of me but you had so much in common you bought him his first guitar you cant blame a man for loving music with you ii tried i just couldnt communicate so easily with you i didnt know how to reach you how to talk to you about boyfriends and girly stuff even the thought of you with a boy made my blood boil and the musici mean you liked take that and the spice girls while brian was into led zeppelin and bob dylan im sorry but it was no contest musically tracy stared at him in disbelief for a moment then she burst out laughing oh im sorry dad you do say the strangest things anyway i like the unthanks smoke fairies regina spektor and noah and the whale these days and the kings of leon thats an improvement anyway i felt awkward with you when you were growing up not daddys little girl anymore not having your mother around didnt help either but that was years ago maybe you just didnt try hard enough maybe i didnt banks scratched his scar id be the first to admit that i put my job first too much of the time and i suppose i had a few personal problems of my own too have you got a girlfriend at the moment no banks said no one he thought about teresa but she wasnt his girlfriend he probably wouldnt even see her again and he certainly wasnt going to tell his daughter about a onenight stand in san francisco he thought of the email with the attached jpeg he had received from teresa that morning the two of them standing in burritt street looking at the plaque that read on approximately this spot miles archer partner of sam spade was done in by brigid oshaughnessy what about annie annie itscomplicated why shes in love with you stop it dont be ridiculous its not as easy as that she is a woman can tell these things but youre just a girl really im twentyfour and still waiting for my latest birthday card by the way anyway lets just put it all behind us shall we start afresh thats okay with me said banks but we do need to talk i know i know and ive been dreading it ive had enough of that she pushed her basket aside you used to like it when i was just a girl tracy sipped her white wine around the same time i used to like mcdonalds and take that it was true banks realized his daughter was a young woman now and it was about time he accepted that and learned how to deal with it do you want to tell me what happened from the start tracy rested her elbows on the table i knew this was coming she said ive been dreading it she wasnt wearing any makeup today and banks thought she looked quite beautiful even the piercings beside her eyebrow and below her lip couldnt detract from it her skin was naturally pale her pink lips well defined and shapely and she had her mothers eyes the short hairstyle suited her too but then he was biased take a deep breath and plunge right in okay tracy said and inhaled but you already know most of it humor me how did you meet jaff through erin they met at that restaurant she worked in down the calls i didnt know him well at all but he sort of hung out with us sometimes at the clubs and whatever and you found him attractive hard to believe isnt it but at one time i suppose i did oh its not so hard to believe he was handsome and im sure he was charming enough said banks and he was a bad boy its quite a heady combination thats erins thing not mine he was her boyfriend did you know he was a criminal a drug dealer no way said tracy if id known any of that i would have stayed well away like i said it was just a superficial relationship at first we danced sometimes chatted about music and stuff it was just funyou knowa laugh banks sensed that tracy might be avoiding the whole issue of drugs and he didnt want to push her on it he didnt imagine for a moment that she was a total saint he assumed that like a lot of kids who go clubbing she probably took e now and then the way people smoked pot or dropped acid in his day maybe she did that too he just hoped she was careful about what she did and didnt use anything harder like coke or heroin but there was no gain in opening that route right now what changed things he asked one night he kissed me on the dance floor i know it sounds like a cue for a tacky old song and then he kissed me or something but its true and it was a bit romantic tracy blushed pity the romance didnt last she said what happened well him and erin had a blazing row right there in the club it was so embarrassing even if the music was so loud nobody could hear she called me some names then stormed off fastforward to me coming home from work a few days later and rose telling me the police had searched the house then all the stuff on the news later about mr doyle the gunpolice all over our old street slow down why did you dash over to jaff mccreadys flat immediately to tell him what had happened he was still erins boyfriend something had happened to her something was dreadfully wrong i mean i know thered been a misunderstanding a row but it was just a kiss honest i mean we didnt sleep together or anything her lower lip trembled notnot then one thing at a time banks said putting his hand on her forearm take it easy tracy held her glass up and tried to smile i could do with another one of these dutch courage banks went to the bar and got them both refills daughter said cyril the landlord nodding over in tracys direction yes that the same young lass you used to bring in here for a coke and a burger years back when you lived just down the road one and the same havent seen her for a long time shes grown up into a finelooking young lass banks looked over at her indeed she has thanks cyril he paid for the drinks and went back to the table paul jones came on singing ive been a bad bad boy these oldies were making him feel sad he had almost forgotten that one what happened when you went to jaffs flat banks asked when tracy had sipped some wine he went berserk she said he scared me first he went in his bedroom and came out just raving calling her a stupid bitch and god knows what i didnt know at the time but hed been looking for the gun she took how did you feel about that i was frightened said tracy i mean i thought he was nice but suddenly he seemed so angry so unpredictable i didnt know what he was going to do i was only the messenger what happened next he grabbed me and said we had to get out of there we yes so you were already a hostage right from the start i suppose so i dont know what he was thinking all i know is that he needed a place to go and he was taking me with him how did you end up at my cottage tracy turned away hehe made me take him there he said hed got nowhere to go and he needed to be somewhere nobody could find him for a while till things got sorted out he asked me if i knew anywhere i was really scared it was all i could think of i thought he might hurt me if i said i didnt know anywhere did you feel that you were free to leave him at this time no i dont know it all happened so fast i mean i wasnt tied up or anything but he had hold of my arm and he was hurting me i thought of your cottage i knew you were on holiday im so sorry ilook im confused youre interrogating me just like one of your suspects i dont know why it all happened the way it did i look back and it all seems like a blur a terrible nightmare all i know is that im the victim here calm down tracy banks said i know this is difficult for you tracy wiped her eyes and sipped more wine one or two people were looking over but banks ignored them the machines were still making enough noise to drown out their conversation and be my baby was playing banks kept his voice down all the same im not interrogating you he said but i have to ask these questions okay tracy nodded okay on the way out of leeds jaff stopped at victor mallorys house why to change cars jaff was worried that the police might be looking for him in his own car so you knew about the gun by then right no he didnt tell me about that until we got to your cottage otherwise i might have been more concerned about getting away he just seemed in a desperate hurry to leave leeds i thought maybeyou knowhe was worried about getting busted for drugs you said you didnt know he was a dealer i knew he had stuff from time to time just not a dealer like you mean why didnt he head straight for london because he said he needed to make some phone calls set up some deals i didnt know what he meant at the time what he was talking about but now i think he meant about selling the cokethere was a lot of itand getting a phony passport and all that he said it would take time and he needed to lie low he was on his mobile a lot but you didnt know why was he running not at that time not when we stopped at victors no did you go inside victor mallorys house with him no jaff told me to wait in the car were you restrained in any way no so you could have simply got out and walked away at this point i suppose so i wish i had now but i was confused he told me to wait he needed me to direct him to your cottage he didnt know the countryside hed never even heard of gratly but if id known whatid have got out and run as fast as i could its okay said banks im not saying you did anything wrong im just trying to get things clear thats all how long was he in there i dont know five or ten minutes fifteen at the most do you know victor tracy shrugged id met him a couple of times at the clubs he seemed okay what happened next we switched cars and drove to gratly im sorry dad sorry for leading him to the cottage i really didnt know what he was like what he would do what do you mean your cd collection you mean you dont know i havent been allowed home yet the socos have just about finished and superintendent gervaise says shell arrange to send in a clean up team after them then i can go back maybe tomorrow or the day after he made a bit of a mess thats all chucking cds around breaking some of the jewel cases spilling drinks dont worry thats not your fault how did you find out about the gun erin took we saw the news they didnt mention it specifically but someone said theyd seen the police bring out a gunshaped object wrapped in a tea cloth he knew thats what it was that it had been missing from his bedroom and erin must have taken it to get at him thats when he first told me what was going on did he tell you why he was so upset about the police having it no what did you say i didnt say anything i just asked him why he needed a gun and why erin had taken it he said that now i knew about it i should see that he couldnt let me go that i had to stay with him to the bitter end he said that yes please dad youre interrogating me again dont you believe me of course i do said banks though he was starting to have some misgivings about tracys version of events and im sorry if im making you uncomfortable i just want to get it all clear in my mind its not even clear in my mind banks sipped some black sheep i understand that thats the reason for the questions theyre supposed to focus you not make you feel as if youre being interrogated im sorry tracy twirled her glass he opened your wine drank some of the really good stuff and your whiskey thats all right banks said wondering just what sort of a mess mccready had made and what he would find missing when he got home telstar started playing it took banks right back to when he was about twelve and used to listen to alan freemans pick of the pops every sunday afternoon on a transistor in the park with his friends looking at the girls who walked by so pretty in their sunday summer dresses blushing and flirting graham marshall always used to be with them until he disappeared one sunday morning during his paper round years later banks had helped to uncover what had happened to him grahams face flashed before his minds eye as the music played they had all liked that weird organ sound on telstar tracy lowered her voice and leaned forward and he had drugs some pot cocaine a lot of it in big plastic bags kilos but he filled a little plastic bag for his own use he was taking it all the time he was crazy yes our men found it in his holdall along with about fifty thousand pounds know where that came from no he had it from the start i think from his flat at least he had the holdall and it seemed heavy i didnt take any of the coke honest i didnt dad its all right i believe you so he drank some wine drank some whiskey smoked some marijuana snorted some coke a right old kneesup by the sound of it where were you while all this was going on just sitting there watching there was nothing i could do to stop him he was much bigger and stronger than me i understand that did he rape me tracy looked directly into bankss eyes and nodded yes he did later when he found out who i was he took me upstairs to your room i tried to fight tried to resist him but it was no good he was so much stronger he threw me down on the bed and banks felt his throat constrict and his heart beat fast its all right tracy i dont need to know the details you say all this happened after he found out who you were that you were a policemans daughter yes he found a letter or something with your name and rank on it he found out you were a police detective a dci and how did he react it made him really angry at first then he said it meant i might come in even more useful than hed imagined he was still furious at me for not telling him before and he didnt like the police he became more aggressive thats when he raped me he thought it was really cool something special to do it to me in your room on your bed like he was getting at you personally or violating you in some way banks certainly felt violated and if mccready were still alive at that moment he would cheerfully have strangled him with his bare hands what happened when annie came he asked he was hiding behind the entertainment room door the gun was in his holdall in the breakfast nook he told me to get rid of her as quickly as possible or hed shoot her i tried dad i really tried but you know annie she just wouldnt stop she wouldnt give up wouldnt go she didnt know the danger she was in banks said she thought she was helping you and shes nothing if shes not persistent she knew something was wrong that i was there under duress i know she was trying to help me but she just wouldnt take no for an answer and then jaff appeared and tracy you know you probably saved annies life dont you that mobile phone call you made she was bleeding i thought she was going to die what else could i do he was so angry when he heard me phoning for an ambulance i thought he was going to kill me too then but i guess i was still too valuable to him so he crushed my mobile and after that the car broke down on the moors we were on foot on the run it was one misfortune after another i have to say if he was a master criminal he wasnt very good at it tracy managed a grim smile lucky for us banks said he glanced at his watch then over at the door want another i shouldnt tracy said im already feeling a bit tipsy coffee then thatd be good banks was just about to go and get tracy a coffee and himself another pint when the door opened and erin and juliet doyle walked in tracy gaped at erin then at banks did you arrange this dad she said i told them we might be here until about half one thats all the two girls just stared at each other for what seemed like an age then tracy got up from the table walked over to erin and threw her arms around her erin hugged her back the tourists gawked banks caught juliet doyles eyes beyond erin and tracy she just gave a curt nod banks breathed a sigh of relief he had thought tracy was going to thump erin and that erin and juliet would never speak to each other again banks could hear the strains of the adagio from beethovens moonlight sonata as françoise the au pair led him across the farmers cavernous entrance hall toward the living room whoever was playing hit a wrong note then hesitated and stumbled before picking up the melody again the family is watching television françoise explained in precise unaccented english and miss eloise is practicing for the piano examinations in the next week she opened the door and announced banks and winsome formally the uniformed officers were awaiting instructions in their cars outside banks had never seen fanthorpes wife before she was a beautiful woman a good few years younger than her husband with a figure sculpted by daily workouts long silky brown hair and a complexion that can only be achieved either through the blessings of nature or the right combination of chemical emollients she gave her husband a puzzled look the little girl with the long ponytail sitting next to her didnt take her eyes from strictly come dancing on the fortytwoinch tv screen i see ive interrupted a family tradition said banks fanthorpe got to his feet what do you want this time banks ive had just about enough of this this is too much im going to ring my solicitor maybe you can ask him to meet you at western area headquarters banks said weve got a custody suite waiting for you there the woman was on her feet too now swiftly uncurled like a cat what is this george she asked with a slight eastern european accent who are these people what are they doing in my house whats going on the farmer put the phone down and went to rest his hands on his wifes shoulders its all right zenovia just calm down love ill handle this he strode toward the door and turned to banks come on well go into the den if you like said banks following him across the hall into the room where they had talked the previous week this is an outrage said fanthorpe pouring himself a large whiskey and not even bothering to offer banks one this time he might actually have taken it its police harassment its persecution its all right all right farmer i get the message said banks lets just all sit down and have a nice quiet little chat before i bring the lads in lads the search team banks took some papers from his pocket i have here a search warrant signed by a local magistrate empowering us to conduct a full and thorough search of your premises search my house fanthorpe spluttered you cant do that you cant just we can and we will but first things first id like to let you know just how deep the shit is that youre in what are you talking about fanthorpe flopped into his leather armchair he slopped a little whiskey on the front of his cableknit jumper as he did so and dabbed at it with a handkerchief he took from the pocket of his brown cords winsome sat opposite him and took out her notebook and pen if you think im going to say anything incriminating said fanthorpe pointing his finger at her then youve got another think coming it always pays to be prepared sir said winsome dont you find what do you know about the shooting of marlon kincaid on the fifth november banks asked marlon kincaid do i look like someone whod know a person called marlon kincaid why not he was a student at leeds polytechnic university well technically hed just finished his studies but he was still hanging around the student pubs in the area the way some people do selling drugs couldnt seem to let go of the old college life what are you talking about marlon kincaid art student his dad was a big fan of marlon brando apparently which is how he got his name marlon was building quite the little business for himself selling coke and various other illegal substances to the leeds student population at parties and in the pubs and clubs so he had his own suppliers and you werent one of them i dont know what you mean you couldnt allow that could you you were well on your way to being the local drug kingpin and along comes some skinny longhaired upstart and cuts right into your market not only that but he makes fun of you and it gets back to you what did you do first warn him send ciaran and darren to administer a beating perhaps this is rubbish but you had another weapon waiting in the wings didnt you a young lad called jaffar mccready who was fast proving himself indispensable and dangerous he needed to prove himself and you needed him to do it that one final act of outrageous loyalty that binds forever you gave him a gun you loaded it for him perhaps you even showed him how to fire it and jaffar mccready shot marlon kincaid what he didnt know was that hed been seen a most unreliable witness for sure especially at the time but hes scrubbed up quite nicely since then soon to be a member of the ministry actually and his memory seems a lot clearer now especially given everything weve found out since what does any of this have to do with me what you didnt know was that for reasons of his own mccready kept the gun a trophy a souvenir call it what you will you no doubt told him to get rid of it at the time and you probably thought he had after all why would he want to keep an incriminating gun around maybe he was just sentimental his first kill or perhaps he liked the idea of having something on you whatever the reason he kept the gun then one night he had a row with his girlfriend to spite him to piss him off she took the gun and ran off went to stay with her parents in eastvale her mother found it maybe she just was cleaning up her daughters room the way mothers do or maybe she was curious wanted to see if she could find anything that would explain her daughters unusual silences her odd behavior her strange cast of mind since shed come home either way she found the gun and thats when things started to go wrong but that doesnt really matter here and now what matters is that we found a clear set of fingerprints on the magazine inside the gun those fingerprints are yours can you explain how they got there fanthorpe frowned and sipped his whiskey i dont have to you can talk to my solicitor about it i will but theres really only one way they could have got there isnt there you handled the magazine at some time so what you didnt find any of my prints on the outside of the gun did you on the trigger guard how do you know that oh very clever banks is this where i say because i wiped them off then put my hand to my mouth and admonish myself for making such a gaffe its not going to happen the fact that you found my fingerprints on the magazine inside a gun proves nothing except that at one time i touched that magazine it certainly doesnt prove that i ever fired the gun i dont need a solicitor to prove that youre fishing do you often go around handling magazines for prohibited weapons i cant say as i ever remember doing such a thing there are any number of ways it could have happened perhaps a vet used it to put down a sick animal a ninemillimeter smith and wesson automatic maybe a copper passed it over to me once and asked me what i thought pull the other one said banks and just how did you get my fingerprints for comparison in the first place ive never been fingerprinted in my life theres no way im in your system thats a terrible oversight and i promise well put the record straight as soon as possible you did however handle a photograph of jaff mccready that ds jackman passed you the last time we were here that glossy photographic paper has a wonderful sticky surface for fingerprints thats entrapment youve fitted me up dont be silly it might conceivably be entrapment if they were forged documents or a murder weapon but it was only a photograph it means nothing in itself i guarantee theyll laugh you out of court do you really because i dont think so and im very glad to hear that you agree with me that it will get to court these days the crown prosecution service is very picky about the cases it allows to go to trial they dont like losing they tend to choose dead certs well on the evidence youve got theres always a first time then theres the little matter of darren brody darren brody yes come on you know darren your farmhandcumenforcer for some reason neither darren nor ciaran was involved with the marlon kincaid killing perhaps they were on another job mucking out the stables or something or perhaps you just needed mccready to get his hands dirty a blooding like the kids first foxhunt but ciaran and darren have been doing quite a lot of overtime for you lately havent they what do you mean banks shook his head ciarans seriously deranged you should know what a liability it is to have someone like him on your payroll ciaran would never say a thing against me youre right about that ciarans a vicious psychopath who enjoys hurting people but hes loyal he probably thanks you for the opportunity he hurt justin peverells girlfriend martina varakova killed her in fact very slowly and very painfully while justin was tied up and made to watch justin is catatonic now the doctors arent holding out a lot of hope of his making a full recovery well you wouldnt after something like that would you imagine someone doing that to your lovely wife why are you telling me all this whats it all got to do with me jaffar mccready had something of yourstwo kilos of cocaine fifty thousand pounds and a hot gun to be exact we have it all now locked up safely in our evidence room fanthorpe sneered safely ill bet you wanted it all back naturally you even told me you wanted it back ds jackman here is a witness to that winsome looked up from her notebook and smiled at fanthorpe you just never told me what it was banks said but you think youve worked it out for yourself it wasnt that difficult im afraid youve come to the wrong conclusion if thats what you found then i was obviously mistaken and jaffar didnt have what i thought he had none of that belonged to me darren brody has been working with ciaran french for a few years now he knows what ciarans like has seen him getting progressively more violent and cruel its all right with him when its worked as a threat and people talk then usually go away with only a few cuts and bruises but this time it got out of hand way out of hand my guess is that ciaran had built up such a lust for bloodletting that he couldnt hold it back any longer victor mallory rose preston teasers however it happened darren was with him and darren couldnt stop him but he didnt like what he saw darrens just trying to save his own skin theyre both psychos well leave the question of why you would employ a couple of psychos aside for the moment jaffar mccready certainly wasnt one he was a greedy cocksure ambitious intelligent young man with a tendency to violence when necessary he wanted to be a player he didnt especially like killing he wasnt even particularly good at it he had so many chips on his shoulder he could have given harry ramsden a run for his money anyway the point is that darren has had enough he had to watch justins face while ciaran sliced up martina varakova in front of his eyes i doubt it was a pretty sight darrens a bit tougher than justin and he still has his faculties but a strange thing happened to him that night theyd found out what they wanted to know that justin was meeting jaffar and tracy on hampstead heath near the highgate ponds but ciaran had already gone too far to stop he couldnt because of that while darren was watching him he was suddenly struck like saul on the road to damascus with a revelation he asked himself why why was he watching this why was he participating in this true the people ciaran was hurting were a couple of toerags who didnt give a damn about peoples lives themselves but this was too much how on earth could darren ever extricate himself from his complicity in ciarans actions though those actions horrified and disgusted him and do you know what he found a way its called cooperating with the police fully in their inquiries darren talked farmer in fact he sang like the three tenors all rolled into one the complete performances box set the farmer had turned pale now and seemed to shrink in his armchair the whiskey left untouched for several minutes beside him youve still got no proof he said rallying its his word against mine and who do you think the court will believe an uneducated thug or an upstanding pillar of the community darren is no more an uneducated thug than you are a pillar of the community banks said i reckon hell make a very good impression on a jury reformed sinner and all that atonement juries love a good redemption story he knows where all the bodies are buried farmer he also told us a few places we should be looking if were after evidence of some of your shadier dealings and contacts so were executing these warrants simultaneously for this house and your business premises including the mailboxes on grand cayman and jersey winsome winsome excused herself and went to the front door where she put her fingers to her lips and whistled loudly banks had always wished he could do that within a few moments six uniformed officers entered the house and spread out ds stefan novak and ds jim hatchley were in charge of the search operation and banks said hello to both of them as he and winsome escorted fanthorpe now in handcuffs out to the car eloise was still practicing the adagio to the moonlight sonata in the piano room and zenovia was screaming and waving her arms at the search team the other young girl frowned and turned up the volume with the remote as she tried to concentrate on strictly come dancing amid the chaos all around her as they walked to the car banks looked down the cinder path with the topiary hedges toward the pond and fountain a young boy pissing he said to the farmer shaking his head that just about says it all doesnt it farmer a young boy pissing banks walked along the now familiar corridors of cook hospital early in the following week saying hello to a couple of the nurses and general staff he had come to recognize he had driven straight from newhope cottage and while he was certainly glad to be home in some ways he couldnt help dwelling on what had happened there superintendent gervaise had arranged for a cleaning crew after the socos had finished so he hadnt had to face any blood or the mess tracy had told him aboutexcept for a few damaged cds and broken jewel casesbut he knew where annie had been shot and he couldnt sit comfortably in the conservatory anymore maybe he would get over it if not he would have to move he couldnt go on living there feeling the way he did newhope used to be a joyous place but since the fire and now this banks was beginning to wonder he found annie propped up on her pillows fewer tubes than on his last visit he was certain and looking a lot better she was flipping through the pages of one the sunday newspaper supplements a bit dated isnt it said banks pecking her on the cheek and sitting in the chair beside the bed its about all i could scrounge since ive been alert enough to read annie said well this is your lucky day banks opened the large holdall he had brought with him and passed over a wh smiths bag full of womens magazines he had seen her reading in the past along with the latest kate mosse and santa montefiore paperbacks these should keep you busy for a while thank you annie said searching through the bag thats great i thought i was going to end up being bored to death its still a bit hard reading with only one hand though for when your arm gets tired banks added reaching into his pocket theres this but its your ipod i got a new one in san francisco this ones nearly full im sure youll find some music you like theres quite a bit of classical and theres a few books on it too mostly classicsjane austen chekhovs short stories trollope tolstoy the brontësand some nonfiction history and biography itll help pass the time he glanced around furtively then stuck his hand inside the holdall again and brought out a bottle of australian red wine i know you prefer white he said and the review of the santa montefiore book suggested it would go well with chilled prosecco but i dont think theyd exactly put it on ice for you here ive seen you drink red and the screw top seemed important its no longer a mark of poor quality you know this is good stuff i know said annie ive had it before and its perfect put it down in the cupboard while no ones around would you i can already imagine midnight drinking sessions with one eye on the door the way i used to read books with a penlight and listen to radio luxemburg through an earpiece when i was a kid banks said one more thing he brought out a small bag of treats from lewis cooper the northallerton gourmet food shop theres a few different cheeses vegetable pâté potted shrimp just in case you feel like being really naughty and water crackers figs olives only the best annie laughed and put her hand to her face banks could see she was crying too oh thanks alan come here he bent over her and she held him with her good arm he felt the warm damp skin of her cheek against his and thought he should have shaved that morning then he smelled her hair smelled her you shouldnt have of course i should banks moved away but held on to her hand im afraid thats it he said how is the food here as youd expect not that bad said annie though being a vegetarian is a definite liability i must say rays been wonderful though where is he he had to go to london theres a gallery putting on a show of his work down there he didnt want to said he thought he should stay with me but i made him go hell be back tomorrow say hi from me said banks so how are you feeling good days and bad im on the mend your breathing sounds a lot better have you talked to the doctor annie turned her head yes mr sandhar and i had a good long hearttoheart late last week he told me about the operation explained all the details the ins and outs the risks and im scared banks tightened his grip on her hand itll be fine youll see you couldnt be in better hands i know that its justyou know its always been one of my greatest fears being unable to walk unable to move confined to a wheelchair remember lucy payne what a monster she was i even felt sorry for her i thought it might have been easier if shed just died its not going to happen to you youll be back to normal in no time he certainly didnt downplay the dangers he wouldnt hes a realist maybe a little kindly lying wouldnt have gone amiss annie winced what is it she put her hand to her chest sometimes when i breathe in i still get a sharp pain in my chest the doctor says its my lung healing my bloody shoulder still hurts like the dickens too keeps me awake at nights its a nasty wound annie paused tell me alan is he really dead jaff mccready yes poor kid i cant say id have wished that on him after what he did to you im not saying he didnt deserve punishment severe punishment but it was quick said banks he didnt even see it coming i suppose not dont feel too sorry for him annie mccready was no innocent i know you were there werent you yes i didnt see it coming either banks had brought a starbucks grande latte with him and he took a sip then set it down on top of annies side cupboard as he did so he realized that he had forgotten the flowers he mentally kicked himself idiot next time no hed have some delivered with a note as soon as he left we recovered his gun by the way mccreadys a baikal as we thought it had a silencer and i think thats what saved your life apparently with a silencer it loses a third of its power and is far less accurate well i never said annie whats happening over the mccready shooting business about what youd expect theyre all backpedaling like crazy in the end it all comes down to spin of course the media dont have many facts but theres been plenty of speculation about my presence there and tracys not to mention a rogue afo mostly the brass has being trying to quash those rumors or at least deflect the worst of them weve had a few more meetings without pc powells presence this time even the chief constable himself was at one of them everyone has ended up bending over backward so the media reports it as all going according to procedure an unfortunate necessity but an officers life at risk a proven police shooter dangerous criminal on the run unstable behavior hostages involved official operation judgment call no choice in the matter blah blah blah take your pick you disagree not at all its justbarelypossible to argue it that way we even had civilian witnesses to bear out the evidence that my life and tracys were at immediate risk and that the police sharpshooter acted appropriately with all reasonable regard for any members of the public in the vicinity all of which is true the fact that she was there unofficially under her own steam and with an unofficial weaponwell we just tried to sweep all that under the carpet there are still bits sticking out of course butacc mclaughlin told the press that we hadnt been able to authorize any sort of large or visible firearms support unit operation because of time constraints the delicacy of the situation and the danger involved to the hostages not to mention the public at large he wasnt lying well take a lot of flack and chambers is still on the warpath but whats new cooler heads might prevail this time and nerys banks sipped a little more of his latte and said id say her careers effectively over wouldnt you i mean not because of the taser business with warburton thats dead in the water even chambers realizes that ironically enough it was partly your shooting that knocked it off the front page cop shootings do get us a lot of public sympathy glad to be of help banks smiled there may be a few slapped wrists for a less than full assessment of the situation at the doyle house chambers and his lads from greater manchester will continue to conduct their inquiry and theyll want their pound of flesh or at least a couple of ounces in compensation but id guess the results a foregone conclusion coverups all round then not really certainly not the taser incident the whole thing was an unfortunate accident and luckily the medias quite happy to view it that wayuntil the next time but nerys the mccready shooting thats a little different nobody wants wild headlines in the papers about rogue cops shooting people down in motorway service station car parks so well put a slightly more heroic spin on her actions even so it wont be easy for her theres the rifle for a start she shouldnt have been carrying it around shes damn lucky not to be going to prison after what she pulled theyll make her see a shrink too of course i must say you do pick them annie speak for yourself besides i didnt pick her she picked me and how can you say that why are you so ambivalent about her she saved your life i know she did and im grateful for that but shes still bloody lucky to get off without serious criminal charges in my opinion lucky no one needs a sacrificial lamb right now and im ambivalent because im not convinced of her motives what do you mean i think she did it as much for herself as for me where do you get that from i cant prove it but ill bet you a pound to a penny that it was you she was thinking of and what jaff had done to you when she pulled that trigger she was shooting him for what he did to you annie reddened well well probably never know will we she let go of bankss hand for a moment and reached for her water banks saw her grimace in pain as she turned so he passed it to her thanks she said we wont know unless she tells us which i doubt she ever will said banks why should she id be the first to admit that it probably doesnt even matter to anybody but me and to people like chambers and trethowan who seem to want to make her lesbianism an issue here and you dont i dont care whether she did it for a man or a woman what matters is that she didnt do it for the reasons she said she did she did it for revenge it was personal then banks rubbed his hand over his eyes but it was personal for a lot of us so im not saying she should be crucified for it and she saved your life yes and there was no other way no look i know im not making a lot of sense ill get it all sorted out in time so what happens to nerys if she has any sense shell get out of north yorkshire as fast as she can lie low for a while then she might well make some clandestine counterterrorism squad or other theyre not always so fussy about who they take on depending on the level of threat and she is a good shot she wont go to waste who knows maybe even the americans will take her she suits their style dont you think thats a bit harsh on whom nerys or the americans annie laughed touché what about the farmer who knows said banks were building a case the cps is enthusiastic but hes got good lawyers still theres some interesting stuff in his jersey and cayman island files we got victor mallory too by the way found his lockup with the lab and cache of baikals the clever bastards were using one of mccreadys fathers old shell companies thats why it took so long to track down whats going to happen to erin ive recommended a good solicitor shell plead guilty with extenuating circumstances i think that given her previous good character and the circumstances surround the whole affair shell probably get away with a suspended sentence at least thats what the solicitor says and tracy hows she doing after her ordeal banks sipped his latte shes young resilient shell recover in time you sound uncertain whats wrong its nothing said banks she was raped you know mccready raped her annie said nothing at first banks wondered if she was remembering her own experience of rape several years ago before she came to north yorkshire good god she said finally im so sorry alan if i can help in any wayif you want me to talk to her just let me know i do wish i could remember more about what happened before the shooting how she was what she said i just cant all i have is the impression that she was scared and she was trying to get rid of me quickly well that would make sense if mccready was waiting in the wings wouldnt it she wanted you out before he hurt you she knew how unstable he was by then not before annie i dont really know how to say this but i think tracy was lying to me when she told the story from her point of view believe me ive had plenty of experience listening to people lie there are just too many inconsistencies did you challenge her on them of course not its nothing really but she just seemed to shade everything so she came out sounding like the victim all the time she was the victim i know but i dont think mccready forced her to go with him i think she fancied him and she went willingly and suggested my cottage as a place to hide out i think it was an adventure to her at first maybe a form of rebellion of paybacki dont knowwe havent been very close lately she may blame me she felt that i favored brian and that i was disappointed by her exam results and her lack of a promising career i dont like to be suspicious of my own daughter annie but alan if tracy was playing down her role she was doing it because she was feeling guilty and ashamed of what a fool she was and the last thing shed want is for you to think even more badly of her dont you see shes afraid of your judgment youre not just her father you know youre a policeman too you have no doubt that she became a victim and hostage later on do you no i think there came a point when the relationship changed maybe when you got shot or even before well then she might have gone along with mccready in the first place for some sort of misguided romantic reasons shes young but she didnt pull the trigger she didnt steal the coke and the money mccready did all that just give her time to heal build some bridges try to understand what she must be feeling shell tell the truth when shes ready you think so i do where is she now shes staying in london with her mother for a while im so deep in the doghouse with sandra now that even my feet arent sticking out annie laughed at the image for not telling everyone what was going on what do you think what a mess annie shook her head slowly and took his hand again i was so scared when i realized what was happening there on the floor in your conservatory before it all went dark and i could hardly catch my breath i was convinced i was going to die i missed you so much at that moment alan banks swallowed and squeezed her hand i missed you too youd have loved it over there the desert nights the grand canyon the pacific coast highway fishermans wharf the golden gate bridge magic i wish id been with you but it sounded like the kind of trip you had to take alone it was said banks this time but who knows one day if i can still walk youll walk you know annie said youve told me plenty about nerys and tracy and what happened and all that but what about you me banks shrugged what about me ive had plenty of practice being in the doghouse where sandras concerned and it matters a lot less when shes a couple of hundred miles away no i didnt mean so much about your family i meant the other stuff job career future banks finished his latte and dropped the cup in the wastebasket well chambers is out for blood and im right in his sights hed love to throw me to the wolves i broke every rule in the book probably more even than poor nerys and he knows id do it again in the twinkling of an eye but i still have a few friends in high places theyre pushing for a spell of gardening leave until i sort out my personal problems emotionally distraught father understandably overtired daughter abducted that sort of thing the saving grace is that if the powers above did throw me to the wolves most of them would have to fall on their own swords for allowing the situation to arise in the first place cold comfort i suppose but there you go in the end theyll either sack me put me in the nuthouse or promote me to area commander annie laughed but what will you do arent you worried seriously you dont sound too concerned im not banks looked at the beeping machines with their
