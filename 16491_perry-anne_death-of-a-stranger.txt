anne perry death of a stranger book in the william monk series to david thompson for his friendship and his profound help authors note all characters are fictional except william colman who won the right to be mentioned as a character in the story but of course his words and actions in this are invented by me i hope they are acceptable to him prologue monk stood on the embankment staring at the lights reflected on the misty waters of the thames as dusk settled over the city he had solved his latest case to the satisfaction of his client and twenty guineas were sitting comfortably in his pocket behind him coaches and carriages moved through the spring evening and the sound of laughter punctuated the clip of hooves and jingle of harness it was too far from here to fitzroy street for monk to walk home and a hansom was an unnecessary expense the omnibus would do very well there was no hurry because hester would not be there this was one of the nights when she worked at the house in coldbath square which had been set up with callandra daviots money in order to give medical help to women of the streets who had been injured or become ill mostly in the course of their trade he was proud of the work hester did but he missed her company in the evenings it startled him how deeply since his marriage he had been accustomed to sharing his thoughts with her to her laughter her ideas or simply to looking across the room and seeing her there there was a warmth in the house that was missing when she was gone how unlike his old self that was in the past he would not have shared the core inside him with anyone nor allowed someone to become important enough to him that her presence could make or mar his life he was surprised how much he preferred the man he had become thinking of medical help and callandras assistance turned his mind to the last murder he had dealt with and to kristian beck whose life had been torn apart by it beck had discovered things about himself and his wife which had overturned his beliefs even the foundations of his own identity his entire heritage had not been what he had assumed nor his culture his faith or the core of who he was monk understood in a unique way becks shock and the numbing confusion that had gripped him a coaching accident nearly seven years before had robbed monk of his own memory before that and forced on him the need to recreate his identity he had deduced much about himself from unarguable evidence and while some things were admirable there were too many that displeased him and lay shadowed across the yet unknown even in his present happiness the vast spaces of ignorance troubled him from time to time kristians shattering discoveries had woken new doubts in monk and a painful awareness that he knew almost nothing of his roots or the people and the beliefs that had cradled him he was northumbrian from a small seaboard town where his sister beth still lived he had lost touch with her which was his own fault partly out of fear of what she would tell him of himself partly because he simply felt alienated from a past he could no longer recall he felt no bond with that life or its cares beth could have told him about his parents and probably his grandparents too but he had not asked should he try now when it mattered more urgently to build a bridge back to her so he could learn or might he find like kristian that his heritage was nothing like his present self and he was cut off from his own people he might find as kristian had that their beliefs and their morality cut against the grain of his own for kristian the past he believed and that had given him identity had been wrenched out of his hands shown to be a fabrication created out of the will to survive easy to understand but not to admire and bitterly hard to own if monk were at last to know himself as most people do automaticallythe religious ties the allegiances the family loves and hatesmight he too discover a stranger inside his skin and one he could not like he turned away from the river and walked along the footpath toward the nearest place where he could cross the street through the traffic and catch the omnibus home perhaps he would write to beth again but not yet he needed to know more kristians experience weighed on him and would not let him rest but he was also afraid because the possibilities were too many and too disturbing and what he had created was too dear to risk chapter one there was a noise outside the womens clinic in coldbath square hester was on night duty she turned from the stove as the street door opened the wood still in her hand three women stood in the entrance half supporting each other their cheap clothes were torn and splattered with blood their faces streaked with it skin yellow in the light from the gas lamp on the wall one of them her fair hair coming loose from an untidy knot held her left hand as if she feared the wrist were broken the middle woman was taller her dark hair loose and she was gasping finding it difficult to get her breath there was blood on the torn front of her satin dress and smeared across her high cheekbones the third woman was older well into her thirties and there were bruises purpling on her arms her neck and her jaw hey missus she said urging the others inside into the warmth of the long room with its scrubbed board floor and whitewashed walls mrs monk yer gotter give us an and again kitty eres in a right mess an me an all an i think as lizzies broke er wrist hester put down the wood and came forward glancing only once behind her to make sure that margaret was already getting hot water cloths bandages and the herbs to steep which would make cleaning the wounds easier and less painful it was the purpose of this place to care for women of the streets who were injured or ill but who could not pay a doctor and would be turned away from more respectable charities it had been the idea of her friend callandra daviot and callandra had provided the initial funds before events in her personal life had taken her out of london it was through her also that hester had met margaret ballinger desperate to escape a respectable but uninteresting proposal of marriage her undertaking work like this had alarmed the gentleman in question so much he had at the last moment balked at making the offer to margarets relief and her mothers chagrin now hester guided the first woman to one of the chairs in the center of the floor beside the table come in nell she urged sit down she shook her head did willie beat you again surely you could find a better man she looked at the bruises on nells arms plainly made by a gripping hand at my age nell said bitterly easing herself into the chair cmon mrs monk yer mean well i daresay but yer feet int on the ground not unless yer offerin that nicelookin ol man o yours she leered ruefully then i might take yer up one day es got an air aboutim as e could be summat real special kind o mean but fun if yer know wot im sayin she gave a guffaw of laughter which turned into a racking cough and she bent double over her knees as the paroxysm shook her without being asked margaret poured a little whiskey out of a bottle replaced the cork and added hot water from the kettle wordlessly she held it until nell had controlled herself sufficiently to take it the tears still streaming down her face she struggled for breath sipped some of the whiskey gagged and then took a deeper gulp hester turned to the woman called kitty and found her staring with wide horrified eyes her body tense muscles so tight her shoulders all but tore the thin fabric of her bodice mrs monk she whispered huskily your husband hes not here hester assured her theres no one here who will hurt you where are you injured kitty did not reply she was shuddering so violently her teeth chattered go on yer silly cow lizzie said impatiently she wont urt yer an she wont tell no one nuffin nells only goin on cos she fancies er ol man proper gent e is smart as a whip dresses like the tailor owedim not tother way round she nursed her broken wrist wincing with pain get on wiv it then you may ave got all nighti int kitty looked once at the iron beds five along each side of the room the stone sinks at the far end and the buckets and ewers of water drawn from the well at the corner of the square then she faced hester making an intense effort to control herself i got in a fight she said quietly its not that bad i daresay i was frightened as much as anything her voice was surprising it was low and a trifle husky and her diction was clear at one time she must have had some education it struck in hester a note of pity so sharp that for a moment it was all she could think of she tried not to let it show in her expression the woman did not want the intrusion of pity she would be only too aware of her own fall from grace without anyone elses notice of it those are bad bruises on your neck hester looked at them more closely it appeared as if someone had held her by the throat and there was a deep graze across the front of her breastbone as though a hard fingernail had scored it deliberately is that blood yours hester asked indicating the splatters across the front of kittys bodice kitty gave a shuddering sigh no no i i reckon i caught his nose when i hit him back its not mine ill be all right nells bleeding you should see to that and lizzie broke her wrist or somebody did she spoke generously but she was still shivering and hester was certain she was far from well enough to leave she would have liked to know what bruises were hidden under her clothes or what beatings she had endured in the past but she did not ask questions it was one of the rules they had all agreed that no one pressed for personal information or repeated what they overheard or deduced the whole purpose of the house was simply to offer such medical help as lay within their skill or that of mr lockhart who called by every so often and could be reached easily enough in an emergency he had failed his medical exams at the very end of his training through a weakness for drink rather than ignorance or inability he was happy enough to help in return for company a little kindness and the feeling that he belonged somewhere he liked to talk to share food he had been given rather than paid for and when he was short of funds he slept on one of the beds margaret offered kitty a hot whiskey and water and hester turned to look at nells deep gash thatll have to be stitched she advised nell winced she had experienced hesters needlework before otherwise it will take a long time to heal hester warned nell pulled a face if yer stitchins still like yer stitched me and theyd throw yer out of a bleedin sweatshop she said goodhumoredly all it wants is buttons on it she drew in her breath between her teeth as hester pulled the cloth away from the wound and it started to bleed again jeez nell said her face white be careful cant yer yer got ands like a damn navvy hester was accustomed to the mild abuse and knew it was only nells way of covering her fear and her pain this was the fourth time she had been there in the month and a half since the house had been open yerd think since yerd looked arter soldiers in the crimea wi florence nightingale an all yerd be a bit gentler wouldnt yer nell went on i bet yer snuffed as many o our boys as the fightin ever did oo paid yer then the russkies she looked at the needle margaret had threaded with gut for hester her face went gray and she swiveled her head to avoid seeing the point go through her flesh keep looking at the door hester advised ill be as quick as i can that supposed ter make me feel better nell demanded yer got that bleedin fat leech comin in ere again i beg your pardon jessop nell said with stinging contempt as the street door closed again and a large portly man in a frock coat and brocade waistcoat stood just inside stamping his feet as if to force water off them although in fact it was a perfectly dry night good evening mrs monk he said unctuously miss ballinger his eyes flickered over the other three women his lips slightly curled he made no comment but in his face was his superiority his comfortable amusement the ripple of interest in them which he resented and would have denied hotly he looked hester up and down you are a very inconvenient woman to find maam i dont care for having to walk the streets at this time of night in order to meet with you i can tell you that with total honesty hester made a very careful stitch in nells arm i hope you tell me everything with total honesty mr jessop she said coldly and without looking up at him nell shifted slightly and sniggered then turned it into a yell as she felt the thread of gut pulling through her flesh for goodness sake be quiet woman jessop snapped but his eyes followed the needle with fascination be grateful that you are being assisted it is more than most decent folk would do for you he forced his attention away now mrs monk i dislike having to discuss my affairs in front of these unfortunates but i cannot wait around for you to have time to spare he put his thumbs in the pockets of his red brocade waistcoat as i am sure you are aware it is quarter to one in the morning and i have a home to go to we need to reconsider our arrangements he freed one hand and flicked it at the room in general this is not the best use of property you know i am doing you a considerable service in allowing you to rent these premises at such a low rate he rocked very slightly back and forth on the balls of his feet as i say we must reconsider our arrangement hester held the needle motionless and looked at him no mr jessop we must keep precisely to our arrangement it was made and witnessed by the lawyers it stands i have my reputation to consider he went on his eyes moving for a moment to each of the women then back to hester a reputation for charity is good for anyone she returned beginning very carefully to stitch again this time nell made no sound at all ah but theres charity and charity jessop pursed his lips and resumed the very slight rocking his thumbs back in his waistcoat pockets theres some as are more deserving than others if you take my meaning im not concerned with deserving mr jessop she replied im concerned with needing and that womanshe indicated lizziehas broken bones which have to be set we cannot pay you any more nor should we she tied the last stitch and looked up to meet his eyes the thought passed through her mind that they resembled boiled sweets to be specific those usually known as humbugs a reputation for not keeping his word is bad for a man of business she added in fact any man at all and it is good especially in an area like this to be trusted his face hardened until it was no longer even superficially benign his lips were tight his cheeks blotchy are you threatening me mrs monk he said quietly that would be most unwise i can assure you you need friends too he mimicked her tone especially in an area like this before hester could speak nell glared up at jessop you watch yer lip mister you might knock around tarts like us she used the word viciously as he might have said it but mrs monks a lady an wots more er usband used ter be a rozzer an now e does it private like fer anyone as wants it but that dont mean e int got friends in places wot counts admiration gleamed in her eyes and a harsh satisfaction an es as ard as they come wen e needs ter be if e took ter yer nasty yerd wish as yerd never bin born ask some o yer thievin friends if theyd like ter cross william monk garn i dare yer wet yerself at the thought yer would the dull color washed up jessops face but he did not reply to her he glared at hester you wait till renewal time mrs monk youll be looking for something else and ill be warning other propertied men just what sort of a tenant you are as to mr monk he spat the words this time he can speak to all the police he likes ive got friends too and not all of them are so nice garn nell said in mock amazement an ere was us thinkin as yer meant er majesty an all jessop turned and after giving hester one more icy stare he opened the door and let the cold air in off the cobbled square damp in the earlyspring night the dew was slick on the stones shining under the gaslight twenty yards away showing the corner of the end housegrimy eaves dark and dripping guttering crooked he left the door open behind him and walked smartly down bath street toward the farringdon road bastard nell said in disgust then looked down at her arm yer improvin she said grudgingly thank you hester acknowledged with a smile nell suddenly grinned back yer all right you are if that fat sod gives yer any trouble like let us know willie might knock me around a bit wots out o place but ed be good fer beatin that slimy pig an all thank you hester said seriously ill keep it in mind would you like more tea yeah an a drop o life in it too nell held out the cup rather less life this time hester directed as margaret hiding a smile obeyed hester moved her attention to lizzie who was looking increasingly anxious as her turn approached setting her broken bone was going to be very painful anesthetic had been available for more serious operations for several years it made all sorts of deep incisions possible such as those needed to remove stones from the bladder or a diseased appendix but for injuries like this and for people unable or unwilling to go to a hospital there was still no help but a stiff dose of alcohol and such herbs as dulled the awareness of pain hester talked all the time about anything and nothingthe weather local peddlers and what they were sellingin order to distract lizzies attention as much as possible she worked quickly she was accustomed to the terrible wounds of the battlefield where there was no anesthetic and not always brandy except to clean a blade speed was the only mercy available this time there was no broken skin nothing to see but the crooked angle and the pain in lizzies face hester touched the wrist lightly and heard the gasp then the retching as the raw ends of bone grated with one swift decisive movement she brought the ends together and held them while margaret gritting her teeth bound the wrist as firmly as she could without stopping the blood to the hand lizzie retched again hester handed her the whiskey and hot water this time with an infusion of herbs added it was bitter but the alcohol and the heat would ease her and in time the herbs would settle her stomach and give her a little sleep stay here tonight hester said gently standing up and putting her arm around lizzie as she rose unsteadily to her feet we need to see that bandage stays all right if your hand swells up a lot well have to loosen it she added slowly guiding her over to the closest bed while margaret pulled back the covers for her lizzie looked at hester in horror her face bloodless the bone will be fine hester assured her just take care not to knock it as she spoke she eased lizzie onto the bed bent and took her shoes off then lifted her legs and feet up until she was lying back against the pillows margaret pulled the covers over her lie there for a bit hester advised then if you want to get into bed properly ill come and give you a nightshirt lizzie nodded thank you miss she said with profound sincerity she struggled for a moment to find words to add and then merely smiled hester went back to where kitty was sitting waiting patiently for her turn she had an interesting face strong features and a wide passionate mouth not pretty in the usual sense but well proportioned she had not been on the streets long enough for her skin to be marred or sallow from poor food and too much alcohol hester wondered briefly what domestic tragedies had brought her there she looked at her injuries they were mostly rapidly darkening bruises as if she had been in a struggle with someone but it had not lasted long enough to do her the damage that nell and lizzie had suffered the deep graze on her breastbone needed cleaning but no stitches would help it was not bleeding much and a little ointment to aid healing would be sufficient the bruises would hurt for some time to come but arnica would ease that margaret brought more hot water and clean cloths and hester began to work as gently as she could kitty barely winced when hester touched the graze cleaning away the blood which was now dried and exposing the raw torn edges of the skin as always hester did not ask how it happened pimps quite often disciplined their women if they thought they were not working hard enough or were keeping back too big a part of their earnings vicious fights between one woman and another happened now and again mostly over territory it was best not to appear inquisitive and anyway the knowledge would be of no use to her all the wounded were treated much the same however their hurts were incurred when hester had done all she could for kitty and given her a cup of strong sweet tea laced with a very small drop of whiskey kitty thanked her and went back out into the night pulling her shawl tighter around her they saw her go across the square head high and disappear into the black shadow of the prison to the north i dunno nell shook her head she shouldnt be out on the street int fer er sort poor bitch there was nothing useful to say a hundred different circumstances took women into prostitution often only to supplement a toomeager income from something else but it all stemmed from the eternal struggle for money nell looked at her you keep a still tongue dont yer ta missus ill be seein yer again i spec she squinted a little at hester regarding her with wry kindness if i can elp yer sometime she left the sentence unfinished shrugging very slightly nodding to margaret she went out as well closing the door quietly behind her hester caught margarets eye and saw the flash of humor and pity in her expression there was no need for words they had already said all there was to say they were there to heal not to preach to women whose lives they only partially understood at first margaret had wanted to change things to speak what she saw as truth guided by her own beliefs gradually she had begun to realize how little she knew of her own hungers except that to be tied in a convenient marriage where the emotion was no more than a mutual respect and courtesy would be a denial of everything inside her it might seem comfortable to begin with but as time passed and she stifled the dreams within her she would come to feel her husband was her jailer and then despise herself for her own dishonesty the choice was hers no one else was to blame she made it and stepped into the unknown aware that she was closing doors she might later regret and which after that could never be opened again she did not often wonder what she had given away but there had been long nights with few patients when she and hester talked frankly and even touched on the prices of different kinds of loneliness those that were perceived by others and those that were masked in marriage and family all choice was risk but for margaret as for hester accommodation to halftruths was impossible for his sake i cant do that margaret had said with a selfconscious laugh poor man deserves better than that id despise myself for it and him for letting me then she had gone for a bucket and water to scrub the floor as she did now and together they cleared up and put away the unused bandages and ointments then took turns in snatching a little sleep two other women came in before morning the first needed two stitches in her leg which hester did quickly and efficiently the second was cold and angry and badly bruised a mug of hot tea again mildly laced with brandy and a little tincture of arnica and she felt ready to return to her room and face the coming day probably most of it asleep dawn came clear and quite mild and by eight oclock hester was eating toast and drinking a cup of fresh tea when the street door opened and a constable was silhouetted against the sunlight without asking he came in mrs monk his tone was heavy and a little sharp the police hardly ever came to the house they were not welcome and had been told so in unmistakable terms largely they respected what was done there and were happy enough if they wished to speak to any of the women to wait and do it in some other place what could have brought him there this morning and at eight oclock hester put down her mug and stood yes she had seen him several times on the street what is it constable hart he closed the door behind him and took off his helmet in the light his face looked tired not merely from a sleepless night on duty but from an indefinable weariness within something had bruised him disturbed him youad any women in ere last night that were knocked about cut mebbe or beat bad he asked he glanced at the teapot on the table swallowed and looked back at hester we do most nights she replied stabs broken bones bruises disease in bad weather the women are sometimes just cold you know that he took a deep breath and sighed pushing his hand through his receding hair someone in a real fight mrs monk i wouldnt ask if i didnt ave to jus tell me eh would you like a cup of tea she evaded the answer for a moment or toast he hesitated his exhaustion was plain in his face yeah ta he accepted sitting down opposite her hester reached for the teapot and poured a second mug toast he nodded jam she offered his eyes went to the table his face relaxed in a rueful smile you got black currant he noticed his voice soft youd like some it was a rhetorical question the answer was obvious margaret was still asleep and making the toast would give hester a little more time to think so she was happy to do it she came back to the table with two slices and buttered one for herself and one for him then pushed the jam over to him he took a liberal spoonful put it on the toast and ate it with evident appreciation youad someone he said after several moments looking at her almost with apology i had three she replied at about a quarter to one or about then one later three oclock or so and another an hour after that all in fights looked like it i didnt ask i never do why hester waited watching him there were hollows under his eyes as if he had lost too many nights sleep and there was dust and what looked like blood on his sleeves when she looked further there was more on the legs of his trousers his hand holding the mug was scratched and one fingernail was torn it should have been painful but he seemed unaware of it she was touched by both pity and a cold air of fear why did you come she asked aloud he put down the mug theres been a murder he replied in abel smiths brothel over in leather lane im sorry she said automatically whoever it was such a thing was sad the waste of two lives a grief to even more but murders were not unheard of in an area like this or dozens of others in london much the same narrow alleys and squares lay a few yards behind teeming streets but it was a different world of pawnbrokers brothels sweatshops and crowded tenements smelling of middens and rotting timber prostitution was a dangerous occupation primarily because of the risk of disease and if you lived long enough starvation when you became too old to practiceat thirtyfive or forty why did you come here hester asked was somebody else attacked as well he looked at her his eyes narrow his lips pulled tight it was an expression of understanding and misery not contempt dead person wasnt a woman he explained wouldnt expect you to be able to elp me if it was although sometimes they fight each other but not to kill far as i know never seen it anyway a man she was surprised you think a pimp killed him what happened someone drunk do you suppose he sipped his tea again letting the hot liquid ease his throat dont know abel swears it int anything to do with is girls well he would wouldnt he she dismissed the idea without even weighing it hart would not let it go so quickly thing is mrs monk the dead man was a toff i mean a real toff you should ave seen is clothes i know quality an clean is ands were clean too nails an all an smooth do you know who he was he shook his head no someone pinched is money an calling cards if ead any but someonell missim well find out even men like that have been known to use prostitutes she said reasonably yeh but not abel smiths sort he replied not that thats what matters he added quickly thing is a man like that gets murdered an well be expected to get whoever did it in double quick time an therell still be a lot o shouting an wailing to clean up the area get rid o prostitution and make the streets safe for decent people like he said this with ineffable contemptnot a sneer of the lips or raising of his voice just a soft immeasurable disgust presumably if hed stayed at home with his wife hed still be alive hester responded sourly but i cant help you why do you think a woman was hurt and could know something about it or that shed dare tell you if she did you thinking er pimp did it he raised his eyebrows arent you she countered why would a woman kill him and how was he stabbed i dont know any women who carry knives or who attack their clients fingernails or teeth are about the worst ive heard of eard of he questioned she smiled with a slight downward curl of her lips men dont come here just women eh for medical reasons she explained anyway if a mans been bitten or scratched by a prostitute what are we going to do for him beyond have a good laughnothing he agreed then his expression became grave again but this mans dead mrs monk an from the look of the body e gotimself in a fight with a woman an then somehow or other e came off worst es got cuts an gashes in is back an so many broken bones its hard to know where to begin she was startled she had imagined a fight between two men ending in tragedy perhaps the larger or heavier one striking an unlucky blow or possibly the smaller one resorting to a weapon probably a knife but you said he was robbed she pointed out thinking now of an attack by several men was he set on by a gang that dont appen round these streets hart dismissed it thats what pimps are for they make their money out of willing trade its in their interest to keep the customers safe so why is this one dead she said quietly beginning to understand now why hart had come there why would one of the women kill him and how if he was beaten the way you describe hart bit his lip actually more like e fell he answered fell she did not immediately understand from an eight he explained like down stairs mebbe suddenly it was much clearer if a man had been caught off balance not expecting it a woman could easily have pushed him but what about the cuts and gashes you spoke of she asked you dont get those falling down stairs there was a lot o broken glass around he replied an bloodlots of it could ave smashed a glass dropped it an then fallen on it i suppose he looked miserable as he said it almost as if it were a personal tragedy he pushed his hand back through his hair again a gesture of infinite weariness but abel swears e was never at is place an knowing the state of it i believeim but e went somewhere often enough why would one of abel smiths women kill him she asked pouring more tea for both of them could it have been an accident could he have tripped and fallen down the stairs e wasnt found at the bottom an they deny it he shook his head and picked up his mug of fresh tea e was on the floor in one o the back bedrooms where was the broken glass she asked on the floor in the passage an at the bottom o the stairs maybe they moved him before they realized he was beyond help she suggested then they denied it out of fear sometimes people tell the stupidest lies when they panic he stared at the distance the potbellied stove halfway along the wall his eyes unseeing his voice still too quiet to carry beyond the table where they sat ed been in a fight scratch marks on is face that never came from any fall look like a womans fingernails an he were dead after e hit the ground all them broken bones an a bash on the head wouldnt ave moved after that an theres blood on is ands but they wasnt injured it werent no accident mrs monk at least not entirely i see he sighed its going to cause a terrible row the familys going to raise ell theyll ave us all out patrolling the streets and arassing any women we see theyre going to ate it an then customers is going to ate it even more an the pimpsll ate it worst of all everybodyll be in a filthy temper until we find whoever did it an probably ang the poor little cow he was too wretched to be aware of having used a disparaging term in front of her or to think of apologizing i cant help you hester said softly remembering the women who had come to the house the previous night all of them injured more or less five women came but they all went again and i have no idea where to i dont ask their names he said without expectation i dont ask that either only something to call them by thatll do for a start he put down his mug and fished in his pocket for his notebook and pencil a nell a lizzie and a kitty she answered later a mariah and a gertie he thought for a moment then put the pencil away again ardly worth it he said dismally everybodys a mary a lizzie or a kate god knows what they were christenedif they were poor souls she looked at him in the sharp morning light there was a dark shadow of stubble on his cheeks and his eyes were pinkrimmed he had far more pity for the women of the streets than he had for their clients she thought he did not particularly want to catch whoever had pushed the man down the stairs the murderer would no doubt be hanged for something which could have been at least in part an accident the death may not have been intentional but who would believe that when the woman in the dock was a prostitute and the dead man was rich and respected what judge or juror could afford to accept that such a man could be at least in part responsible for his own death im sorry she said again i cant help he sighed an you wouldnt if you could i know that he rose to his feet slowly shifting his weight a little as if his boots pinched justad ter ask it was nearly ten oclock in the morning when the hansom pulled up at her house in fitzroy street monk was sitting in the front room he used to receive those who came to seek his services as a private agent of enquiry he had papers spread in front of him and was reading them she was surprised to see him and filled with a sudden upsurge of pleasure she had known him for nearly seven years but had been married to him for less than three and the joy of it was still sharp she found herself smiling for no other reason he put the papers aside and stood up his face softening in response there was a question in his eyes youre late he said not in criticism but in sympathy have you eaten anything toast she replied with a little shrug she was untidy and she knew she smelled of vinegar and carbolic but she wanted him to kiss her anyway she stood in front of him hoping she was not obvious she was sufficiently in love that it would have embarrassed her to be too easily read he undid her bonnet and tossed it casually onto the chair then he put his arms around her and kissed her rather more warmly than she had expected she responded with a whole heart then remembering the lonely and rejected women she had treated during the night she kept her arms around him and held him more closely what is it he asked his voice demanding knowing the difference in her just the women she replied there was a murder last night thats why im late the police came to the house this morning why what would you know about it he was puzzled she knew what he was imagining a prostitute beaten and bleeding coming to the house then returning to her brothel and being beaten again this time to death no at least not the way you mean she answered it was a man who was killed a client if you can call him that they think he fought with one of the women and somehow or other she pushed him downstairs they wanted to know about women who came in cut and bruised as if they had been in a struggle and you had seen some he said of course every night its mostly that and disease i couldnt help because i dont know how they got hurt or where to find them again he pushed her back a little looking more closely at her face and would you help the police if you could i dont think so she admitted i dont know he smiled very slightly but his eyes read her perfectly all right she agreed im glad i cant help it relieves me of having to decide if i would or not apparently he was in constable harts words a toff so the police are going to make everyone suffer because the family will make sure they do she grimaced with disgust theyll probably tell us he was a philanthropist walking the back streets and alleys trying to save the souls of fallen women he lifted his head and very gently pushed back the hair that had fallen across her brow unlikely but i suppose its possible we believe what we need to at least for as long as we can she rested her head against his chin i know but i cant excuse persecuting a lot of women who are wretched enough anyway or the pimps who will only take it out on them it wont change anything someone killed him he said reasonably they cant ignore that i know she took a deep breath i know chapter two hester had foreseen that the area around coldbath square would suffer an added diligence from police harrying women who were either prostitutes or who could not prove their legitimate occupations but when it happened she was still taken aback by the reality the very next evening in the house she saw immediate evidence of it margaret was not in she was mixing with her more natural society endeavoring to elicit further donations of money toward the rent of the house and the cost of bandages and medicines necessary to treat those who came to it there were also other expenses to be met such as fuel for the stove and carbolic and vinegar for cleaning and of course food the first woman to come to the house was not injured but ill she had an intermittent fever which hester judged to be a symptom of venereal disease but there was little she could do for her beyond offering comfort and an infusion of herbs to lower her temperature and give her some sense of relief are you hungry hester asked passing her the steaming mug i have bread and a little cheese if you like the woman shook her head no ta ill just ave the medicine hester looked at her wan face and hunched shoulders she was probably not more than twentyfive or twentysix but she was weary and sleeplessness poor food and disease had robbed her of all energy would you like to stay here for the night hester offered it was not really what the house was for but in the absence of those in greater need why should this woman not use one of the beds a spark flared for a moment in the womans eyes wotll it cost she said suspiciously nothing can i go in the morning then you can go any time you wish but morning would be good yeah ta thatd be fine she still did not quite believe it her mouth pulled tight int no point out there she said grimly no trade rozzers all over the bleedin placelike flies on a dead rat they are int nothin fer no one even them wots still clean she meant free from disease not like herself there was nothing for hester to say the truth would be a condescension this woman did not need it would not give hope only separate her from any sense of being understood its that bleedin toff wot was snuffed last night the woman went on miserably stupid cow wy anyoned want ter go an do a thing like that fer i dunno she took a sip of the herbs and twisted her mouth at the bitter taste sugarll probably make it worse hester said but you can have some if youd like nah ta she shook her head ill get used ter it maybe theyll find out who it was and things will get back to normal hester suggested what are you called it was not quite the same thing as asking her name a name was a matter of identity this was merely something to use in making her personal betty was the reply after a longer draft of the herbal infusion are you sure you wouldnt like a piece of bread and cheese or toast yeah toastd be good ta hester made two pieces and put them on a plate with cheese betty waited while hester took one piece herself then she took the other her hand closed around it with satisfaction almost urgency reckon is familys real put out she went on after a moment or two em rozzers is buzzin around like the devils arter em poor bastards they int bad most o the time knows we gotter make a livin an the men wot comes ere does it cos they wanter int nobody elses business really she ate over half the toast before speaking again spose they come arter summink wot their wives don give em never could work that out but thank god fer it i say hester stood up and made more toast skewering the bread on a fork and holding it to the open door of the stove till the heat of the coals scorched it crisp and brown she returned with another good slice of cheese and gave it to betty who took it in wordless gratitude hester was half curious she had been involved in too many cases with monk not to try reasoning as second nature but she was also concerned for the disruption to the neighborhood why would any woman kill a client she asked surely she would realize it had to end like this betty shrugged oo knows even soused out of er mind yerd think shed avead more sense wouldnt yer she bit into the toast and cheese and spoke with her mouth full bring the wrath o god down on all of us stupid bitch but there was more resignation in her voice than anger and she turned her full attention to the food and said no more hester did not raise the subject again until close to morning she had slept in one of the beds herself and was roused by constable hart knocking on the door she got up and let him in he looked mithered and unhappy he glanced around the room and saw only the one bed occupied quiet he said without surprise perhaps involuntarily his eyes went to the stove and the kettle im going to have a cup of tea hester remarked would you like one he smiled at her tact and accepted when the tea and toast were made and they were sitting at either side of the table he began to talk it was light in the street outside but there was hardly any traffic yet the huge mass of the coldbath prison stood silent and forbidding to the north the sun softening its walls only slightly the cobbles of the road still damp in the crevices light glinted on a pile of refuse in the gutter so i dont suppose youve eard anything he said hopefully only that there are police all over the streets and none of the women are doing much trade she replied sipping her tea i imagine thatll go for a lot of other occupations as well he laughed without humor oh yeah burglaries are downand robberies its so bleedin safe to walk around now you could wear a gold albert in your waistcoat an go from coldbath to pentonville an still find it there the reglars like us almost as much as a dose o the pox then maybe theyll help she suggested get things back to normal do you know who he was yet he looked up at her his eyes solemn and troubled yeah is son got worried cos e were supposed to be at a big business meeting an e never come ome that night seems e werent the kind o man to miss something like that so everyone got upset asked the local station about accidents an so on he spread black currant jam liberally on his toast he lived up royal square opposite st peters church but the station put the word about an we was askin around too knowin as e wasnt from our patch son came over and looked atim in the morgue last evening he bit into the toast knewim right enough he said with his mouth full ell of a stink e kicked up streets not safe for decent men whats the world coming to and all that ell write to his member of parliament e said he shook his head wonderingly i think for his familys sake he would be wiser to say as little as possible at least for the moment she replied if my father were found dead in abel smiths place i would tell as few people as i could or found alive either for that matter she added he smiled at her for an instant then was grave again e were called nolan baltimore he told her rich man ead of a company in railways it was is son jarvis baltimore who came to the morgue es ead o the company now an going to make sure e raises cain if we dont find who killed is father an see em anged hester could imagine the reaction of shock pain outrage but she thought young mr jarvis baltimore would live to regret his actions today whatever his father had been doing in leather lane it was extremely unlikely to be anything his family would wish their friends to know about because it was murder the police would have to do all they could to establish the facts and if possible bring someone to court but it might have been better for the baltimore family if it could simply have remained a mystery a disappearance tragic and unexplained but that choice was no longer open to them it was only a passing thought a moments pity for the disillusion and then the public humiliation the laughter suddenly hushed when they entered a room the whispered words the invitations that stopped the friends who were unaccountably too busy to receive or to call all the money in the world would not buy back what they might be about to lose what if it were nothing to do with any of the women in abel smiths place she suggested maybe someone followed him to leather lane and took a good opportunity when they saw it he stared at her hope and incredulity struggling in his face god elp us if thats true he said in a whisper then well never findim could be anyone hester could see that she had not necessarily been helpful have you any witnesses at all he shrugged very slightly dunno who to believe is son says e was an upright decent man in a big way o business respected in the community an got a lot o powerful friends wholl want to see justice done an the streets o london cleaned up so onest folk can walk in em of course she nodded he can hardly say anything else he has to to protect his mother an is sister hart added who int married yet cos shes a miss baltimore ardly do er chances any good if er father was known to frequent places like leather lane for their usual trade he frowned curious that int it i mean a man thatll go to places like that isself turning down a young woman cos er father does the same thing i cant work folk out not gentry leastways it wont be his father constable itll be his mother she explained oh he put his empty mug down on the table yeah o course i see still it dont help us dont really know where to begin cept with abel smith an e swears blind baltimore werent killed in is place what does the police surgeon say dunno yet died o broken bones an bleedin inside but dunno whether e died at the bottom of abels stairs or somewhere else altogether coulda bin anyone as pushedim if it were the stairs or maybe he was drunk and just fell she said hopefully give me three wishes an right now all of emd be that he said with intense feeling the whole place is like a wasps nest all the way from coldbath up to pentonville an down as far as smithfield an itll get worse we just got the women an the pimps on our backs now he sighed give it a day or two an well have ever so discreet bellyachin from the toffs whose pleasure it is to come ere an have a bit o fun cos now they cant do it without falling over the police at every street corner theres goin to be a lot o red faces around if they do an a lot o short tempers if they dont we cant win whatever she sympathized with him silently getting him more tea and then fresh toast with black currant jam which he ate with relish before thanking her and going disconsolately out into the everbroadening daylight and resuming his thankless task the following day the newspapers carried headlines on the shocking death of wellrespected railway owner nolan baltimore found in extraordinary circumstances in leather lane off the farringdon road his family was desolated with grief and all society was outraged that a decent man of spotless reputation should be attacked in the street and left to die in such circumstances it was a national scandal and his son jarvis baltimore had sworn that it would be his crusade to clear away the crime and prostitution that stained the capital citys honor and made such foul murders possible the metropolitan police had failed in their duty to the citizens of the nation and it was every caring mans responsibility to make sure that it was not allowed to remain so of far more concern to hester was the fact that the night after constable harts second visit to her a young woman was brought into the house by her friends so seriously beaten that she had to be carried the three frightened and angry women waited huddled in the corner staring the injured woman lay on the table curled over holding her abdomen her body shaking blood oozing between her fingers whitefaced margaret looked at hester yes hester agreed quietly send one of the women for mr lockhart tell him to come as quickly as he may margaret nodded and turned away she gave directions to one of the waiting women where to start looking for the doctor and not to stop until she had found him then she went over to the stove for water vinegar brandy and clean cloths she worked blindly reaching for things because she was too shaken and too horrified to see clearly what she was doing hester must staunch the bleeding and overcome her horror at such a wound telling herself to remember the battlefields the shattered men she had helped lift off the wagons after the charge of the light brigade at sebastopol or after the battle of the alma bloodsoaked dead and dying limbs torn hacked by swords or splintered by shot she had been able to help them why was this woman any different hester was there to do a job not indulge her own emotions however deep or compassionate the woman needed help not pity let go of it she said very gently ill stop the bleeding please god she could she took the womans hands in hers feeling the clenched muscles the fear transmitting itself as if for a moment she were part of the same flesh she was aware of the sweat breaking out on her skin and running cold over her body can you elp er one of the women asked from behind she had come over silently unable to keep away in spite of her fear i think so hester replied what is her name fanny the woman said hoarsely hester bent over the woman fanny let me look at it she said firmly let me see with more strength she pulled the womans hands away and saw the scarletsoaked cloth of her dress she prayed they would find lockhart and he would come quickly she needed help with this margaret handed her scissors and she took them cutting the fabric to expose the flesh bandages she said without looking up rolled she added she lifted the dress away from the wound and saw raw flesh still running blood but not pumping relief washed over her breaking out in prickling sweat again it might be only a surface wound after all it was not the gushing arterial blood she had dreaded but still she could not afford to wait and see if lockhart turned up choking for a moment on her words she asked for cloths brandy and a needle threaded with gut behind her one of the women started to cry hester talked all the time she worked most of it was probably nonsense her mind was on the bloody flesh trying to stitch it together evenly without cobbling without missing a vessel where the blood was still oozing without causing more pain than was absolutely unavoidable silently margaret handed her more and more cloths and took away those that were soaked and useless where was lockhart why did he not come was he drunk again lying in someone elses bed under a table or worse in a gutter where no one would ever recognize him much less find him and sober him up she cursed him under her breath she lost track of how long it was since margaret had sent the woman out all that mattered was the wound and the pain she did not even notice the street door opening and closing then suddenly there was another pair of hands delicate and strong and above all clean her back was so locked in position that when she straightened up it hurt and it took her a moment to refocus her eyes on the young man beside her his shirtsleeves were rolled up above his elbows his fair hair was damp around his brow as if he had splashed his face with water he looked down at the wound good job he said approvingly looks as if youve got it where have you been she replied between her teeth overwhelmed with relief that he was there and furious that he had not come sooner he grinned ruefully and shrugged then turned his attention back to the wound he explored it with sensitive expert touch all the while looking every few moments at the patients face to make sure she was no worse hester considered apologizing to him for her implied criticism and decided it did not matter now it would not help and she did not pay him so perhaps he owed her nothing she caught margaret looking at her and saw the relief in her eyes also it seemed as if the bleeding was stopped she handed lockhart the final bandages soaked in balm and he bound them in place then stood back not bad he said gravely well need to watch her for infection he did not bother to ask what had happened he knew no one would tell him a little beef tea or sherry if you have it not yet but in a while you know what else he lifted his shoulders in a slight shrug and smiled probably better than i do hester nodded now that the immediate crisis was over she was overwhelmed with weariness her mouth was dry and she was trembling a little margaret had gone to the stove for hot water so they could wash the worst of the blood away and to make tea for them hester turned to the waiting women and the question in all their faces give it time she said quietly we cant tell yet its too soon can she stay ere one of them asked please missus ell only do it again if she goes back whats the matter with him hester let her fury out at last he could have killed her hes got to be a madmanyou should get rid of him dont you have some kind of it werent bert another of the women said quickly i know that cos e were out cold drunk in the gutter wen it appened i know that fer sure cos i seedim meself great useless bleedin oaf a customer hester said in surprise and increasing anger nah the woman shuddered yer dunno that the third woman said grimly fanny int sayin oo it were missus shes that scared she wont say nuffin but we reckon as its some bastard as she knows but it int er reglar pimp cos like jenny said e were blind drunk an not fit ter beat a rice puddin never mind do that ter anyone she grimaced besides wot sense does it make ter put yer own women out o work gawd theres little enough around now without cuttin anyone open even a bleedin eejut can see that then who would do it hester asked as margaret poured hot water into a bowl on the other table then added cold to it to make it bearable to wash in the carbolic was already to hand lockhart rolled his sleeves farther up ignoring the blood on them and began to wash hester followed straight after him and he handed her the towel margaret made tea for all of them including herself and brought it over hot and very strong hester was glad to sit down at last and made no demur when lockhart carried the bowl away to empty it down the drain fanny was lying on the main table her head on a pillow her face ashen white it was too soon to think of moving her even to a bed who would do it hester repeated looking at the woman dunno the first one replied ta she accepted a mug of tea from margaret thats wots got us frit fannys a good girl she don take nothin wot don belong to er she does wot shes told poor little cow prhaps she was once quite decent she lowered her voice parlor maid or summink like that got inter trouble an afore yer can say knife ere she is in the street don talk much but shead it rough id say lockhart came back with the empty bowl and accepted his tea if i could get me ands on the sod wot did that to er the middle woman said id slit is sorry miss but so i would you shut yer mouth ada her companion warned theres rozzers all over the place comin outa the bleedin woodwork they are don wanna be but theyre gettin leant on every which way poor sods someones tellin em ter clear us up others is tellin em ter leave us alone so they can ave their fun poor rozzers is runnin around like bluearsed flies fallin over each other yeh an poor little cows like fanny is gettin cut up by some bleedin lunatic ada retorted her face pinched her voice rising with barely controlled hysteria hester did not argue she sat quietly and thought about it but she did not ask any more questions the three women thanked them and after saying goodbye to fanny and promising to return they went out into the night after an hour lockhart looked closely at fanny who seemed to be quite a lot easier at least in her fear he helped hester and margaret carry her over to the nearest bed and laid her on it then promising to come back the following day he took his leave hester suggested margaret take a turn to sleep and she would watch later they would change places in the morning bessie wellington would come to take care of the house for the day and keep it clean she had once been a prostitute herself then kept a bawdy house until fiercer competition had driven her out of business now she was glad to find a warm room to spend the day and was gentle enough with such patients as remained in the beds she asked for no payment and her knowledge of the area was worth almost as much as her labor when hester returned the next evening she was met by bessie at the door her face red her black hair pulled back into a screwed knot and poking out at all angles she was bursting with indignation that slimy toad jessop was ere arter money again she said in a whisper which carried halfway across coldbath square offeredim a cup o tea an e wouldnt take it suspicious sod what did you put in it bessie hester asked concealing a wry smile she came in and closed the door behind her the familiarity of the room engulfed her the scrubbed boards still smelling of lye and carbolic the faint echo of vinegar the heat of the stove and over near the tables the pungency of whiskey and the sharper clean tang of herbs automatically her eye went to the bed where she had left fanny she saw the dark tangle of her hair and the mound of her body under the blankets shes all right poor little bitch bessie said with anger rumbling in her voice cant get a word out of er oo done that to er mind don understand that if it were me id be cursinim up an down ter everyone wotd listenan them wot wouldnt she shook her head only a bit o licorice she said in answer to hesters original question an a spot o whiskey ter ide the taste like pity that waste o good whiskey not that theres any other sort mind she grinned showing gap teeth did you throw it away hester asked anxiously bessie gave her a sideways look course i did bless yer wouldnt wanna give anyone cold tea would i she stared back with mock innocence and hester could not help at least half wishing jessop had drunk it surely bessie would not cause him anything worse than an acute discomfort and possibly embarrassment would she she went over and looked at fanny who was still frightened and in considerable pain it took half an hour to take off the bandages and look at the wound to make sure it was not infected rebandage it then persuade her to take a little broth she was barely finished when the street door opened with a gush of chilly damp air and she turned to see a woman of uncertain age standing only just inside she was plainly dressed like a good ladys maid and her face was pinched hard with disapproval even her nose was wrinkled though it was impossible to tell if it was the odor of lye and carbolic or fierce disgust that consumed her yes hester said enquiringly can i help you is this a a place where you take in injured women who are are she stopped apparently unable to say the word in her mind prostitutes hester said for her with a touch of asperity yes it is are you injured the woman blushed scarlet with mortification then the blood drained out leaving her face gray she swiveled on her heel and went out of the stillopen door bessie stifled a laugh the next moment another young woman stood in the entrance very different in appearance her complexion was extremely fair her yellow hair thick she had pale lashes and brows but a healthy color in her face which was too bland of feature to be pretty but had an openness and a balance about it which was immediately pleasing she appeared nervous and was obviously controlling deep emotions but there was no sign of injury or physical pain in her the quality of her clothes which even though they were of unrelieved black made it quite obvious she spent a considerable amount of money on them and her bearinghead high eyes directsaid that she was not a woman of the streets however successful it occurred to hester with a jolt of embarrassment that probably the first woman had indeed been her maid and there very much against her will perhaps she should not have made the remark she made she put down the dish and spoon with which she had been feeding fanny and went toward the visitor good evening can i help you are you in charge here the young woman asked her voice was low and a trifle hoarse as if her feelings were held in so tightly the effort had half closed her throat but her diction was perfect yes hester replied my name is hester monk what can i do for you i am livia baltimore she took a deep breath i understand this place studiously she avoided looking around her this is a refuge where women of the streets come if they are injured i beg your pardon if i am mistaken i do not mean to insult you but my maid informed me that this is the correct place her fists were clenched by her sides her body rigid it is not an insult miss baltimore hester replied steadily i do this because i wish to medicine deals with those who need it does not make social judgments she hesitated uncertain whether to say anything about nolan baltimores death or not then instinct broke through regardless i am sorry for your bereavement miss baltimore please come in thank you she glanced once behind her then closed the door perhaps you can also help me if i knew anything about it i would already have told the police hester replied turning and moving back toward the table she knew what livia baltimore had come seeking it was natural enough and showed a great deal of courage even if little wisdom she was touched with pity for the pain this young woman would experience as she realized more fully the reality of the places her father had frequented whatever his purpose she would have kept her emotions her dreams her grief far safer had she stayed at home but perhaps she would not only gain information but be able to give it as well even if vast areas of her fathers life were unknown to her she would still have some sense of his personality please sit down hester offered would you like tea its a miserable night livia accepted apparently the maid had been dismissed to wait for her in the carriage or whatever other form of transport she had used either livia wished this conversation to be private or the maid had declined to remain in such a place possibly it was both breathing heavily bessie filled up the kettle again from a ewer on the floor and set it on the stove itll be a few minutes she warned grudgingly she sensed condescension and resented it of course hester agreed then turned to livia i really have no idea what happened to mr baltimore she said gently i deal only with injury and illness here i dont ask questions but you must hear things livia urged the police wont tell me anything they speak to my brother but they say there was a woman involved and she may have been hurt her blackgloved hands clenched and unclenched on her reticule perhaps he saw a woman being attacked and he tried to help her and they set upon him her eyes were eager desperate if that were so she might have come here surely yes hester agreed knowing the word was true but the thought was not then you would have seen her or your woman would livia half nodded toward bessie standing with her arms folded beside the stove i would have seen her hester conceded but several women come here every night and they are all injured or ill but that night the night he was killed livia leaned forward a little across the table in her eagerness forgetting her distaste who was here then who was hurt and might have seen his murder her eyes filled with tears and she ignored them dont you care about justice mrs monk my father was a good and decent man and generous he worked so hard for what he had and he loved his family doesnt it matter to you that someone killed him yes of course it matters hester responded wondering how to answer the woman little more than a girl without overwhelming her with facts she could neither understand nor believe it matters when anyone is killed then help us livia pleaded you know these women tell me something no i dont know them hester cut across her i do what i can for their injuries thats all livias eyes were wide uncomprehending but they come in through that door hester nodded to the street entrance sometimes i have seen them before sometimes i havent they are either injured with cuts bruises or broken bones or they are in a critical state of disease most often syphilis or tuberculosis but other things as well i dont ask more than their first names merely for something to call them i do what i can and often that is not much when they are well enough they go away again but dont you know how they were injured livia pressed her voice rising you must know what happened hester looked down at the tabletop i dont need to ask either a customer lost his temper or they kept a bit of the money for themselves and their pimps beat them she replied and now and again they took a bit of trade in someone elses patch and got into a fight that way the competition is pretty rough whatever it is it really doesnt make any difference to what i need to do livia obviously did not understand it was a world even a language beyond her experience or imagination what is a pimp the man who looks after them hester replied and takes most of what they earn but why there was no comprehension in livias eyes because its dangerous for a woman on her own hester explained most of them have no choice the pimps own the buildings in a way they almost own the streets they keep other people from hurting the women but if they think theyre lazy or cheating them then they beat the women themselves usually not badly enough to scar their faces or make them unfit to work only a fool damages his own property livia shook her head as if to get rid of the idea then who hurts them when they come here to you customers perhaps who are drunk and dont know their own strength or just lose their tempers hester said other women sometimes quite often they come because of disease lots of people get tuberculosis livia pointed out all sorts of people i had a cousin who died of it she was only twentyeight they call it the white death dont they that was a statement and the other is she would not speak the words her own embarrassment at the subject was too deep to allow such candor at last she let herself look around the room at the whitewashed walls and the cupboards some of them locked hester saw her glance carbolic lye potash vinegar she said its good for cleaning and tobacco we keep that locked livias eyes widened tobacco you let people use tobacco even women for burning hester explained its a good fumigant especially if we have lice or ticks or things like that livias face twisted as if she could smell the reek of it already i just want to know what they saw she begged what happened to my father hester studied her the youth in the soft curves of her cheek and throat the unlined skin the earnest gaze but already the shadow of grief had touched her there was a hollowness a papery quality around her eyes and a tightness to her mouth the world was a different place from the one it had been three days before and that innocence could not be found again hester struggled for something to say that would stop this girl for that is all she was in spite of her years and send her back to her own life to believe whatever she wanted to unless there were a trial she would never have to know what her father had been doing in leather lane let the police find out if they can she said aloud theyre finding nothing livia answered indignantly these women wont talk to them why should they its someone they know who killed him theyre probably afraid to tell what was your father like hester asked then instantly regretted it it was a stupid question what does any woman say her dead father was like everything she wanted him to be reality blurred by loss loyalty the sense of decency that says you speak no ill of the dead i mean why might he have come to leather lane at night she amended livia looked slightly embarrassed and defensive i dont know it must have been business of some kind what does your mother say we dont discuss it livia responded as if it were the most usual thing to say mama is an invalid we try to keep anything troublesome or distressing from her jarvis my brother says he must have been going to meet someone possibly to do with navvies or something like that my father owned a railway company they have a new track which is almost completed it will go all the way from the dockside here in london up to derby and we have a factory near liverpool as well for making railway wagons perhaps he was seeing someone about laborers or steel or that kind of thing hester could not meet her eyes and answer that was not the sort of business people conducted in leather lane at night but what use was there in pointing that out to baltimores daughter these women wouldnt know about that she said instead they scrape the best living they can by selling their bodies and they pay a heavy price for it she saw the incomprehension again you think they should be in factory labor sweatshops do you know what that pays livia hesitated no or the hours no but its honest right there was an edge of scorn in her voice she had not intended and she saw the sting of it in livias face they cant afford to be honest at one and sixpence a day for fourteen or fifteen hours work she said more gently but still with the underlying angernot for livia but for the facts she saw livias eyes widen and her throat constrict especially if theyve got children to keep or debts to pay she added they can make a pound or two every night on the streets even after giving their pimp his cut but livia started again looking toward the curledup outline of fanny in the nearest bed the risks injuries disease the unpleasantness of it hester asked go into a sweatshop sometime see if you think its any better theyre cramped illlit dirty overcrowded theres just as much disease there a different kind maybe but im not sure its any better dead is dead whatever the cause cant you help me at all livia said softly shock and something like humility in her face at least ask them i can ask hester promised overwhelmed with pity again but please dont hope for much i dont think anyone knows and of course if it was business of some sort it would be well away from any of these women the police say he was found in abel smiths house in leather lane but abel swears it wasnt any of his women who killed him perhaps they are telling the truth and he was killed by whoever he went to see she hated telling what she thought was almost certainly a lie but very possibly no one would ever know who had killed baltimore let alone why so perhaps his daughter would be able to cling to her illusions that would be it livia said grasping hope as if it were a lifeline thank you for your logic your good sense mrs monk hester pressed her advantage and it was at least in part for livia as well perhaps your brother would stop asking the police so hard to drive the women off the streets she suggested it may have nothing to do with any of them and harrying them will make them even less likely to tell you anything but if they dont know anything livia started they may have seen nothing hester conceded but they will get to hear word passes quickly in places like this i dont know jarvis doesnt listen to before she could finish the train of her thought the street door swung open wide and a young man shouted for help panic harsh in his voice his face was white his hair streaked across his brow in the rain and his thin clothes were sodden and sticking to his narrow chest livia swung around and hester rose to her feet just as a far larger man came staggering in holding a woman in his arms she was so pale her skin looked waxy in the gaslight and her eyes were closed her head lolling as if she were completely insensible put her there hester pointed to the larger empty table avent yer got a bed the large man stifled a sob his face was twisted with emotion anger was so much less painful than the terror which obviously engulfed him hester was accustomed to all kinds of feelings pouring out beyond control and she made no judgment of them no response to those that were unfair i need to see what is wrong she explained i have to have a firm surface and the light put her there he obeyed his eyes imploring her to help to find some answer beyond his imagining hester looked at the girl lying in front of her the man had put her down as gently as he could but it was still clear that her bones were broken her arms and legs lay awkwardly the flesh was swelling and the bruises were darkening even as hester watched the veins in the girls neck and shoulders were blue her skin graywhite she was breathing but her eyelids did not flutter at all can yer elp er the man demanded the youth now beside him ill try hester promised what happened do you know someone beat the ell out of er he exploded cant yer see that yer blind or summink yes i can see that hester said looking at the woman not at him i wanted to know how long ago how you found her if shes been stabbed or cut if you can tell me that without my moving her so much better i can see how her arms and legs are what about her body did you see where she was punched or kicked gawd lady dyer think ida let it appen if iad ida killed the bbastard if id bbin there he stuttered in a futile effort to find a word bad enough for the rage that ate him if yer cant elp er at least don urt er any more yer ear me hester put her hands very gently on the womans arms feeling for the grating edges of bone where the flesh was already misshapen and damaged she found one break in the left arm two in the right the left knee was swollen and at least two small bones were broken in the right foot the collarbone was broken on one side but there was little she could do about that cutting the cloth of the girls bodice she exposed a purple bruise at least six inches wide across the ribs and stretching down below the waist this was what she fearedit meant internal bleeding she could do nothing to help she had a fair knowledge of anatomy mostly learned in the battlefield while looking at the actuality of tornopen bodies not the neater more leisurely education of medical school or dissections of the dead still she knew where the major arteries were and what could happen to them when damaged do something damn yer the man said desperately shifting his immense weight from one foot to the other and back again in his fever of anxiety without answering hester continued to learn as much as she could without moving the broken body of the woman she wished margaret were there to help bessie was kind but she had not the inner calm the steady hands that margaret had she identified too much with the women having lived all her life among them she saw the pain and the fear from the inside and it robbed her of the dispassion needed for practical help in such critical injuries as these go and find mr lockhart she ordered and saw bessies face flood with relief that she could do something useful and at the same time escape the pain she was out of the door without even grasping for her hat hester turned to livia ignoring the man miss baltimore she said firmly would you be good enough to pass me that roll of bandage on the table and then fetch a splint from the cupboard over there she pointed with her other hand in fact fetch three very slowly livia stood up she looked pale enough to faint if you would do it quickly please hester instructed holding out her hand livia obliged still moving as if in a dream fumbling with the bandage rolling in the ends then going to the cupboard she returned after a moment with three splints and passed one across hester took it from her now would you hold the girls shoulders please lean on them i need them to remain still what just do it lean your weight on her shoulders be firm but gentle she looked up go on im going to set these bones so they heal as straight as possible i need someone to hold her still its far kinder to do it while she is insensible anyway can you imagine how it will hurt if we leave it until she regains herself livia stood frozen to the spot you dont catch diseases that way just do it hester snapped i cant set it by myself you came here to find out who killed your father if you cant even bring yourself to look at this world how are you going to learn anything about it you want these people to help you youd better give a little help yourself slowly still looking as if she were going to pass out livia put her hands on the young womans shoulders and leaned forward resting her own bodys weight on them thank you hester acknowledged then she carefully took the lower arm and feeling the sickening grating of bone pulled the limb straight the youth handed her the splint and the bandages his hands gentle as he laid them by the limb and she bound them together as firmly as she dared fortunately there was no broken skin so there was no possibility of infection from dirt but she knew very well that there might be considerable internal bleeding which she could not reach or stop with livias shocked and reluctant help she set the other bones as well the large man stoked the fire and fetched more water hester made poultices for the broken ribs and collarbone and placed them gently on the injuries now all we can do is wait she said at last she gonna be all right the big man asked i dont know she said honestly well do all we can i he swallowed im sorry if i were a bit short wif yer first off im sposed ter keep an eye after er but she don belong round ere dunno wot it er alf the time he passed a huge hand over his face as if he could wipe away his emotions strewth whyd the stupid little cow go moufin off ter someone times ive told er ter keep er mouf shut but they int got the wits they was born wif some o them fink cos a man pays em money es gonna treat em nice some o them swine fink alf a crown buys yer soul bastards he made a low growl in his throat as if he were going to hawk and spit then changed his mind you cant do anything more for her now hester said gently you might as well go home she turned to livia baltimore and you should go home too i suppose your carriage is still somewhere close by yes livia agreed very quietly hester wondered what reception she would get from the maid probably icy with disapproval she dared not voice but she might very well be handing in her notice in the morningand shattering the invalid mrs baltimore with outraged accounts of the whole episode livia would need all her courage and her patience to deal with that thank you for your help hester said with a very slight smile if i learn anything that might be of use to you i shall tell the police livia took a card out of her reticule and handed it across please do either write or call i will hester promised knowing livia hesitated ill walk yer to yer carriage the big man offered livia looked startled then relieved a flash of light crossed her face which could even have been humor thank you she said then went out of the door into coldbath square followed by the man it was ten minutes later that bessie returned with lockhart tired and disheveled as always but perfectly willing to help you dont eat proper bessie chided him as she had apparently been doing ever since she had found him steak and kidney pudding you need she went over to the stove ill get you some ot tea best i can do but its yer own fault she did not explain what she meant by that and lockhart shot a wry look at hester but there was affection in it he understood bessie better than she understood herself hester explained what they had done for the girl and took him over to her he looked at her carefully for a long time but he could not tell hester the one thing she needed to know whether there was internal bleeding or not im sorry he said shaking his head and looking at the girl with pity i just dont know but if shes still no worse by morning she might survive it ill come back midday or so until then you can do as much for her as i can youve made a good job of the bones it was a little after seven and full daylight when hester awoke to find bessie standing over her her eyes bright her hair struggling out of its fierce knot her dress even more rumpled than usual shes come round she said in her penetrating whisper don look too good poor creature yerd better see to er kettles on yer look like summit out o the morgue yerself an all thank you hester said a trifle dryly sitting up and wincing her head throbbed and she was so tired she felt worse than when she had lain down she swung her legs to the floor and stood up aware now of the girl on the other bed only yards away from her eyes open face so white it seemed hardly warmer than the pillow dont move hester said gently youre safe here im all broken inside the girl breathed the words rather than spoke them heavens i hurt her voice was soft her diction clear not that of the streets i know but in time it will ease hester promised hoping it was true no it wont the girl said with resignation im dying thats my punishment i suppose she did not look at hester but stared up at the ceiling with blank eyes hester put her hand over the girls touching it very lightly your bones will heal she told her i know it hurts now but it will get better what shall i call you alice suddenly her eyes filled with tears but she was too weak and too tired to sob she was also too broken to be held in anyones arms just rest hester said aching to be able to do more for her youre safe here we wont leave you alone is there anyone you would like me to tell no she turned to look at hester her eyes frightened please i wont if you dont wish it hester promised dont worry i dont want them to know alice went on let me just die here and be buried wherever they put people no one knows she said it without selfpity she was asking for an end privacy not help hester had no idea whether the girl would recover or not she was uncertain how to help or if she could perhaps the best thing would be to leave her but she could not do that she was compelled by her own inner will for life not to allow someone else to give up to be beaten was another thing but she was not there yet who did this to you she asked dont you want to stop them before they do it to someone else alice turned her head a little you cant stop him no one can anyone can be stopped if you know how and if enough of us try hester said decisively if you help who is he alice looked away again you cant its legal i owe him money i borrowed too much then i couldnt pay it back who your pimp alice stared up at the ceiling you might as well know theres nothing more he can do to me now but i dont know his name not his real name i was respectable then a governess can you imagine that i used to teach gentlemens children in kensington i fell in love there was immeasurable bitterness in her voice and it was so little above a whisper that hester had to strain to hear her we got married we had six months of happiness then i realized he gambled couldnt help it he said maybe he was right anyway he didnt stop he began to lose she took a deep breath and gasped with pain it was a moment or two before she could continue hester waited i borrowed to get him out of debt then he left me alice said only i still had to pay back the money it was then that the moneylender told me he could get me looked after on the streets especially if i went into this brothel it caters to men who like clean girls ones who speak nicely and carry themselves like quality pay a lot more for it that way i could pay off my debt and be free and you went hester said slowly it was so easy to understandthe fear the promises the escape from despair the price might not seem any worse than the alternative not at first alice replied not for another three months by then the debt was twice as high that was two years ago she fell silent bessie came over with a cup of beef tea her eyes questioning hester looked at alice try a little she offered alice did not bother to answer her thoughts were inward remembering pain defeat perhaps humiliation more than she would ever forget hester put her arm around alices shoulders and eased her up a few inches the girl gasped with pain but she did not resist she lay as leaden weight against hester her splintered arms stiff her body rigid bessie held the cup to her lips her own face crumpled with concern her hands so gentle her touch could hardly be felt as more than a warmth it was a quarter of an hour before the tea was finished and hester had no idea whether it had helped or not but she knew of nothing else to try alice sank into a restless sleep and when margaret came in at nearly nine oclock her optimism over raising more funds vanished the moment hester told her of the nights happenings thats monstrous she said furiously you mean someone out there is lending money to respectable women in financial trouble and then demanding they pay it back by working in a brothel that caters to men who like to use women they think are decent to god knows what and now with police all over the place they cant get the trade to pay off so they are getting beaten hester finished for her yes thats exactly what i mean fanny is probably another of them only shes too frightened to tell us she remembered kitty who had also spoken well and carried herself with pride heaven knows how many more there are what are we going to do margaret demanded there was no doubt in her that they would do something she expected no less from hester it was written plainly in her face and in her brave candid stare hester did not want to let her down or any of these women who trusted her to be able to do what they could not but those reasons were trivial above them all was the evil hester so easily imagined could have happened to hundreds of women she knewor to herself had chance been only a little different i dont know she admitted not yet but i will she would ask monk he was clever imaginative and he never gave up a very slight warmth opened up inside her at the certainty of his help he would hate this with exactly the same passion as she did i will she repeated chapter three before hester returned from coldbath square on the morning after alices attack monk received a new client in fitzroy street she came into the room with the air of tension and tightly controlled nervousness that almost all his clients showed he estimated her to be about twentythree and not beautiful although her bearing was so filled with grace and vitality it was a moment or two before he realized it she was dressed in a dark skirt and matching jacket fitted to her waist and the cloth of it was obviously discreetly expensive it sat so perfectly she was carrying a bag much larger than a reticule about a foot or more square mr monk she asked but only as a formality there was an air of purpose about her which made it plain she was there because she knew who he was my name is katrina harcus i believe you undertake enquiries for people privately is that correct how do you do miss harcus he replied gesturing to one of the two large comfortable chairs on either side of the fireplace there was a fire burning today it was spring but still chilly early in the morning and in the evening particularly for anyone sitting still and who might be in a state of some distress you are quite correct please sit down and tell me what i may do to help you she accepted setting the bag at her feet from its shape he guessed it might contain documents of some sort which already marked her as unusual most women who came to him did so about personal matters rather than business jewelry lost a servant who had occasioned their suspicion a prospective sonor daughterinlawabout whom they wished to know more but without betraying themselves by asking any of their own acquaintances he sat down opposite her she cleared her throat as if to dispel her nervousness then began to speak in a low clear voice i am about to become engaged to marry a mr michael dalgarno she could not help smiling as she said his name and there was a brightness in her eyes which made her feelings obvious however she hurried on without waiting for monks acknowledgment or congratulations he is a partner in a large company building railways here her face tightened and monk was aware of increased anxiety in her he was accustomed to watching people minutely the angle of the head the hands knotted together or at ease the shadows in a face anything that told him what emotions people were concealing behind their words he did not interrupt her she took a deep breath and let it out silently this is very difficult mr monk i need to speak in confidence as i would were you my legal adviser she looked at him steadily she had very fine eyes golden brown rather than dark i cannot conceal a crime miss harcus if i have evidence of it he warned but other than that all you say to me is in confidence that is what i had been told forgive me for having to ascertain it for myself but i need to tell you things that i would be most distressed were they repeated unless it is to conceal a crime they will not be and if there is a crime involved she spoke quite steadily and her eyes did not flinch from his but her voice had sunk to a whisper if it is a crime planned then i must seek to prevent it by any means i can including informing the police he answered if it is one that has already happened then i must share with them any knowledge i may come by if i am certain it is true otherwise i would be complicit in the act myself his curiosity was piqued what kind of help did this very composed young woman want from him her manner was unusual it seemed as if her request was going to be even more so he realized how disappointed he would be if it proved to be a case he could not accept i understand she nodded i do fear a crime but i wish you to prevent it if that is possible if i had the skill to do so myself then i would however my greatest concern is to protect michaelmr dalgarno i may be mistaken of course but whether i am or not word of my suspicions must never come out of course not he agreed desiring to spare her the explanation she obviously found painful if they are innocent it would be embarrassing and perhaps worse if they are guilty they must not be warned he saw the relief in her face at his quickness of understanding tell me what you fear and why miss harcus she hesitated reluctant to take the final step of commitment it was not difficult to understand and he waited in silence this is gathered from things mr dalgarno has told me in the course of conversation she began her eyes steady on his face watching and judging his reaction little pieces of information i have overheard and now actual papers which i have brought with me for you to read and consider i she looked away for the first time i took them stole them if you like he was careful not to express shock i see from where she raised her eyes from mr dalgarnos rooms i am worried for him mr monk i think there is fraud being practiced in the building of the new track for the railway and i am very afraid he may be implicated although i am certain he is innocent at least at least i am almost certain sometimes even good people yield to the temptation to turn the other way when their friends are involved in something wrong loyalties can be misplaced especially when you owe much that is good in your life to someone elses generosity and trust in you she looked at him intently as if to judge how much he understood some far memory stabbed him at the thought but he kept his face blank he could not tell her how acute was his feeling for just that kind of obligation and the pain of failure is it a fraud from which mr dalgarno might profit he asked levelly certainly he is a junior partner in the company so if the company made more money then he would also she leaned forward a fraction just a tiny movement but the earnestness in her face was intense i would give everything i have to prove his innocence and protect him from future blame should there be any what is it exactly that you have overheard miss harcus and from whom there was something in the mention of railways that stirred an old memory within himlight and shadows unease a knowledge of pain from before the accident he had rebuilt his life since then created something new and good recognizing and piecing together the facts of himself he had discovered and the shards of memory that had returned but the vast mass of it was lost like a dream somewhere in the mind but inaccessible frightening because it was unknown what detection had shown him was not always pleasant a man driven by ambitionruthless clever brave feared more than liked she was watching him with those intense goldenbrown eyes but she was consumed by her own discomfort talk of great profit which must be kept secret she answered him the new line is due to be completed very soon they are working on the last link now and then it will be ready to open he was struggling to make sense of it to understand why she should imagine dishonesty is it not usual to make a large profit from such an undertaking of course but not one that must be kept secret and and there is something else which i have not yet told you yes her eyes searched his face minutely as if every inflection no matter how tiny were of importance to her it seemed she cared for dalgarno so profoundly that her concern over his involvement was more important to her than anything else a misjudgment of monk could be a disaster she made her decision if there has been fraud and it is to do with the purchase of land then that would be morally very wrong she said but if it concerns the actual building of the track the cutting through hills which is sometimes necessary or the building of bridges and viaducts and something is done which is not right a matter of design or materials do you not see mr monk that the consequences could be far more serious even terrible a memory stirred in him so briefly he was not even sure if he imagined it like a darkness at the edge of the mind what sort of consequence are you thinking of miss harcus she let her breath out in a sigh then gulped the worst i can imagine mr monk would be if a train were to come off the rails and crash it could kill dozens of people even hundreds she stopped the idea of it was too dreadful to allow her to continue train crashthe words moved something inside monk like a bright vicious dagger in his mind he had no idea why certainly a train crash was a fearful thing but was it any worse than loss at sea or any other of a dozen disasters natural or manmade you understand her voice came to him as if from far away yes he said sharply of course i do he forced his attention back to the woman in front of him and her problem you are afraid that some fraud in the construction of the railway whether in the land used or the materials may cause an accident in which many people could lose their lives you think it possible mr dalgarno may share the blame for this even though you believe it extremely unlikely that he would be morally guilty you would like me to find out the truth of the matter before any of this happens and thereby prevent it i am sorry she said softly but she did not lower her gaze i should not have questioned your understanding that is exactly what i would like please before you say anything else look at the papers i have with me i dare not leave them in case they are missed but i believe they matter she reached for the bag at her feet and picked it up she opened it and took out fifteen or twenty sheets of paper and leaned across offering them to him he accepted them almost automatically the first one was folded over and he opened it it was a survey map of a large area of countryside most of it with many hills and valleys and a line of railway track marked clearly through it it took him a moment or two to recognize the names it was in derbyshire on a line running roughly between london and liverpool this is the new line mr dalgarnos company is building he asked she nodded yes it goes through some very beautiful land between mining districts and the big cities it will be used a great deal for both goods and passengers he did not repeat his comment about quite normal profit he had said it once he looked at the next paper which was a map of a much smaller section of the same area and therefore in greater detail this time the grid references were on the corners the scale below and every rise and fall of the land was written in and in most places the actual composition of the soil and rock beneath the surface as he stared at it he had an odd sense of familiarity as if he had seen it before and yet as far as he knew he had never been to any part of derbyshire the names of the towns and villages were unknown to him one or two of the higher peaks were identified and they were equally unknown katrina harcus waited without comment he looked at the next sheet and the next they were deeds to purchase stretches of land he had seen such things often before there would be many of them necessary in the construction of a railway land always belonged to someone railways had to stop at towns if they were to be any use and the way in and out lay through areas that were bound to be built upon it was sometimes a long and difficult matter to acquire a passage through some enthusiasts believed the rights of progress overruled everything else all structures across the path of the railway should be demolished even ancient churches and abbeys monuments to history great works of architecture private homes others took the opposite view and hated the noise and destruction with a violence that did not stop short of action he flicked back to the first map again then he realized what it was that had jolted his memory not the land at all but the fact that it was a surveyors map he had seen such maps before with a proposed railway line penciled through them it had to do with arrol dundas the man who had been his friend and mentor when he had left northumberland as a young man and come south the man to whom he had owed just that kind of loyalty of which katrina harcus had spoken the debt of honor monk had been a banker then determined to make his fortune in finance dundas had taught him how to look and behave like a gentleman how to use charm and skill and his facility with figures to advise in investment and always earn himself a profit at the same time he had deduced much of this from fragmentary facts that came to him in other casesa snatch of recollection a momentary picture in the mindrather than remembered it in any sequence and with it always came the memory of helplessness and pain he had failed terribly overwhelmingly as he looked at the map now the grief engulfed him again arrol dundas was dead monk knew that dundas had died in prison disgraced for something he did not do monk had been there and unable to save him knowing the truth trying repeatedly to make anyone else believe him and always failing but he did not know where nor exactly when somewhere in england before monk had joined the police it was his inability then to effect any kind of justice which had driven him to become part of the law he had not learned more than that perhaps he had not wanted to it was part of the man he used to be and so much of that was not what he admired or wanted anymore his youth belonged to that same hard ambitious man who hungered for success who despised the weak and who all too often disregarded the vulnerable and nothing he could do now would help dundas or retrieve his innocence he had failed then when he knew everything what was to be gained now nothing it was just that the survey map with its proposed railway and the purchase order for land had brought back a past of which he had no knowledge almost as if he had broken from a dream to step into it and it was the reality and everything since only imagination then it was gone again and he was sitting in the present in his own home in fitzroy street holding a sheaf of papers and looking at a troubled young woman who wanted him to prove to the world and perhaps most of all to her that the man she was going to marry was not guilty of fraud may i make notes of some of this miss harcus he asked of course she agreed quickly i wish i could allow you to keep them but they would be missed naturally he admired her courage and the fact that she had taken them at all he rose to his feet and fetched pen and paper from his desk bringing the inkwell back with him and sitting at a small table by his chair he copied rapidly from the first map then the second taking the grid references the names of the principal towns and the main features of the route from the other papers he took the areas prices and names of the previous owners of the land purchased then he looked at the rest that she had handed him there were purchase orders and receipts for an enormous amount of materials including wood steel and dynamite for tools wagons horses food for men and animals and endless wages for the navvies who cut the land built bridges and viaducts laid the track itselfbut also for ostlers blacksmiths wheelwrights carpenters surveyors and a dozen other minor tradesmen and artisans it was a vast undertaking the sums involved amounted to a fortune but building railways had always been about speculation and venture capital about winning or losing everything that is why men like arrol dundas were drawn to it and it needed their skill and willingness to take risks arrol dundas in the past dalgarno now and monk as he had been however many years ago he must read the papers closely he told himself notes were not enough if there were anything fraudulent it would not be in the open for a casual observer to see had it been then katrina harcus herself would have read it and in all probability understood unless of course she had understood but could not bring herself to face dalgarno with it and she wanted monk to stop him before he was committed beyond retreat he read the bills and receipts carefully the expenses seemed reasonable two of them were signed by michael dalgarno the others by a jarvis baltimore the figures were added correctly and there was nothing unaccounted for certainly some of the land purchased was expensive but it was the stretches previously occupied by houses workers cottages tenant farmers the payment did not seem to be more than the land was worth he looked at the last two orders for navvies wages they were what a hardworking and skilled man might expect he flicked down the list masons received twentyfour shillings a week bricklayers were paid the same also carpenters and blacksmiths the navvies who used picks were paid nineteen shillings the shovelers seventeen the last two seemed a trifle high he looked at the signature at the bottommichael dalgarno was that really frauda shilling or two on the price of pickmen he looked at the last one the pickmen were twentyfour shillings the shovelers twentytwo shillings and sixpence the signature was he felt the blood pounding in his head he blinked but his vision did not clear it was there in front of himwilliam monk he heard katrina harcus say something but it was no more than a jumble of sound in his ears this made no sense his name on the order and his hand there was no arguing it he had lost the past up to but since then he remembered everything as well as anyone else date when was it he could prove he had nothing to do with it date there it was at the top just under the company name baltimore and sons august seventeen years ago why was this receipt in with the presentday ones he looked up at katrina harcus she was watching him her eyes bright eager have you found something she said breathlessly should he tell her everything in him shrank from the thought it was his fear to be kept secret until he understood it all she cared about was dalgarno someone had accidentally picked up an extra piece of paper and an old receipt had been mixed in with the current ones it was coincidence that it was the same company but then why not the same there were only so many large manufacturers and builders in the business it was the same area london to the northwest not really such a coincidence not yet his mouth was dry his voice came with an effort the figures seem correct but i shall make notes of all the facts and investigate them from what you have here though there does not seem to be any irregularity i heard them speak of an enormous profit far above and beyond what is usual she said anxiously her brow furrowed if it were there openlyshe gestured to the papersi could have found it myself but i am deeply afraid mr monk firstly for michael his reputation and his honor even his freedom men can go to prison for fraud monk was cold inside he of all people knew that as if it were only days ago hours even he could see dundass white face in the dock as he was sentenced he could remember their last parting and he knew exactly where he had been when mrs dundas had told him of her husbands death he had gone to visit her she was sitting in the dining room he could recall exactly the sunlight through the windows shining bright and hard on the glass cabinets almost obscuring the staffordshire china dogs inside the tea had been cold she had been sitting there by herself time sliding by as if the world had stopped yes i know he said abruptly i will look into the land purchases very carefully and the quality of the materials and that the building is actually what is specified here if there is anything that can cause or contribute to a rail crash i shall find it i promise you miss harcus it was a rash thing to say and he knew it the moment the words were out of his mouth but the compulsion within him was greater than any whispered caution in his mind she relaxed and for the first time since she had entered the room she smiled her smile was dazzling intensely alive making her face almost beautiful she rose to her feet thank you mr monk there is nothing you could say that would make me happier i feel confident that you will do everything i hope indeed you are all i had believed of you she was waiting for the papers could he keep the one with his own name on it no she was watching him there was no possibility she took them from his hand and replaced them in her bag then from her purse she carefully took out five sovereigns and offered them to him will this suffice as a retainer for your services his lips were dry certainly where may i reach you to report anything i find miss harcus the gravity returned to her face i have to practice the utmost discretion it is important that mr dalgarno and indeed the baltimore family have no idea whatsoever of my concern as i am sure you will appreciate of course i do not know whom i may trust or who among my friends would feel a divided loyalty if they were aware of my fears therefore i think it would be prudent of me to place no one at all under that burden i will be in the royal botanic society gardens in the afternoon at two oclock from the day after tomorrow until i see you she smiled very slightly it is no inconvenience to me i have always had a fondness for plants and my presence will not cause any surprise thank you mr monk good day good day miss harcus i will be there as soon as i have anything to tell you he sat for a little while after she had gone reading and rereading his notes apart from the order signed by himself the others made excellent sense it was all exactly what he would have expected obviously they were only samples of a very much larger quantity which would stretch over years of activity but would anyone be blatant enough to alter or corrupt receipts so that someone looking at them could see a discrepancy surely the differences would lie between the paper and the reality for that he would have to go to derbyshire and look at the track itself if on the other hand as seemed far more likely the fraud lay in the purchase of land if he went to the appropriate offices in derbyshire he would be able to find the original copies of the survey and begin to trace the ownership the transfer of money and anything else that was relevant when hester came home at nearly eleven exhausted and frightened by the events of the night he was relieved to see her she was later than usual and he had become anxious he made an effort to put everything to do with railways out of his mind even the fact that his own name had been on one of the orders she had been up all night and obviously wished to speak to him about something so urgently she barely waited until she had sat down no thank you she replied to his offer of tea william there is most despicable business going on in coldbath and she proceeded to tell him about the young women who had been lent money and required to pay it back at extortionate rates of interest by prostituting themselves for the particular tastes of men who liked women of good family it is their pleasure to humiliate them in a way that using an ordinary woman of the streets could never do she said furiously how can we fight it she stared at him with anger burning in her eyes and her cheeks flushing i dont know he replied honestly feeling guilty as he said it hester women have been exploited like that for as long as anyone knows i dont know how to help it except now and then in individual cases she would not accept defeat she sat on the edge of her seat her back rigid her body stiff there has to be something no there doesnt have to be he corrected her not this side of gods justice but if there is and you can find it ill help you all i can in the meantime i have a new case possibly to do with fraud in the building of railways he saw the look of impatience in her face no its not just money he said quickly if a railway track is built on land that is fraudulently obtained or there is an unjust profit that is illegal and immoral but what if it is built on land that is wrongly surveyed that subsides under the weight of a coal train or if the bridges or viaducts are constructed with cheap or substandard materials or labor then you risk having a crash have you thought how many people are killed or injured in a rail crash how many people does a passenger train carry her impatience vanished she let out her breath in a slow sigh there might be land fraud i dont know anything about that but navvies know materials they wouldnt build with anything that wasnt good enough and they wouldnt build in a substandard way she spoke with complete certainty not as if it were an opinion but a fact how on earth would you know that he asked not patronizingly but as if she might have an answer not because he thought she could but because she was tired and had seen too much pain and he did not want to hurt her anymore i know navvies she replied stifling a yawn what he must have misheard how do you know navvies in the crimea she said pushing her hair back off her brow when we were stuck in the siege of sebastopol in the winter of to nine miles from the port of balaclava and with the only road washed out so not even a cart could get through the army was freezing to death or dying of cholera she shook her head a little as if the memory still hurt we had no food no clothes no medicine they sent hundreds of navvies out from england to build us a railway and they did without any help and all through the russian winter they worked and swore and fought each other and it was all finished by march a double track with tributary lines as well and it was perfect she looked at him with a spark of pride and defiance as if they were her own men and perhaps she had nursed a few of them if there had been accidents or fever he tried to picture it the gangs of men laboring to cut a track through the mountains in the middle of the bitter snow thousands of miles from home to relieve the armies who had no other way out he dared not think of the soldiers or of the incompetence which had brought about such a thing you didnt mention that before he said to her nothing brought it to mind she replied stifling another yawn they were all volunteers but i dont think youll find it any different here but look into it see if there has ever been an accident caused by bad excavation or bad building of track see if you can find a tunnel that caved in or a viaduct that collapsed or rails that were built on bad ground or at the wrong incline or anything else that was the navvies doing i will he agreed now go to bed youve done all you can he reached out and put his hand over hers dont think about the usurer and the women theres always going to be violence you cant stop it all you can do is try to help the victims that seems pretty pathetic she said angrily its like the police he said with a halfsmile we never prevented crime from happening we only caught people afterwards you took them to the courts she argued sometimes not always do the best you can dont cripple yourself by agonizing over what you cant reach she conceded giving him a quick gentle kiss and then all but stumbled her way to the bedroom monk left the house and went into the city to begin searching for the information which would help him answer katrina harcuss questions he tried to concentrate but nagging like a constant dull toothache was the sight of his own name on the receipt of baltimore and sons from seventeen years before he did not even think of denying it was his he had recognized it beyond doubt the familiar bold writing more assertive than now written by the man he used to be before he looked more closely at himself and knew how others perceived him he went to see a merchant banker for whom he had solved a small domestic mystery to his great satisfaction baltimore and sons john wedgewood said hiding his curiosity with difficulty they were sitting in his oakpaneled office a crystal tantalus was on the side table but monk had declined whiskey wellrespected company financially sound enough wedgewood went on a great tragedy especially for the family i take it that it is the family who has asked you to investigate dont trust the police he pursed his lips very wise but youll need to move very swiftly if you are to forestall scandal monk had no idea what the man was talking about it must have been clear from his face because wedgewood understood before monk had time to frame a reply nolan baltimore was found dead in a brothel in london wedgewood said puckering his brow with distaste and something which might or might not have been sympathy i apologize i rather leaped to the conclusion that you had been asked to find the truth of the matter before the police and if possible to persuade them into some sort of discretion no monk answered wondering for an instant why he had not read about the case in newspaper headlines then realizing the answer before the question was on his tongue it must be the murder hester had referred to and which had set the police buzzing around the farringdon street area in what was very probably a hopeless quest no doubt the press would learn the reason for all the activity soon enough they had only to ask one of the local inhabitants sufficiently inconvenienced and sooner or later the story would emerge suitably dramatized no he repeated i am interested in the reputation of the company not mr baltimore personally how good is their work what skill and honesty have their men wedgewood frowned in what regard all regards are you asking on behalf of someone interested in investment in a manner of speaking it was true enough katrina harcus was investing her life her future in michael dalgarno financially sound wedgewood said without hesitation werent always had a shaky spell fifteen or sixteen years ago but weathered it dont know what theirs was about specifically but a lot of people did then great age of expansion people took risks their workmanship monk asked wedgewood looked a little surprised they use the traveling navvies the same as everyone else platelayers miners masons bricklayers carpenters and blacksmithsall that sort of thing and there are engine men and fitters foremen timekeepers clerks draftsmen and engineers he shrugged slightly looking at monk with puzzlement but theyre all competent or they wouldnt last the men themselves see to that their lives depend on every man doing what he should and doing it right best workmen in the world and the world knows it british navvies have built railways all over europe and america africa russia and no doubt will go to india and china as well and south america too why not they all need railways everybody does monk steeled himself to ask the question he dreaded what about accidents crashes god knows how many men get killed in the construction wedgewood pursed his lips a flicker of anger and sadness in his eyes but i never heard of one that was down to poor building substandard materials monk asked wedgewood shook his head they know their materials monk no navvy is going to put in the wrong stone or wood or anything else they know what theyre doing they have to dont shore up a wall properly or put in insufficient timber and the whole lot will come down on top of you its my business to know and ive never heard an instance of navvies getting it wrong but there have been accidents monk insisted crashes people killed wedgewoods eyes widened of course there have god help us terrible ones but they were nothing to do with the track what then monk found himself holding his breath not for katrina harcus but for himself it was arrol dundas who filled his mind and his own guilt in whatever had happened seventeen years ago all sorts of things wedgewood was looking at him curiously driver error overloaded wagons bad brakes signals wrong he leaned forward a little what are you after monk if someone wants to invest in baltimore and sons all they have to do is ask in the financial community anywhere they dont need a private agent of enquiry for that any merchant banker would do i have a nervous client monk admitted what about unsuitable land no such thing wedgewood replied instantly good navvies can build on anything and they do sand swamps evenit just costs more they need to lay pontoons or sink stilts until they come to bedrock are you sure you arent after his personal life monk smiled yes i am sure the baltimore family is not my client nor is anyone related to them i have no concern in his death unless it has to do with his railways honesty or safety i doubt it has wedgewood said ruefully just a very regrettable lapse of personal judgment monk thanked him and left to pursue the other idea nagging more and more insistently in his mind perhaps no one would risk a fraud in which one sharpeyed navvy might betray him and the amounts of profit he made might be small far easier and less dangerous and certainly with more money to be made from it would be something to do with the purchase of the land for the track he did not mention this to hester it was far more real closer to him and not to be laid so easily at some anonymous door although he had no memory he could pin down there was nothing but a nameless anxiety something dark at the back of his mind the following day he started specific enquiries who decided where a railway line should run what provisions were there for obtaining the land where did the money come from who surveyed it who bought it it was not until he had answered these questions all ending back with the railway company that it crossed his mind to wonder what happened to the dispossessed who had once lived in the houses knocked down to make room for progress or to those who had worked the land now divided or gouged out for cuttings none of the answers surprised him as if he had once known them as easily as did the small neat clerk who sat across the office table from him the clerk looked slightly baffled at the question they move to live somewhere else sir they can hardly stay there do they all agree to that no sir not quietly the clerk acceded an sometimes if its a big estatearistocracy or the likethen the railway just as ter go round it no choice em as as got the power in parliament or that can see their land dont get cut up an o course theres gentry what object like mad to their unting being sliced in alf grouse and pheasants monk asked with slight surprise he had imagined farmland foxes actually the clerk corrected him likes ter ride after em an cant get orses ter jump tracks like they do edges an all the light in his eyes betrayed a certain satisfaction in this but he did not elaborate he had long ago learned not to have personal opinions as far as anyone else would know i see monk acknowledged yer bin abroad sir why i was jus wonderin ow yer missed knowin all this kind o thing lot o fuss about it in the papers goin back a bit like protests an all work o the devil railways if the good lordad meant us ter travel that way an at that speed ed ave made us with steel skins an wheels on our feet and if he hadnt meant us to think he wouldnt have given us brains monk countered immediately and even as the words were on his tongue he heard an echo of them as if he had said them before yer try tellin that to some o them ministers oos churches get knocked down an moved the clerks face was eloquent of his awe and an amusement he was trying hard to suppress knocked down and moved monk repeated the words as if they were incredible but he believed themin fact he knew they were true again memory had jabbed at him and then disappeared for an instant he saw a lean face dark with outrage above a clerical collar then it was gone yes of course he said quickly he did not want the man to tell him more about it the memory was unpleasant touched with guilt o course they protest the clerk shrugged his shoulders all kinds of em out by the score talk about mammon an the devil an ruin of the land an so on he scratched his head ave ter say i wouldnt take kindly if it were me mam an dad oos gravestones were took up an they was left ter lie under the tracks o the five fortyfive from paddington or whatever i reckon id be out there wi placards in me and an threatenin ellfire on the profiteers as did it has anybody ever done more than threaten monk had to ask if he did not the question would remain in his mind written across everything else until he found the answer anyone ever sabotage a line the clerks eyebrows rose almost halfway up his forehead yer mean blow up a train gawd i ope not he bit his lip come ter think on it though thereve bin a few nasty crashes one or two of em nobody knows for sure ow they appened usually blame the driver or the brakeman there was a real bad one up liverpool way about sixteen years ago an that was one asad a church removed an the vicar was right cut up about it he stared at monk with increasing horror terrible one that was i was still livin at ome an i can remember me dad comin inter the parlor is face white as the tablecloth an no newspaper in is and it was a sunday dinnertime wed bin ter church so weadnt seen the early papers weres the papers george me mam askedim we int gettin no papers terday lizzie e answered er nor you neither robert e adds ter me theres bin a terrible crash up liverpool way near an undred people killed an only god in is eaven knows ow many injured im atellin yer because yerll ear it any road but don go lookin at no paper theres things in there yer don wanna know pictures they drawed yer don wanna see that was ter protect me mam o course but you looked monk said knowing the answer o course the clerks face was pale at the memory an i wished iadnt wot me dad never said fer me mams sake was that a coal trainad it a load o children on an oliday outing one o them excursion trains they was all comin ome from a day at the seaside poor little beggars his mouth was tight with grief and he blinked away the vision even now as if he could see the artists impressions back in front of him with all their horror and pain the mangled bodies in the wreckage rescuers trying desperately to reach them while there was still time driven to try and terrified of what they would find was that what waited buried at the back of monks mind like a plague pit waiting to be opened what kind of a man was he that he could have had any parteven any knowledgeof a thing like that and forgotten it why if hed had no part in it did it not stay an innocent grief such as this man felt what had he done then who had he been before that night nearly seven years ago when in an instant he had been obliterated and recreated again washed clean in his mind but in his body still the same person still responsible was there anything on earth as important as learning that or as terrible what caused the crash he heard his own voice as if from far away a stranger speaking in the silence dunno the clerk said softly they never found out blamed the driver and the brakemen like i said thats the easiest seein as they were dead an couldnt say nothin diffrent coulda bin them oo knows who laid the tracks dunno sir but they was perfick bin used ever since an nothin elses ever appened where was it exactly cant remember sir it wasnt the only rail crash o course i just remember cos it were the worst it bein children like something caused it monk insisted trains dont crash for no reason he longed to be told it was human error for certain nothing to do with the planning or building of the line but without proof he could not believe it arrol dundas had been tried and sent to prison the jury had believed him guilty of fraud why what fraud monk knew nothing about it now but what had he known then could he have saved dundas if he had been prepared to admit his own part that was the fear that crowded in on him from all sides like the oncoming of night threatening to snatch back from him all the warmth and the sweetness he had won in the present i dunno the clerk insisted nobody knew that sir or if they did they werent tellin no of course not im sorry monk apologized where can i find out about land acquisition and surveying for railways best go ter the nearest county town for the track in question the clerk replied if yer want that old one go ter liverpool i reckon an start from there derbyshire derby i suppose that was not really a question he had supplied his own answer thank you yer welcome im sure i ope its some use to yer the clerk said graciously yes yes thank you monk left the office in something of a daze liverpool was what mattered but if he found out whatever land purchase was concerned in the present baltimore line at least he would be familiar with the mechanics of it liverpool had waited sixteen years and he had to report back to katrina harcus if it had been fraud which had somehow caused the first crash he was morally obliged more than any other man to prevent it from recurring he could not go off to liverpool chasing the demons of his memory and allow the whole nightmare to happen again because he was too preoccupied to attend to it he went back to fitzroy street to collect clean clothes and sufficient money and to tell hester where he was going and why then he took a hansom to euston station and the next train to derby the journey cost nineteen shillings and threepence and took nearly four hours with a change at rugby which he was glad of the secondclass carriage was divided into three compartments each less than five feet long and with twelve bare narrow wooden seats in it the compartments did not connect and the partitions were covered with advertising posters the whole was only five feet high which meant that monk had to duck to avoid hitting his head firstclass would have been higher but also more expensive and not necessarily any warmer or cleaneralthough the louvered windows would have stopped vendors from sticking their heads in at the stations and breathing gin on the occupants it was a chilly day alternate sun and rain which was usual for late march and of course there was no heating on the train the metal foot warmers filled with hot water were restricted to firstclass still it was a lot better than the nicknamed parliamentary trains required to fill lord palmerstons legislation that rail travel should be available to the ordinary people at a penny a mile monk was delighted to get out at rugby and stretch his legs use the convenience and buy a sandwich from one of the peddlers on the platform he also bought a newspaper to read on the next part of the journey having been in america at the very beginning of the civil war which was raging there he was interested to see an article on the progress of the union troops under a major general samuel r curtis beginning a campaign in missouri according to the latest dispatches the confederates outnumbered had withdrawn to northwestern arkansas he remembered with a shiver of grief the slaughter he had witnessed in the battle he had been caught up in during the previous summer the uncontrollable horror he had felt and hesters courage in helping the wounded his admiration for her had never been more intense more based in the hideous reality of the broken bodies she tried to save everything he had ever thought or felt about her before was seen through different eyes her anger her impatience the cutting edge of some of her words now passionately understood he looked at the peaceful countryside through the carriage windows with a sharper gratitude for it and an upsurging will to protect it preserve it from violence or indifference he was pleased when the train pulled into the station in derby and he was able to begin his search he spent all day in the city records offices looking at every purchase along the entire track from one border of the county to the other until his eyes ached and the pages swam in front of him but he found nothing illegal certainly there were profits made advantage taken of ignorance and hundreds of families dispossessed of their homesalthough there was also some effort made to find them new housesand an enormous amount of money had changed hands monk tried to bring back the skills he must have had with figures in his banking days in order to understand exactly what had happened and where the profit had gone he pored over the pages but if there had been any transgression it was too cleverly hidden for him to find perhaps he would have seen it sixteen or seventeen years ago but if he had had that skill then he had lost it since railways were progress in a country like england with its mines and stockyards and shipbuilding its cotton mills and factories canals would inevitably have given way to faster more adaptable railways that could cut through mountains climb hills and cross valleys without the timeconsuming and expensive business of locks filling and emptying and the moving of tons of water the destruction along the way was merely a part of that progress that there was no art or skill to avoid farmers landed gentry vicars or the tenants of villages or towns would not have liked canals any better he saw articles with drawings of protestors holding placards cartoons in newspapers and periodicals calling the roaring steambelching iron engines the work of satan whereas in fact they were only the work of industry and time corruption if there was any was in the nature of man he sat until his head ached and his shoulders were stiff searching every record he had determined to there was gain and loss but it was only the ordinary fortunes of commerce there were stupid decisions beside those that he could have foreseen as mistaken with the wisdom of some halfrecollected experience and of course there were those which were simply bad luckbut there was good luck as well there were errors of judgment but small a matter of distance a mismeasurement here or there as he pored over the pages the work became more and more familiar to him time stopped like a wheel moving a cog and he could have looked up from the lamplight on the papers to see dundas smiling at him not the empty inn bedroom or the lonely tables of the records office or the library it was the second night that he awoke in the dark lying rigid in the bed startled by the silence and with no idea at all where he was there were still shouting voices in his headfurious accusing people jostling each other white faces twisted with grief he was breathless as if he had been running without realizing it he had sat up in the bed his body was stiff what was the dream he wanted to escape run and run and leave it behind him forever and yet if he did it would follow him his mind knew that if you fled your fears they pursued you he could remember that much from the coach crash which had taken his past and from the nightmares that had followed it nothing in him was willing to turn and look at those accusing faces he felt almost bruised by them as if they could physically have touched him so real had they been but there was no escape because they were inside him part of his mind his identity very slowly he lay down again against sheets that were now cold he was shivering the fear was still there some nameless horror that even when he found the courage to look or could no longer help it held no form he could remember the anger the loss but the faces themselves were gone what did they think he had done taken their land cut a farm in half ruined an estate demolished houses even desecrated a burial ground it was not personal he had been acting for the railway but it was acutely personal to those who lost what was more personal than your home or the land your fathers and their fathers had farmed for generations or the earth in which your familys bones were buried was that what it was the blind terrified resistance to change then he was not guilty of anything but being the instrument of progress so why did his body ache and why was he afraid to go back to sleep because of the demons in his mind which would return when he had no guard to keep them out was it not land but the infinitely worse thing he dared not think of at all the crash he had found nothing except the possibility that baltimore and sons had made too much profit from the land where the track had been diverted around the hill he had climbed with so much pleasure another older survey had made it at least fifty feet less with a skillful mixture of gradient and cutting a tunnel would have been unnecessary but the blasting would still have been expensive granite was hard and moving it was costly was the profit enough to justify calling it fraud only if he could prove foreknowledge and intent and even then it was open to doubt chapter four the following morning it took monk an hour and a half after leaving the town to reach the workings of the new railway it was a fine day with a light wind rippling the grass carrying the scents of earth and spring and the sound of sheep in the distance from the height of the horses back he could see the hawthorn hedges sweeping low already with leaves bursting later he knew they would be heaped with white blossoms almost to the ground he was following a track that climbed slowly up toward the summit over a mile away beyond which lay the last curve of the railway line the breeze was light and cool in his face and sweet with the smell of earth and grass there was an acute pleasure in feeling the strength of a good animal beneath him it was a long time since he had ridden yet the moment he had swung up into the saddle there was a familiarity to it and he was at ease these great rolling spaces were at once a freedom and a resurrection of something quite different far away to his right he could see the roofs of a village half hidden by trees the church spire towering above them and elms scattered over green parkland a rabbit shot out of the grass almost at the horses feet white tail flashing and ran a dozen yards before disappearing again he half turned to speak smiling prepared to say how surprised he was to see it and then realized with a jolt that there was no one else with him whom had he expected he could see him as clearly as if he had been there a tall man with white hair a lean face prominent nose and dark eyes he would be smiling also knowing exactly what monk meant so there was no need to elaborate on it it was a comfortable thought arrol dundas monk knew it as surely as if it had happened they had ridden together on bright spring days like this up hills in all kinds of country towards rail tracks half finished where hundreds of navvies worked he could hear the sounds of shouting the thud of picks on earth the ring as the iron hit stone the rumble of wheels on boards as if they were only beyond the rise he saw in his minds eye the bent backs of men bearded as navvies nearly all were lifting shovels pushing barrows of rock and earth urging the horses on he and dundas would be going to see the progress to estimate the time till completion or to sort out some problem or other here there was silence but for the wind carrying the distant sounds of cattle and sheep the occasional bark of a dog half a mile away he could see a cart moving along a lane but he could not hear the sound of the wheels in the muddy ruts the cart was too far away what kind of problems protesters angry villagers farmers whose land was divided saying their cows were giving no milk because of the disturbance and when the engines were roaring through shattering the peace of the fields it would only be worse it was different in towns houses were knocked down and scores of people hundreds were dispossessed he dimly remembered some plan to use the arches of viaducts to house the homeless there were to be three classes of accommodationdifferent qualities different prices the lowest was to be on clean straw and free he could not remember if it had ever come about but there had been no moral or practical decision to make it was progress and inevitable he tried to snatch back more detail of memory not the emotional but the practical what had they spoken of what did he know of the land purchases in detail what was the fraud involved wedgewood had said there was no such thing as land across which it was not possible to make a track it was only a question of cost and navvies knew how to set up rails on pontoons if necessary which could cross marshland shifting streams subsidence anything you cared to think of they tunneled through shale or clay chalk sandstone anything at all again it was only cost which made the difference back to money all land had to be purchased was it as simple as money passed back to the officer of the company who decided which route to take a track diverted from one path to another the officer bribed by the landowner in order to keep his property intact or otherwise worthless land sold at an inflated price and the profits shared back with the officer straight into his own pocket defrauding the company and the investors that was obvious but was it so much that it had been overlooked at least for a while what arrogance to imagine they could escape forever had dundas been arrogant monk tried again to recapture a sense of the man he had once known so well and the harder he looked the more any clear remembrance evaded him it was as if he could see it only in the corner of his vision focus on it and it vanished the wind was growing warmer across the grass and far above him piercingly sweet he heard skylarks singing it was timeless it must have been like this when trains were only a thing of the imagination when wellingtons armies gathered to cross the channel or marlboroughs or henry viiis for that matter bound for the field of the cloth of gold why could he not turn in the saddle now and catch some clearer glimpse of dundas the brightness of the sun on his face brought back a feeling of affection and wellbeing but it was no more than that a remembrance of being utterly comfortable with someone laughing at the same jokes a kind of happiness in the past that was gone because dundas was dead he had died alone in a prison disgraced his life ruined his wife isolated no longer able to live in the city that had been her home had he had children monk thought not there were none he could recall in a sense monk himself had been son to him the young man he had nurtured and taught to whom he had passed on his knowledge his love of fine things of arts and pleasures good books good food good wine good clothes monk remembered something of a beautiful desk wood like silk shining inlaid a depth to the color like light through a goblet of brandy he had a sudden sharp vision of himself standing before the looking glass in a tailors rooms younger thinner in the shoulders and chest and dundas behind him his face so clear the tiny lines in the skin around his eyes were etched sharply telling of years of squinting against the light and quick laughter for heavens sake stand up straight he had said and change that cravat tie it properly you look like a popinjay monk had felt crushed he had thought it rather stylish he knew later that dundas was right he was always right in matters of taste monk had absorbed it like blotting paper taking a blurred but recognizable print of his mentor what had happened to dundass money if he had been found guilty of fraud there must have been a profit somewhere had he spent it perhaps on fine clothes pictures wine or had it been confiscated monk had no idea he breasted the rise and the panorama that spread out in front of him took his breath away fields and moorlands stretched to the farther hills five or six miles distant and around the curve of the escarpment on which he sat the unfinished track snaked over farmland and open tussock toward the sudden dip of a stream and an adjoining marshy stretch across which spanned the incomplete arches of a viaduct when it was finished it would be over a mile long it was a thing of extraordinary beauty the sheer engineering skill of it filled him with a sense of exhilaration almost spiritual uplift at the possibilities of man and the certainty in his own mind of what it would be when the last tie was driven in the great iron engines with more power than hundreds of horses would carry tons of goods or scores of people at breakneck speeds from city to city without resting it was a marvelous complicated beauty of strength the force of nature harnessed by the genius of man to serve the future he remembered his own words itll be on time he could see dundass face as clearly as if he had been there hair a little windblown skin burned narrowing his eyes against the light monk was stung by loneliness that there was nothing but miles of empty grass rippling over the long curve toward the valley broken by a few wildflowers white and gold in the green he could remember the joy of it like a beat in the blood it was not money or gain of any natural things it was the accomplishment the moment when they heard the whistle in the distance and saw the white plume of steam and heard the roar of the train as it swept into view a creation of immense superb totally disciplined power it was a kind of perfection dundas had felt exactly the same monk knew that with certainty he could hear the vibrancy in his mentors voice as if he had just spoken see it in his face his eyes time and again they had ridden until they were exhausted just to see a great engine boiler fired belching steam begin to move on some inaugural journey he could see those engines green paint gleaming steel polished great wheels silent on the track until the whistle blew the excitement was at fever pitch the railmen with faces beaming as at last the great beast stirred like a giant waking it would gather speed slowlya puff a gasp a turn of the wheels another and another the power as huge and inevitable as an avalanche albeit manmade and mancontrolled it was one of the greatest achievements of the age it would change the face of nations eventually of the world to have a part in it was to shape history dundas had said that they were not monks words he could hear dundass voice in his head deep a little edge to it a preciseness as if he had practiced to lose some accent he disliked just as he had taught monk to lose his lilting country northumbrian what had monk really felt for arrol dundas it had probably begun with ambition and he hoped gratitude surely later on affection had been the greater part what he remembered now was the sense of loss the absence of that warmth of friendship and the certainty of having owed dundas so much more than knowledge and advantage but things of the inner self that could never be repaid he tried to put together more of the pieces memories of laughter shared simple fellowship in traveling it was not only riding up hills like this on horseback but sitting in public houses somewhere the sun shining on a stretch of grass by a canal bread and pickles and the smell of ale voices he could not place but the feeling was the samecomfortable looking to both past and future without fear or darkness it should have been like that now he had found the woman he truly loved far better for him than the women he had wanted then or thought he wanted in spite of the fear at the front of his mind he smiled at his own ignorance not of them so much as of himself he had thought he wanted softness pliancy someone to answer his physical hungers be there to provide the home that was the background for his success and at the same time not intrude into his ambitions hester was always intruding whether he intended her to be or not she was part of all his life her courage and her intelligence made it impossible for him to exclude her she demanded his emotions she was a companion of his mind and his dreams as well as of his physical self what he imagined women to be had been startlingly incomplete at least he had not committed himself to someone else and hurt both himself and whoever she had been he jerked himself back to the present and stared below him there were laborers all over the place hundreds of them swarming tiny and foreshortened in the distance about half a mile before the viaduct there was a ridge and they were cutting through it he could see the pale scar of the rock face and the slope where men were running the barrowloads of earth and stones up to the top balancing with high skill on the narrow planks it was one of the most dangerous jobs he knew that a slip could cause a fall with the weight of the load crashing on top of him they were almost through it was not quite high enough to require a tunnel he could remember the brickwork the digging the shoringup of tunnels the smell of clay was in his nostrils as if he had left it minutes ago and the steady sound of dripping from roofs the wet splashes on the head and shoulders he knew the labor was backbreaking men sometimes worked for thirtysix hours with no more than a few minutes for food then were replaced by another shift also working night and day he urged his horse forward and went carefully down the incline following what track there was until he was on the level and only a hundred yards from the rail now the noise was all around him the thud of pick heads hitting rock and earth the rattle of wheels on the wooden runs up the cutting the ring of hammers on steel voices the nearest man to him looked up his shovel idle in his hands for a moment his back straightening slowly his skin was caked with dust and the sweat cut rivulets through it he regarded monks casual clothes and wellcut boots and the horse standing at his shoulder yer one o the surveyors men he asked e int ere yet yer a day soon he half turned eh edgeog he shouted at a short heavyshouldered man with a shock of gingery hair yer sure yer in the right place then there was a guffaw of laughter from half a dozen men further away and they all resumed their digging and shoveling hedgehog screwed up his face no con wed better start all over an dig through that damn great ill over there he replied three weeks mebbe con said to monk if thats wot yer want ter know i int seed yer ere before yer come up from lunnon apparently they assumed he was from baltimore and sons main office wheres your foreman monk enquired im the foreman contrairy york the first man replied like i said three weeks cant do it no faster i can see that monk squinted along the line of the rail the last bit of the viaduct would take another two weeks at least and then there were sleepers to lay the rails themselves to lay and tie it was double track most of the way single through the cutting and as far as the other end of the viaduct there must be a plan for timetables and trains passing a length like this was far too expensive to use only one engine at a time on he had studied the survey map the shortest route lay through the hill he had just crossed couldnt you have cut through that he asked then you would have avoided having to build a viaduct course we could contrairy said dismissively cost though too igh fer a straight cuttin an tunnels are about the most expensive things there is look at yer map see the eight on it an granite takes time an all monk swung around and looked up at the hill he pulled out the map from his pocket and read the height on it then looked at the crest of the rise again something flashed in his memory and was gone before he caught it but it was a moment of unease nothing more nothing he could explain he should check the alternative routes see who owned which land where the vested interests lay estimate the costs of cutting and tunneling the hill for a direct route compared with the small cutting there was here and the viaduct and the extra land and length of rail it would be a long tedious task but the answer if there was one lay in the figures he had had the skill once it had been where his business lay his and dundass that was a chill thought he would rather not have owned but it would not go away he thanked the navvy mounted his horse again and rode slowly back up the slope thinking he had studied the surveyors maps and reports and baltimore and sons estimate of costs for rerouting on paper it seemed reasonable the investors had accepted it some of the new land necessary was expensive but the land for the old route had been expensive also it was the hidden costs that would make the difference the bribes to do one thing or another what to purchase what to avoid that could be where the fraud lay it was warm here even with the very slight breeze ruffling the grass a rabbit popped up gazed around then bolted twenty yards its white tail flashing until it disappeared down a hole it was a moment before it meant anything to him he searched his memory it was the rabbit it signified something he was on another hillside in the sun but colder a wind out of the east clouds scudding across the sky and a sense of darkness in spite of the bright light he remembered he had watched a rabbit sit in the sun nose twitching then take fright and run going into a hole he had seen it with a slowdawning horror why what could be more ordinary than a rabbit in the grass running away and diving down one of its own holes into a vast warren riddling a hillside doubtless it would emerge somewhere else a hundred yards away except that if a rabbit could dig through the hillside and build tunnels using nothing but its feet then an army of navvies with explosives would have little trouble digging a tunnel for a train the hill could not possibly be granite the survey had lied he could remember it now the shock of realization the gaslight wavering on the paper as he opened it out on the table in his hotel bedroom and read the legend on the map but he could not recall what else there had been try as he might sitting there now with the sun and wind on his face and his eyes closed attempting to recreate the past of course there was profit in some land and not in other but surely the investors had also checked they must have representatives who were aware of that it would have to have been cleverer far subtler than simply a lie whether the land were granite instead of clay or chalk or conglomerate or whatever the hill was actually composed of and always in the back of his mind there was the jumbled horror of something dark unclear and violent the rending of steel the scream of tearing metal sparks in the night then flame and through it all fear so dreadful it cramped the stomach and locked the muscles in pain but there seemed nothing to connect the two arrol dundas had been convicted of fraud guilty or not there had been a crash which monk seemed to remember and shortly after dundass death he had left merchant banking and gone into the police force driven by the passion to serve justice in future which had to mean he had believed with a passion that there had been injustice then but he could do nothing more here to help katrina harcus or learn any greater truth about michael dalgarno if there were fraud at baltimore and sons then dalgarno was almost certainly involved in it but it was merely profiting unjustly from land purchase there was nothing to cause injury to anyone except the loss of possible profit to the investors that was yet to be proved and speculation was always as likely to end in loss as in gain he could call for an official audit if any evidence warranted it it was time he stopped evading the old truth that lay at the core of his fear remembered pieces were little help he must use the detective skills he had refined so well if he wanted to know it for a client where would he begin were it himself and not dalgarno that he were investigating for katrina harcus begin with the known facts that could be checked and proven without the possibility of misinterpretation he knew the date on the work order with his own name on it that katrina had handed to him with the others that was proof that he had once worked for baltimore and sons but not where and not that he had had anything to do with the fraud for which dundas had been convicted could there be more than one fraud no too much of a coincidence nonsenselies to comfort of course there could a man who will defraud once will adopt it as a pattern if he gets away with it the question then became was dundas caught on his first attempt or on the second or third or the twentieth with a jolt so sharp he startled his horse by the sudden change in his hands on the reins monk realized he had actually admitted the possibility that dundas had been guilty in fact he had assumed it what a betrayal of the belief he had held without shadow all his life until now he turned his horse to head up the track and around the long slope of the hill back toward the ostlers where he had hired it and the railway station back to london where would he find the history of dundass bank and its dealings he did not even know in which city they had been headquartered it could be any of a dozen or more presumably dundas would have been imprisoned at the closest place to the court in which he was tried and that in turn would be the nearest large city to the scene of the fraud itself or could it be where the principal investors banked he was still considering where to begin when he rode into the ostlers yard and dismounted reluctantly it was a good animal and he had enjoyed riding even though it brought the best memories cutting sharp with loss he paid the ostler and walked out of the yard with its smells of leather straw and horses and the sounds of hooves on stone and mens voices soft as they talked to animals he did not look back he did not want to see it although it was clear in his mind the stationmaster was on the platform standing almost at attention with his tall top hat shining in the sun and his crimean medals on his chest monk did not know what each one meant but hester would have he spoke to the man briefly then paced the platform waiting for the next train his original intention had been to return to london with whatever further information he had for katrina harcus the promise he had made her was still strong in his mind at least he was one step further forward in that like the other this present railway was also rerouted around a hill that had been falsely surveyed it would have been perfectly possible and cheaper to have blasted through it first by cuttings then if necessary tunneling if necessary something else tugged at his memory something about grid references for areas on the map but he could not unravel it everything he caught hold of slipped meaninglessly out of his mind taking him nowhere he heard the train before it came into sight around the curve in the track shining roaring billowing steam and drew to a halt with a hiss and clank of metal the driver was grinning the stoker smutstained wiped a heavy hand across his brow smearing coal dust on his skin there was a bang of opening and closing doors someone struggled with a wooden box a porter ran forward monk climbed into a secondclass carriage again and sat down on one of the hard wooden seats a few minutes later the whistle blew and the train jolted forward and began to pick up speed the journey to london seemed endless full of stops where he could get off stretch his legs and get on again they rattled over the rails rhythmically jolted from side to side he drifted into sleep filled with dreams and woke stiff and aware of waiting for something terrible he forced himself to stay awake eyes wide open watching the countryside slide past him was katrina right and nolan baltimore had discovered the land fraud and dalgarno had murdered him to keep him silent but the old receipt with monks name on it was from seventeen years ago and the fraud that had ruined arrol dundas had happened shortly after that long before dalgarno could possibly have had any position with the company at all he would barely have been out of school had that first fraud been practiced on baltimore and sons at all or was monks connection with them coincidence if dundass bank had made a business of financing railways he might have been connected with many but the fraud was the same or it seemed the same he could remember the rabbits the rerouting on the longer track the protestors the anger the questions as to which land was to be used and the accusations of profiteering was he transplanting all that from the past and his own broken memory into the present where it did not belong no katrina harcus had come to him because she had overheard dalgarno and jarvis baltimore talking of large and dangerous profits that must be kept secret and she feared fraud that was fact nothing to do with memory true or false and very much in the present as was nolan baltimores murder whether it had anything to do with the railway or not the train pulled into euston at last and monk got out and hurried along the platform jostled by tired and impatient travelers the huge space beyond the platform arched over by a magnificent roof was filled with peddlers people hurrying to catch outgoing trains porters with boxes and cases friends and relatives come to meet those arriving or to wish goodbye to those leaving coachmen looked for their masters or mistresses a paperboy was calling out the latest news hurrying past him monk heard something about the union troops in america having captured roanoke island on the kentucky border the violence and tragedy of that war seemed very far away the searing heat and dust and blood of the battle he and hester had been caught up in were in another world now when at last he got home he found hester asleep curled over in the bed as if she had reached to touch him and found him not there one arm was still outstretched he stood still for several moments hesitating whether to waken her or not the fact that she did not stir unaware of him told him how tired she must be there were times when his own impulse would have woken her anyway she would not have minded she would have smiled and turned to him now he resisted what would he say to her that he had found nothing in derby except ghosts of familiarity that he could not place that there was a crash in the past which was so terrible he could neither remember it nor forget it and he dared not look at the reasons because he was afraid that they involved some kind of guilt but he had no idea for what and he had nothing yet that would help his client he turned away and went to wash shave and change into clean clothes hester was still asleep when he left to go to the royal botanic gardens to meet with katrina harcus it was a bright windy march afternoon and a score of people had chosen to spend it admiring the early flowers the vivid green of the grass and the giant trees still bare wind gusting noisily through the branches in spite of the brilliant light the ladies had abandoned parasols as it was now and again both hands were needed to keep hats in place and skirts from being whipped and lifted above petticoats he saw katrina after a moment there was a distinction about her bearing which marked her out apparently she recognized him just as quickly and came over without any pretense that it was a casual meeting her face was flushed but that might have been the wind and sun rather than any expectation so soon mr monk she stopped in front of him breathlessly what have you learned an elderly gentleman out walking alone turned and smiled at them indulgently no doubt mistaking it for a lovers meeting another couple walking arm in arm nodded and moved even closer to each other very little miss harcus he replied quietly this was not a conversation he wished overheard her eyes dropped and disappointment filled her face too acute to be concealed i have made enquiries about workmanship and materials he went on from what i have heard the railway navvies are too skilled to use inadequate materials of any kind not only their reputations and future livelihood would depend on it but their lives at the time they have built railways all over the world and there is no known example of a bad one anywhere she lifted her eyes quickly to gaze into his face then where is the secret profit coming from she demanded this is not enough mr monk if the materials are good then perhaps there was dishonesty in acquiring them she was watching him intently her face burning with emotion he realized again how deeply she was in love with dalgarno and how terribly afraid that he would be driven into crime and then ruined by it not only morally but in every other way perhaps even to end in prison like arrol dundas monk knew the bitterness of that only too well it was one thing of which even his shattered memory had not completely let go he offered her his arm and after only a moments hesitation she took it and they walked side by side between the flower beds i havent looked closely at the possibility of land fraud yet he said speaking quietly so passersby strolling in the bright day would not overhear him he was aware of their curiosity politely masked as courteous nods and smiles as they passed he and katrina must make a striking picture both handsome people elegantly dressed and obviously involved in a conversation of deep emotional content she kept her hand lightly on his arm a delicate gesture one of trust rather than familiarity please look into it mr monk i beg you she said urgently i am desperately afraid of what may happen if no one learns the truth before it is too late we may be able to prevent not only the tragedy of an innocent mans being implicated in a crime but the loss of an untold number of peoples lives in the kind of disaster that only something like a rail crash could bring why do you fear a crash miss harcus he asked frowning a little at her there is no reason whatever to think there is either faulty material or workmanship if there is land fraud then that is dishonest certainly but it does not cause accidents she lowered her eyes and turned away until he could no longer see her face except in profile and her hand slipped off his arm when she spoke it was barely audible i have not told you everything mr monk i had hoped not to have to speak of this i feel ashamed of having stopped on the landing and overheard a conversation below me in the hall i tread very lightly and i am not always heard it is not intentional simply a habit from childhood which my mother instilled in me ladies should move silently and with grace she took a deep breath and he saw that she blinked rapidly as if to control tears what did you overhear miss harcus he asked gently wishing he could offer her more comfort even reach the unnamed grief inside her which was easy to guess i am sorry to insist but i need to know if i am to look in the right places for the dishonesty you fear she kept her eyes averted i overheard jarvis baltimore say to michael that as long as no one discovered what they had done she said quietly then they would both be rich men and there would be no accident this time to mar the profits or if there were no one would make the connection she swung back to face him her skin white her eyes brilliant demanding can it matter where an accident is it is still human life still people crushed beyond any kind of help please mr monk if you have any skill or wit at all which can prevent this happening do so not just for my sake or for michael dalgarnos whom god knows i would save from harm but for the sake of those people who might be riding the train when it happens he was cold inside imagination of mangled bodies too vivid in his mind i dont see how land fraud could cause an accident but i promise i will do everything i can to find out if there has been any theft or dishonesty of any kind in baltimore and sons he promised he would have to for his own sake as much as hers the knowledge of the liverpool crash and the memory of arrol dundas were too violent to ignore no one knew the cause of that carnage perhaps if he learned more about surveying land purchase the movement of money he would see the connection i will tell you all i know he went on but do not expect an answer sooner than three or four days she smiled at him relief flooding her expression like sunlight thank you she said with sudden gentleness a warmth that seemed to reach out to him you are all i trusted you would be i shall be here every afternoon from three days hence awaiting your news and with a slight touch of his arm again she turned away and walked back along the path past two elderly ladies talking to each other nodding graciously to them and on out of the gate without looking back monk turned on his heel and retraced his steps to the road but he could not rid himself of the sense of oppression that haunted his mind there were no specific images just a heaviness as if he had been forcing something out of his recollection for so long it had dimmed the sharp outlines to a blur but its presence had never left him what was it that he had refused to face in the past guilt he already knew the sense of failure because he could not help dundas made the sharper by dundass subsequent death but what about his part in the fraud in the first place they had worked together dundas as mentor and monk as pupil monk had believed dundas innocent that was one thing he was sure of the emotion of admiration and respect was still perfectly clear but had that been knowledge or his own naïveté or far darker and uglier than that had he known the truth but been unwilling to speak it or prove it at dundass trial because it implicated himself could a rail crash between a coal train and a holiday excursion trip have anything to do with fraud the clerk who had told him of the crash had said no one ever found the cause of it surely they must have looked experts on the whole subject would have examined every detail if it were even possibly the fraud they would have torn apart everything to do with it until all the facts were known he should put it from his mind his guilt was only that he had believed dundas innocent and he had failed to get him acquitted nothing to do with the crash dundas had gone to prison and died there a good man who had been unquestioningly generous to monk sacrificed by a judicial system which made mistakes people are fallible some are wicked or at least they perform wicked acts what about michael dalgarno with whom katrina harcus was so deeply in love it was time monk met him facetoface and formed his own judgment he crossed the outer circle and walked briskly down york gate to the marylebone road where he took the next empty hansom south toward dudley street and the offices of baltimore and sons he went up the steps and in through the door of the building he climbed the oakpaneled stairs his imagination racing by the time he was inside in front of the clerk who answered the bell on the reception desk he had decided at least roughly what he was going to say he already had the printed card in his waistcoat pocket good afternoon sir how can i help you the clerk enquired good afternoon monk replied confidently my name is monk i represent findlay and braithwaite of dundee who have been asked to acquire certain rolling stock for railways in france and if their venture there should be successful in switzerland also the clerk nodded the reputation of baltimore and sons is very high monk continued i should be much obliged for the advice of whoever is available to give it to me regarding possible business of great value which must be of the best if whoever is in charge of land and material purchase has the time to spare me it could be of great profit to all of us he produced the card which gave his name an address in bloomsbury and a very general occupation of adviser and agent he had found it useful on many occasions certainly mr monk the clerk said smoothly pushing his spectacles a little further up his broad nose i shall ask mr dalgarno if he can spare the time if you would be good enough to wait there sir that was an instruction not a question and taking the card in his hand he disappeared through the doorway leaving monk alone monk glanced around the walls at a number of very striking paintings and etchings several of them of dramatic railway works towering cliffs on either side of gorges carved by swarming teams of navvies tiny figures against the grandeur of the scenery ramps curved upwards from the lower levels to the higher dotted with wagons piled with stone horses straining against the weight men were swinging picks lifting shovels hauling digging he moved to the next which showed the exquisite arc of a viaduct stretching halfway across a valley of marshland again there were teams of men and horses lifting carrying building for the railway to press on its relentless way to take industry from one city to another over whatever lay between he walked over to the other wall where paintings hung of specific enginesmagnificent shining machinery belching steam into the sky wheels gleaming paintwork bright he felt a longforgotten pride surge back a shiver of excitement and fear a sense of extraordinary exhilaration the door opened and he turned almost guiltily as if he had been caught in some forbidden pleasure and saw the clerk waiting for him beautiful arent they the clerk said with pride mr dalgarno can see you now if youd like to come this way sir thank you monk accepted quickly yes they are very fine he was reluctant to leave the pictures almost as though if he looked at them long enough they would tell him something more but dalgarno was waiting so there was no time now he followed the clerk through into a spacious but very modestly furnished office as of a company that had yet to make any income beyond that which it plowed back into further projects rather than luxury for its employees but michael dalgarno dominated the room so that carved desks or newly upholstered chairs would seem superfluous he was roughly monks height and he stood with the relaxed grace of a man who knows his own elegance his clothes not only fitted him perfectly but were in every way appropriate to his situationstylish discreet and yet with the slight individual touch that marked a man who was not one of the crowd in dalgarnos case it was the unusual fold of his cravat his hair was dark with a heavy wave his features regular but pleasingly not quite handsome perhaps his nose was a little long his lower lip rather too wide it was a strong face in which the emotions were unreadable how do you do mr monk he said courteously but not with the eagerness that betrays too much hunger for business how may i be of assistance to you he indicated one of the chairs for monk to be seated then returned and sat in the one behind the desk himself monk accepted feeling almost familiar in the office as if it had been his own the piles of paper bills and invoices were things he was used to the books on the shelf behind dalgarno were about the great railways of the world and there were also atlases gazetteers ordnance survey maps and references to steel manufacturers lumber mills and the dozen major and minor industries connected with the building of railways i represent a company acting for a gentleman who prefers to remain unnamed at this point he began as if it were the most ordinary way to conduct business he has the opportunity to supply a foreign country with a very large amount of rolling stock specifically both passenger carriages and goods wagons he saw dalgarnos interest but the intensity of it was concealed naturally i am searching this area for the best stock at the best price he continued one at which all parties will gain from the deal baltimore and sons has been mentioned as a company that is rather more imaginative than most and is of a size to give individual advice and attention to a good client he saw dalgarnos eyes flicker it was only a slight widening a greater stillness but he was experienced in observing people and reading the unspoken word and he allowed dalgarno to perceive that he leaned back a little and smiled adding no more dalgarno understood i see what sort of quantities are we speaking of mr monk from some untapped recess of memory the answer came to his tongue five hundred miles of track to begin with he answered if it is successful going up to at least two thousand over the next ten years approximately half of it would be over easy terrain the other half would involve a good deal of cutting and blasting probably at least five miles of tunneling the rolling stock would begin with a hundred goods wagons and perhaps as many passenger carriages but we have excellent manufacturers in mind for the latter of course we could always entertain another offer if it proved to be better let me understand you mr monk dalgarnos expression was utterly relaxed as if he were only mildly interested but monk could see the tension in the muscles beneath the eloquent lines of his jacket far more than anything he saw or heard betrayed in dalgarnos voice he knew exactly how dalgarno felt he had sat in such a chair at dalgarnos age he could feel it as if he were sitting there now it was deeper than memory it was an understanding almost in the bone with no idea why his mind could change places with dalgarnos you are going to ask me if better means cheaper monk said for him it means better value for the money mr dalgarno it must be safe accidents are expensive and it must last a thing that has to be replaced before its time is expensive however little you pay for it there is cost in purchase in contracts in haulage in disposal of the old and above all in idleness while you obtain the new dalgarno smileda broad instinctive gesture he had excellent teeth your points are well taken mr monk i can assure you that any offer baltimore and sons might make would meet with all your criteria monk smiled more widely himself he had no intention of committing to anything both because dalgarno would have no respect for him if he did and because he wanted to remain in dalgarnos company for as long as possible it was his only opportunity to form a personal opinion of the man already he found it hard to believe dalgarno was anybodys dupe he would never meet nolan baltimore to know if he might have used and misled the younger members of his company but if he had monk doubted it would have included this man opposite him there was an alertness a confidence in dalgarno he could feel as if he knew the mans thoughts and could sense his nature he understood very well why katrina harcus was in love with him but not why she was convinced of his innocence surely that was a blindness of the heart if i submit all the particulars monk went on aloud would you be able to give me times costs and specifications within a month mr dalgarno yes dalgarno said without hesitation delivery might take a little while especially of rolling stock we have a very large order in place already to be shipped to india that country is building at a great rate as i am sure you are aware yes of course but i am impressed that you ship to india he was astounded although he could not have said why dalgarno relaxed putting his fingers together in a steeple in front of him not us mr monk unfortunately we are not yet large enough for that but we are supplying components to another company but i assume you know this that was not really a question he was taking it for granted that monk was testing him and he was allowing his candor to show monk recovered himself rapidly can you speak for your senior partner also dalgarnos face clouded it was impossible to tell if his hesitation was genuine or a matter of propriety tragically our senior partner died recently he answered but he is succeeded by his son mr jarvis baltimore who is more than able to take his place im sorry monk said appropriately please accept my condolences thank you dalgarno accepted you will appreciate that at this moment mr jarvis baltimore is somewhat occupied attending to family affairs and endeavoring to be of comfort to his mother and sister and that is where i should be this evening mr monk mr baltimores death was sudden and totally unexpected but of course that is not your concern and railways wait for no man i give you my word we shall not let personal tragedy keep us from our duty any promise given by baltimore and sons will be honored to the letter he rose to his feet and held out his hand monk took it rising also it was a firm strong grip unaffected dalgarno was extremely sure of himself but with a sharp edge of hunger an ambition in which monk could see himself as he had once been in fact not so long ago he had left merchant banking and financial venture far behind but as a policeman that ambition had merely been redirected every case was still a battle a personal challenge his charges from katrina harcus were to save dalgarno and to prevent any possible disaster and to do either of them he needed to have as much knowledge as he could of jarvis baltimore one further question mr dalgarno he said casually there are always risks of land purchase posing problems the best deals can founder on that if a section of the proposed track runs into difficulties not everyone sees progress as a blessing dalgarnos face was mute testimony of his understanding who deals with that subject in your company monk enquired yourself or mr baltimore was there a slight hesitation in dalgarno or was it only that monk wanted to see it there weve all dealt with it at one time or another dalgarno replied as you say it is a subject which can cause a great deal of concern monk frowned all the late mr nolan baltimore was also concerned with land dalgarno explained indeed monk was about to continue when the door opened and a man he instantly assumed to be jarvis baltimore stood in the entrance his face a little flushed his expression impatient michael i he saw monk and stopped abruptly im sorry i didnt know you had a client he held out his hand jarvis baltimore he introduced himself monk took baltimores hand and felt a grip a little too powerful as of someone determined to exert his authority mr monk represents a client interested in a large purchase of rolling stock dalgarno explained baltimore fixed his expression into one of ease and interest although his body still carried a barely suppressed tension im sure we can help you mr monk if you give us your clients requirements we will quote for you on all goods and services monk raised his eyebrows mr dalgarno said you also have some skill in negotiating the purchase of land and rightofway baltimore smiled certainly at a fee of course he glanced quickly at dalgarno then back at monk now im afraid we must both leave the discussion for today my family has very recently been bereaved and dalgarno is a close friendone of us almost my mother and sister are expecting us both this evening monk looked to dalgarno and saw the quick response in his face the immediacy of his answer was that ambition affection pity he had no way of telling im sure you understand baltimore went on of course monk agreed again please accept my condolences this was only a preliminary discussion i will report back to my principals and they will instruct me further thank you very much for your time mr baltimore mr dalgarno he excused himself and took his leave turning over impressions in his mind as he made his way home what was dalgarno like hester asked him an hour later over a supper of grilled fish with mashed potato and onions do you think he is involved in any kind of fraud he hesitated before he replied surprised by how decisive his answer was she was watching him with interest her fork poised in the air i dont know whether there is any fraud or not he replied steadily but if there is i would find it hard to believe he was duped he seemed knowledgeable intelligent and far too ambitious to leave anything to chanceor to anyone elses judgment i would think him the last man to trust his welfare to another then miss harcuss opinion of him is formed more by being in love than the reality she smiled a trifle ruefully we all tend to see people we care about rather more as we wish them to be are you going to tell her he is very well able to care for his own reputation no he said with his mouth full at least not until i know if there is any land fraud or not im going to derbyshire tomorrow to look at the survey reports and then at the site she frowned why is she so convinced that there is something wrong if it is not dalgarno who is it she thinks is to blame she put her fork down forgetting her meal altogether william is it possible that it was nolan baltimore the man who was killed in leather lane and his death had to do with land fraud and not prostitution at all i know he probably wasnt there because of land she went on quickly i do know what abel smith does for a living her mouth twisted in a tight little smile and i assume he went there for that purpose but it would make sense wouldnt it if whoever killed him followed him there and chose that place in order to disguise his real motive this time she ignored the quickening of his interest and left baltimore there so anyone would assume exactly what they do she went on except his family of course did i tell you his daughter came to me in coldbath square to ask if i knew anything that could help clear his name what he jerked forward you didnt tell me that oh well i meant to she apologized not that it makes any difference i cant of course tell her anything i mean but the family would want to believe it was nothing to do with prostitution wouldnt they they wouldnt be keen to think it was land fraud either he said with a smile but the thought took fire in his mind it fitted with what he had seen of the two younger men in baltimores offices what katrina harcus believed of dalgarno and it made more sense of nolan baltimores death than a prostitutes or a pimps having killed him hester was looking at him waiting for his response yes he agreed taking more fish and potato but i still dont know if there is any fraudor if youre right i suppose i should say was i must go to derbyshire tomorrow and see the site i need all the maps in large detail and i need to look at exactly what they are doing she frowned will you know from that i mean just looking at the maps and the land this was the time to tell her of his jolting memory his sense of familiarity with the whole process of surveying for railways and the land purchase with its difficulties he had told her long ago of the snatches he had remembered of arrol dundas and his helplessness to prove the truth at the time she would understand why he was compelled now to learn the truth about baltimore and sons whether katrina harcus needed it or not if he explained his fears it would make it easier if he had to admit later on that he had been at least partly implicated in the fraudand the disaster afterwards which it may have caused he thought of her work with the women in coldbath square she would be going back there tonight she was dressed for it already a long nights hard and thankless labor he might not see her again until after he came back from derbyshire it should wait until another time when he would have the opportunity to be with her to assure her of what that whatever he had been in the past he was no longer that man anymore i dont know he said that was in essence true even if not all of it i dont know what better to try she picked up her knife and fork and started to eat again if i hear anything more about nolan baltimore ill tell you she promised chapter five hester had spent a strange unhappy evening after monks return aware that there was something powerful in him that she could not reach he was either unwilling or unable to share it she had missed him while he was away and taken the opportunity to put in as much work as possible at the house on coldbath square and she would have been happy to go there far later or even not at all had he said only once that he wished her to stay but he did not he was brittle absorbed in thought and he seemed almost relieved when she said goodbye just before ten oclock and went out into the lamplit darkness and took the first passing hansom to coldbath square the night was chill and she was glad of the warmth that enveloped her when she pushed the door of the clinic open and went inside bessie was sitting at the table stitching buttons onto a white blouse and she looked up her face filling with pleasure when she saw hester yer look pinched she said with concern nice ot cup o teall do yer good she put the sewing down and rose to her feet like a drop o the ard stuff with it she did not even reach for it knowing hester would refuse she always did but bessie always offered it was a sort of ritual no thank you hester replied with a smile hanging her damp coat on the hook on the wall but dont let me stop you that was ritual also now that you mention it bessie agreed dont mind if i do she went to the stove to make sure the kettle was on the boil and hester went to look at the patients fanny the girl who had been stabbed was feverish and in a great deal of pain but she appeared to be no worse than hester had expected wounds like that did not heal easily her fever seemed to be down have you eaten anything hester asked her fanny nodded nearly she whispered i had some beef broth thank you bessie was coming toward them a wide benign shadow between the beds away from the light of the far end of the room mr lockhart was right pleased with er she said with pleasure e come about midday sober as a judge she added that last bit with pride as if it were partially her achievement perhaps it was did you give him luncheon hester asked without looking up at bessie what if i did bessie demanded we can spareim a bit o bubble an squeak an a sausage or two hester smiled knowing bessie had brought it out of her own meager pantry of course we can she agreed pretending she did not know small enough reward for all he does yer right bessie said vehemently darting a slightly suspicious look at hester and then away again an e looked at alice an all poor thing said as shes doin as well as yer could expect spent a fair time talkin to er e an miss margaret put arnica poultices on er jus like me an yer did an it seemed ter elp er some there was fear in bessies voice hester knew she wanted to ask if alice was going to live and yet she was too afraid of the answer to do it the fact that alice had already survived three days since her injuries was the most hopeful sign had there been the internal bleeding they feared she would have been dead by now hester went to her and saw that she was half asleep dozing fitfully muttering under her breath as if troubled by dreams there was nothing to do to help her either her body would heal in time or she would develop fever or gangrene and die in a while when she was more wakeful they would give her a little more to drink then sponge her down with cool water and give her a fresh nightgown hester returned to the table at the far end of the room where bessie was allowing the tea to brew and putting a generous dash of whiskey into her own mug there were still police on every street in the coldbath area harassing people asking questions hester had noticed them looking profoundly unhappy but unable to escape the necessity most of them were locally based and knew the womenand the men who regularly came to take their pleasures although in the current climate there were fewer and fewer of them business was poor in other trades as well all those on the edge of the law were nervous and tempers were short there was no money to be spared for small treats like peppermint water flowers ham sandwiches a new hat a toy for a child sellers of matches and bootlaces were about the only ones doing well a little before midnight jessop called again pressing for higher rent he stood in the middle of the floor with his thumbs hooked into the armholes of his red brocade waistcoat trying to add restrictions and generally making a nuisance of himself the few women who were hurt or ill had already complained of his presence and would do so again if he kept on coming he made them wary he represented authority no matter how distantly hester pointed that out to him and asked him to leave he smiled with satisfaction and remained the longer until bessie lost her temper and filled the bucket with hot water lye and vinegar she started to scrub the floor splashing the buckets contents all over his boots deliberately and he left in umbrage bessie then made a very slapdash effort at cleaning a couple of yards of the floor then threw the good water away she and hester curled up on two of the empty beds and slept on and off undisturbed by patients for most of the night only getting up twice to help alice i put a weapon into his hand didnt i margaret said with chagrin when hester told her about jessops visit early on the following morning when she arrived just after nine oclock and bessie had gone for some shopping margaret was too honest for hester to patronize her with an excuse today of all days she felt a burning need for candor im afraid so she agreed but with a rueful smile to rob it of offense they were busy seeing what bandages could be saved from those used and washed they were not in a position to afford any unnecessary supplies but i dont think it will make any difference in a while well have to find a new place as soon as we can hell put us out at the first opportunity he was always going to do that margaret did not reply her fingers moved nimbly over the rolls of cloth sorting some out and throwing them away keeping the others what are we going to do about the usurer and the women who are being beaten she said at last hester had been thinking about just that since she had first learned the truth from alice and had come to the conclusion that by themselves there was nothing they could do that did not risk making the situation worse the usury was not a crime that the law could reach in the ordinary way she had toyed with other ideas but never formed any coherent plan they might be capable of carrying out this morning she felt even more helpless in the face of pain because her own happiness was dimmed her confidence in herself shadowed by the fact that monk had placed a distance between them something hurt him and he was not able to share it with her we need help she said aloud already her mind was made up someone who knows the law far better than we do mr monk margaret said quickly no i meant a lawyer hester refused to allow herself to be hurt by the thought that it was not monk she would turn to someone who knows about usury and that kind of thing she answered i think we should go as soon as legal offices will be open bessie will be back by then and it is not very likely anyone will come in during the morning who cant wait for us to return but who could we find who would be interested in cases like fanny or alice margaret asked and we have no spare money to pay with everything is already committed to rent and supplies she said that firmly just in case hester should be inclined to be impractical and forget their priorities i know at least where to begin hester replied soberly i wont spend our supply money i promise she did not yet want to tell margaret that she was planning to see sir oliver rathbone he had been on the verge of asking hester to marry him once he had hesitated and then not spoken the words perhaps he had seen in her face that she was not yet ready to make such a decision or even that she would never love anyone else with the fierceness or the magic with which she loved monk she could not help that whether monk ever returned her feeling or not and at that time she had not known it was only after that that she had discovered monk did return her feelings passionately and profoundly and he had accepted that to deny his own emotions would be to deny all the best in himself as well as the most vulnerable they were friends all three of them in a fashion rathbone still felt a deep affection for her she knew that and monk had to be aware of it also but they were allies in a cause which overrode personal wounds and losses rathbone had never turned down a case he believed in however difficult or against whatever odds and certainly not because it was brought to him by monk she and margaret would go to vere street and tell oliver all that they knew at least it would be a burden shared suddenly she knew how good it would feel to see him to be aware of the warmth of his regard for her and his trust actually it was after eleven oclock before hester and margaret were ushered into rathbones office with its beautiful leather inlaid desk and cabinets full of books and the long windows overlooking the street rathbone came forward toward hester smiling broadly he was not much more than average height his charm lay in the intelligence in his face in his wry delicate humor and the supreme confidence of his bearing he was a gentleman and he had the ease of privilege and education hester what a pleasure to see you even if it has to be a problem that brings you here he said sincerely who is wrongly accused of what i imagine it is murder it usually is with you not yet she replied warmth engulfing her just to hear the gentleness in his voice she turned to introduce margaret and as he turned also she saw a sudden interest spark in his dark eyes as if already he recognized her or something in her that he was happy to see this is miss margaret ballinger she said quickly sir oliver rathbone margaret drew in her breath to reply a very faint flush in her cheeks we have met already rathbone said before margaret could speak at a ball i forget where but we danced it was just before that miserable business with the architect it is a pleasure to see you again miss ballinger the expression in his face suggested that he was speaking honestly not simply as a matter of good manners margaret took a deep breath just a trifle shakily thank you for seeing us with no notice at all sir oliver it is very gracious of you hester always brings me the most fascinating problems he demurred inviting them with a gesture to sit down and when they had done so taking the seat behind the desk himself you said no one has been murdered yet should i deduce from that that you expect someone will be there was no mockery in his tone it was light but perfectly serious two people have been very badly injured and more will be hester said a fraction more quickly than she had meant to she was aware that rathbone was at least as conscious of margaret as he was of her she realized with a yawning hollow inside her how much of his life lay beyond her knowledge the material facts of it did not matter it was the wealth of people he knew the emotions the laughter and hurt the dreams that were the man inside he was waiting for her to continue miss ballinger and i have rented a house in coldbath square in which to offer medical treatment to women of the street who are injured or ill she said ignoring the look in his eyes the strange mixture of tenderness admiration and horror lately at least two women have come in very seriously beaten she went on one of them has said that she used to be a governess then married and her husband led her into debt she borrowed money and then could not repay it she was speaking too quickly deliberately she slowed herself the usurer offered her a position as a prostitute catering to men who like to humiliate and abuse women who were once respectable she saw the disgust in his face if he could have listened to her and felt nothing she would have despised him for it rathbone glanced at margaret saw the anger in her and something in him softened even further go on he said turning back to hester i daresay you are aware that a mr nolan baltimore was murdered in leather lane just over a week ago she asked he nodded i am since then the police have patrolled the area with more men than usual with the result that there is far less trade possible for such women they are earning little or no money and cannot pay the usurer they are being beaten for their delinquency in their debts memory of the two women momentarily obliterated any sense of her own loneliness she leaned forward earnestly please oliver there must be something we can do to stop it they are far too terrified and ashamed to fight back for themselves she watched him struggle for something to say to let her down gently she was asking too much she would have liked to withdraw be reasonable but the reality of their pain burned too hotly inside her hester he began i know the whole world of coldbath square and leather lane are outside the law she said quickly before he could dismiss her it shouldnt be do we always have to wait until people come to us before we can help them sometimes we have to see the problem and address it anyway she was aware of margarets slight stiffening perhaps she was unaccustomed to such frankness from a woman to a man it was unbecoming not the way either to win or to keep a husband you mean decide for them rathbone said with a wry smile that doesnt sound like you hester im a nurse not a lawyer she said sharply quite often i have to help people when they are beyond knowing anything for themselves it is my skill to know what they need and do it this time his smile was full of warmth a genuine sweetness in it i know that it is a kind of moral courage i have admired in you from the day we met i find it a little overwhelming because i dont possess it myself she found tears prickling her eyes for an instant she knew he meant it and it was more precious to her than she had expected but she still wished to argue that was no help to women like alice and fanny oliver margaret leaned forward sir oliver she said urgently her cheeks flushed but her eyes steady if you had seen that poor womans body with its broken arms and legs if you could see her pain her fear and the shame she feels because she has taken to the streets to pay her husbands debts you would feel as we do that to nurse her through the daily distress of at least partial recovery only to set her out into coldbath for it to happen again because her debt is ever falling behind miss ballinger then she stopped abruptly the color deepening in her face as she became conscious of how forward she was being i am sorry she said contritely it is not your sort of case and it is not as if we had any money to pay you she rose to her feet her eyes downcast with embarrassment it was an act of desperation miss ballinger he rose also stepping around the desk towards her please he said gently i do not mean that i am unwilling simply that i do not know what i can do but i promise you that i will put my attention to it and if there is anything that may be done within and through the law i will tell you and take your instructions money need not be a consideration i hesitate only because i do not wish to promise what it is outside my power to give margaret looked up at him quickly her eyes candid and direct her face filled with gratitude thank you hester realized with a shock of amazement that rathbone was acceding to a request entirely against his interests and outside his nature in order not to refuse margaret it was not hester he was pleasing as it had always been in the past she was glad he agreed of course and grateful but it was an odd sense of rebuff that it was not for her it was not obviousin no way had he been less than friendly to her but the quality of his attention was different she knew it as certainly as a change of temperature in the air she should have been happy for both of them she was happy she did not wish rathbone to spend the rest of his life in love with her when she would only ever love monk but just today this was as if a door had closed in front of her and something in it hurt rathbone had turned towards her she must smile it was imperative thank you she added to margarets words i think we have told you everything that we know it is the principle rather than individual women so far but if we learn anything further we will inform you of course there was nothing else for any of them to say and they were conscious of the courtesy of his having seen them at all at the expense of other clients waiting they excused themselves thanking him again and five minutes later were in a hansom riding back toward coldbath square they did not speak each lost in her own thoughts margaret was still flushed her eyes wide turned away from hester and staring out of the window at the passing streets no words could have been more eloquent of the fact that very plainly she had not forgotten her first meeting with rathbone nor had its emotional mark on her been worn away in the time between but it was something too delicate to share had their roles been reversed hester would not have spoken either and she did not think of intruding now she and margaret had been honest and natural friends part of such friendship was respect and the understanding of when not to speak she did not wish to share her own thoughts except the superficial ones of the mind the difficulty of knowing where to find the women who owed money to the usurer of persuading them that help was possible if indeed it was and the effort needed to convince them that the exercise of courage would win them anything but further pain above all there was the necessity of being absolutely certain that that was true but margaret had been in coldbath square long enough to know that for herself so hester also watched the streets pass by and thought of practical things in the afternoon another woman was brought in beaten for debt she was not seriously injured but she was very frightened and it was that which marked her apart from the usual anger and misery of those hurt she was almost silent as hester and margaret tended to her shallow painful knife cuts she would not say who had inflicted them on her no lies and no truth but they were very obviously intentionally made no imaginable accident could have caused such vicious and repeated slicing of the flesh she stayed a few hours until they were certain the bleeding was stopped and the woman had at least partially recovered from shock margaret wished her to stay longer but shaking her head she picked up her torn shawl once a pretty thing with flowers and fringes and went out into the square toward the farringdon road margaret stood in the middle of the room and looked around at the tidy cupboards the scrubbed tabletops and the floor hester shrugged i suppose we should be glad theres nobody else hurt she said with an attempt at a smile do you want to go home there really isnt anything to do and bessiell be in later if anything should happen margaret grimaced and trail around behind mama calling on nice ladies who look at me with kindly despair and wonder why i havent accepted a reasonable offer of marriage she said wryly then theyll assume that there is something terribly wrong with me too indiscreet to mention and they will think i have lost my virtue she gave a little grunt of frustration why is it that young women are presumed to have only two possible virtueschastity and obedience she demanded with sudden fierceness what about courage or honesty of opinion not just a matter of not taking what does not belong to you because they make people uncomfortable hester replied without hesitation but giving margaret a crooked sympathetic smile can you imagine anything lonelier than being married to someone who always says what he thinks you want to hear regardless of whatever it is that he thinks margaret asked her brows puckered in a frown it would be like living in a room full of mirrors where every other face you saw was simply a reflection of your own i think it would be a very particular kind of hell hester answered with a rush of wonder and pity that anyone could imagine they desired such a thing and yet she knew many who thought they did you have a gift to put it into such vivid words she added with admiration perhaps you should try to convey it visually sometime that would be something really worth drawing margaret responded i am so bored with doing the predictable just reproducing what i see in front of me with no greater meaning i can barely draw a straight line hester admitted margaret flashed her a sudden smile there are no straight lines in artexcept perhaps the horizons at sea would you like me to go out and see if i can find us some hot pies for luncheon there is a good peddler on the corner of mount pleasant and warner street what an excellent idea hester said enthusiastically one with flaky pastryand lots of onions please in the late afternoon bessie came in carrying a basket with herbs tea a bottle of brandy and a loaf of bread she set it down on the table and looked around the room before taking off her hat and cape nobody she said with disgust hanging the cape and bonnet on the hooks near the door ardly a bleedin soul out in the streets neither ceptin damn bluebottles an bin like that all night too they say she looked at hester reproachfully as if somehow she had failed to do anything about it i know hester replied tartly the pressure is still on them to find whoever killed nolan baltimore some pimp e crossed up bessie retorted what else der they think as someones goin ter tell em that if they asks often enough dont spose nobdy knows ceptinim wot done it an e int gonna tell ed be dancin at the end of a rope fore e can say knife she walked over to the cupboard and started to rearrange the things inside it so she could put the new groceries away funny innit some bleedin usurer can beat a girl alf ter death an nobdy gives a toss but kill some toff wots refused ter pay is debts an alf the rozzers in lunnons out in the streets wastin their time askin questions they know nobdys gonna answer sometimes i think theyre sittin on their brains an thinkin wi their backsides she glared at the basket couldnt get no butter yerll ave ter do wi bread an jam margaret stopped riddling the stove and moved the kettle over onto the hob nobdys workin bessie went on relentlessly them as brings the money in are frit o bein done by the rozzers all this keep the streets decent thing an them as if livin ere int got no trade cos no ones got no money its wickedthats wot it is there was no answer to make there was not even any purpose in either hesters or margarets remaining for the rest of the afternoon hester said as much and bessie agreed with her yer get orff she nodded theres nothin much gonna appen ere if that fat slug jessop comes round lookin fer yer ill giveim a nice ot cup o tea she grinned demonically bessie hester warned wot she opened her eyes wide if it dont agree wifim i know ow ter give summink ter makeim sick it up i won let the bastard die i gi me word she spat and made an elaborate gesture of crossing her heart hester glanced at margaret and they both half hid smiles but all the way home and for the rest of the evening until monk returned late and tired hester thought about the women the police around the farringdon road and the coldbath area it was no moral answer to the evil to get the police presence removed but it was a practical answer to the lack of trade which was crippling everyone and turning tempers so ugly she had tried to avoid coming to the conclusion but it was inevitable the only thing that would make them leave would be to solve the murder of nolan baltimore if the police were going to succeed they would almost certainly have done so by now the community had closed against them which was to be expected no one would tell them anything of meaning in case it would implicate himself in prostitution if nothing else and most of the inhabitants of the leather lane area were involved at least peripherally in fencing stolen goods a little forgery of documents if not of money in pickpocketing burglary cardsharping and a dozen other illegal pursuits she could ask monk at least for advice if not practical help he knew and understood murder and its investigation and perhaps it was in the interest of his own case to learn everything he could of the man who until a week or two ago had been the head of baltimore and sons if there had been fraud he might have known of it he might even have been the man who perpetrated it surely it was reasonable to suppose his death was connected in fact the jarringly ugly thought was irrefutable that michael dalgarno could have followed him to leather lane and killed him precisely because he knew of the fraud and would have exposed it why had monk not thought of that because he was so caught up in investigating the exact nature of the fraud and whether it could provoke a disaster that he had ignored nolan baltimores murder she waited for him barely thinking of what else she was doing she found herself listening for the sound of horses in the street from six oclock onwards for the opening and closing of the door and his footsteps when they finally came at nearly quarter to eight she was caught by surprise and almost ran into the hall he saw her face the expectation in it and gave her a quick smile and then looked away the weariness and anxiety in him were so easy to read she hesitated for a moment uncertain whether to say anything more than a few words of welcome should she ask him if he were hungry or had eaten or make some enquiry after his success that could be answered on the surfaceor honestly as he chose she could not let it slide by if he were not going to break the barrier then she must did you find anything more about the fraud she asked not casually but as if she were waiting for and required an answer nothing helpful he replied taking his jacket off and hanging it up on the hook theres dubious profit in land sales but nothing more than i imagine most companies make there are some losses as well she felt as if he had closed a door there seemed little more that she could ask but she refused to let go she watched him but he moved around the room restlessly without looking directly at her touching things straightening putting away was she mithering him just at the time when he needed the silent understanding of a friend was she being selfish expecting him to give her his attention listen to her think of her problems when he was exhausted or was she breaking a barrier while it was still thin enough to be penetrated easily before it became habit we need to find out who killed nolan baltimore she said very clearly do we there was doubt in his voice he was standing near the mantelshelf staring down at the embers of the fire it was a sharp evening and she had lit the fire for company as well as warmth i dont see that his personal weaknesses have anything to do with railway fraud if there is any if he defrauded somebody of money then leather lane seems an excellent place to kill him she retorted wishing he would look at her a perfect situation to blame someone else and exact a rather painful revenge on his reputation as well this time he did look up and smile but it was without pleasure there was an openness that flickered for an instant in his eyes as if there had been no shadow then it was gone again the anxiety was back and with it the distance between them actually when i said we she corrected herself i meant margaret ballinger and me or perhaps i meant everybody in coldbath more women are getting beaten because they cant pay their debts the police are all over the place so nobodys doing any trade you wish to find who killed baltimore so the police will leave and the prostitutes can get back into business he said with an edge of mockery she could not miss you have strange moral convictions hester was that pain in his voice now did he feel she had let him down that she should have taken a higher more puritan stand he was disappointed and she felt rebuked if i could change the world so no women ever went into prostitution i would she said angrily perhaps you can tell me where i should begin get every woman a decent living at something more respectable perhaps or stop every man from wanting or needing to buy his pleasures outside his own home she saw his expression of surprise and ignored it perhaps every man should be married and every wife comply with her husbands wishes or better still no man should have wishes he cant satisfy honorably that would solve at least half of it then all we would have to do is change the economy after that changing human nature should be relatively easy you have rather escalated your demands he said quietly i thought all you wanted was for me to solve nolan baltimores murder her anger vanished she did not want to quarrel with him she wanted intensely fiercely to hold him in her arms and share whatever it was that hurt him so much to take at least half of it if not all to fight it with him beside him it was better to try and be rebuffed than not to try at all even rejection would not hurt more than this distance which was a kind of little death she walked over to him and stopped just in front of him forcing him either to meet her eyes or deliberately look away all i want is for you to advise me she said what should i do what questions should i ask some of the women will trust me where they wont trust the police leave it alone hester he lifted one hand as if to touch her cheek then let it fall again its too dangerous you think they trust you and they do to take care of their injuries but you arent one of them and you never will be but thats just the point william she caught hold of his hand gripping it hard i could have been these women who owe money were perfectly respectable only a short while ago they were governesses parlor maids married women who were abandoned or whose husbands got into debt they could have been nurses i earned my own living in other peoples houses before i married you one mistake one misfortune and i could have borrowed money and found myself on the streets to pay it back she pulled a selfmocking face at least if i were a trifle younger no you wouldnt he said very softly but with absolute certainty you would never have lent yourself to that at any age youd have led a rebellion or taken ship to america or even stuck a knife between his ribs but you wouldnt have gone meekly to the slaughter sometimes you rate my courage too high she replied but with a rush of warmth inside her at the strength of his admiration i dont know what i would have done thank god i was never put to the test he stood silently for a moment then bent and kissed her long and with a tenderness so complete so achingly profound the emotion welled up inside her bringing tears to her eyes then he let go and went into the room he used as a study and closed the door she was asleep in exhaustion when he came to bed she woke in the night and he was beside her but he did not move or touch her even when she turned closer to him in the morning he was gone there was a note on the dresser hester i am going to investigate more into land purchase for the railway partly because it is the only fraud i can see in the baltimore case but mostly because i know that arrol dundas was convicted of land fraud in what seems to have been almost identical circumstances it may even have been the same company baltimore and sons i dont know that beyond question but i am fairly certain i hope you will understand why i need to know absolutely if there is anything at all i can do to make sure dalgarno does not end up in prison as dundas did for something of which he is innocent then i must do so i will not fail him in the same way i may have to return to the railway itself in derbyshire please hester be careful it is enough that you work in the coldbath area helping people who are troubled and are incapable of repaying you even by telling you the truth certainly they cannot protect you if you attract the interest of the kind of men who so abuse them if you wont look after yourself for your own sake or for mine at least do it for theirs if you are injured or worse to whom could they turn you have in the past eloquently criticized the crimean generals who wasted their troops in quixotic gestures and rightly you have often said a woman would have been more practical and less glory seekingnow prove it i hope to see you minding your businessand not minewhen i return when if i can i shall help you to find whoever killed nolan baltimoreif the police have not already done so even if it does not always seem as if i do i love you profoundly and i admire you far more than you realize william she held the paper in her hands as if it could bring her some part of him or he would know the emotions inside her the love and the need the loneliness for him the longing to be able to help with whatever private battle he was fighting why could he write so much and yet not tell her facetoface she knew the answer even as the question formed it was obviousbecause she could hold a letter in her hands read it and reread it carry it with her but she could not demand any further answers of it monk himself was gone alone and she was here equally alone he loved her certainly but why was it he could not trust her alsoher loyalty her understanding her courage what was it in her he feared might fail him it hurt too much to think of she would go back to coldbath square and work there would be something to do even if it were only to seek more ideas for raising money perhaps they should start to look for other premises margarets friendship was valuable although it no longer had quite the uncomplicated ease she had thought it did before they had gone to rathbones office she must not show jealousy that would be smallminded and unbelievably ugly she would despise herself for that and of course she must try to learn all she could about nolan baltimores death taking reasonable care not to antagonize anyone margaret was late in to coldbath but that was of no importance at the moment tempers were short throughout the area so there were many quarrels and several people lashed out in frustration and fear but it was more often men who were the victims and the injuries were of the nature that heal with time and very little caremostly bruises shallow cuts and sore heads pimps were getting more careful about scarring or bruising their women their only asset in a shrinking market of course everyone knew it would not go on indefinitely but it had already been long enough to blow a chill of bitter reality into the lives of all manner of people the end of it still lay in some unknown time in the future they lived from day to day how is fanny hester asked as she came in out of the fine rain taking off her cloak and hat and alice fair enough bessie answered looking at her balefully from where she was sitting by the empty table apart from her halfdrunk cup of tea quiet it is like a bleedin graveyard ad two girls come in wi disease thats all cant do much fer em poor cows miss ballinger int in yet out showin erself off round the swell ouses i shouldnt wonder never seen such a change in anyone in me life she said it with fierce satisfaction and not the shadow of a smile wouldnt say boo to yer wen she first come ere now shes as bold as brass ask anyone fer money she would wager yer sixpence shell come waltzin in ere wi a grin all over er face an tell us shes got a few pound more fer us hester did smile in spite of the gloom of the morning it was true margaret had found a confidence even a happiness in work that in itself was an accomplishment whoever else they were able to heal and whether or not their patients would slip back to exactly the same debt and abuse afterwards bessie was right half an hour later margaret did come in carrying satisfaction with her like a burst of sunlight i have another twenty guineas she said proudly and promise of more she held it out for hester her eyes bright her face glowing hester forced herself to warm to the success even though she felt all she could taste in her own mouth was failure thats excellent she said appreciatively it will keep jessop at bay for a while and that gives us time thank you very much margaret looked pained youre not going to give him more than our agreement are you hester relaxed a little she almost laughed no i am most certainly not margaret smiled back and started to take off her jacket and hat what can we do today how are fanny and alice she glanced towards the beds as she spoke asleep bessie answered for hester nowt ter do fer em now ceptin keep the roof over their eads an feed em now an then she frowned at the rain spattering the window i spose id best be doin some marketin stay inside and keep dry for a while hester made her decision margaret and i have an errand in half an hour or so its important bessie was suspicious oh yeh she did not trust hester to look after herself but she was not quite bold enough to say so in so many words wot yer gonna do that i cant do fer yer then hester had not been going to confide in bessie simply as a precaution and also at least in part because she was not sure if her plan had any chance of success now suddenly she thought better of secrecy and decided to be frank if we are to solve this problem of police all over the place and therefore no trade for the women she said briskly before she should lose her nerve we have to find out what happened to nolan baltimore she ignored margarets look of incredulity and bessies sucking her breath in between the gap in her teeth i intend to start asking a few questions at least people may speak to me who would not speak to the police she finished ow yer gonna do that bessie said with dismissal in her voice oos gonna tell yer anythin about it come ter think ood yer even ask the people in leather lane of course hester replied spreading out her cape so it would dry we need to know if baltimore went there regularly or if it was his first visit if he went there often then someone will know something about him who else he knew what kind of a man he was away from his home and family i would like to know whether he went there simply to use the women or if he could have had some other business maybe somebody from his life at home followed him there his death might have nothing to do with the people who live in the coldbath area bessies face brightened cor thatd be summink eh but the people of leather lane might not know his name margaret pointed out i dont suppose he used it i shouldnt think so hester agreed realizing her point what we need is a picture to show people margarets eyes widened a picture how on earth could we get a picture only the family would have one and theyre hardly likely to give it to us hester took a deep breath and plunged in actually i have an idea for that i am not very good at drawing but you are oh margarets voice shot up in denial and she started shaking her head but her eyes did not leave hesters oh no do you have an idea which would serve better hester asked with an attempt at innocence bessie understood with dawning horror you never are she said to hester the morgue yer gonna draw a dead body not i hester corrected her nobody would recognize their own mother from anything i drew but margaret is very good she can really catch a likeness even if she is too modest to say so herself its not that margaret began then tailed off staring at hester as disbelief slowly turned into understanding really she whispered do you think i mean would they allow us to well we may require one or two embellishments of fact hester admitted wryly but i intend to try as hard as possible she became very grave it really does matter as long as you do the embellishments margaret said making a last attempt at reason of course hester agreed not yet with any very clear idea of what she would say there would be plenty of time to think about it as they walked the mile or so to the closest morgue where baltimore would have been taken i dont have a pencil or paper margaret said but ive got a couple of shillings of my own i mean not supposed to be for the house excellent hester approved well get what you need at mrs clarks shop on the corner of the farringdon road and i daresay an eraser as well we may not have time to start over and over again margaret shrugged then gave a nervous laugh almost a giggle hester heard a note of hysteria in it its all right margaret said quickly i was just thinking what my drawing master would say if he knew he was such an old woman it would be worth it just to see his face he used to like me to draw demure young ladies he made my sisters and me draw each other he wasnt even sure if we should draw gentlemen the idea of that would be bad enoughhed have a seizure if he knew i was going to draw a corpse i do hope hell be wearing a sheet or something if not you have my express instruction to draw one in hester promised with an answering bubble of laughter not because she found any pleasure in it but because to think of the absurd was the only way to make it all bearable they put on their outdoor clothes again and set off walking briskly in the rain they purchased a block of paper pencils and an eraser and hurried on to the morgue an ugly slabsided building set a little back from the street what do you want me to say margaret asked as they went up the steps side by side agree with me hester replied under her breath as soon as they were through the door they were faced almost immediately by an elderly man with white whiskers and an alarmingly high voice almost falsetto good mornin to you ladies ow can i be of elp he bowed very slightly blocking their way as completely as if he had held out his arms he fixed his eyes on hesters face unblinking waiting for her to explain herself hester stared back at him without flinching good morning sir i am hoping you will accommodate our request out of delicacy to miss ballingers feelings she indicated margaret a look of sorrow in her face she has just returned from abroad visiting her mother who has gone to a warmer climatefor her health you understand she bit her lip only to hear of her uncles most terrible and tragic death she waited to see if he showed any sign of sympathy but she waited in vain she did not dare to look at margaret in case she drew attention to her startled expression the morgue attendant cleared his throat yes i have accompanied her so she can pay her last respects to her uncle mr nolan baltimore hester continued she is not able to remain until the funeral heaven knows when that will be yer want ter see one o our bodies he shook his head id advise agin it ladies wont be nice best rememberim as e was if i were you my mother will ask me margaret spoke at last her voice husky tell er e were restin peaceful the attendant said almost expressionlessly she wont know different margaret managed to look shocked oh i couldnt do that she said hastily besides she might ask me to describe him and it is so long since i saw him i might make a mistake then i should feel dreadful i i would be most grateful if you would simply allow me to have a few moments you may be with us at all times of course if you feel that is the correct thing to do hester gritted her teeth and swore under her breath a verbal description of nolan baltimore would be of no use they needed sketches to show people how could margaret not have understood that she tried to catch margarets eye but margaret would not look back at her she was concentrating totally on the attendant and perhaps on controlling her awareness of the damp faintly sickly smell in the air well he said thoughtfully i suppose itd make no odds ter me nor toim fer that matter but dont old me to account if yer pass out mind he looked at hester yerd better come an stand beside er if she falls over or yer do either im not fetchin a quack fer yer yer pick yerself up again understand certainly hester said with considerable asperity then she remembered the role she had cast herself in and changed her attitude certainly she repeated with considerably more respect you are quite right we shall conduct ourselves appropriately right yare he turned around and led the way through the door and along the passage to the ice room where corpses were stored if required to be kept for any extended period why did you ask him to stay hester said in an almost stifled whisper the attendant stopped and turned around beg pardon hester felt herself flush hot i i said it was nice of you to say you would stay she lied gotter he said grudgingly the cadavers ere are in my charge some people dont think as it matters very much but yerd be surprised wot some folks get up ter wif bodies theres mad people around an thats a fact he snorted an people will steal bodies ter cut up gawd elp us margaret gulped her face pale but she kept her composure admirably all i wish to do is look at uncle nolan she said huskily i would be obliged if i might do so without hearing more of such atrocities i quite appreciate why your care and and diligence are necessary i am grateful for them jus doin me duty he said stiffly and opened the next door ushering them into a small very cold room with bare whitewashed walls you said nolan baltimore last one over there he walked across the damp stone floor to the fourth table where a figure lay supine covered by a large unbleached cotton sheet the attendant looked at margaret skeptically as if to assess the likelihood of her fainting or otherwise making a nuisance of herself he gave up the struggle and with a sigh of resignation pulled the sheet off the head and shoulders of the corpse margaret made a little hissing sound of breath between her teeth and swayed as if the floor beneath her were the deck of a ship hester moved forward quickly and put her arms tightly around her holding her hard enough to cause pain margaret gave a little yelp but the sharpness of hesters grip seemed to steady her they both looked down at the mottled graywhite flesh of the face it was coarsefeatured with fleshy cheeks and jaw the large eyes were now closed but the sockets suggested their shape his hair was receding wavy a dark gingery gold he was obviously a large man heavychested thickarmed it was difficult to judge his height but probably close to six feet the hardest thing was to imagine life and color in the features to think what they would have been like animated by intelligence and yet presumably to have built a company like baltimore and sons he must have had skill imagination and immense drive thank you margaret whispered he he looks so peaceful how did he die we do our best the attendant said as if she had passed him a compliment how she repeated her voice rasping in her throat dunno plice say as e likely fell down stairs yer cant see ere ow broke up e is inside an o course we clean em up thank you margaret repeated struggling to get her breath the cold and the smell of carbolic were almost overcoming her hester stared at the form on the table she had seen so many dead men although most of them not as neatly and clinically laid out as this one but even without touching him or moving anything she noticed a certain crookedness in the way he was positioned cleaned up or not she guessed many of his bones had been broken or joints dislocated it must have been a very hard fall and staring at his head she noticed fine scratches on the neck stretching under the left ear down to the front of the throat then starting up again on the front of the breastbone fingernails they were scratches not cuts and the edges were new and raw bloodless of course now but the skin had a ragged look as if it had had no chance to heal yer seen enough the attendant asked looking at margaret and beginning to frown yes yes thank you margaret replied i i should like to leave now i have done my duty poor uncle nolan thank you so much for your she tailed off unable to keep her composure and finish hester realized that margaret was at the end of her strength this was probably the first time she had seen a dead man although one woman had died in the house in coldbath but that was different full of emotion pity and in the end some kind of peace this was simply freezing cold and smelling of stone and carbolic and it was old death days old she put her arm around margarets shoulders and walked with her out into the passage again crushing down her disappointment at least she had a picture in her mind to try to put into words at the entrance they thanked the attendant again then went as quickly as was even remotely decent out into the street and the gently falling rain tea margaret gasped and somewhere to sit down somewhere dry wouldnt you rather get back to coldbath hester said in concern im not sure what sort of a place around here would offer i want to draw him before i forget margaret hissed at her i cant do that standing up in the rain hester was taken completely aback can you i mean could of course i can if i do it while hes still sharp in my mind which right now i feel will be forever but common sense and profound hope say it will not margaret stared around and started to walk more briskly in an effort to reach just such a place and hester had to skip a couple of steps to catch up with her and then seize her by the arm to stop her from bumping into a peddler who was hoping for a sale of bootlaces eventually they found a tavern where they settled for a table in the corner two half pints of cider and two hot pies as soon as they were served margaret took out the paper and pencil and began to draw every now and then she sipped from her glass but she ignored the pie perhaps the thought of eating while she saw the face of a dead man was too much for her hester was suddenly profoundly hungry in her case relief outweighed more delicate feelings and all she could think of was how clever margaret was to bring character and life into a representation created out of lines on paper in front of her nolan baltimores face took shape until she felt as if she must have known him thats marvelous she said with deep respect wiping her fingers on her handkerchief then drinking the last of her cider if we show people that they will certainly know whether they have seen him or not margaret looked up at her her eyes bright with pleasure for the praise i had better do another she said gravely if we were to lose it we should be in difficulty and immediately she set about depicting baltimore from a slightly different angle more threequarter face hester fetched her another glass of cider and one more for herself and watched patiently while margaret did a third drawing as well in remarkable detail and shaded to show an almost threedimensional likeness then before they ran even greater risk of attracting anyones attention they put the drawings away and left going out into the damp streets but with a clear sky above and a mild breeze promising to keep it so they had a very quiet afternoon at coldbath hester deliberately took a short sleep in preparation for her plans which might involve much of the night she knew monk would not be at home and therefore needed no explanation as to why she was not either she had no intention of taking margaret with her margaret had already done magnificent work today also of course it was necessary to have two people here just in case there should be some need for help from mr lockhart someone had to go for him and that was almost always bessie she seemed to have a great ability to find him at any time perhaps his friends sensed her affection for him and her own past had taught her neither to question nor to judge margaret argued a little but hester could see in her eyes a certain relief when it was pointed out that bessie could not manage alone should someone seriously injured come in yes i suppose so she said with genuine reluctance but what about you you shouldnt go alone either anything could happen to you and we wouldnt even know why dont you she stopped hester smiled why dont i what you cant think of a better idea any more than i can i shall be very careful indeed i promise you i look pretty much like the women who live in the area and they go around by themselves there are police all over the streets just now we know that as well as anyone as long as i dont look as if i am soliciting for trade which i shall take care not to i shall be as safe as anyone and without waiting for further argument from margaret bessie or a voice of caution inside her own head she took an old shawl from the cupboard of spare clothes and went out into the street the evening was fine now and quite warm looking straight ahead of her she walked quickly in the direction of leather lane she intended to begin with the place where nolan baltimores body had been found but she must be careful she did not wish to draw the attention of any police patrolling the streets and alleys and particularly not of constable hart who would recognize her in an instant and probably have a very good idea of her purpose she slowed her step to something more like that of the middleaged woman in front of her keeping about twenty feet between them and trying to appear to a casual eye to be much the same sort of person she reached the angle where bath street becomes lower bath street then crosses the wide thoroughfare of theobalds road and becomes leather lane there was a constable on the corner looking tired and dispirited how was she going to show anyone a picture without drawing his attention it would have to be done under one of the few street lamps one could hardly be expected to recognize anybody in the dusk and shadows closer to the walls or in a doorway or alley the constable watched her without speaking and without apparent interest good that meant he took her for an ordinary resident that was not flattering but it was what she needed at the moment with a tight little smile to herself she walked on down leather lane there was a girl standing close to the next lamppost the light shone on her bare head making a bright mass of her hair she was probably well under twenty not particularly pretty but there was still a certain freshness to her she was not someone hester knew and she found herself suddenly very nervous about asking a complete stranger the questions she needed to but the answers might be known only by strangers and she was not going back to coldbath to tell them that she had been too cowardly to try that would be worse than anything this girl could say to her excuse me she began tentatively the girl looked at her hostility already in her eyes dont stop ere luv she said in a low steady voice this is my patch an me manll mark yer face if yer try it ere find yer own patch she regarded hester with more care yer looks are nothin but yer walk with yer ead igh theres some as likes that try up that way she pointed back up toward the huge mass of the brewery on portpool lane hester swallowed her temper with difficulty the insult stung which was ridiculous she knew her own passion well enough there were too many remembered nights not to but she still did not like to be told her looks were nothing but this was no time to give back as good as she received i dont want your patch she said levelly her better sense knew the girl was only fighting for survival she probably had to fight for everything she got and then fight again to keep it i just want to know if you have seen a particular man in the area look luv the girl answered pityingly if yer ol man comes ere fer is pleasures just look the other way an ang on t yer ouse an yer kids if yer got a roof over yer ead an food in yer belly don go owlin fer the moon yer wont get nothin but a sore froatan if yer go upsettin other folk a bucket o cold water thrown at yer or worse hester hesitated what story could she make up that this girl would believe and still give her the information she needed the girl was turning away already perhaps the only answer was the truth its the man who was murdered she said abruptly feeling the heat run through her body and then the cold as she committed herself irrevocably i want the police out of the area so everything can get back to normal she saw the look of disbelief on the girls face there was nothing for it but to go on now they arent finding out who did it she said abruptly the only way to see the back of them is if somebody else does she fished in her pocket and brought out the picture of nolan baltimore the girl squinted at it is thatim she said curiously i int never seenim sorry hester studied the girls face trying to judge whether to believe her or not the girl smiled mirthlessly i int i know as e were found at abel smiths place but i int never seenim ere thank you she wondered whether to go on and ask this very selfpossessed girl where the brothel was that might use women like herself who walked with their heads high that might be the one that belonged to the usurer she drew in her breath the girl glared at her the warning back in her eyes thank you hester repeated and put the picture back into her pocket and walked on almost as far as high holborn asking people showing them the drawing then back up the farringdon road and across hatton wall back to leather lane again she found no one who would admit to having seen nolan baltimore it was fully dark now and definitely colder there were very few people around a man in a coat too big for him hurried along the footpath dragging one foot a little his shadow crooked on the stones as he passed under the street lamp a woman paraded along the opposite side casually keeping her head high as if she were full of confidence as she rounded the corner into hatton wall a hansom slowed hester did not see whether she was picked up or not a beggar reached an arched doorway and subsided into the brief shelter of it as if for the night hester had accomplished nothing she was not even sure if people were lying out of fear or perversity or if indeed no one had seen baltimore if the latter did that mean he had not been here or simply that he had been extremely careful would a man like nolan baltimore not automatically be careful not to be recognized what had he come here for a secret business meeting to do with land fraud or far more likely to indulge a taste for a bit of rough pleasure and practices he could not indulge in at home at least she knew where abel smiths establishment was and she decided as a last resort to go there and confront him she retraced her steps along leather lane and finally went into a short alley off the street and up a rickety stair all around her she could hear the faint drip of moisture the creak of wood and now and then the scurry of clawed feet that last noise reminded her of the rats in the hospital at scutari and she clenched her teeth and moved a little faster the door opened as she reached it startling her and a bald man with a smiling face stood looking at her the light behind him made a halo out of the few white hairs on his scalp are yer lost then he asked his voice sibilant as if he had a broken tooth it was only when she reached the top step that she realized he was several inches shorter than she was that depends on whether this is abel smiths house or not she replied glad she was not out of breath as well as reasons if it is then i am where i mean to be he shook his head im willin ter try most things luv but yer int right fer ere he looked her up and down if yer desperate ill give yer a bed for the night but find yerself somewere else fer tomorrer yer int my trade no im not she agreed but i know a few girls who are i have the house in coldbath that takes care of some of your sick and injured his eyes narrowed and he whistled his breath out between the gaps in his teeth i int got no one sick ere an i dint ask fer no ouse calls im not here about illness she replied now she decided to stretch the truth a little im here about getting the police to move out of the area so we can all get back to business as usual oh yeah an ow dyer reckon on doin that then he eyed her slim straight body and direct eyes with heavy skepticism theyre sayin as that toff wot got done was ere in me ouse which e never were ceptin wen e were dead he sniffed i never topped a customer in me life bloody stupid thing ter do all ways round but dyer think them stupid sods believe me where is the staircase he is supposed to have fallen down she asked wy wot diffrence does it make ter you he demanded why do you want to hide it she countered go on git outa ere he flapped his hands at her yer jus trouble go on somewhere behind her a rat overbalanced an empty crate and it fell with a damp thud she stood still im trying to help you fool she said fiercely if he didnt die here then he died somewhere else it didnt have anything to do with women at all and if i can prove that then the police will stop harassing us and we can all get back to the way it used to be do you want that or not his eyes were little more than slits in his pink face wy he said carefully i thought as yer was just a dogooder wot tries ter save souls o fallen women yer got summink else goin onint yer he nodded several times wot is it then wot yer doin in that ouse up coldbath that is none of your business she snapped seizing the chance do we have to do this standing on the steps for anyone to hear reluctantly he moved back and swung the door open for her to follow she went in after him and found herself on a narrow landing with half a dozen doors leading off it he walked ahead of her with a curious rolling gait as if he had been long at sea he stopped at the fourth door along opened it and led the way in she went after him and found herself in a sitting room whose furnishings had once been green and red but were now faded and soiled to shades of brown like old leaves a desk against the back wall was covered with papers there was a soft chair ahead of her and a very small fireplace presently filled with dead ash the odor of stale air was oppressive warmth would only have made it worse i would like to speak to some of your girls she asked they dont know nothin he said flatly i dont care about your miserable trade she knew her voice was rising but she could not help it they may have seen this man in the street somebody brought him here you say he didnt walk in then who brought him havent you even wondered who did this to you yer bleedin right i ave he spat his face suddenly losing its pink innocent look and burning instead like that of a malevolent baby curiously evil because it was so ludicrous he suddenly raised his voice ada he yelled with startling volume there was a slight sound downstairs but no one appeared ada he screamed the door flew open and a fat woman almost his own height burst into the room her black ringlets clustered around her red face her eyes blazing with indignation she looked at him then at hester no good she said without being asked too thin wot yer call me fer yer daft aporth dont yer know nothin sorry for er are yer she jabbed a short fat finger toward hester well not in this ouse yer great soft eap o she stopped sensing his lack of selfjustification she realized her error and swung around to face hester well wot are yer ere fer then cat got yer tongue hester pulled out the drawing of nolan baltimore and showed it to her ada barely glanced at it es dead she said flatly some eap o dung left ere on our floor but e int nuffin ter do wi us never seedim afore an no one can prove we ave its your word against theirs hester said reasonably ada was hugely practical she was too much of a survivor to quarrel for the sake of it so wot der yer want then wyd yer care oo putim ere because i wish to find out who killed him so the police will go away and leave us alone and i wish to find out who is lending money to women and making them pay it back by going on the streets hester replied she took a wild chance feeling her flesh prickle at the risk adas black eyes opened even more widely do yer then wy her question was shot out like a missile because as long as there are police all over the place theres no trade hester replied and people cant pay their debts tempers are getting ugly and more and more women will get hurt ada was still suspicious and since when did women oo speak like you care if women like us got trade or not she said her eyes narrow thought you was all fired up ter clean the streets and put decency back inter life she said this last with sarcasm like an open razor if you think putting constables on every corner is going to do that youre a fool hester retorted theres no like me and like you all kinds of women can find themselves in debt and take to the streets to pay it they might have to cater to specialist tastes but they take what they can get its better than being beaten half to death we dont do that ter nobdy ada said indignantly but beside the selfrighteousness there was a ring of honesty in her voice as well and hester heard it do you cater to special tastes hester asked not wi girls wot are ere cos o debts wot we know anythin abaht ada replied theyre jus ornry girls wot wants ter make a livin an they don get enough ter pay moren their way hester glanced at the room what ada said was easy enough to believe although it was quite possible they had a second establishment or even a third which could be different from his but for all she could tell no one had seen nolan baltimore in the area if he had been killed in one of abel smiths other houses were there any smith would hardly have had the body dumped here she was inclined to believe them her silence unnerved ada we dont do nothin like that ada reiterated jus straight busness an we int never beat no one she sniffed fiercely less they got uppity an looked fer it gotta ave some discipline or yer int got nothin people int got no respect fer a great soft eap likeim she glanced witheringly at abel may i speak to some of your girls to ask if anyone saw mr baltimore around the streets here or knows where he could have gone hester requested ada considered for a few moments i spose she said at last apparently she had weighed what hester had told her and decided a degree of trust might get her what she wanted but don take all night times is ard we int got opportunities ter waste hester did not bother to answer she spent nearly an hour speaking with one bored or frightened woman after another but none of them were marked as far as she could see certainly none of them were prepared to admit having seen nolan baltimore in leather lane only at the bottom of the stairs here on the night of his death daft question if yer ask me one woman called polly said with total disdain e were a toff money comin outer is ears an all her laugh changed into a snarl more disgust than anger look at us lady dyer think someone like thats gonna come ere ter the likes o us e wants summink special an e can pay fer it she shrugged and yanked the sliding shoulder of her dress back up again e probly goes up squeaky robinsons way e could pay is prices an no trouble squeaky robinson hester repeated almost afraid to believe who is he dunno polly said immediately nearer coldbath an the brewery atton wall or portpool lane mebbe don wanner know neither d you if yer knows wots good fer yer thank you hester stood up youve been very helpful i appreciate it int told yer nothin polly denied bluntly jerking the dress back into position again and swearing under her breath no hester agreed except that baltimore didnt die here in fact he didnt do business here at all yer right polly said with feeling e dint hester believed her all the way back to coldbath square she turned it over in her mind and was sure that nolan baltimore had met his death somewhere else and been carried to abel smiths house in order to move the blame but she was a little closer to finding out where he had been killed or why though she would not forget the name of squeaky robinson or the fact that according to polly he catered to men with expensive and different tastes chapter six monk had considered very carefully all the information he possessed regarding the baltimore and sons railway and he could see no obvious fraud in the purchase of land or any other part of the project but even if there had been illegitimate profit made in either the buying or not buying of certain stretches of the track he could think of no way in which it could be connected with a risk of accident and that was what exercised his mind in ways katrina harcus could not imagine of course a present danger mattered and he was acutely aware that if such existed he had a moral duty as well as a desire to do everything in his power to avoid it but what hurt with a massive drowning painbecause it was irretrievablewas the fear that in the past the fraud for which arrol dundas had died was in some way responsible for the crash monk remembered with such awful guilt he strode across the grass of regents park toward the royal botanic society gardens barely noticing the other people strolling by his mind was torn between past and present each held the key to the other and he might find both in the few snatches of information katrina held locked in and obscured by her emotions they had at least that in common she was terrified for dalgarno and what she did not know about him and dreaded could be true monk was terrified in exactly the same way but for himself it was bright sunshine with all the aching silverandgold clarity of spring and the gardens were busy with people having nerved himself to meet her he felt a sharp disappointment that he looked for her for several minutes in vain there were dozens of women of all ages he could see colored silk and lace embroidered muslin hats with flowers parasols in a jungle of points above the spread domes of cloth they walked in twos and threes laughing together or on the arms of admirers heads high a flounce of skirts he stood in the gateway with a sense of acute disappointment he had steeled himself for the meeting and now he would have to do it again tomorrow he had no idea where she lived or how to find her and no other avenue of investigation to pursue to fill in the time until she might be here again mr monk he swung around she was there behind him he was so pleased to see her he did not notice what she was wearing except that it was pale and faintly patterned it was her face he watched her amazing darkfringed eyes and he knew he was smiling it probably misled her as if he had good news to tell and even though that was a lie he could not alter it the sheer relief bubbled up inside him miss harcus i i was afraid you would not come he said hastily it was not really what he meant but he could think of nothing more exact she searched his face have you news she said almost breathlessly he noticed only now how pale she was he could feel the emotion in her as he could in himself tight curled like a spring ready to break no he said the word more brusquely than he had intended to because he was annoyed with himself for misleading her except that i have found nothing out of order in mr dalgarnos conduct he stopped there was no relief in her eyes and he had expected it it was as if she could not believe him if anything the tension in her increased under the fine fabric of her dress her shoulders were rigid her breathing so intensely controlled that merely watching her he could feel it himself she started to shake her head very slowly from side to side no no i have searched everything he insisted there may be irregularity in the purchase of land irregularity she said sharply what does that mean is it honest or not i am not completely ignorant mr monk people have gone to prison for irregularities as you call them if they were intentional and they have profited from them sometimes even if they were not intended but they were unable to prove that an elderly gentleman hesitated in his step and glanced at katrina as if uncertain what the tone of her voice might mean was it anger or distress should he intervene he decided not and walked on with considerable relief two ladies smiled at each other and passed by a few feet away yes i know monk said very quietly old sickening memories coming back to him as he stood in the sunlit gardens but fraud has to be proved and i can find nothing katrina drew in her breath as if to interrupt again but he hurried on the sort of thing i am thinking of is routing a railway line through one piece of land rather than another to oblige a farmer or the owner of an estate so as not to divide his land there might have been bribery but i would be very surprised if it is traceable people are naturally discreet about such things he offered her his arm aware that by standing in one place they were making themselves more noticeable she grasped at it till he could feel her fingers through the fabric of his jacket but the crash she said with panic rising in her voice what about the dangers that is not just a matter ofshe gulpedof making personal profit that is questionable its she whispered the word murder at least morally she pulled him to a stop again glaring with a depth of horror in her eyes that frightened him yes i know he agreed gently turning to face her but i have walked the track myself miss harcus and i know about railways there is nothing in land acquisition even bad land that endangers the lives of people on the train isnt there she allowed him to move on slowly and blend in with the others strolling between the flower beds are you certain if land costs more than it should have done or less he explained and the company owners put the difference in their own pockets instead of those of the shareholders that is theft but it does not affect the safety of the railway itself she looked up at him earnestly he could see the hurt and confusion in her face the desperation mounting inside her why what did she know about dalgarno that she was still not telling him what amounts of money could be involved she interrupted his thoughts a great deal surely enough to keep an ordinary man in comfort for the rest of his life monk had a sudden start of memory of arrol dundas so vivid he could see the lines in dundass skin the curve of his nose and a gentleness in his eyes as he looked across at monk he was back at the trial again seeing peoples faces drop in amazement as amounts of money were mentioned sums that seemed unimaginable wealth to them but in railway terms were everyday he could see the open mouths hear the gasps of indrawn breath and the rustle of movement around the room the scrape of fabric the creak of whalebone stays what had happened to that money did dundass widow have it no that was impossible people did not keep the profit of crime had it disappeared there must have been proof that he had had it at some time in order to convict him monk refused even to consider the other possibility that somehow he himself had had it he knew enough of his own life in the police force to know such wealth would have been exposed katrina was waiting for him to respond he jerked himself back to the present yes it would be a great deal of money he conceded her mouth was a thin line lips tight enough to tempt men to great crime she said hoarsely for people to believe the worst of anyone quite easily mr monk this answer is not sufficient she looked down away from his eyes and what they might read in hers when she spoke again her voice was little more than a whisper i am so afraid for michael i hardly know how to keep my head at all because i am afraid i have taken risks i would never take in other circumstances i have listened at doors i have overheard conversations i have even read papers on other peoples desks i am ashamed to confess it she looked up suddenly but i am seeking with all my strength to prevent disaster to those i love and to ordinary innocent men and women who only wish to travel from one town to another and who trust the railway to carry them safely what is it that you have not told me he demanded now a little roughly again passersby were staring at them perhaps because they were standing rather than walking more likely because they saw the passion and the urgency in katrinas face and that she was still gripping monks arm i know that jarvis baltimore is planning to spend over two thousand pounds on an estate for himself she said breathlessly i saw the plans of it he spoke of having the money in almost two months time from the profits they expect out of the scheme he and michael spoke of she was watching him intently struggling to guess his judgment but both he and michael have said it must be kept a most deadly secret or it will ruin them instead are you quite certain you have not misunderstood he questioned was this since nolan baltimores death no the word was hardly more than a breathing out so it was not an inheritance the sale of railway stock to foreign railway companies why should that be secret she asked would someone not speak of it quite openly do not companies do it all the time yes he said that with certainty there is some secret you have not yet discovered mr monk she said huskily something which is terrible and dangerous and will drag michael down to prison if not death if we do not find it before it is too late fear ran through him like a burning wave but it was nameless and without sense he reached for the only thing he knew which matched the violence and the enormity of what she was suggesting miss harcus nolan baltimore was murdered a short while ago most people assumed it was because he was frequenting a brothel in leather lane but perhaps that is what they were intended to think she jerked up her head staring at him with terrified eyes her face white she was totally oblivious of the people around her of their curiosity or alarm you think it was to do with the railway she breathed out the words in horror putting her hand up to cover her mouth as if that could stifle the truth he knew the worst fear that had to be in her mind and he hurt for her pain but it was senseless to evade it now it would not drive it away yes he answered gently if you are correct and there really is such a great deal of money involved then if he knew of this scheme he may have been murdered to assure his silence now she was so white he was afraid she was going to faint instinctively he reached for her arms to stop her from falling she allowed him to hold her for no more than seconds then she pulled away with a jerk so sharp he all but tore the fine muslin of her sleeves no there was horror in her face and she spoke with such pentup choking emotion that several people nearby actually turned and looked at them both then in embarrassment at being caught staring turned away again miss harcus he urged please no she repeated but less fiercely i i cant think that she did not finish they both knew what it was that tormented her the possibility was too clear if the fraud were as great as she feared the profit as high then nolan baltimore could easily have been murdered to silence him it could have been because he knew and he and his murderer quarreled he wanted too large a share or he threatened the plans in any other way or because he had not known but had discovered and had to be silenced before he betrayed them michael dalgarno was the obvious man to suspect as far as katrina knew only dalgarno and jarvis baltimore were involved monk ached for her he knew with hideous familiarity what it was like to live with the dread of learning the truth and yet be compelled to seek it all the denial in the world changed nothing and yet the knowledge final and irrefutable would destroy all that mattered most for her it would mean that the man she loved in a sense had never really existed even before he had gone to leather lane that night before anything was irrevocable he had had the seed of it within him the cruelty and the greed the arrogance that placed his own gain before another mans life he had betrayed himself long before he had betrayed katrina or his mentor and employer and if monk had betrayed arrol dundas and had even the slightest knowing or willing hand in the rail crash in the past then he had never been the man hester believed him to be and everything he had so carefully built with such difficult letting go of his pride would come shattering down like a house of cards suddenly this woman he barely knew was closer to him than anyone else because they shared a fear which dominated their lives to the exclusion of everything else she was still staring at him in terrified silence miss harcus he said with a tenderness that startled him and this time he did not hesitate to touch her it was only a small gesture but of extraordinary understanding i will find out the truth he promised if there is a fraud ill uncover it and prevent any further accidents and i will do what i can to discover who murdered nolan baltimore he watched her gravely but unless there is fraud and michael dalgarno is implicated he would have no motive to have done such a thing baltimore was probably killed in some fight over money to do with prostitution not a fortune but a few pounds some drunken pimp thought he owed they may well have had no idea who he was had he a hot temper the faintest shadow of a smile touched her lips and her whole body eased its stiffness yes she whispered yes he was quicktempered thank you more than i can say mr monk you have at least given me hope i shall cling onto that until you bring me news her eyes flickered down then up again i must owe you further and you have expenses from all the traveling you have done on my behalf would another fifteen pounds be sufficient for the moment it it is all i can manage there was a faint flush of embarrassment on her cheeks now it would be quite sufficient he answered taking it from her hand and putting it into his inside pocket as discreetly as possible pulling out a handkerchief as if that were what he had reached for he saw her flash of understanding and acknowledgment and was sufficiently thanked in that it was time that monk considered more seriously the possibility that baltimores death was not the prostitution scandal that the police and everyone else assumed but a very personal murder simply carried out in or near the brothel in leather lane if dalgarno or even jarvis baltimore had wished to kill the older man to do it behind the mask of his private vices was the perfect crime there was nothing to be gained by asking the superintendent in charge of the investigation who would resent monks interference the poor man was being pressured more than enough by the authorities and the outraged citizens who felt morally obliged to protest no matter what he did he would not please them the only solution they wanted was for the whole matter to disappear without trace and that was not a possibility if they did not complain they appeared to condone prostitution and the murder of a prominent citizen if they did then they drew even more attention to practices they all wished to be free to indulge in and deny at the same time nor was there much purpose in his speaking to the constables on the beat who were being dragooned into protecting the farringdon road area against everybodys interests if they knew who had killed nolan baltimore whoever it was would have been charged already and the matter put to rest what monk wanted to know was the movements of nolan baltimore on the night of his death and exactly what michael dalgarno had known of them and where he had been how had they parted what was jarvis baltimores role who could know these things the baltimore household family and servants possibly the constables on the beat near the house or the offices if either man had not gone home that evening or street peddlers cabdrivers people whose daily passage took them through that area he began with the easiest and possibly the most likely to tell him something of worth she sat on a rickety box propped up near the corner of the street a shawl around her head and a clay pipe stuck firmly between her remaining teeth an array of cough drops and brandy balls sat in bowls and tin dishes around her and a heap of small squares of paper was held down by a stone arternoon sir she said in a soft irish accent now what can i be gettin yer he cleared his throat cough drops if you please he said with a smile threepence worth i think he fished a threepenny piece out of his pocket and offered it to her she took it and ladled out a portion of sticky sweets with a tin spoon she dropped them onto one of the pieces of paper and twisted it into a screw then handed it up to him she drew deeply on the pipe but it appeared to have gone out she fished in her pocket but he was there before her a packet of matches in his hand he held it out for her its a gentleman ye are she said taking it from him picking out a match and striking it holding the flame to the bowl of her pipe and drawing deeply it caught and she inhaled with profound satisfaction she offered the matches back to him keep them he replied generously she did not argue but her bright eyes half hidden by wrinkles of weathered skin were sharp with amusement so what are ye wantin then she said bluntly he smiled widely at her he had charm when he wanted it youll be knowing that mr baltimore was murdered in leather lane a few days ago he said candidly he knew the folly of insulting her wits anyone who served in the street to her age was nobodys fool sure an doesnt all london know it she replied her expression betrayed her contempt of him probably not for his morals but for his hypocrisy youll have seen him coming and going he went on nodding his head toward the baltimore house thirty yards away of course i have bad cess to him she responded not a halfpenny on a cold day that one perhaps it was a warning to him that she had no interest in helping to find his killer an honest expression or a ploy to be paid now for help it did not matter either way if she told him anything he was happy to reward her for it i am interested in the possibility that he was killed by someone who knew him he admitted did you see him that evening any idea what time he left home and if he was alone or with anyone she looked at him steadily weighing him up he looked back wondering whether she wanted money or if poorly handled it would offend her pride it would be very agreeable to find it was nothing to do with the women in leather lane he remarked real interest flashed in her eyes it would an all she agreed but even if i saw him leave an others follow after him that doesnt mean to say they went further than the end o the street now does it no it doesnt he said trying to keep the emotion out of his voice he did not even know if he was excited or afraid he did not want dalgarno guilty it was only the keenness of a scent which caught his eagerness a thread of truth at last among all the knots and ends but if i knew which way they went then i might be able to find the cabbie who picked them up josiah wardrup she said without a flicker saw him myself i did almost like he was expectin the old bastard how very interesting monk said sincerely perhaps he was in fact perhaps mr baltimore went that way at that time quite regularly she made a low sound of appreciation in the back of her throat its clever you are now isnt it oh now and then he agreed he fished in his pocket and brought out two shillings i think ill reward myself with a few pence worth of brandy balls sure an how many pence worth would that be now she asked taking the two shillings from him four he said unhesitatingly she grinned and poured him a generous four pence worth thank you keep the change im most obliged she put the clay pipe back in her mouth and drew on it with profound satisfaction she had had a pleasant conversation gained one and eight pence for nothing and perhaps helped the cause of justice to get the rozzers off the backs of the poor cows who worked down the farringdon road way not bad for less than half an hours work monk took until the next day to find josiah wardrup but with only a moderate amount of pressure the cabbie admitted that he had picked up nolan baltimore on that corner at least once a week for the last two or three years and taken him to the corner of theobalds road and grays inn road which was a mere stones throw from leather lane monk was not sure if it was what he wanted to hear it looked extraordinarily like a regular indulgence but then insofar as it was regular it would have been simple enough for anyone wishing him harm to have learned his pattern and followed him but if wardrup had seen anyone else he was not saying so he looked at monk with blank innocence and demanded his suitable appreciation and no he had no idea where mr baltimore went from the corner he always stood there and waited until wardrup had left which caused him some wry amusement what did anyone imagine a gentleman did in such an area the only fact monk would glean of any interest was that on every occasion it had been the same corner the times varied the nights of the week but never the place and yet the brothel in leather lane where his body was found denied all knowledge of him they said that not only had he not been there for business that night he had never been monk was alternately cajoling and threatening but not one woman changed her words and in spite of general opinion of their honesty and the fact that baltimore had undoubtedly been found there he found to his surprise that he believed them of course he was also aware that he was far from the first person to have asked and they had had more than enough time to compare stories with each other and determine a united front still abel smiths dubious and far from attractive establishment was not the sort of place one expected a man of baltimores wealth to frequent but tastes were individual some men liked dirt others danger yet he knew of none who liked diseaseexcept of course those already infected at the end of two days he was little wiser he turned his attention to dalgarno surprised how much he dreaded what he would find and the search itself was not easy dalgarno was a man who seemed to do a great many things alone it was not difficult to establish what time he had left the offices of baltimore and sons a few enquiries of the desk elicited that information but it was of little use dalgarno had left at six oclock five hours before baltimore had been picked up by a hansom and taken to the corner of the grays inn road a newsboy had seen someone who was almost certainly dalgarno go into the baltimore house and half an hour later jarvis baltimore go in also but he had left the street before eight and no one that monk could question knew anything further the baltimore servants would know but he had no authority to speak to them and could think of no excuse even if he could have baltimore could have been killed at any time after midnight and before dawn no enquiry showed one way or the other whether dalgarno had been in his rooms all night exit and entry were easy and there was no postman or other servant to see he spoke to the gingerbread seller on the corner fifty yards away a small spare man who looked as if he could profit from a thick slice of his own wares and a hot cup of tea he had seen dalgarno returning home at about half past nine in the evening of baltimores death dalgarno had been walking rapidly his face set in a mask of fury his hat jammed hard on his head and he had passed without a word however the gingerbread seller had packed up shortly after that and gone home so he had no idea whether dalgarno had gone out again or not the constable on night duty might know he patrolled this way now and then but he gave monk a lopsided grin and half a wink he did have a certain acquaintance who frequented these streets on lessopen business give him a few days and he would make enquiries monk gave him half a crown and promised him another seven to make up a sovereign if he would do as he suggested only monk would need more than a word secondhand if there were anything he must speak to the witness himself what anybody elses business was in the street would remain unknown and unquestioned the constable thought for a moment or two then agreed monk thanked him said he would be back in three or four days and took his leave it was about three in the afternoon cold and gusty gray with coming rain he could do no more about dalgarno and baltimores death for now it was probably exactly what it looked to be and everyone assumed he could no longer put off the search he had known from the beginning he would have to make he must go back to arrol dundass trial and see if the details would shake loose his memory at last and he could remember what he had known then the fraud how it was discovered and above all his own part in it he did not know where the trial had been but all deaths were recorded and the files held here in london he knew sufficient details to find the file and it would tell him the place he would go back there tonight and face his own past pry open the lid of his nightmares and let them loose first he must go home wash eat change his clothes and pack a case ready to go wherever it proved to be he had expected hester to be out either working at the house in coldbath square or raising more money to pay the rent and keep it supplied with food and medicines he presumed it because he wished it so to avoid the confrontation of his own emotions he was aware that it was a kind of cowardice and was ashamed of it but he imagined what her feelings would be if she were forced to face the truth that he was so much less than she believed and that was a pain he was not ready for it would be so violent as to disable the concentration and intelligence he must bring to bear if he was to keep his promise to katrina harcus and prevent any new rail disaster even that was an evasion it was for himself that he would do it it was his own compulsion never to allow such a thing to happen again he must do that before he could bear to face the original which lay somewhere in his memory fragmented imperfect but undeniable he opened the door and went inside ready to do no more than change clothing pack have a cup of tea and a slice of bread with whatever cold meat he could find he would leave a note for her to explain his absence instead he almost ran into her as she came out of the kitchen smiling ready to walk into his arms but he saw the uncertainty in her eyes that told of her sensitivity to his aloneness the withdrawal of the old honesty between them she was hurt and hiding it for his sake he hesitated hating the lie and fearing the truth it must only be seconds less than that or it was too long he had to make the decision now it was instinctive he went forward and put his arms around her holding her too closely feeling her body yield and cling onto him in return this at least was honest he had never loved her more all that she was the courage the generosity of spirit the fierceness to protect and her own vulnerability which she thought so hidden and which was in reality so obvious he pressed his cheek into the softness of her hair moving his lips gently but he did not speak at least without words he had not deliberately misled her in a moment or two he would tell her he was going away again and perhaps even why but for a while let it simply be the truth of touch without complication he would remember that afterwards keep it in his mind and deeper than thatin the unspoken memory of the body it was late when he reached the public records office all he knew was the year of dundass death not the date it could take him some time to find the record since he was not certain of the place either but at least it was an uncommon name if he had still been with the police he would have demanded that the office remain open for him to search for as long as he required as a private person he could ask nothing he simply requested the records section he wanted and when he was conducted to it sat on a high stool straining his eyes to read the pages and pages of spidery writing the attendant was at his elbow to tell him they were closing when he saw the name dundas and then the rest of it he had died of pneumonia in prison in liverpool april he closed the book and turned to the man thank you he said hoarsely thats all i need im obliged to you irrational how seeing it in cold writing like that made it so much more real it took it out of imagination and memory and into the world of indelible fact that the world knew as well as he he strode out of the door down the steps and along the street back to the station where he bought a ham sandwich and a cup of tea while he waited for the last train north when the night train pulled into liverpool lime street just before dawn monk got off shivering cold his body stiff and went to buy himself a hot drink and something to eat then to look for some sort of lodgings where he could wash and shave and put on a clean shirt before he began to look for the facts of the past it was still far too early to find any records office open but he knew without asking where the prison was by seven oclock it was gray daylight with a stiff wind coming up off the mersey all around him people were hurrying to work steps swift heads down he heard the flat nasal liverpool voices with the lift at the end of each sentence the dry humor the cheerful complaints about the weather the government the prices of everything and found it all oddly familiar even the slang he understood he took a hansom and simply directed the driver street by street until the dark walls towered over them and memories came surging back like the flood tide of the sea the smell of the wet stones the sound of rain in the gutter the unevenness of the cobbles and the chill wind around the corners he told the driver to wait climbed out and stood staring at the locked gates he had been here before so many times in dundass last days even the pattern of light and shadow on the walls was familiar more powerful than the blackness of the stone around him and the smell of ingrained dirt and misery was the old feeling of helplessness come back with shattering force as if the air were thin in his lungs starving him of breath he stood motionless fighting to grasp something tangiblewords facts details of anythingbut the harder he tried the more completely it all eluded him there was only the suffocating emotion behind him the cab horse shifted its weight iron shoes loud on the cobbles harness creaking there was nothing to be gained here remembered pain did not help he had not doubted the truth of it he needed something he could follow he walked slowly back to the hansom and climbed in i want to look at old newspapers he told the driver sixteen years ago take me wherever they are library the driver replied less yer want the law courts no thank you the library will do if he had to ask for a transcript of the trial he would but he was not ready for that yet to see such a thing he would have to give his name and his reasons the newspapers were an anonymous way of learning and he despised himself even as the thought was in his mind still he knew it was selfpreservation to guard against all the hurt he could pain was disabling and he had to keep his promise to katrina harcus there was no one else interested in old records so early in the day and he had the newspaper files to himself it took no more than fifteen minutes to locate the trial of arrol dundas he already knew the date of dundass death so he worked backwards there was the headlinefinancier arrol dundas on trial for fraud he turned to the beginning and read it was exactly as he had feared the print swam before his eyes but he could have recited the words as if they were in inchhigh capitals there was even a penandink sketch of dundas in the dock it was brilliant monk did not have to hesitate for an instant to wonder if it portrayed the man as he had been it was so vivid the charm the dignity the inner grace were all there caught in a few lines and the fear and weariness in the face fine features become gaunt nose too prominent hair a fraction too long folds in the skin too deep making him look ten years older than the sixtytwo the words proclaimed monk stared at it and was back in the courtroom again feeling the press of bodies around him the noise the smell of anger in the air the harsh liverpool voices with their unique rhythm and accent the innate humor turned vicious against what they saw as betrayal all the time he felt the frustration again the striving to do something he was prevented from at every turn hope seeped away like water poured into dry sand there was a picture of the prosecutor a large man with a bland placid face belying his appetite for success he had educated himself out of his local dialect but the nasal sounds of it were still there when he was excited scenting the kill now and then he forgot and used a piece of idiom and the crowd loved him for it monk had not realized then how much he was playing to the gallery but now with hindsight and memories of the scores of other trials he had attended he could see that the prosecutor had been like a bad actor did it all rest on the skill of lawyers what if dundas had had someone like oliver rathbone would it have made any real difference in the end he read on through the account of witnesses first of all other bankers disclaiming all knowledge of improper dealings busy washing their hands of it talking loudly of their innocence he could remember their wellcut jackets and tightcollared shirts faces scrubbed and pink voices correct they had looked frightened as if guilt were contagious monk could feel his own anger clenching inside him still urgent and real not something finished sixteen years ago next had come the investors who had lost money or at least were beginning to realize they were not going to profit as they had expected they had swung from professed ignorance to open anger when they saw that their financial competence was undermined they had been foremost in damning dundas with their sly pejorative words their judgment of his character wise after the event monk could remember his fury as he had been forced to listen to them helpless to argue to defend to speak of their own greed or repeat the eagerness with which they had been persuaded from one route to another one purchase more or less any cheaper way he had wanted to testify he could feel his anger as if it had been yesterday and all the pressure he had put to bear on the defense lawyer to let him speak and every time it had been refused prejudice the jury he had been told pillar of the community cant attack baltimore or youll only make it worse his family has money in every big undertaking in lancashire make an enemy of him and youll turn half the county against you and so it had gone on until his own evidence had been so anodyne as to be virtually useless he entered the ring like a boxer with one arm behind him bruised by blows he could not return the landowner had surprised him he had expected outrage and selfinterest from him and instead he had heard bewilderment careful recounting of haggling and sales attempts at diversion so as to keep one estate or another whole but there was no spite no desperation to preserve a reputation large sums of money had changed hands but in spite of all the prosecutors attempts to make them seem dishonest or exorbitant by and large they were exactly what everyone expected however when all the amounts were entered into evidence monk heard the death knell of the defense in those meticulous records he knew now as if it were all clear in his fragmented mind just what the final verdict would be not because it was true but because there were too many of the negotiations conducted by dundas agreements with his signature on them money in his accounts he could deny but he could not disprove he had acted for others that was his business but there were no other names written he had trusted they claimed they had trusted also who had betrayed whom of course monk knew the verdictguilty but he had to know more of the detail exactly how the fraud had been managed so that it had remained hidden until the last moment how had dundas expected to get away with it there was a sketch of nolan baltimore giving evidence monk stared at the few lines with fascination it was an ugly face but there was immense vitality in it a power in the heavy bones and appetite in the curve of the mouth it was intelligent but portraying no sensitivity and little subtlety or humor monk was repulsed yet it was only a sketch one mans view he could not recall ever having seen the man alive he was simply the owner of dalgarnos company and the man whose murder had so inconvenienced hester and the women she cared for he had died in leather lane in all probability pushed down the stairs by a prostitute whom presumably he had refused to pay or else railway fraud had at last caught up with him after all and he had been killed as katrina feared either to prevent it from happening again or to keep it secret and allow it to go ahead had he been going to expose this one too this allbutduplicate of the old fraud which would have worked if if what monk laid the paper down on the flat tabletop and stared at the rows of folders and ledgers on the shelves in front of him what had happened to expose arrol dundas why had the scheme not continued undetected had someone betrayed him or had it been carelessness a transfer not concealed well enough an entry not followed through something incomplete a name mentioned that should not have been if anyone had ever told monk he had known from a confidence or deduction he could not bring it back now however hard he tried his eyes ached from the endless writing and the lines jumped in front of him but he went back to reading the account of evidence day by day fraud trials were always long there was so much detail following the intricacies of land sale and purchase surveying negotiation of routes consideration of methods materials alternatives he rubbed his eyes blinking as if there were grit in them he had given evidence himself but there was no sketch of him he was not interesting enough to engage the reader so whether the artist had drawn him or not no likeness had been used was he disappointed had he really been so incidental then so unimportant it seemed so he read what was given of his own interrogation by the prosecutor at first he was startled to see that from the tone of the questions he was obviously a suspect too but then as he looked at it more rationally and without the instinctive selfdefense the man would have been derelict in his duty not to have taken very serious consideration of the possibility so if he had been suspected then why was he later considered to be of insufficient interest to have his picture included he must have been vindicated by the time the newspaper went to press he was effectively no longer involved why did it matter now probably not according to what was reported in the paper monk had conducted some of the negotiations for purchase it seemed to have been pulled out of him with extraordinary reluctance that he had not hired the surveyor which was the fact that exonerated him he had been in the witnessbox altogether less than half an hour if he had said anything at all to help clear dundas it was not reported he had been regarded as a hostile witness by the prosecution but most of what he was asked concerned documents and could hardly be denied he could not remember what he had said only the feeling of being trapped stared at by the crowd frowned on by the judge weighed and assessed by the jurors fought over by the opposing counsel and looked to for help he could not give by dundas himself that was what remained with him even now the guilt because he had not been clever enough to make any difference then another face was sharp in his mind one not drawn by the artist for whatever reason perhaps compassionthat of dundass wife she had sat with a terrible calm throughout the trial her loyalty had been the one thing even the prosecution had felt obliged to praise he had spoken of her with respect certain that her faith in her husband was both honest and complete monk recalled her afterwards the totality of her silent grief when she had told him of dundass death he could picture the room the sunlight her face pale the tears on her cheeks as if it were then too late for anything but the hidden inmost pain which never leaves it was she he thought of more than dundas she whose grief outweighed his own and which tore still at the deep well of emotion within him unhealed even now and there was something more but he could not bring it back he sat staring at the old papers yellowed at the edges and struggled to recapture what it was time and time again it was almost there and then it splintered into fragments and meant nothing he gave up and went back to the next stage of the trial more witnesses this time for the defense clerks were called people who had written entries in ledgers kept books filed orders for money purchases of land title deeds surveys but it was all too complicated and half of them had become uncertain under crossexamination the main thrust of the defense had been not that there was no fraud but that nolan baltimore could equally be suspected of it but nolan baltimore was in the witnessbox arrol dundas was in the dockand that perception made all the difference it depended upon whom you believed and then in that light all the evidence fell one way or the other monk could see how it had been and he could find no loose thread to unravel a greater truth there seemed no question that dundas had purchased land in his own name farmland of poor quality which he had paid market value for little enough when you need it for running sheep but when the railway was diverted from its original track around a hill and through that farmland which it was obliged to buy at a considerably larger amount then dundass very rapidly turned profit was huge that in itself would be regarded as no more than exceptionally fortunate speculation to be envied but not blamed one might well resent not having done the same oneself but only a smallminded man hates another for such advantage it only looked fraudulent when it emerged that the rerouting of the track from its original passage was not only unnecessary but brought about at all only by forged papers and lies told by dundas the original route would have been used in spite of the fact that a certain owner of a huge estate was actually campaigning against it because it spoiled the path of his local hunt and the magnificent landscaped view from his house the hill that had been the pretext for the rerouting was real and certainly lay across the proposed path of the track but it was less high in reality than on the survey they had used which was actually of another hill of remarkably similar outlines but higher and of granite the grid references had been changed in an imaginative forgery the actual hill across the track could probably have been blasted into a simple cutting with a manageable gradient if not even tunneling for a short distance would have been possible the cost of that had been wildly overestimated in dundass calculations too much to have been incompetence all dundass past plans were reviewed and no errors were found of more than a foot here or there this miscalculation was over a hundred feet when it was put together with his profit on the sale of the land the assumption of intentional fraud was inescapable a defense of incompetence misjudgment and coincidental profit might have succeeded but it was dundass name on the purchase and on the survey and the money was in dundass bank not baltimores in the face of the evidence the jury returned the only verdict it could arrol dundas was sentenced to ten years imprisonment he died within months monk was cold where he sat drenched with memory he could feel again the overwhelming defeat it hurt with a pain so intense it was physical it was for dundas whitefaced crumpled as if age had caught up with him and shrunken him inside and in a day he had been struck by twenty years it was for his wife as well she had hoped until the very end she had kept a strength that had sustained them all but there was nothing left to hope for now it was over and it was for himself also it was the first bitter and terrible loneliness he could recall it was a knowledge of loss a real and personal sweetness gone from his life how much of the truth had he known at the time he had been far younger then a good banker but naïve in the ways of crime it was before he had become a policeman he was accustomed to making judgments of mens character but not with the view to dishonesty he had developed later not with the knowledge of every kind of fraud embezzlement and theftand the suspicion carved deep into every avenue of his mind he had wanted to believe dundas all his emotions and loyalty were vested in his honesty and his friendship it was like being asked to accept that your own father had deliberately deceived you over the years and everything you had learned from him was tainted with lies not just to the world but specifically to you was that why he had believed dundas and the rest of the world had not all the proof had been pieces of paper anyone can produce paper whoever else had been in the company even baltimore himself but dundas had fought so little he had seemed to at first and then to crumple as if he knew defeat even before he really attempted to struggle but monk had felt so certain of dundass innocence had he known something which he had not said in court something which would have shown that there was no deceit or if there had been that it was baltimores after all there was no proof here that it had been dundass idea to divert the track neither had there been anything to prove that he had met the landowner or accepted any favor from him financial or otherwise the police had not examined the landowners records to trace any exchange of monies nothing was found in dundass bank beyond the profit from the sale of his own land the worst that could be said of that was that it had been sharp practice but that happened all the time it was what speculation was half the families in europe had made their fortune in ways they would not care to acknowledge now what could he have known where more money was why had he kept silent to conceal dundass act to keep the money from being taken back for whommrs dundas or himself he moved in the seat and felt his locked muscles stab he was so stiff he winced and rubbed his hands over his eyes he had to know his own part in itit was the core of who he had been then then he even used the word as if it could separate him from who he was now and rid himself of responsibility for it at last he faced the thing that was woven into the story and that in pursuing the evidence of money he had ignoredthe crash it was not mentioned in reports about the trial even obliquely obviously it was either irrelevant or it had not happened yet there was only one way to find out he turned the pages looking at headlines only it would be in the heaviest blackest print when it came and it wasnearly a month later at the top of the front pagerail crash kills over forty children as coal train plows into excursion trip from liverpool the words seemed unfamiliar although he must have read this before but he had to have known about it anyway seeing this would have meant nothing it would have been only someone elses report of a horror beyond words to recreate now as he stared at it it was everything the reality he had been torn between finding and leaving buried the compulsion to know and the dread of confirming it at last making it no longer nightmare but reality never again to be evaded or denied an excursion train carrying nearly two hundred children on a trip into the country was crashed and thrown off the rails last night as it returned to the city along the new line recently opened by baltimore and sons the accident happened on the curve beyond the old st thomass church where the line goes into single track for a distance of just under a mile through two cuttings a goods train heavily loaded with coal failed to stop as it was coming down the incline before the tracks joined it crashed into the passenger cars hurling them down the slope to the shallow valley below many carriages caught fire from the gas used to provide lights and screaming children were trapped inside to be burned to death other children were thrown clear as the fabric of the carriages was torn and burst open some to escape with shock and bruises many to be crippled maimed trapped and crushed under the wreckage both drivers were killed by the impact as were the firemen stokers and brakemen on both trains monk skipped over the next paragraphs which were accounts of the attempts at rescue and the transport of the injured and dead to the nearest places of help after that there followed the grief and horror of relatives and promises of the fullest possible investigation but even searching with stiff fingers and dazed mind through all the succeeding weeks into months he found no satisfactory explanation as to what had caused the crash in the end it was attributed to human error on the part of the goods train driver he was not alive to defend himself and no one had discovered any other cause certainly the torn and twisted track appeared to have been damaged by the crash itself and there was no suggestion by anyone that it had been at fault previously to that the earlier goods train along it carrying timber had had no difficulty at all and arrived at its destination safely and on time as he had already heard from the clerk days ago there was nothing wrong with the trackthere was no connection whatever with the fraud or with arrol dundas or therefore with monk with overwhelming relief he kept telling himself that over and over again he would go back to london and assure katrina harcus that there was no reason whatever to fear a crash on the new line baltimore and sons had never been implicated in the liverpool crash and baltimore himself had been exonerated of fraud in the trial of dundas which did not mean he had been innocent but if land fraud was what was happening now on the same scale as before then it was not unreasonable to believe it was nolan baltimore who was involved this time as well rather than michael dalgarno monk could at least tell that to katrina although even as he said that to himself he knew she would want more than hope she would need proofjust as he did he went back to the station and caught the evening train to london perhaps because he had been reading most of the day and had slept little and poorly on the previous night in spite of the wooden seats and the awkward upright position the rhythmic movement of the train and the sound of the wheels over the track lulled him to sleep he drifted into a darkness in which he was even more conscious of the noise it seemed to fill the air and to be all around him growing louder his body was tense his face tingling as if cold air were streaming past him and yet he could see sparks red in the night like chips of fire there was something he needed to do it mattered more than anything else even the risk of his own life it dominated everything mind and body obliterating all thought of his safety of physical pain exhaustion and carrying him beyond even fearand there was everything to be afraid of it roared and surged around him in the darkness buffeting him until he was bruised and aching clinging on desperately fighting to what he did not know there was something he must do the fate of everybody who mattered depended on it but what was it he racked his brain and found only the driving compulsion to succeed the wind was streaming past him like liquid ice he strained against a force hurling his weight against it but it was immovable there was indescribable noise impact and then he was running scrambling blind with terror all around him the sound of screaming ripped through him like physical pain and he could do nothing he was closed in by confusion thrashing around pointlessly bumping into objects in the darkness one moment blinded by flames the next the heat in his face and the cold behind him his feet were leaden holding him back while the rest of his body ran with sweat he saw the face again above the clerical collar the same as before this time gray with horror scrambling in the wreckage all the time calling out he woke with a violent start his head throbbing his lungs aching starved of air his mouth dry as soon as he moved he realized the sweat was real sticking his clothes to him but the carriage was bitterly cold and his feet were numb he was alone in his compartment the smell of smoke was in his imagination but the fear was real the guilt was real knowledge of failure weighed on him as if it were woven into every part of his life staining everything seeping into every corner and marring all other joy but what failure he had not saved dundas but he had known that for years and now he was no longer rationally sure that dundas had been innocent he felt it but what were his feelings worth they could have been simply born of the loyalty and ignorance of a young man who owed a great deal to someone who had been as a father to him he had seen dundas as he wished him to be like millions before him and millions to come the dream was a crashthat was obvious but was it from reality or imagination read into the accounts of those who were there or even a visit to the scene afterwards as part of the enquiry into what had happened it was not the rail line which had caused it it was not the land fraud which could make no difference to anything but money so why did he feel this terrible responsibility this guilt what was there in himself so fearful he still could not bear to look at it was it dundasor himself could he find out was he just like katrina harcus driven to discover a truth which might destroy everything that mattered to him he sat hunched in the seat rattling through the darkness towards london shivering and icy cold thoughts racing off the rails into tunnelsand another different kind of crash chapter seven the house on coldbath square was almost empty of women injured in the usual way of trade because there was hardly any trade many of the local populace had found ways around the constant police presence and now conducted what business they could elsewhere but the farringdon road was outwardly much the same as always it required a more practiced eye to see the stiffness of street corner peddlers the way everyone was watching over their shoulders not for pickpockets or other smalltime thieves but for the ubiquitous constables placed in frustrated boredom as prevention rather than solution on our backs like a jockey floggin a horse what wont run constable hart said miserably nursing a mug of hot tea in his hands as he sat opposite hester at the smaller of the two tables we wont run cos we cant he went on it was midafternoon and raining on and off his wet cape hung on one of the hooks by the door were just standin round lookin stupid an gettin everyone angry at us he complained its all to make the baltimore family an their friends feel like were cleanin up london his expression of disgust conveyed his feelings perfectly i know she agreed with some sympathy nobody ever done that nor ever will he added london dont wanter be cleaned up women on the street int the problem problem is men what comes after em of course hester conceded would you like some toast his face lit up it was a completely unnecessary question as she had known it would be he cleared his throat got any black currant jam he asked hopefully of course she smiled and he colored very faintly she stood up and spent the next few minutes cutting bread toasting it on the fork in front of the stove and then bringing it over with butter and jam thanks he said with his mouth already full she and margaret had spent their days trying to drum up more funding having further conversations with jessop which varied from placatory to confrontational and back again depending upon tempers and pledges of help hester had never disliked anyone more are you any closer to finding whoever killed baltimore she asked hart he shrugged an air of hopelessness filling him as he stared gloomily at the crumbs on his plate not as i can see he admitted abel smiths girls all swear blind they dint do it an speakin purely for meself i believe em not that the higherups are goin to listen to what i say he looked up at her with sudden anger his face set hard but im damned if im goin to see some poor little cow topped for killinim just to satisfy is family an their like an get business back to normal no matter whoever says ever so soft that theyd like it that way hester felt a chill do you think anyone would try to do that he caught the doubt in her voice youre a nice lady brought up proper you dont belong ere he said gently he glanced around the long room with its iron beds the stone sinks at the far end and the jugs and pails of water course they would if it comes to it cant go on like this much longer right and wrong gets to look different when youve bin ungry for a while or slept in a doorway ive seen em it changes folk an oos to say its their fault she wondered whether to tell him anything about squeaky robinson and his very different establishment apparently somewhere near reids brewery on portpool lane or close beside she was only half listening to him as she weighed it up of course she agreed absently if she told hart he would feel obliged in turn to tell his superiors and they would go blundering in and very possibly warn robinson without learning anything about baltimore after all robinson would deny it just as everyone else was doing almost certainly he already had done not as im sure we want to find the truth hart went on dismally considering what itll be like as not now she did pay attention not find it she challenged you mean just go on with the appearance until they get tired of it and say theyre giving up they cant keep half the london police force in coldbath forever another few weeks at the most he agreed it would be easier in the end easier for whom without asking she poured him more tea and he thanked her with a nod em as uses the ouses round ere for their pleasures he answered her question but mostly for em in charge o the police he grimaced shaking his head a little would you like to be the one what goes and tells the baltimore family that mr baltimore came ere to gratify isself an maybe refused to pay what e owed an got into a fight with some pimp in a back alley somewhere but the pimp got the better ofim an killedim maybe e didnt even mean to but when it was done it were too late an so e settled some old score or other by dumpin the body at abel smiths she tightened her lips and frowned we all know its likely the truth he went on but knowin an sayin is two different things most of all aving other people know is a third different thing an all some of which is best not said it made her decision for her if the truth was what she feared it wasthat in some way baltimores death was personal incurred by his behavior either as a user of prostitutes or something to do with the railway fraud because he was the instigator of it or some other member of his family wasthen the police were not going to wish to find either of those answers you are right she agreed would you like another piece of toast and jam thats very civil of you miss he accepted leaning back in the chair i dont mind if i do hester knew she must find an excuse to call on squeaky robinson after hart had gone and margaret came in they spent some time caring for fanny and alice who were both making slow and halting recovery then as the afternoon waned and a decided chill settled in the air hester brought in more coals for the fire and considered telling margaret to go home the streets were quiet and bessie would be there all night margaret sat at the table staring disconsolately at the medicine cabinet she had recently restocked i spoke to jessop again she said her face tight contempt hardening the line of her mouth my governess used to tell me when i was a child that a good woman can see the human side in anyone and perceive some virtue in them she gave a rueful little shrug i used to believe her probably because i actually liked her most girls rebel against their teachers but she was fun and interesting she taught me all sorts of things that were certainly no practical use at all simply interesting to know i cant imagine when i shall ever need to speak german and she let me climb trees and get apples and plumsas long as i gave her some she loved plums hester had a glimpse of a young margaret her hair in pigtails her skirts tucked up shinning up the apple trees in someone elses orchard forbidden by her parents and encouraged by a young woman willing to risk her employment to please a child and give her a little illicit but largely harmless fun she found herself smiling it was another life another world from this one where children stole to survive and would not have known what a governess was few of them ever attended even a ragged school let alone had personal tuition or the luxury of abstract morality but i dont think even miss walter would have found anything to redeem mr jessop margaret finished i wish with a passion that we did not have to rent accommodation from him so do i hester agreed i keep looking for something else so we can be rid of him but i havent found anything yet margaret looked away from hester and there was a very faint pinkness in her cheeks do you think sir oliver will be able to help us with the women like alice who are in debt to the usurer she asked tentatively hester felt the odd sinking feeling of change again a very slight loneliness that rathbone no longer cared for her quite as he had their friendship was still the same and unless she behaved unworthily it always would be and she had never offered him more than that it was monk she loved if she were even remotely honest it always had been the love of friends was different calmer and immeasurably safer the heat did not burn the flesh or the heart nor did it light the fires which dispelled all darkness and that was the core of it if she cared for either rathbone or margaret and she cared for them both then she should be happy for them full of hope that they were on the edge of discovering the kind of happiness that required all the strength and commitment there was to give margaret was looking at her waiting i know he will do his best hester said aloud so if it can be done then yes he will do it she breathed in deeply but before that and apart from it i want to make some more enquiries as to where mr baltimore was killed because i believe abel smith that it was not in his house margaret looked at her quickly a different kind of anxiety in her eyes now hester please be careful shall i come with you you shouldnt go alone if anything happened to you no one would ever know you would know hester replied cutting off her argument but if you come with me then no one would except perhaps bessie i think i would rather rely on you to rescue me she smiled to rob the remark of sting but i promise i shall be careful i have an idea which even if i dont learn anything could be of benefit to us a little more in the way of funds anyhow and even a spoke in mr jessops wheel which i would dearly like so would i margaret agreed but not at the cost of danger to you theres no more danger than coming here every night hester assured her with something less than the truth but she thought the risk was worth it and it was slight all things considered she stood up tell bessie i should be back no later than midnight if im not then you can inform constable hart and send out a search party for me i shall be here myself margaret retorted tell me where you are going so i shall know where to begin looking she half smiled but her eyes were perfectly serious portpool lane hester replied i have an idea to see a mr robinson who keeps an establishment there she felt better for telling margaret that and as she put on her shawl and opened the door onto coldbath square it was with more confidence than she had felt a few moments earlier she turned in the doorway thank you she said gravely then before margaret could argue she walked quickly along the footpath in the rain and turned the corner into bath street she did not slacken her speed even when she was out of sight of the square because it was better for a woman alone to look as if she had a purpose but also she did not want to allow herself time to reconsider what she was going to do in case she lost her nerve margaret had an extraordinary admiration for her especially her courage and she was surprised now to realize how precious that was it was worth conquering the fear that fluttered in the pit of her stomach to be able to return to coldbath square and say that she had gone through with her plan whether she learned anything or not it was not entirely pride although she was forced to admit that that did enter into it it was also a gentler thing the desire to live up to what margaret believed of her and aspired to herself disillusion was a bitter thing and she might already have brought about a little of that she was aware of having been abrupt a few times of a reluctance to praise even where it was due the knowledge that monk was keeping from her something that hurt him had driven her into an unusual sense of isolation and it had touched her friendships as well she could at least live up to the mask of courage that was expected of her she too needed to believe that she was equal to anything she set herself physical courage was easy compared with the inner strength to endure the pain of the heart anyway squeaky robinson was probably a perfectly ordinary businessman who had no intention of hurting anybody unless they threatened him and she would be careful not to do that this was only an expedition to look and learn the huge mass of reids brewery towered dark into the raindrifted sky and there was a sweet rotten smell in the air she was obliged to stop where portpool lane ran close under the massive walls she could no longer see where she was going the eaves dripped steadily there were shadows in the doorways beggars settling for the night considering that she was in the immediate vicinity of exactly the kind of brothel she would have inhabited herself had she been driven to the streets the chances of her being misunderstood were very high but she had passed a constable less than a hundred yards away certainly he was out of sight but his presence was sufficient to deter the kind of customer who came here even more than most she leaned against the brewery wall keeping away from the edge of the narrow curb where the light from the street lamp shone pale on the wet cobbles with her shawl covering her head and concealing most of her face she did not look as if she were hoping to be noticed the lane was a couple of hundred yards long leading into the grays inn road a busy thoroughfare traffic running up and down it until midnight or more and the odd hansom cab even after that the town hall was just around the corner squeaky robinson was more likely to have his house in the shadows up one of the alleys at this end opposite the brewery his clients would want to be as discreet as possible did such men feel any shame at the exercise of their tastes certainly they would wish it secret from society in general but what about each other would they come if their equals with similar tastes were aware she had no idea but perhaps it would be clever of the proprietor of such a place to have more than one entrancemore than two even if so the alleys opposite would be perfect this end not the other where there was a large very respectable looking building and a hotel beyond now that she had decided as much there was no point in waiting she straightened up breathed in deeply forgetting the sweet decaying smell and she wished she had not as she coughed and gasped drawing in more of it she should never forget where she was not even for an instant cursing her inattention she crossed the road and walked smartly up the first alley right to the end where any building would lie which opened onto both lanes and onto the narrow streets at the farther side the alley was narrow but freer of rubbish than she would have expected ordinarily and there was a light on a wall bracket about halfway along showing a clear path up the uneven stones was that coincidence or was squeaky robinson taking care of the physical sensibilities of his clients by seeing they did not have to stumble over refuse on their way to their pleasures she reached the end of the alley and on the outer edge of the light from the lamp she could see steps and a doorway she already knew what she was going to say and there was nothing to hesitate for she went to the door and knocked it was opened immediately by a man in a dark suit scuffed at the edges and too large for him even though he was at least average in build from the way he stood he was ready for a fight any time one should seem necessary he looked like a ruffian aping a downatheel butler perhaps it was part of the image of the establishment he regarded her without interest yes miss she met his eyes directly she did not wish to be taken for a supplicant in distress seeking to use the brothel to rescue herself from debt good evening she replied stiffly i would like to speak with the proprietor i believe he is a mr robinson we may have business interests in common where we could be of service to one another would you be good enough to tell him that mrs monk of coldbath square is here to see him she made it an order as she would have done in her old life before her sojourn in the crimea when calling upon the daughter of a friend of her father whose servants would know her the man hesitated he was used to obeying the clienteleit was part of their purchasebut women were stockintrade and as such should do as they were told she did not lower her eyes ill see he conceded ungraciously yerd better come in he almost added something further then at the last moment thought better of it and merely led her to a very small room off the passage little more than a wide cupboard furnished with one wooden chair wait there he ordered and went out closing the door she did as he said this was not the time to take risks she would learn nothing by exploring and she had no interest in the interior of a brothel yet and hoped she never would have it was easier to deal with the injured women if she knew less rather than more about their lives she was concerned with medicine nothing else and if she was caught she would not be able to explain herself to squeaky robinson and it was important he believe her there would be enough stretching and bending of the truth as it was she had to wait for what seemed like a quarter of an hour before the door opened again and the wouldbe butler ushered her along the passage further into the warren of the building it was narrow cramped for width and height the floors were uneven under the old red carpeting but the boards did not creak as she would have expected someone had taken great care to nail them all down so not one moved to betray a footstep there was no sound in the silence except a random settling of the whole fabric of the building a sigh of ancient timber slowly consumed by rot the stairs were steep and ran both up and down within the one corridor as if two or three rambling houses had been joined to give a dozen entrances and exits finally the butler stopped and opened a door indicating that hester should go in the room was a startling surprise although only on entering it did hester realize what she had expected she had pictured dimness vulgarity and instead it was large lowceilinged and the walls were almost obscured by shelves and cupboards the floor was wood boards covered with rugs and the main piece of furniture was an enormous desk with a multitude of drawers on its cluttered surface was a brightly burning oil lamp shedding a yellow light in every direction the room was also warm from a black stove on the far wall and the whole place was untidy but apparently clean the man sitting in the leatherupholstered chair was thinfaced sharpeyed with straggling graybrown hair and very slightly hunched shoulders he regarded hester with intelligent wariness but none of the curiosity she would have expected had he no idea who she was presumably word of the coldbath house had reached him which she should have expected well mrs monk he said smoothly and what business is it that could concern both you and me his voice was light and soft a little nasal but not sufficiently so to account for his nickname she wondered what had given him that she sat down without being invited in order to let him know she did not intend to be fobbed off but would stay until the matter was settled to her satisfaction the business of keeping as many women as possible in a fit state to work mr robinson she replied he moved his head a trifle to one side i thought you were a charitable woman mrs monk wouldnt you rather see all the women back in factories or sweatshops earning a living the law and society would approve you dont earn a living at all with broken bones mr robinson she countered she tried to sound as casual as possible suppressing her emotions of anger and contempt she was there to accomplish a purpose not indulge herself and my interests are not your concern except where they meet with your own which i presume is to make as much profit as possible he nodded very slowly and as the light flickered on his face she saw the lines of tension in it the grayness of his skin in spite of being closeshaven even at this time in the early evening there was a tiny flicker of surprise in him so small she might have been mistaken and what kind of profit are you looking for he enquired he picked up a paper knife and fiddled with it his long inkstained fingers constantly moving that is my concern she said tartly sitting up very straight as if she were in a church pew he was taken aback it was clear in his face a trifle more masked was the fact that she had also woken his curiosity she smiled i have no intention of becoming your rival mr robinson she said with some amusement i assume you are aware of my house in coldbath square i am he conceded watching her closely i have treated some women who i think may have worked for you but that is only a deduction she continued they do not tell me and i do not ask i mention it only to indicate that we have interests that coincide so you said his fingers kept rolling the paper knife around and around there were papers scattered on the desk which looked like balance sheets there were lines ruled on them in both directions and what seemed more like figures than words the lack of trade must be affecting him more than most as she had already thought it added to her strength business is poor for everyone she observed i thought you did yours for nothing he replied flatly so far you are wasting my time mrs monk then ill come to the point she could not afford to have him dismiss her what i do serves your interests she made it a statement of fact and did not wait for him to agree or disagree in order to do it i have to have premises and i am at the present time having a degree of difficulty with my landlord he is obstructive and keeps threatening to increase the rent she saw his body tighten under the thin jacket a distinct alteration in his position in the big chair she wondered just how much the present situation had cost him was he short of money was he the usurer or merely the manager of this place quite a lot might depend upon the answer to that i practice business not charity mrs monk robinson said sharply his voice rising in pitch his hand clutching the paper knife even more rigidly of course she said without the slightest change in her expression i am expecting enlightened selfinterest from you not a donation tell me mr robinson have you made a profit since the unfortunate death of mr baltimore i believe his name was his eyes narrowed you knew him he said suspiciously not at all she answered i say unfortunate because it has interrupted what was a fairly satisfactory state of affairs in the area and has brought a police presence we would all prefer to be without he seemed to consider saying something and then changed his mind she saw his breathing quicken a little and again he shifted his position very slightly as if easing aching bones they apparently intend to remain until they find who killed him she went on and i do not foresee any success for them they appear to think he died in abel smiths house in leather lane she did not move her eyes from his i think that is unlikely robinson seemed scarcely to breathe do you he was weighing everything he said which made her wonder if he was frightened and if so of what or of whom there are several possibilities she kept her voice light as if they were discussing something of only moderate interest none of which anyone will assist them to find out she added he will have been killed somewhere else either intentionally or by accident and whoever was responsible very naturally did not wish to be blamed or to attract the attention of the police so equally naturally they moved the body anyone would have done as much that has nothing to do with me robinson replied but she noticed the knuckles of his hand were white except that like all of us you would like to see the police leave and allow us to get back to our normal lives she agreed hope flashed for a moment in his eyes briefly but quite unmistakably and you have some way of doing that mrs monk he asked now his fingers were motionless as if he could not divert even that much of his energy from her she wished she had any plan would be worth sharing now if this was the place where fanny and alice had worked she would give a very great deal to finish him legally so he and anyone who was his partner would spend the rest of their lives in prison preferably on the treadmill i have certain ideas she equivocated but my immediate concern is to acquire better terms for leasing premises since it will be in your interest that women who have accidents are treated quickly freely and with total discretion i thought you might be a good person to approach for advice on the matter robinson sat quite still studying her while the seconds stretched into one minute then two she tried to judge him in return she did not expect any assistance with accommodation that was only an excuse to allow her to meet him and to see something of the place was this where fanny and alice and others like them had worked if at least she could give rathbone a name and address then he would have something to pursue was this narrowfaced man with his stringy shoulders and carefully shaven face the intelligence behind the usury the profit and the vicious punishment she had seen or simply another brothel owner with a ratherbetterthanaverage establishment he was nervous about something the way his long thin fingers constantly moved the pallor of his face his rigid body all betrayed anxiety or was it simply that he was unwell or preoccupied with something quite different perhaps he never went out in daylight anyway and his pallor was part of the way of his life she had learned little if she was to accomplish anything she must take more risk you must be losing money she stated boldly something in him changed it was so subtle she could not have described it but it was as if some hidden fear had clamped a tighter hold on him her heart sank she must be in the wrong place squeaky robinson had not the nerve or the intelligence to plan something as bold or complicated as the scheme alice had described it would take planning with longterm profit in view a steady mind and a cool head to carry out such a thing squeaky robinson did not impress her as having any of those qualities the panic in him was too close beneath the surface now as they sat staring at each other but it could not be she whom he feared she had posed no threat at all open or implicit she had no power to hurt him and had not suggested that she wished to was it his partner he was afraid of the man who had set this up and relied on him to run it profitably and without attracting the law was that it perhaps you should consult your partner before you reach any decision she said aloud squeaky stiffened so violently he poked himself with the paper knife and gave a sharp yelp he started to say something then abruptly changed his mind i dont have a partner he glared at the red mark on his hand then resentfully at her as if it were her fault he had hurt himself she smiled disbelievingly you looking for other premises he said guardedly i could be she replied but i would want very good rates and no chopping and changing them when it suited youa proper business arrangement if you have no one else to consult then consider what i have said and see if you can be of assistance it is in your interest squeaky chewed his lip he was only too obviously in a quandary and the pressure of a decision was taking him ever closer to panic hester leaned forward a little it is going to get worse mr robinson the longer the police are here the more likely it is that your clients will be obliged to find other places in which to entertain themselves and then what can i do he burst out and now his voice was high and sharp enough to have given him his nickname i dont know who killed him do i i dont know she answered perhaps you do im sure a man with the skill to run a house like this must have his ear to the ground you could not succeed if you did not she stopped he looked so acutely uncomfortable she was afraid he was actually in physical pain there was a sheen of sweat over his skin and his knuckles were white if you did not have an excellent knowledge of the area and everything that goes on in it she finished there was such a tension in the man a few feet from her that suddenly she wanted to escape the emotion in his face the desperation had a physical presence almost at odds with the sly knowledge of his mind it was as if he had been robbed of a safety he had known for so long he was still only half aware of his new nakedness and had had no time to shield himself or deal with it yes he said sharply of course i have he was defensive now as if he needed to assure her ill think about it mrs monk we need to get back to business as usual if i hear from anyone what happened to this baltimore ill see if we cant arrange something he spread his hands indicating the piles of paper now ive got things to see to i cant spare any more time to to talk when theres nothing to say she rose to her feet thank you mr robinson and you will not forget to mention to your partner the matter of a property to rent very reasonably seeing as it is in all our interests he jerked up again i dont have he began then his face ironed out and he smiled it was a ghastly gesture all teeth and rigid muscles ill tell him ha ha he laughed violently see what he says she left conducted out through the corridors again by the man in the dark suit too big for him and found herself in the alley leading back to portpool lane it was now swirling with fog and she could see the solitary lamp on the wall through a shifting haze for several moments she stood still becoming accustomed to the chill air and the smell of the brewery massive against the sky shedding its denser shadow till it obliterated all other outlines just as the coldbath prison did on the house in the square then she set out walking keeping close to the walls to avoid being noticed and hoping she did not trip on anyone sleeping on the stones of the path or huddled in an unseen doorway after speaking with him and seeing his reactions she was almost certain that squeaky robinson ran the brothel where young women like fanny and alice were put to work in order to pay off their debts to the usurer but squeaky was panicking over something was it just the lack of business at the moment if he were the usurer surely he could afford to wait until the police either found out who killed baltimore or were forced to give up but what if he was not what if he was only a partner and the usurer was pressing him as well then who was the usurer and why was squeaky so frightened at the mere mention of his existence she crossed portpool lane and turned left toward coldbath square still walking briskly there were a few other people about the lights of a public house shone out across the pavement as someone opened a door there was a peddler on one corner a constable on another looking bored and cold probably because he was standing still he was getting in everyones way and he had long since given up hope of discovering anything useful was squeaky robinson so frightened because he had somehow lost his partner the intelligence and driving force behind the enterprise how to prison illnesseven death was he panicking because he was suddenly alone and he had not the skill to carry on without help she was convinced after talking to him that he was not the usurer he had not the polish the confidence to have ensnared the sort of young women he used if he were she could not have rattled him as she had what had happened to the usurer a warm rush of hope surged up inside her and she quickened her step it hardly mattered why he had gone or where if it left squeaky unable to continue his fear might be why he had turned violent and either half killed fanny and alice himself or more probably had someone like the wouldbe butler do it but his rule would be shortlived no more women would be ensnared and if the usurer was gone then he could not enforce repayment not in law surely oliver rathbone might be able to help after all she got back to coldbath square to find margaret pacing the floor waiting for her her face lit the moment hester was in through the door im so relieved to see you she said rushing forward are you all right hester smiled with a pleasure that surprised her she really did like margaret very much yes thank you only cold she answered frankly but i would love a cup of tea to get the taste of that place out of my mouth she took off her shawl and hung it up on one of the pegs as margaret went to the stove what did you learn margaret asked even while she was checking that the kettle was full and moving it onto the hob she kept glancing at hester and her face was eager her eyes wide and bright i think the woman at abel smiths told me correctly hester answered fetching two mugs from the cupboard that is the place where they cater to more individual interests she said it with heavy distaste at the euphemism and saw her own feelings reflected in margarets expression i met squeaky robinson what was he like margaret stopped even pretending to watch the kettle her voice was sharp with anticipation very nervous indeed hester replied succinctly in fact i would say positively frightened she put the mugs on the table margaret was astonished why was baltimore killed there do you suppose hester had been so occupied with the thought of squeaky robinsons partner and the possibility of his being absent permanently and therefore the usury business collapsing that she had not seriously considered the thought that squeakys fear might be primarily of the police rather than of financial ruin but the rope was an infinitely worse prospect than poverty even to the greediest man alive i suppose he could have been she said a trifle reluctantly explaining what her hope had been perhaps it was the usurer who killed him margaret suggested but there was more will than belief in her face maybe he couldnt pay and someone lost his temper it could have been as much an accident as anything after all it isnt in their interest to kill a client is it it cant be good for business it isnt as if anyone had to go there there are plenty of other places even if they would be in different parts of the city and they left the body at abel smiths just as he said hester agreed yes that sounds possible she could not keep the slight disappointment out of her voice also it might have helped monk if baltimores death had had something to do with land fraud on the railway it would have tied the present to the past and vindicated his belief that arrol dundas had been innocent except of course it would increase monks sense of guilt that he had been unable to prove it at the time should we tell constable hart margaret asked hopefully that would solve the murder and get rid of the police the kettle started to whistle behind her and get rid of the driving force behind the usury at the same time she turned to the kettle and scalded the teapot then put in the leaves then the boiling water not yet hester said cautiously i would like to know a little more about mr baltimore first wouldnt you yes but how margaret carried the teapot over to the table and set it down beside the milk and the mugs can i help i might be able to scrape an acquaintance with someone of whom i could ask questions or you could i wouldnt know what to say there was the very faintest color in her cheeks and she did not quite meet hesters eyes we might be able to take something useful to sir oliver if we could prove a connection she spoke very casually and hester smiled knowing exactly how she felt and why she was compelled to mask it even from her closest friend or perhaps especially from her that would be a good idea she agreed ill write to livia baltimore and ask if i can call upon her tomorrow evening with further information about her fathers death if i send the letter with a messenger ill have a reply long before i need to go margaret looked startled what are you going to tell her not that her father was at portpool lane surely well not the reason anyway hester smiled with a downward twist of her mouth and reached for the teapot hester sent the letter early in the morning paying a messenger to take it to the baltimore house in royal square and before lunch the answer was returned that miss baltimore would be delighted to receive her that afternoon and awaited her call with pleasure meanwhile margaret had made discreet enquiries and arranged for herself and hester to visit with her brotherinlaw who was acquainted with business matters and could tell them what was publicly known of baltimore and sons and perhaps a certain amount of that which was rather more privately believed an appointment was made for the following evening in the middle of the afternoon hester left fitzroy street wearing a pale blue skirt and jacket and a hata piece of apparel she loathedand carrying a parasol against the bright fitful sun she had been given the parasol as a gift and she had never even unrolled it nevertheless it lent an air of respectability suggesting young ladies who had time and care to consider guarding their complexions from the sun she took an omnibus from the tottenham court road and was happy to walk the last few hundred yards to the front door in royal square she was admitted immediately and conducted to a small sitting room clearly kept for the ladies of the house to receive their guests it was furnished in a very feminine manner the windows were draped with curtains in a clear soft yellow the chairs were well padded and pastelshaded cushions made them look particularly inviting there was a tapestry frame in one corner and a basket of colored silks and wools beside it the screen in front of the fireplace was painted with flowers and on the round table in the center of the room a huge china bowl of white and yellow tulips gave off a light pleasing perfume livia baltimore was waiting for her expectantly she was dressed in the obligatory black of mourning and it made her fair skin look drained of all color the moment hester was in the room livia stood up coming forward from the chair where she had been sitting her book put down with a marker to keep the place how kind of you to come mrs monk i was hoping that with all your work for the distressed you would not forget me i am sure you would like tea without waiting for an answer she nodded to the parlor maid to confirm the instructions please sit down she indicated one of the chairs as the door closed and she resumed her own seat you look very well i hope you are it would probably be polite to talk about a variety of subjects as was usually done none of them mattered it was simply a way of becoming acquainted it was not what one said but the manner in which one said it that counted but this was not a usual social friendship they would probably never see each other after this there was only one thing which brought them together and regardless of what conventions were observed it was the only thing either of them cared about yes i am hester replied relaxing into the chair of course the area is in some difficulty at the moment and some of the women are being beaten simply out of temper and frustration because there is no business she was watching livias face as she spoke she saw the young womans struggle to hide her distaste at the business in question it was something she knew very little about wellbred young ladies were barely aware of the existence of prostitution never mind the details of the lives of those involved if she had been asked before her fathers death she would have known even less but unkind tongues had made sure she was acquainted with at least the rudiments now there are police on every corner hester went on nobodys pockets have been picked in a couple of weeks but there is less and less in them that would be worth the trouble people are going elsewhere when they can which i suppose is natural i dont know why but police make even honest people nervous i dont know why they should livia responded surely innocence should fear nothing perhaps too few of us are entirely innocent hester replied but she said it gently she had no desire whatever to hurt this young woman whose life had been so abruptly invaded by tragedy and knowledge nothing had prepared her for and which in other circumstances she would never have known but i came to tell you that i have continued to listen and to enquire where i could into the death of mr baltimore livia sat motionless yes her voice was little more than a whisper she blinked ignoring the tears brimming her eyes i went to the house in leather lane where his body was found hester said gravely pretending not to notice she did not know livia well enough to intrude i spoke to the people there and they told me they had no part in what happened to him he died elsewhere and was moved in order to implicate them and i assume to remove suspicion from someone else did you believe them there was neither acceptance nor rejection in livias tone as if she was deliberately not daring to hope too much yes i did hester said unequivocally livia relaxed smiling in spite of herself hester felt a stab of guilt so sharp she questioned whether she should be there at all telling this young woman things which were true and yet so much less than the whole truth it would inevitably lead her to knowledge which would destroy forever the memories of happiness and innocence that had molded her youth then he could simply have been set upon in the street livia was saying eagerly the color returned to her cheeks whoever killed my father then used his death to try to have some kind of revenge on mr smith and of course escape blame themselves have you told the police this not yet hester said guardedly i would rather know more first so that they believe me do you know why he would be in the farringdon road area did he go there often i have no idea livia blinked away sudden tears papa went out many evenings at least two or three every week i am sure that sometimes he went to his club but usually it would be to do with business he was i mean we were she gulped as realization overwhelmed her again she forced her voice to remain almost level we are on the brink of a great success he worked so very hard it hurts us all that he will not be here to see it the new line opening in derbyshire hester asked livias eyes widened you know about that hester realized she had shown too much knowledge i must have heard someone speak of it she explained after all expansion of travel and new and better rail lines are of interest to everyone the maid returned with tea and livia thanked and dismissed her choosing to pour it herself it is very exciting she agreed passing hester her cup for a moment her face betrayed very mixed emotionsthere was exhilaration the sense of being on the verge of change that was wonderful and also a regret for the loss of the familiar hester was uncertain if it could have any bearing at all upon baltimores death or what monk needed to know but she was curious to learn more will it mean changes for you this house seems charming it would be hard to imagine anything better she picked up her cup and sipped the hot fragrant liquid livia smiled it softened her face and made her look the young slightly shy girl that she must have been only a month before i am glad you like it i have always been happy here but my brother assures me that when we move it will be even better you are to move hester said with surprise we will keep this for the london season livia explained with a slight gesture of her hand but we are to have a large estate in the country for our home the only thing that will cloud it at all is that my father will not be here he wanted to build all this for us it is so unfair that he should not be able to have the rewards of his lifes labor all the risks and the skill that went into it she picked up her tea also but did not drink he must have been a remarkable man hester prompted feeling that her hypocrisy must show in her face she despised baltimore he was livia agreed accepting the praise eagerly as if somehow her father could still be warmed by it hester wondered how well livia had known him was her change in tone due to the fact that she was not remembering him so much as saying what she wished were true he must have been very clever hester said aloud and very forceful a weak man would never have been able to command others in the manner that must be necessary in order to build a railway any sign of indecision or wavering from a principle and he would have failed one has to admire such spirit yes he was very strong livia agreed her voice tense with emotion when papa was around one always knew one would be safe he was always quite certain i suppose it is a quality men have at least the best men those who are leaders i think the leaders are the ones who do not allow us to see their uncertainties hester replied after all if someone does not feel confidence in where they are going how can they expect others willingly to follow them livia thought for a moment you are quite right she said with sudden understanding how perceptive you are yes papa was always i thinkbrave is the word i know now that there were some more difficult times when i was a child we have waited many years for this great success that is coming now a smile flickered across her face it is not just the new railway line you know it is a new invention to do with rolling stockthat means carriages and wagons and so on i apologize if i tell you what you already know not at all hester assured her i know only what anyone may read about or overhear what kind of an invention i am afraid i am not certain papa said little of it at home he and my brother jarvis did not discuss business matters at the table he always said it was not suitable to speak of in front of ladies there was a shadow of uncertainty in her eyes not quite as strong as doubt he believed family and business should be kept separate her voice dropped again it was something he cared about very much keeping the home a place of peace and graciousness where things such as money and the struggles of trade should not intrude we spoke of the values that matter beauty and intelligence the exploration of the world realms of the mind it sounds excellent hester said trying to sound as if she meant it sincerely she did not want to hurt livias feelings but she knew that the inclusion of the ugly and some attempt at the understanding of pain was necessary for the kind of truth that makes the greatest beauty possible but this was not the time or place to say so you must have been very happy she added yes livia agreed we were she hesitated sipping her tea mrs monk yes do you think it is likely that the police will ever find out who killed my father please be honest i do not want a comfortable lie because you think it would be easier for me it is possible hester said carefully i dont know about likely it may depend whether there was a personal reason or if it was simply mischance that he passed along the wrong street at the wrong moment do you know if he went intending to keep an appointment with anyone it was the question to which she most wanted an answer and yet she was aware that the solution to baltimores death might mean social ruin to his family particularly to livia who was young and as yet unmarried livia looked startled then on the brink of speech she stopped and considered setting her cup down again i dont know certainly he did not tell us but then he never discussed business with mama or me my brother might know i could ask him do you think it would make a difference it might how honest should she be her whole reason for being there was dishonest to livia she was thinking of monk and his need to know about fraud and fanny and alice and all the other young women like themin fact all the women of the whole coldbath area who were still living on the streets but were unable to earn anything because of the constant police presence she was not trying to find the murderer of nolan baltimore because it would ease the grief of his family or even in the impersonal cause of justice i know what people presume livia said quietly her cheeks very pink i simply cannot believe it is true i wont no one could easily believe it of her own father hester would not have believed it of hers it was not rational the brain said that ones father was human like any other man but all the heart and the will denied the very idea that he would lower himself to indulge carnal appetites with a woman paid from the streets it awoke something inside oneself as to the origin of ones own existence the nature of ones physical creation and something unbearable about ones mother as well it was a betrayal beyond acceptance no hester said not really as a reply simply an understanding of course not perhaps your brother may know if he intended to meet someone or if not at least what his destination might have been i have already tried livia said with both embarrassment and anger he simply told me not to worry myself that the police would find the answer and not to listen to anyone that might be good advice hester conceded at least the part about not listening to what people say there was a knock on the door and almost before livia had finished answering it opened a dark lithe man in his thirties came in hesitating when he saw hester but only momentarily he had an air of confidence about him which was arrogant even abrasive and yet had a certain attraction perhaps it was the feeling of energy in him which appealed almost like a fire at once dangerous and alive he moved with grace and he wore his clothes as if elegance were natural to him he reminded hester fleetingly of monk as he would have been in his early thirties then the impression was gone this man lacked a depth of emotion his fire was of the head not the heart livia looked over at him and her face lit instantly it was not something she did consciously but it was impossible to mistake her pleasure michael i was not expecting you she turned to hester i should like you to meet mr michael dalgarno my brothers partner michael this is mrs monk who has been kind enough to call upon me in connection with a charity in which i am interested she barely blushed at her lie she was perfectly used to the accommodation of social exchange how do you do mrs monk dalgarno bowed very slightly i am delighted to meet you and i apologize for intruding upon your tea i had not realized miss baltimore had company or i should not have been so forward he turned to look at livia and smiled it was deliberate and devastatingly charming there was a candor to it that was as intimate as a touch the color swept up livias face and neither hester nor dalgarno himself could have doubted her feelings for him he placed his hand on the back of livias chair gently as if it were her shoulder it was oddly possessive perhaps so soon after her fathers death and in such circumstances the statement of anything further would be inappropriate but the gesture was unmistakable hester had a fleeting thought that as the daughter of a wealthy man about to become vastly wealthier through the sale of the components livia baltimore was a young woman who might expect a great number of suitors many of them driven by the least noble of motives she must have known dalgarno for some time was it a genuine love begun as friendship long before the promise of wealth or was it a classic piece of opportunism by an ambitious young man she would never know nor did she need to but she hoped profoundly that it was the former now she had learned all that she was likely to she did not want to remain longer and risk saying something that would give away the lie to livias explanation for her presence the only charity with which she was connected was the house in coldbath square and she did not think that mr dalgarno would find it easy to believe that livia was interested in that she rose to her feet thank you miss baltimore she said with a smile you have been most gracious and i shall call upon you again if you wish or not trouble you further if you feel we have oh no livia interrupted hastily rising as well her black skirts rustling stiffly i should very much like us to speak again if if you would be so kind of course hester agreed thank you again for your graciousness she turned to him i am delighted to have made your acquaintance mr dalgarno he moved to open the door for her she went out and was conducted to the entrance by a footman she passed a tall fairhaired young man coming in he was remarkable for his vigor and his large ears he took no notice of her but strode toward dalgarno and started to speak before he reached him unfortunately hester was obliged to go out into the street before she could overhear anything the following evening hester and margaret kept their appointment to meet in margarets sisters home and learn what more they could about nolan baltimore accordingly hester dressed carefully in her most sober jacket and skirt the one which she would have worn were she seeking a position of nursing in a private house margaret wore a becoming gown of a dark wine shade and a highly fashionable cut they took a hansom together and arrived in weymouth street south of regents park just after six it was a very imposing house and even as they crossed the footpath and mounted the steps up to the front door hester felt a subtle change come over margaret she moved less briskly her shoulders were not quite so square and she pulled the brass knob of the bell almost tentatively the door was answered straightaway by a footman of towering height and excellent legs the qualities most admired in his calling good evening miss ballinger he said stiffly mrs courtney is expecting you and mrs monk if you would care to come this way he ushered them in and hester could not help glancing around the perfectly proportioned hallway with its blackandwhite flagged floor leading to a magnificent staircase and the walls hung with ancient armor decorated swords and flintlocks stocks inlaid with gold wire and motherofpearl the footman opened the withdrawingroom door announced them and then showed them in hester saw margaret draw in a deep breath and go forward inside the room oakfloored with paneled walls heavy plumcolored curtains framed high windows onto formal gardens beyond three people were awaiting them the woman was obviously margarets sister she was not quite as tall and judging by her skin and slightly more ample figure the elder by four or five years she was handsome in a conventional way and gave the air of being extremely satisfied with all about her she was fashionably dressed but discreetly so as if she had no need to make herself ostentatious in order to be remarked she came forward as soon as she saw margaret her face beaming with welcome either she was genuinely pleased to see her sister or she was a most accomplished actress my dear she said giving margaret a swift kiss on the cheek then stepping back to regard her with great interest how delightful of you to have come it has been far too long i swear i was quite giving up hope she turned to hester you must be mrs monk margarets new friend this welcome was not nearly so warmin fact it was merely courteous there was something guarded in her eyes hester realized immediately that marielle courtney was not at all sure that hesters influence upon her sister was a good one it might have replaced some of her own and with less desirable effects and of course she could not place hester socially which set her at a disadvantage in estimating her desirability how do you do mrs courtney hester replied with a polite smile i think so highly of margaret that to meet any member of her family is a great pleasure to me how kind of you marielle murmured turning to the man to her right and just behind her may i introduce you to my husband mr courtney how do you do mrs monk he responded dutifully he was a blandfaced man of approximately forty already a little corpulent but full of assurance and general willingness to receive his wifes family and whoever they might bring with them civilly enough the third person in the room was the one they had come to see the man who might be able to tell them more about nolan baltimore he was slender and unusual in appearance his thick hair waved back off a high brow and was touched with gray at the temples suggesting his age was more than his ease of carriage and elegance of dress portrayed his features were very aquiline his mouth full of humor marielle introduced him as mr boyd and laid rather more emphasis on margaret than hester was prepared for she saw margaret stiffen and the color rise to her cheeks although she masked her discomfort as well as possible the usual formalities of refreshment were offered and accepted marielle invited them to remain for dinner also and margaret declined without even referring to hester stating a previous engagement which did not exist it is very good of you to come in order to furnish us with assistance and information mr boyd she said a little stiffly i hope it has not spoiled your evening not at all miss ballinger he replied smiling very slightly the humor going all the way to his eyes as if he saw some joke that might be shared but not spoken of please tell me what it is you wish to know and if i can answer you then i will do so i understand the restrictions she said hastily i am sure you are aware that mr baltimore died tragically just over two weeks ago in leather lane i am if he felt any distaste he was too well schooled to show it hesters regard for him increased she glanced at marielle and saw her intense interest she was watching boyd and then margaret and then boyd again as if the outcome was of the greatest importance to her hester was filled with a fierce understanding of why margaret longed to escape from her home and the pressure to marry suitably as marielle had done and possibly whatever other sisters she had she recalled some mention of a younger one who was no doubt impatient for her turn was boyd aware of this also did he know he was being gently but very firmly engineered into the desired place he looked like a man supremely able to make his own decisions no ambitious mother or sister would maneuver him of that hester was certain but it was margarets feelings that concerned her i work in a charity in that area margaret went on with a candor that made marielle wince and her husband look startled and then unhappy really margaret he said with disapproval gaining a little money for those who are unfortunate is one thing but you should not become involved in any personal way my dear margaret ignored him keeping her attention on boyd mrs monk was a nurse in the crimea she went on relentlessly she offers medical assistance to women who cannot afford to pay a doctor i am privileged to give what additional help i can as well as to raise money for the rent of the rooms and for medicines admirable boyd said seemingly with sincerity i dont see what i can contribute beyond an offering of money which i am happy to do what has nolan baltimores business to do with this he did well but not extraordinarily so and anyway as you observed he is dead now hester searched his face but saw no personal grief in it and no trace of surprise or alarm neither did she see the outrage she had at least half expected he was murdered margaret added as you may imagine it has caused some upheaval in the area an intense police presence of course it has marielle said sharply moving forward a step as if to come between margaret and hester who represented this regrettable involvement of her sisters it is completely shocking that a respectable man should be attacked in the street and done to death by the immoral and predatory creatures who inhabit such places she turned her shoulder toward hester i dont know why you wish even to discuss such subjects margaret you never used to be so bold in your conversation she looked at boyd i am afraid margarets soft heart at times leads her into some strange not to say misguided avenues marielle courtney began i do not need you to apologize for me margaret snapped then she looked candidly at boyd before her sister could respond mr boyd mrs monk and i have reason to believe that mr baltimore may have been murdered by a business rival rather than a prostitute she ignored marielles sharp intake of breath at the word and we would both be most obliged if you could tell us more of his business interests and his character as you may have heard it is it possible he went to meet someone he was dealing with in such a place as leather lane or its environs rather than in his customary offices hester felt obliged to interject we know what his family says of his business interests and conduct i am acquainted with his daughter but their view cannot help but be biased what was his reputation in the city you speak very plainly mrs monk boyd turned his gaze to her and she knew instantly that he remarked it in respect not disapproval although the faint ghost of humor was still there in his eyes she found herself liking him had she been in margarets place and had she not already met oliver rathbone she might have been acutely uncomfortable at being so foisted upon this man rather than having him choose her for himself she believed closer acquaintance with him might prove a great pleasure i do she agreed the matter does not allow for misunderstandings i apologize if it offends you she knew it did not i am afraid nursing has blunted the edges of my good manners suddenly she smiled at him fully that is a euphemism i never had any then i shall follow your example mrs monk he replied with a very slight bending of his head almost like a bow his eyes dancing nolan baltimore was a man with great ambitions who took extraordinary chances in order to achieve them he had courage and imagination both of which were admired he was watching her as he spoke weighing what she made of his remarks and she prompted him he acknowledged her understanding and some of his risks paid fairly well others did not he managed to survive rather better than some of his friends he was not noted for his loyalty in general hester asked or in particular i had no dealings with him myself she knew his tact was for courtney not for her he expected her to understand his omissions as much as his words from choice she said quickly yes he smiled at her could any of his chances have taken him to leather lane she asked dubious finance his eyes widened it is not impossible if one needs money and the usual services are not available one goes elsewhere a shortterm loan that was to be paid off when an investment produced a high profit could be found in such a place there is plenty of money in vice of one sort or another people who come by it that way are often keen to invest it in a legitimate business really boyd courtney growled i dont think this is the sort of thing to discuss in front of ladies if mrs monk has been an army nurse and now works in the coldbath area james i doubt i can tell her anything that she does not already know better than i boyd pointed out with more humor than annoyance i was thinking of my sisterinlaw courtney said a trifle waspishly his eye flickering to marielle and back again as if in actuality responding to her rather than his own thoughts and my wife he added perhaps unaware of the implied insult to hester boyd looked at him coldly for a moment and noticed him color then he turned to margaret i apologize if i have distressed you miss ballinger he said with a slight smile but a question in his eye i shall require an apology mr boyd if you think me less able to face the truth than mrs monk margaret replied with heat you have answered us very frankly and for that i am grateful please do not spoil your respect for our sincerity by equivocating now boyd ignored both courtney and marielle as if they had not been present then i must tell you miss ballinger he replied that i think nolan baltimore was as likely to have gone to leather lane for the reasons generally supposed as for any business purpose honorable or otherwise the quality of his living the cost of his clothes his carriages his food and wine did not suggest a company with any need to seek finance he waved courtneys proposed interruption away impatiently and without taking his eyes from margarets he continued since i have seen him in the city he has never restricted himself rumor has it that his company is on the verge of a great achievement perhaps he has borrowed against his expectations or else he had a backer with very deep pockets but before you ask me who it might be i have no idea whatever not even an educated guess i am sorry an extraordinary thought occurred to hester only a flutter of darkness to begin with but less and less absurd as the seconds ticked by please dont apologize mr boyd she said with sincerity you have been most helpful she ignored margarets look of surprise and marielles clear disapproval boyd smiled at her curiosity and satisfaction in his face how fortunate marielle said coolly indicating that the subject was closed have you seen the new exhibition at the british museum yet margaret mr boyd was just telling us how fascinating it is egypt is a country i have always wished to visit the past must seem so immediate there it would give one quite a different perspective upon time dont you think unfortunately it would not give me any more of it margaret said trying to sound casual and less embarrassed than she was at such an obvious ploy she looked at boyd thank you for your candor mr boyd i hope you will excuse us leaving so abruptly but there is no one to take our places should any injured be brought into the house in coldbath square she looked at her sister thank you for being so generous marielle i am extremely grateful to you you really must stay longer next time marielle said resentfully you must come to dinner or to the theater there are many excellent plays on at the moment you are allowing your interests to become too narrow margaret it cannot be good for you margaret ignored her bade everyone goodbye and a few moments later she and hester were outside in the cool air of the street walking toward the corner where they might find a hansom easily what did he say that was helpful margaret demanded i dont see what any of it means that is really any use mr boyd hinted that baltimore had other income apart from the railway company hester said a little tentatively he went to leather lane on business margaret was uncertain does that help we have no idea what business or with whom and actually didnt you say his death wasnt in leather lane anyway yes i did i said it might very well have been in portpool lane margaret stopped walking abruptly and swung around to face hester you mean in the brothel that is run by the usurer yesi do mean that his tastes were to humiliate young women who used to be respectable disgust and anger were very clear in margarets face possibly hester agreed but what if that was his other source of income his family would not know of it nor would any gatherer of taxes or anything else it would explain very nicely why he had more funds to spend on his pleasures than baltimore and sons could supply and his death coincides just about exactly with squeaky robinsons panic maybe the question has nothing to do with railways maybe the question iswas he killed as a client who went too far or as a usurer who got too greedy margaret was tense but her eyes did not waver even though her voice did so what must we do how can we find out i dont have any plan yet hester replied but i will certainly make one she saw a hansom and stepped off the curb raising her hand in the air margaret followed after her with equal determination chapter eight monk arrived at the station in london exhausted his head ached so fiercely all he wanted to do was go home take as hot a bath as he was able to then have several cups of tea and go to bed to sleep properly lying flat and between clean sheets it would be best of all if hester were beside him understanding everything and holding no criticism or blame and that would be impossible to do that she would have to be without moral judgment and what use would she be then what real person at all or that she would be unaware of any of the fears that tangled in his mind simply there a gentle presence in the darkness except that of course she would know what he was feeling the fear of truth of finding in himself a greed and a cowardice he would despise a betrayal for which there was no excuse greater than his wrong to dundas was his wrong to himself to all that he had made and built out of his life since the accident if she did not know that then in what sense was she actually there at all none that mattered she might as well be in another place they would speak touch even make love with each other and the heart would remain utterly alone it would be a worse loneliness than to have stayed apart because it was a negation of what had been real and mattered infinitely so he would go to a public bath and simply buy a new shirt he would visit a barber to make himself look fit to go this afternoon and meet katrina harcus and tell her that there was no reason whatever to suspect michael dalgarno of anything that was not usual practice among businessmen there was no record of his having bought or sold any land in his own name or of having made any profit other than for the company for which he acted monk would also report that he had investigated the crash in which baltimore and sons had been peripherally involved sixteen years ago and the land fraud proved against one of its bankers had no connection whatever with it the cause of that tragedy was not known but the track had been repaired and was still in use it had been examined minutely and no flaws or inadequacies had been found in it he was so tired he longed for sleep even on a park bench in the bright april sun but he was afraid of what horror might return to him the moment he lost control of his thoughts he did not know how he could be guilty of anything but the guilt remained the helplessness the blood the screams the awful squeal of metal on metal and the glare and smell of fire and always the certain knowledge that he could have prevented it he drank coffee bought from a corner peddler then made his way back to the gingerbread seller to see what he had learned from his notorious acquaintances he found him dispersing slices of hot spiced loaf to a group of children and waited a few yards off until he had finished well he asked there was no need to question if the man remembered him his crooked face was alive with anticipation e went out all right he said triumphantly bout midnight face like thunder come back alf an hour later no more half an hour not time enough to get to leather lane find nolan baltimore kill him and return monk was overswept with relief so sharp it was physical he could tell katrina that dalgarno was innocent and he didnt go out again not less it were close on daylight the gingerbread seller said firmly crows as got eyes like awks dont miss nothin cant afford to he was right the lookout men for burglars survived on their ability to see remember and report thank you monk said sincerely he was so relieved he gave the man a sovereign and added another half crown on top then bought a piece of gingerbread at two oclock he was tired and his feet were sore but his step was light as he went in through the gate of the royal botanic gardens noticing briefly the blaze of color of the spring flowers he had only five minutes to wait she came to the entrance and stopped still searching for him several other people turned to look at her he was not surprised she was most striking with her dramatic face and proud bearing head high she wore white muslin sprigged with dark blue and the lines of the bodice echoed the same vivid color accentuating the femininity of it her hat had roses on the brim and her parasol was trimmed with blue ribbons several gentlemen stared at her smiling for longer than was really polite but their admiration robbed it of offense she saw monk and her face lit with pleasure almost relief he knew she must have been here many days each time hoping to see him he felt a welling up of satisfaction because at last he could tell her that as far as any investigation could show dalgarno was innocent of fraud and even if there was land fraud by anyone else it could have no connection with any crash her fears were honorable but needless she came toward him swiftly stopping so close to him he could smell the perfume she wore warm and musky quite different from the sweet fresh smell of the flowers around them you have news she said with a gasp i can see it in your face yes he smiled back at her there was a wildness in her eyes and he saw her bosom rise and fall in the effort to control her breathing he put his hand up as if to touch her arm to reassure her then realized how little he really knew her the understanding of her fears the feeling of identity with her was on his side only she would regard his touch as intrusive which it would be he let his hand fall again most importantly i have been able to ascertain that mr dalgarno did not leave his house at a time or for a duration where he could possibly be involved in nolan baltimores death she was startled how she said incredulously how could anyone know that burglars leave men on watch he explained dryly they call them crows there was at least one on that street between midnight and dawn she breathed out very slowly her face very pale thank you thank you very much but but what about i have searched exhaustively in london and in liverpool where the company was based earlier miss harcus he said and i can find no evidence of fraud at all none she started her voice high her head moving very slowly in a gesture of denial disbelief a little oversharp profit on certain deals he conceded but that is common he stated it with authority realizing only afterwards that he was speaking from memory he was not guessing he knew and everything was in the company name not that of mr dalgarno he is a successful businessman and as honest as most are you certain she pleaded her face flooded with amazement and dawning joy absolutely certain mr monk i am sure there is nothing whatever to raise doubt as to his honor he repeated you may rest in confidence that his reputation is in no peril she jerked back her eyes wide an onlooker might have thought he had insulted her from the disbelief in her face which seemed almost like anger rest she said fiercely but the crash what about the danger of another the liverpool crash had nothing to do with the track he said patiently it was driver error with a possibility that the brakemen also were now she was angry flinging her hand back almost as if to strike the person behind her whatall of them she challenged they all chose the same moment to make a mistake he caught her wrist no they dont mean that they mean it was one of them and possibly the others panicked and didnt know how to right it are you saying that baltimore and sons was innocent she demanded always then and now innocent of the crash yes he heard his own voice and he sounded uncertain why there was nothing to implicate nolan baltimore in the liverpool crash or in the fraud that had ruined arrol dundas it was his own emotions his own shadow of guilt trying to place the blame on someone he did not care about she took a step towards him now she seemed almost excited her eyes were bright her body tense her cheeks flushed with pink she put her hands on the front of his chest closing her fingers tightly over the edges of his jacket is there proof of their innocence she said hoarsely real proof something that would stand in a court i have to be sure an innocent man was convicted once before he felt his own body tighten and the blood pound in his veins he clasped her wrists how do you know that he said between his teeth he was startled to find that he was shaking she pulled away from him violently he felt the button in her hand rip off his coat but it hardly mattered her face was filled with emotion so intense her eyes blazed and her color was hectic she stared at him for a long desperate moment then spun on her heel and all but ran back toward the gate monk was aware that several people were staring at them but he did not care what did she know about arrol dundas that question filled his mind to the exclusion of everything else he strode after her almost catching up with her at the gate out onto inner circle pathway but she was moving rapidly she crossed the path and followed it through the grass and trees past the toxophilite society grounds on the left toward the bridge over an arm of the lake he managed to stop her on the far side again to the alarm and curiosity of passersby how do you know that he repeated the demand what have you heard from whomdalgarno dalgarno she said incredulously then she started to laugh a wild sound close to hysteria but she did not answer instead she turned away from him again and half ran along york gate towards the marylebone road and the general traffic with carriages and hansoms going in both directions im going home she called at him over her shoulder he ran after her catching up again and walking beside her as she reached the road and raised her parasol to hail a cab one pulled up almost immediately and monk helped her in climbing in after her she made no protest almost as if she had expected him to if it was not dalgarno then from whom he insisted after she had given the driver instructions to take her to cuthbert street in paddington she turned to face him you mean the fraud case all those years ago yes of course i do he kept his temper only with the greatest difficulty it mattered intensely what did she know how could she know anything except from baltimores records or something she had overheard him say she stared straight ahead smiling but there was a hollowness in her eyes did you imagine i made no enquiries myself mr monk her voice was hardedged grating did you think i learned nothing about the past history of baltimore and sons when i knew how deeply michael was involved in it and expected to make his fortune through it you said that you knew an innocent man was convicted of fraud in that case he said grimly horrified at how his own voice betrayed the emotion choking him how do you know that no one knew it then didnt they she asked staring ahead of her of course they didnt or he wouldnt have died in jail he grasped her arm how do you know what happened she turned in the seat to stare at him her face twisted with a fury so intense he drew back from it loosening his hold on her a great wrong mr monk she said softly her voice trembling her words almost a hiss people were wronged then and are wronged now but revenge will comethat i promise you it will come on my mothers grave on mine if need be miss harcus please get out her face was ashen now i need to think and i must do it alone she snatched her hand from him and picking up the parasol banged on the front of the hansom to draw the drivers attention i will tell you this evening she banged on the front again more fiercely yes miss the driver answered mr monk is alighting would you be so good as to stop she ordered yes miss he said obediently and pulled in to the curb they were at the corner of marylebone street and the edgware road traffic streaming around them in both directions monk was touched by a deep concern for her she looked so torn by conflicting passions it was almost as if she had a fever he wanted desperately to know what she meant by stating so vehemently that dundas was innocent and that revenge would come or what the present wrong was that he could not see but now that he knew where she lived at least he could find her again when she was calmer perhaps he could even be of some help to her now she needed to rest and compose herself ill call upon you miss harcus he said far more gently of course you need time to consider she made an intense effort at selfcontrol breathing in very deeply and letting it out in a sigh thank you mr monk that would be very good of you you are most patient if you would call upon me this eveningafter eight if you would be so goodthen i shall tell you what you wish i shall speak to michael dalgarno again and that will be the end of it i promise you have played your part perfectly mr monk i could not have wished better you will see me after eight do you give me your wordabsolutely i do he swore good the faintest ghost of a smile touched her face at twentythree cuthbert street you have given me your word yes i will be there he alighted and stood on the pavement as the hansom pulled away from the curb immediately and was lost in the traffic monk went home to fitzroy street and an empty house he washed and slept at last at ten past eight as the light was fading he took a hansom to twentythree cuthbert street he was startled back to attention from his thoughts when they stopped abruptly and the cabbie looked in and told him that he could not go any further sorry sir he said apologetically plice blockin the road dunno wots appened but theres a big ruckus up front cant go no further yerll ave ter walk if theyll let yer thank you monk scrambled out paid him leaving the change of eight pence and started to walk toward figures he could see standing under the street lamps there were three men two arguing with each other the third familiar in its tall stiff outline looking down at something like a bundle of clothes that lay at his feet it was runcorn who had been monks rival in the old days then his superior who had always hated and feared him until the quarrel when he had dismissed monk at the same moment monk had resigned in fury then the case of the artists model just months before had drawn them together again and in shared emotions painful and unexpected pity they had formed an uneasy alliance but what was runcorn doing here monk lengthened his stride only just restraining himself from running the last few yards what is it he demanded although as runcorn swung around to face him he could already see the figure of a woman was sprawled on the ground her white muslin dress trimmed in blue was crumpled and dirty and deeply stained with blood she lay half on her front half sideways as if she were broken her neck was at an awkward angle one arm doubled under her her legs crooked instinctively he looked upward and saw the flat roof of the buildings third floor and then the rest of it going up another story beyond that there was a railing as if it were an extended balcony from the upstairs room he could not see the door it was hidden by the wall above them a wave of nausea overtook him and then overwhelming consuming pity he stared at runcorn his mouth too dry to speak looks like she fell off runcorn replied to monks original question except shes a bit far out as the eye sees it and people usually fall backward might have twisted in the air he squinted upward its a fair distance get a better idea from up there couldve jumped i suppose monk started to speak then stopped what is it runcorn asked sharply nothing monk said hastily he should say nothing not yet his mind raced what on earth could have happened she would never ever have jumped not katrina harcus she was on the edge of exposing an ancient wrong she wanted revenge and she had had it almost within her grasp and dalgarno was innocent which was what she had wanted above all from the beginning a uniformed constable came across the pavement pushing his way past the bystanders who had begun to gather got a witness sir he said to runcorn his face was pinched and unhappy expression exaggerated in the shadows cast by the street lamp says there were two people up there quite definite e saw them strugglin back and forward eard er scream out summink and then she staggers back an e comes after er an next thin e turns an shes gorn over the edge he looked down at the figure on the ground poor creature looks like she were youn an right andsome too its a cryin shame what happened to the man runcorn asked glancing at monk then back to the constable the constable straightened up dunno sir i asked the witness but e didnt see light was very fitful like e saw er particlar because of er wearin white an all man were in summink very dark an ead a cloak on sort o he shrugged well a cloak witness says e saw it billowin out when they was fightin just before she went over monk felt sick imagining it katrina struggling with someone crying out for help and no one did more than watch they did not even know who had been there on the roof fighting with her killing her dalgarno it must have been he was the only person involved he must have come here when she had contacted him as she had told monk she would something she had said some evidence she had found and he had missed for all his meticulous searching had driven dalgarno to defend himself this murderous way but what how had he committed the fraud why had monk not been able to find it why was he so stupid so blind all over again and now someone else was dead another he had been doing everything he could to help he had promised her and failed runcorn was still talking to the constable monk bent onto his knees beside the body her eyes were wide open this side of her face was barely damaged at all there was just a trickle of blood he knew better than to touch her but he wanted to brush back the hair from her cheek as if she could feel it across her skin one hand was under her the other outstretched and as he looked more closely he could see there was something held inside it something very small had she clutched at her murderer the last moment before he pushed her over and torn something from him runcorn and the constable were still absorbed in conversation facing each other monk put out one finger and moved katrinas hand very slightly just enough for the object to slip out of the slack grasp and fall onto the stones it was a button a mans coat button he drew in his breath to tell runcorn then a wave of heat engulfed him bringing the sweat out on his skin and the instant after he was cold it was his own button the one she had torn off in a heated moment in the botanic gardens but that had been hours ago what have you got runcorns voice broke into his daze of horror shattering his indecision he could do nothing now certainly not hide it with clumsy fingers he fastened the lower buttons on his jacket so the top would be closed as well hiding the fact that a button was gone seeming as if it were simply not done up he rose to his feet his legs trembling a button he said huskily he cleared his throat there was a button in her hand runcorn bent down and lifted it from the pavement turning it over and over curiously monk held his breath please god runcorn would not notice that it was exactly like the ones on monks coat it was dark he was half turned from the street lamp he would leave as soon as he could mans coat button by the look of it runcorn observed must have pulled it off as she struggled with him he put it in his own breast pocket good piece of evidence he gave his attention to the constable again you talk to the people around here see what you can find do we know who she was yet no sir the constable answered they seen er comin an goin but not to speak to like seemed very respectable a miss barker or marcus or summink like that but not sure to evade it was a pointless lie and he would be caught in it sooner or later harcus monk said quietly katrina harcus runcorn stared at him you know her yes i was working on an investigation for her now the die was cast but he could not have hidden it and neither should he want to it was one coat button easily enough explained there might even be people in the gardens who had seen them and would recall the gesture in which she had accidentally ripped it off i can help he went on now that fierce anger overtook the initial shock he wanted to he wanted to be revenged for her to find who had done this and see him punished it was all he could do for her now he had failed in everything else but she had wanted revenge he remembered very clearly the fury in her face he could get at least that for her runcorns eyes were wide he let out his breath slowly so you werent here by accident i should have known what would you be doing in cuthbert street at this hour of the evening it was a rhetorical question to which he expected no answer what was it this case you were working on he asked do you know who did this to her no i dont know monk replied but ive an idea and ill damn well find out and prove it she was betrothed to a michael dalgarno a senior employee of baltimore and sons a railway company just a minute runcorn interrupted him wasnt there a nolan baltimore murdered in leather lane just a few weeks ago is that some connection with this none that ive been able to find monk admitted looks like baltimore simply went to enjoy his pleasures and got involved in a fight that ended badly perhaps he didnt pay enough or more likely he was drunk and picked a quarrel so what were you doing here runcorn pressed nothing to do with that monk replied theres no need to be secretive now monk shes dead poor creature he glanced down at her the only help you can give her is to find out who killed her i know that monk retorted sharply he steadied himself with an effort as i said she was betrothed to michael dalgarno she was concerned that there might be some fraud to do with the new line they are building between london and derby he saw runcorns start of interest specifically to do with the purchase of land and was there runcorn cut across him eagerly none that i could find and i looked very carefully monk knew he sounded defensive he felt it if he had found the proof katrina might still be alive runcorn looked dubious if it were plain to see others would have found it too i know more about railways than most people monk responded then instantly felt vulnerable he had told too much about himself opened up areas where he was guessing piecing bits together one at a timeand to runcorn of all people theirs was an uneasy truce the old resentments were covered over not gone do you runcorn said with surprise hows that then thought you were in finance before you joined up with us ordinary police his words were civil enough even his tone but monk knew the envy of money of selfassurance of a life runcorn had never had with its social ease and elegance because railways have to be financed he replied the last thing i did before leaving banking was a new railway line near liverpool runcorn was silent for a moment perhaps he heard the strain in monks voice or caught something of his grief and his anger so you found no fraud he said at last does that mean for sure that there wasnt any no monk admitted it means that if it was there then it was very well hidden indeed but she was convinced it was even more so the last time i met her than in the beginning so shed found something even if you hadnt runcorn eyed him sideways did she give you any idea what it was no but her whole conviction that there was something wrong arose from things she overheard in the baltimore offices or house being betrothed to dalgarno gave her access to conversations i had not runcorn grunted then wed better go in and find out what there isexcept i daresay he took it with him probably why he killed her he started forward toward the house monk changed his mind about leaving and decided to accept it as an invitation to accompany runcorn he could not afford to refuse he moved with alacrity to follow catching up with him at the entrance and going in a step behind him it was still early in the evening but by now word had spread that a woman had fallen or been thrown off the roof and was lying dead in the street neighbors waited in shocked silence or hasty whispered conversations with each other the uniformed constables were questioning them all one by one for anything they might have noticed either tonight or earlier runcorn was shown up the stairs to katrinas apartments monk was close on his heels as if he belonged and no one challenged him right runcorn said as soon as they were inside and the door closed the gas was burning as she must have left it but the corners were still full of shadows monk was grateful for it conscious of the missing button as if it had been a bloodstain whered she keep her papers anything that would be likely to tell us about this railway runcorn asked looking about him i dont know ive never been here before monk replied turning away from the light i thought you said she employed you and you were on your way here tonight you told me there was challenge in runcorns voice it was the first time id come here monk explained she came to my office or we met in the royal botanic gardens it sounded odd even as he said it whys that runcorn said curiously skepticism in his eyes she was very careful of her reputation monk answered she was betrothed to an ambitious man she wanted to be entirely discreet about having hired me i imagine she intended it to appear that we were social acquaintances he went to put his hands in his pockets then realized it would alter the sit of his coat perhaps showing the missing button and changed his mind after the first time we always met in public and by chance she walked in the gardens every day at the same time and if i had anything to report i knew where to find her extremely careful runcorn agreed poor creature he added softly maybe she knew then that this dalgarno was dangerous he shook his head funny what attracts some women to a man ill never understand that well wed better get on with it well just have to search monk stared around at the room it was simply furnished but the taste was excellent and the few pieces were of good quality giving it an air of spaciousness that was unusual he was not surprised katrina herself had been a woman of character and strength highly individual again his anger against dalgarno boiled over and he went across to the desk and opened it he kept his back to runcorn who was still staring around gaining an impression of the style of the room and going instinctively to the glass doors which opened onto the balcony from which she must have fallen the desk contained quite a few business papers and monk began leafing through them only glancing at the subject he did not know what he was looking for and if dalgarno had killed her because she had found proof of his fraud then most certainly she would have shown it to him and he would have taken it to destroy nevertheless there might be more than one paper of interest and he had to look he found something surprisingly quickly but it was not what he expected it was a letter written but obviously never sent addressed to someone named emma dear emma i promised to tell you all i learned so i must keep my word even though it is extremely painful for me to acknowledge such a mistake i have discovered papers to do with the original fraud in liverpool and it now seems incontrovertible that mr monk whom i had trusted profoundly was actually involved in that terrible affair himself i found an old receipt among the baltimore papers and it was signed by him upon further investigation i learned that he once worked in merchant banking and was connected with the loan for the railway baltimore and sons were building he had kept it concealed from me and no wonderthe fraud was profound and farreaching one man died for it and a great deal of money is still unaccounted for even to this day and of course there was the crash mr monk is deeply implicated you can only imagine how it grieves me i have not confronted him yet but i believe i must how else can i behave honorably dear emma i wish you were here so i could counsel with you what to do i am suddenly deeply afraid there was no more written monk stared at it who was emma where did she live there was no address what else might katrina have written to her he flicked very carefully through the other papers in the first drawer and found bills an old invitation and another letter written in a cramped sloping backhand my dearest katrina it is so good to hear from you as always but i confess i do not care for the sound of this man monk whom you have employed and all you have told me only adds to my foreboding please my dear be very careful do not trust him he scanned the rest but it was merely pleasant gossip about mutual acquaintances mentioned only by christian name if runcorn found these he would think monk himself could have killed her fingers fumbling moving slowly so as to not rattle the paper he slid both of them off the pile and heard them rustle runcorn had come in from the balcony he was holding up a large slightly crumpled mans cloak in the gaslight it appeared to be black whats that monk asked moving to shield the papers from runcorns view and put out his other hand to leaf the pages and mask the sound of the two he was taking out he folded them quickly and slid them inside his shirt around the side of his body where movement would not make them crackle it was out there runcorn said with a frown lying on the ground near the edge where she must have gone over he looked at it its too long for her and anyway its not a womans monk was surprised thats a careless thing to doleave it behind must have come off when he struggled with her runcorn wrapped it over lining to the outside doesnt have a tailors name but well find out where it comes from and whose it is did you find anything nothing significant yet monk replied keeping his voice perfectly level unnaturally so he leafed through another few sheets and saw a scribbled note the sweat stood out on his skin as he read it tell monk of conversation i overheard which makes me certain that there is a fraud currently at baltimore and sons and that i am deeply afraid that michael dalgarno is involved a very great deal of money is to be made shortly but the matter must be kept completely secret the land fraud is basically the same as beforehe will see that when he looks carefully enough questions to raiseis it cheaper and therefore illegal profit to be made by diverting the line and somehow stealing the difference from investors or is there bribery either by someone to use their landor not to use it there are several possibilities again michael has to know of it his signature is on the wages receipts and on the land purchase orders there was nothing more as if it were written as an aid to her own memory runcorn looked at monk well he demanded are those the papers you looked into yes and yet you found nothing to incriminate this dalgarno runcorn was skeptical not like you to miss somethingspecially if you know all about railways youre slipping arent you there was only the very faintest trace of the old animosity in his voice but monk heard it he was too sensitive to years of enmity not to know every shade and nuance of a jibe when it was there he had made enough of his own more often than not runcorn had been the victim there wasnt any land fraud like the first he said defensively runcorns eyes widened ohyou found the first then yes of course i did monk desperately did not want to tell runcorn about arrol dundas or anything to do with his own past with all its secrets and its wounds that was land fraud and this time it looked to be the same but dalgarno didnt buy the land himself so there was no profit for him when it was sold runcorn looked at him pensively and what was the fraud the first time exactly a man bought poor land at a cheap price then had the railway line diverted to it when it didnt have to be and sold the land to the railway company at a much higher price monk replied hating putting it into words and she thought this was the same but it wasnt runcorn concluded that seems so then why did this dalgarno kill her i dont know it did not occur to monk that it might not be dalgarno she had spoken of him with such a consuming hunger for revenge only someone she had once loved could have aroused such a fury in her strangers could never waken passion so deep well i intend to find out runcorn said with scalding heat ill hunt him down and ill drag him all the way to the gallows i promise you that monk good ill help youif i can help me look at the rest of this in case you can explain any of itto do with railways and so on runcorn said then you can go home and ill go and find mr dalgarno and see what he has to say for himself by quarter past ten monk was at home in fitzroy street again hester was sitting by a low fire but she started up as soon as she heard him at the door she looked tired and a little pale her hair was pinned rather lopsidedly as if she had done it without a looking glass she stared at him the question in her eyes if she had intended to speak the look in his face must have been sufficient to silence her the misery of his own failure was like a gray fog around him he longed to be able to tell her all of it and allow her to comfort him to say over and over that it did not matter that it was not true of him but only a collision of circumstances but even if she said all that he would not believe her he was afraid that it was true and he was even more afraid that she would be denying it out of pity and loyalty not because in her heart she could believe it she would be disappointed let down it was not her standard of integrity ever to have done such a thing or been so dishonest at the core it was the past reaching out like a dark hand to pull him back from all he had built staining the present stopping him from being the man he tried to be but he had to tell her something and it must be true if not all the truth i went to see miss harcus he said taking off his coat with its torn button he would have to replace it if he could or get rid of the coat to tell her that i can find no proof that dalgarno is guilty of anything in fact there doesnt seem to be anything to be guilty of she waited her face pale eyes wide she was dead he told her someone threw her off the balcony of her apartment runcorn was there william im so sorry she meant it the pity was there in her facefor him but far more for the woman she had never met do you have any idea who dalgarno he said before she had finished he suddenly realized how cold he was and walked over to the fire michael dalgarno she said slowly turning so she was still facing him yes why he studied her face the profound unhappiness in it more intense than even a moment before hester what relationship does she have to dalgarno she asked her eyes not leaving his why did she think he was guilty of something and why do you think he killed her william she was betrothed to him did i not tell you that no not by name why do you ask tell me she looked down then up at him quickly her face full of pain i went to see livia baltimore to tell her a little about what i have discovered regarding her fathers death it isnt much she must have seen his impatience i met michael dalgarno he was there he works for baltimore and sons its not surprising he knew as he said it that she had not told him all that mattered he was paying court to livia she answered and from the way she received him she was expecting it so he has been doing so for some time if he was betrothed to miss harcus then he was behaving disgracefully he knew she would not be mistaken in such a thing she understood the nuances of courtship even if she had never flirted in her life she also knew the correct way for a young woman to behave and what was acceptable for a man to do and what was not so dalgarno had betrayed katrina in love as well as in financial honesty had she known that had she found out that very night when she had challenged him over the land fraud had he shown himself the ultimate opportunist and knowing that he had no intention of marrying her now that baltimores daughter would accept him had she threatened to expose the fraud and so had he killed her monk bent to poke the fire glad of the flames as it burned up and of the excuse to look away from hester poor katrina he said aloud he betrayed her in every way first he was a thief then he jilted her for another woman and when she faced him with ithe murdered her he found it difficult even to say the words but youll prove it wont you hester said quietly you wont let it go no i wont he promised standing up again i couldnt save her but by god ill have justice for her i wish that were more comfort hester replied she stepped toward him almost tentatively then very gently put her head on his shoulder and slid her arms around him holding him softly as if he were so physically hurt that she might cause him pain it did comfort him but the pain was too deep inside to be touched that she should love him was so infinitely precious that he would give anything he owned not to lose it but there was nothing to give it to no bargain to make he lifted his hands and stroked her hair her neck and held her monk slept late it was a long time since he had lain in his own bed with hester beside him and any kind of peace in his mind even if it were only the peace of exhaustion and the knowledge that he could do nothing more to help katrina harcus avenging her was a different matter it was important but he was not alone in it runcorn would not let go monk could and would help him as the occasion arose when he got up in the morning he offered to riddle the kitchen stove and get it going well enough for breakfast hester accepted with slight surprise monk carried heavy things willingly enough for her but he was not naturally domestic he was used to being cared for and accepted it without question barely noticing the detail when he was alone in the kitchen he worked hard at shaking loose the old ash then took it out on the shovel and put it in the ash can he brought in a little kindling to get the flames going quickly then light coal and as soon as he had the fire burning well enough he pulled the papers out of his shirtfront where he had concealed them when dressing and poked them into the fire within moments they were consumed but they were only two letters and obviously there had been others who was emma how could he find her where could he even begin to look he closed the stove door and stood up just as hester came back from the dining room its going well he said with a smile that was quick she regarded him with surprise if you are so good at it perhaps i should have you do it every day it was meant as teasing and he relaxed at the ease of it the old banter returned chance he said airily just good luck might never happen again dont be so modest she retorted with a sideways look at him the papers were burnt he felt guilty about it they were evidence but he also felt a wave of relief at least for the moment it gave him time he did not yet know what he would do about the jacket and its missing button i thought you admired modesty he said raising his eyebrows she rolled her eyes but she was smiling they had only just finished breakfast when runcorn arrived he looked tense and angry at first he refused hesters offer of tea then almost straightaway changed his mind and sat down heavily at the table while she went to brew a fresh pot the mans a swine he said savagely he had not even removed his coat as if he were too knotted up to relax sufficiently ill see him hang for this if its the last thing i do he glared at monk hes a liar of the worst sort he says he never had any intention of marrying katrina harcus can you believe that no monk said coldly but i can believe that when he found he had a chance to marry baltimores only daughter he seized it with both hands and suddenly found katrina something of an embarrassment runcorn stiffened you knew he accused him you lied for gods sake monk what were you thinking of trying to protect her feelings or her dignity shes dead and a pound to a penny dalgarno killed her it i only found out last night after i got home monk cut across him his voice sharp with anger at runcorn for prejudging him at dalgarno for being greedy dishonest and cruel and at katrina for loving so passionately a man unworthy of her or of anyone runcorn was regarding him with disbelief hester told me monk snapped at him then seeing runcorns continued doubt he went on she knew something was wrong i told her katrina harcus was dead and that it looked as if dalgarno had killed her when she heard his name she said that she had been to see livia baltimore why runcorn interrupted because livia baltimores father was murdered in leather lane everyone assumes by a prostitute monk replied curtly you knew that hester has set up a house in coldbath square where injured women can get some medical help he felt a certain satisfaction at seeing the amazement and then the admiration in runcorns face he remembered the deep and powerful change of heart he had seen in him over the women driven to prostitution when they had investigated the death of the artists model together it was the moment when monk had been obliged intensely against his will to see a goodness in runcorn that he could not ignore or disdain he had liked him for it genuinely so she went to see miss baltimore runcorn prompted hester came back with a fresh pot of tea and without speaking poured for runcorn and passed the cup to him he nodded his appreciation but his eyes were on monk yes monk answered the question dalgarno was there and their feelings for each other were quite open they both glanced at hester and she nodded runcorn made a noise of disgust in the back of his throat wordless and eloquent of his fury and contempt where was he last night monk asked knowing runcorn would have found out runcorns face split into a sudden smile alone in his rooms he said with profound satisfaction or so he claims but he cant prove it manservant out no porter no callers so he could have been in cuthbert street monk was surprised at the mixture of emotions that awoke in him had dalgarno been able to account for his time it would mean he could not be guilty at least not in person and that would have thrown the whole question wide open monk knew of no one else with any reason to harm katrina but it also caused him more distress than he would have imagined because he thought of her facing the man she had loved so deeply and seeing in his eyes that he meant to kill her had she known it immediately or had she waited standing in the room or out on the balcony even until the last moment unable to believe he would and then she had felt his hands on her and his strength and knew she was pitching backward falling monk runcorns voice broke into his thoughts yes he said sharply what else did he say how did he react to her death runcorns loathing was quite open with affected surpriseand indifference hes the coldest swine ive ever dealt with one would have judged from his manner that the whole thing was a tragedy that barely touched on his life a matter of regret for decencys sake but in reality of complete indifference hes got his eye on being part of the baltimore company and thats all he cares about ill get him monk i swear it weve got to prove his motive monk said concentrating his mind on the issue fury outrage and pity were all understandable emotions but they accomplished nothing now greed runcorn said simply as if the one word were damnation in itself he picked up his tea and sipped it gingerly afraid of burning himself that doesnt prove he killed her monk pointed out with controlled patience lots of people are greedy he wouldnt be the first man to have broken his promise to a woman of little means in favor of an heiress once he realized he had the chance its despicable but its not a crime he has no proof where he was runcorn put down his cup and touched the points off on his fingers he had the opportunity to have been in cuthbert street he resembles the figure seen on the roof by the witnesses only an impression but elegant dark taller than she was but not by a great deal but she was quite a tall woman runcorn held up his second finger he needed nothing to kill her with except his own weight and strength and of course there was the mans coat button we found in her hand well look at all his clothes monk felt the chill run through him and then the sweat break out on his body he prayed runcorn did not notice it the jacket with the missing button was in his wardrobe in the bedroom thank god he had not stuffed it into the stove with the paper he had thought about it hope he hasnt destroyed it runcorn went on but even if he has people will know he had another coat and how will he explain its disappearance monk said nothing his mouth was dry where could he find another button and replace it if he went to a tailor runcorn might find out runcorn held up a third finger and she had accused him of being involved in fraud we know that she hired you to prove it monk licked his lips disprove it actually he countered and he wanted to cast her aside and marry the baltimore heiress runcorn went on relentlessly thats more than motive enough hester was looking silently from one to the other of them only if we prove the land fraud monk argued and livia baltimore is probably quite comfortably off but shes not an heiress she will be when baltimore and sons sells its railway components to india runcorn answered vehemently it will make them all rich and it will only be the beginning the money will go on and on something flickered in monks brain then vanished what is it runcorn demanded looking at him more closely monk sat motionless trying to bring it back to catch something of it from the edge of his mind but it was gone i dont know he admitted anger flared for an instant in runcorns eyes then was replaced by understanding well if you remember tell me in the meantime ive got to tie dalgarno into the fraud better his tone of voice had a lift at the end as if waiting for monk to complete the thought for him ill help monk said immediately it was a statement he intended to whether runcorn agreed or not it would simply be easier if he did runcorn must have searched the rest of katrinas house had he found any letters from emma there would be a return address on them dare he ask what excuse could he give the moment slipped away runcorn gave a wry smile thought you would he pulled a sheaf of papers out of his pocket maybe half a dozen or so and for an instant monk felt as if he must have spoken aloud got these from miss harcuss rooms runcorn looked at him all shadow of even the most bitter humor gone from his eyes theyre order forms and receipts from baltimore and sons she really suspected him she must have gone to a lot of trouble and risk to take these she was a brave woman with a passionate love of honesty he held the papers high in his hand no matter how much she loved him she wasnt going to protect him from fraud even though when she started out suspecting she was still betrothed to him so in time she would have shared with him whatever he got out of it he shook his head very slowly why are people such fools monk why did he want dishonest money more than a really fine woman not as if she wasnt handsome as well and young precisely because she was honest i expect hester replied for him she loved him in spite of what he was not because of it maybe his pride couldnt live with that he wants admiration then hed have to have been a saint runcorn said in disgust as it is hell swing for her sorry mrs monk but he will he held the papers out to monk here take these and see if you can find anything im going to follow the baltimore money and see just how much of it ends up with dalgarno either now or if he marries miss baltimore he turned to hester thank you for the tea i apologize for disturbing you she smiled and rose to see him to the door monk stood in the center of the room with his hands clenched and shaking the papers crumpled by the power of his grip monk read very carefully through everything runcorn had left with him there were no letters to implicate dalgarno in anything but the desire to make as large a profit as possible and that was common to all businessmen there was nothing illegal nothing even underhanded all they showed was that dalgarno was involved in every aspect of the survey bargaining for and purchasing the land but that was part of his duty jarvis baltimore had apparently dealt with the purchase of timber steel and other necessary materials for the track itself and nolan baltimore had overseen the whole enterprise and concerned himself with the government and the competition the fiercest rivalry between railway companies lay in the great days of expansion a generation or so before but it still required knowledge now ability and the right connections to achieve any success the one thing that impressed itself upon monk as he looked over the papers a third time reading the principal pieces aloud to hester was that the amounts of profit were not undue the baltimores must be comfortably off she observed but it is not really a fortune no he agreed wryly not by railway standards i suppose memory teased him that dundas had been accused of defrauding for much larger profits than anything written here it was only glimpses so brief they were gone again before he could understand them they might have no connection with the present issue but something in them could be the key the one element still missing and there was something that would tie them all together and make sense of them but it floated always just beyond his reach melting into shapelessness one moment on the verge of identity the next he grasped for it and it melted into fear without meaning but there was another fear with very precise shapeemma to whom katrina had written so frankly and in whom she had confided that she did not trust monk who was she and why had she not come forward someone would tell her katrina had been murdered friends gossips even possibly some lawyer with whom katrina had entrusted her affairs from his brief sight of her rooms and the clothes she had worn to meet him she was not without means if they corresponded with such candor then they were close wrote frequently there would surely be some note among katrinas papersof her address or at least something from which he could deduce where she lived she might even know more about dalgarno than katrina had told him something to help runcorn he must go back to her rooms the question was would it be wiser to go brazenly in daylight lie that he had authority or break in at night and trust to his skill not to be caught either way he had no honest explanation worst of all could be if he were caught having found emmas address or some further damning letter from her but the risk of leaving it was too great not only if runcorn found it but for the first time in his life that he could remember his nerves were raw enough to betray him to hester at least and it was she who mattered even above the law he did not know if it was the braver of the two ways or not but he chose to go by daylight he would have a better chance of bluffing his way if he was questioned and it was quicker he wanted it over with the waiting was almost as hard as the preparation and the doing he found no one on duty at the door of katrinas building but there was a beat constable twenty yards away he hesitated should he wait until the man moved on then try to sneak in and if he was caught think of some excuse for not being honest or would it be better to go up to him boldly lie about having thought of something useful and having runcorns permission to search implicitly he did have runcorn wanted him to prove dalgarnos guilt there were only two choices the latter had dangers but it was the better of the two he forced the consequences out of his mind fear would show in his face and if the constable was very good he would see it he walked firmly up to the constable and stopped in front of him good morning constable he said with a very faint smile no more than a gesture of civility my name is monk you may remember me from the night miss harcus was killed he saw recognition in the mans face with a wave of relief mr runcorn has asked for my assistance since i knew miss harcus and was working on a case for her i need to go into the house again and make a further search i do not require your assistance i am simply informing you so that you are not concerned if you see me there right sir thank you the constable said with a nod if you need me sir ill be ere good ill send for you if theres anything good day and before the man could sense his tension he turned and left going as rapidly as he dared toward the house he had no keys he was going to have to fiddle with the lock and pick his way in but that was an art he had learned from a master in the days before the accident and the skill had not left him he was inside the house within seconds and retraced his steps up to katrinas rooms it took him even less time to pick the lock on her door and then he was in the room the sense of tragedy closed around him the silence the very faint film of dust showing on the wooden surfaces in the sunlight through the bay windows perhaps to someone else it would simply have looked like the room of someone on holiday to him the presence of death was as tangible as another person watching him waiting he jerked his attention back to the moment there was no time to think about what had happened here to try to picture dalgarno if it had been him standing probably where monk was now charming her quarreling whatever it had been then going out onto the balcony with her the last furious words the struggle and her falling he was looking for papers letters address books where would they be in the desk where runcorn had already looked or in some other similar kind of place he moved quickly to the desk opened it and started with the pigeonholes then the drawers there was surprisingly little for a woman who conducted her own affairs and nothing dating farther back than a few months presumably that was when she had come to london there was nothing else to emma which was not surprising they would naturally all have been posted he was chilled inside at the thought of what emma might have and it seemed katrina had not kept emmas other letters at least not in the desk nor was there any note of her address was it one that she knew so well there was no need to note it down he stood in the middle of the floor staring around him where else might she keep anything on paper where did she cook did she have recipe books kitchen accounts that were separate a diary where did women keep diaries bedside table or cabinet under the mattress if it were private enough he searched more and more frantically trying to steady his hands and be methodical miss nothing replace everything as he had found it there were no other letters no address book only the cooking notes any woman might have a book of recipes handed on from eveline mary m austin and brief memos on how to launder certain difficult fabrics he found the diary just as he was about to give up he had actually sat down on the bed sweat on his face frustration making his hands stiff and clumsy when he felt a hardness in the lacecovered decorative pillow at the head over the coverlet he fished inside the fold at the back and drew out the hardcovered little book he knew instantly what it was and opened it gulping his breath at fear of what he would find it could be anything more doubts of himself words that would prove dalgarnos guilt or even someone elses or nothing of use at all and he hated the intrusion diaries were often intimate and shatteringly private he did not want to read it and he had to inside the flyleaf was an inscription to my dearest katrina from your aunt eveline he only glanced at the pages the first date was over ten years ago and the entries were sporadic sometimes merely the notation of a date at others a page or more even two for events of great importance to her he had not time to read them all and he concentrated on the more recent ones particularly since meeting dalgarno he felt guilty reading what were in some cases the inner thoughts of a young woman on the people in her life and the emotions they caused in her but often her words were so cryptic he could only guess and he preferred not to he imagined what he would have felt had he ever committed his own thoughts to paper like this and some mere stranger had read them he found the letter from emma almost at the end it was in the same cramped backhand as the one he had destroyed it was far less specific only words of any general sympathy as if in answer to a letter from katrina which did not need repeating for her responding emotions to be understood he read it twice then folded it up again put it in the diary and then put the diary carefully in his pocket apparently runcorn had not found it so he would not now miss it he could read it later and see if anything in it would lead to emma within half an hour of going in he was out in the street again telling the constable that unfortunately he had found nothing and then wishing him good day and walking rapidly back towards the main thoroughfare the news broke in the late edition that eveningmichael dalgarno arrested for brutal murder of katrina harcus in second tragedy for baltimore and sons runcorn must think he had enough to go to trial please heaven he was right but runcorn was not certain monk knew that the moment he spoke to him the next morning even though he denied it they were in runcorns office papers scattered on the desk and the sunlight coming through the window making bright patterns on the rest of the floor of course its enough runcorn repeated he was pulling a land fraud against the investors in baltimore and sons and katrina harcus knew it she told him so begged him to stop he had two reasons for wanting her dead he held up his fingers to keep her quiet about the fraud for which she may well have had proofand he destroyed it she as good as told you that and because he now had a chance of marrying livia baltimore who was shortly going to be a rich woman he looked across at monk challengingly and whether he had anything to do with nolan baltimores death or not well probably never know but its possible he drew in his breath he held up a third finger added to that he cant prove where he was at the time of her death he says he was at home but theres no one who can swear to it what about the cloak monk asked then instantly wished he had not it had to remind runcorn of the button as well and he had not yet destroyed the jacket or had a chance to find a replacement button if he dared do that runcorn sighed irritably no trace of it he said cant find anyone who saw him with a cloak anything like that he had a cape for the opera his tone of voice suggested what he thought of that but hes still got it monk was disappointed nothing with the button either runcorn went on all his coats and jackets are complete and his manservant says theres nothing missing then it all hangs on there being a fraud monk pointed out he hated having to say it but it was the truth and we cant prove that the land runcorn said truculently his chin forward you said there are rabbits in it you told me you saw them yourself is there some kind of a rabbit that can build tunnels through a hillside that a team of navvies couldnt blast through with dynamite for gods sake of course there isnt at least i hope not monk said wryly but even if there was a bit of sharp profit made on that it wasnt because dalgarno owned the land they had to divert to if there was no profit why do it runcorn demanded monk was patient i didnt say there was no profit only that it wasnt because dalgarno owned the land he didnt neither did either of the baltimores it may have been a matter of bribery someone paid very nicely to have the line diverted from his land but we havent any proof of it and i dont think katrina did either at least she didnt tell me about it he stopped what runcorn said quickly what is it monk youve remembered something i think she knew something more that she had not yet told me he admitted then that was it runcorns face was alight that was the proof she was going to give you but dalgarno killed her before she could she wanted to try one more time to persuade him to give it up we have no evidence of that monk cut across him look runcorn clenched his fist and stopped just short of banging it on the table this fraud is a copy of the first one for which arrol dundas was jailed sixteen years agoyes monk felt his body tense yes he said very quietly which nolan baltimore had to have known about either at the time or when it all came out in court runcorn pressed yes all right now this dundas wasnt a fool he got away with it for quite a long timein fact he nearly got away with it altogether nolan baltimore knew all about it presumably so did jarvis baltimoreand so very possibly did michael dalgarno its all part of the companys history after all find out how dundas got tripped up monk find the details of it piece by piece it was his land monk said wearily he bought it before the railway was diverted and then sold it to them expensively after falsifying the survey report as to the height and composition of the hill and baltimore and sons is doing exactly the same thing this time and diverting the track again runcorns eyes were wide with disbelief and im supposed to believe thats just a coincidence balderdash dalgarno knew all about the first time and he pulled exactly the same trick for a very good reason theres profit in it for him somewhere and katrina found proof of it you know railways you know bankingfind it and before we go to trial ill see you get the money for going to liverpool or wherever it takes you just come back with proof monk could not refuse for his own sake as much as runcorns or katrinas he held out his hand and after a moments blank stare runcorn pulled open his desk and came out with six guineas which he put into monks palm ill send you more if you need it he promised but dont take any longer than you have to theyll put him up pretty soon yes monk agreed yes i imagine they will he put the money in his pocket and went out of the door chapter nine when hester returned home and found a message from monk that he had gone to liverpool hoping to find proof of dalgarnos guilt in the fraud she understood exactly why he had done so in his place she would have done the same still she felt a great emptiness in the house and within herself also she had not been able to help him in this case and for all the superficial explanation and understanding she knew there were deep and intense feelings he had not shared with her and most of them were painful perhaps she had been so absorbed in the problems facing coldbath square that she had not insisted he tell her in the way that he had needed her to he could not speak easily of the truth because it trespassed on that part of his life that hurt him and in which he was afraid he had been so much less than the man he was now why did he still not trust her to be generous of spirit to hold back willingly and genuinely from needing to know that which was better buried did part of him still think she was critical selfrighteous all the cold and pinched things of which he used to accuse her before either of them would acknowledge that they were in love or had she somehow failed to let him know that she had accused him of arrogance cynicism and opportunism only because she was afraid of her own vulnerability she had been looking for something comfortable a man she could love while retaining her inner independence a love which would be agreeable safe never take from her more than she wished to give never cause her pain that was as great as the laughter and the joy he had pulled back for the same reasons he had pursued women who were soft and compliant pretty who did not challenge him or hurt him or demand of him all he had to give and more who did not strip away the pretenses and the shields to reach his heart when he was back she would do betterstop playing games of accommodation politeness skirting around the truth she would get back to the passion of honesty they had had in the beginning things shared with such intensity that touch words even silence was like an act of love but for now she must occupy herself and do something about the women who owed money to the usurer and were being beaten because they could not pay she was almost certain that squeaky robinson was the culprit but until she had spoken to him again and probed a good deal deeper her suspicions were not enough he was afraid of something it would be very helpful to know what it was it was a warm day outside she barely needed a shawl let alone a coat and the streets were crowded as far as the tottenham court road where she looked for a hansom she thought of buying a peppermint water from a peddlerit looked invitingbut then she thought better of spending the money she passed a newsboy and her eye caught an article on the war in america guiltily she hesitated in her step long enough to read at least the beginning remembering with vivid horror being caught up in that wars first fearful battle it seemed that the union forces had been profoundly embarrassed that many of the guns bristling out of miles of confederate fortifications were actually only painted logs of wood the cannoneers had retired south some considerable time before she smiled at the irony of it and hurried on finding a hansom at the next corner she went into the house in coldbath square really only to tell bessie where she intended to be so that if she was needed she could be sent for and also so that someone would know where she had gone it was the nearest she could come to any kind of security not that she thought squeaky robinson was any threat to her he had no reason to wish her harmthey were ostensibly on the same side at least he thought they were still it was a kind of precaution bessie was highly dubious about it she stood with her arms folded her lips pursed well all i can say is if yer int back ere safe an sound in two hoursan i can tell the timethen im goin fer constable art an ill not mince me words ill letim know were yer are an wots goin on i swear an ell come right arter yer likes yer e does she said that fiercely as if it were a threat in itself but that bessie would speak willingly to a policeman at all let alone confide in him and ask his help was eloquent witness to the gravity with which she viewed hesters undertaking satisfied that she had made her point hester thanked her and wrapped her shawl over her head in spite of the sun and set out for portpool lane squeaky received her stiffly sitting upright in his chair behind the desk a tray of tea sat in the only space clear of papers he had spectacles perched on the end of his long nose and there were ink stains on his fingers he seemed profoundly unhappy his hair stood on end as if he had been continually running his fingers through it what do you want he said abruptly i havent got anything to tell you i havent seen jessop i have hester said quickly sitting down on the chair opposite him and arranging her skirts more elegantly as if she meant to stay for some time he is still greedy for more money which we dont have nobody has money squeaky said resentfully i certainly dont so theres no use looking to me times are hard you of all people ought to know that why me hester asked innocently cos you know theres hardly a soul on the streets he said savagely toffs are starting to go other places for their pleasure were all going to end up in the workhouse an thats a fact it was an exaggeration he would steal long before he allowed such a disaster to happen but there was an underlying note of panic in his voice which was real i know its serious she said gravely political pressure is still keeping the police all over the place although no one expects them to find out now who killed baltimore a curious expression flickered over his face a kind of suppressed fury why if he knew who it was why did he not inform secretly of course and get the whole thing over with then he and everyone else could get back to normality there was only one possible answer to thatbecause it implicated him in some way or at least his house did he protect his women even at the cost of business she found that very hard to believe he used women until they were of no value anymore then discarded them as all pimps did they were property but his were particularly valuable property not easily replaced he could not go out and get them they had to walk into this trap they wont find out he sneered but there was rising tension underneath it and he watched her every bit as closely as she did him if theyd had any idea at all theyd have sewn it up by now he went on theyre here to please some bleedin toffs feelings of outrage cos a tart dared to hit back there was hatred in his eyes but for whom she could not tell what had happened to the woman who had killed baltimore if it was a woman or had she simply struck him and perhaps screamed and someone like the wouldbe butler at the door had actually killed him perhaps even unintentionally in a fight at the top of the stairs baltimore had lost his balance and fallen somebody must be sheltering her she said aloud then stopped seeing the instant denial in his face you think not he wiped his expression blank howd i know mebbe youd make it your business to know she replied her eyes never leaving his do you wish to be thought incompetentstupid she added for clarity in case he misunderstood he flushed with angeror possibly a kind of embarrassment youve a reputation to keep up she continued what do you want he snapped his voice high with barely controlled tension i cant stop jessop i told you that if you want someone to go an beat a little consideration intoim itll cost you i dont care whether youve got money or not youll get nothin for nothin it was not just greed driving him it was fear as well she could see it and hear it almost feel it in the room fear of what not the police they were nowhere near any kind of solution she knew that from constable hart fear of the silent man who loaned money to young women and then blackmailed them into prostitution a man who would do that must be a cruel and possibly dangerous partner was he threatening squeaky if he did not produce the usual income in spite of the circumstances she smiled slowly the idea of the wouldbe butlers giving jessop a couple of black eyes and a thoroughly good fright was very appealing she could be tempted squeaky was watching her as a cat does a mouse five pounds he said it was relatively speaking a modest enough sum margaret would be able to come by it why was squeaky offering to do such a thing for only five pounds was the partner really so demanding he was a usurer money was his stockintrade was squeaky down to so little that five pounds made a difference for you in your position she asked me he snapped hes then the derision vanished from his face and he conceded everything me he repeated it was a second or two before she realized what he was saying then it came in a flood of understandinghe was alone for some reason the partner was no longer there that was his panicthe fact that he did not know how to run the business by himself the wild idea gained at marielle courtneys house hardened into close to a certainty nolan baltimore had been squeakys partner and his death murder or accident had left squeaky without anyone to run the usury side of the business he needed a new partner someone with access to the sort of young women who might get into debt the polished manner to earn their confidence and the business acumen to loan them money and insist on its repayment in this way an even wilder idea came almost unbidden into her mind it was outrageous but it just might work if it did if she could persuade him it could solve their own problem it would not reveal who killed baltimore or get the police out of the area but she found to her surprise that she did not care greatly if baltimore had been the usurer and also a client of his own appalling trade then she could not mourn his death i will consider your offer mr robinson she said with aplomb she rose to her feet now that she had thought of a plan she was in a fever to put it to the test he looked vaguely hopeful was that for the money or the prospect of seeing jessop severely frightened either would do let me know he said with a very faint smile i will she promised good day mr robinson hester had to wait until the evening before she could put her idea to margaret after the initial business of the house was over alice and fanny were resting fairly easily the two were actually talking to one another hester heard the occasional soft giggle hester sat down with margaret to a cup of tea and she could contain herself no longer margaret stared at her wideeyed with disbelief hell never do it never well he might not hester admitted reaching for the butter and jam for her toast but it could work dont you thinkif he would if do you think margaret could scarcely admit the possibility but she was glowing with excitement her cheeks pink will you come with me to try hester asked margaret hesitated her eagerness was plain in her face also her fear of embarrassment and of failure she might be thought too forward and invite a rebuff which would hurt more than she would find easy to accept hester waited yes margaret agreed then took a deep breath as if to retract it and let it out in a sigh and picked up her tea good hester smiled at her well go tomorrow morning i shall meet you at vere street at nine oclock she gave margaret no chance to change her mind she stood up and carrying her toast with her went to speak to fanny as if the whole matter were settled and there could be nothing more to discuss the morning was bright and chilly again and hester dressed smartly in a plain dark blue dress and coat she took a hansom to vere street to be there just before nine she knew margaret would be on time and trembling with tension she cared for her feelings but apart from that she did not wish to give her any opportunity to retreat actually margaret was late and hester had begun to pace up and down the pavement anxiously at last the hansom drew up and margaret beautifully dressed scrambled out with less grace than usual im sorry she said hastily after paying the driver the traffic was terrible somebody clashed wheels and broke an axle in trafalgar square and they started shouting at each other what a mess are we yes hester replied too relieved to be angry we are come on and she took margaret by the arm and entered rathbones chambers they were too early as hester expected they would be she was immensely relieved simply to find that rathbone was not due in court that morning and if they waited there was an excellent chance he would be able to see them after his first client who was due at half past nine exactly the time the clerk expected rathbone himself as it transpired they were invited to go into his office shortly after ten oclock but hester had the feeling that had margaret not been with her he might have kept her waiting longer rathbone came forward to greet them hesitating an instant as to which of them he should speak to first it was so slight hester barely saw it but she knew him far better than margaret did and she had not mistaken it he addressed hester because of their long friendship but he had wanted to go to margaret hester how pleasant to see you he said with a smile even if i am perfectly sure that at this time in the morning you must have come on business no doubt to do with your house in coldbath square he turned to margaret good morning miss ballinger there was the very faintest flush on his cheeks i am glad you were able to come also although i am afraid i have not yet thought of any way in which your usurer can be stopped by the law and believe me i have tried margaret smiled back at him meeting his eyes with candor and then suddenly realizing how bold she was and moderating her gaze i am sure you have done all that could be she started then stopped we have thought about it a great deal also and certain events have changed matters considerably hester will tell you it is her idea although i do heartily agree rathbone turned to hester with his eyebrows raised and a distinct look of apprehension in his face as he invited them to be seated he turned to hester well she knew time was limited and she must not waste words or choose the wrong ones there would be little opportunity to retrieve a mistake she was prepared to risk a touch of overstatement if she was wrong she could apologize later she plunged in i know who the usurer is was she stated with assurance it was a partnership one man who found the young women and lent them the money the other who actually ran the brothel and did the daytoday management of affairs he collected the repayments and exacted the punishment if they were late it is the one who did the lending who is dead she added then is the business ended he asked doubt in his face will he not find another usurer or plan that part of it himself he cant take it over himself she answered he has not the skills nor has he the opportunity to meet the sort of young women most vulnerable he is a brothelkeeper and he looks and sounds like one she leaned forward a little what he needs desperately at the moment is someone who appears to be a gentleman but who has business ability and a degree of charm to deceive young women in debt into borrowing from him in the belief that they can repay with money honestly earned she watched him carefully to make sure she was putting the case clearly and yet not so obviously that he was ahead of her and would refuse before she had had the opportunity to explain the whole plan i expect he will find one he said his face filled with the rueful humor she knew so well it would be very pleasant to think that he will not but not realistic im sorry i agree she nodded if he could not then we would have no concern i cannot prevent it hester he said gravely nor can i reasonably find out who it will be i wish i could or are you saying that if we are to stop this business we have only a small amount of time in which to act he looked genuinely grieved i would if i knew of anything that would help it is not practical to try closing him down london is full of prostitution and probably always will be like all large cities there was apology in his eyes in the line of his mouth he did not look at margaret i know that hester answered softly i am not so idealistic as to aim at changing human nature oliver only at putting squeaky robinson out of this particular business miss ballinger suggested that you had an idea he said with care the slight frown back between his brows she could not help a flash of humor he had been involved in one or two of her plans before and was wise to be wary she plunged in we must strike before he finds a partner she said firmly praying she would phrase her plan in such a way as to make him believe it was not only possible but perfectly moral and reasonable which would not be easy strike he said warily he glanced at margaret she smiled with magnificent innocence he looked uncomfortable and turned back to hester she took a deep breath this was the moment before he finds a partner himself she said we must provide one who will need to examine the books of course before he commits himself rathbone said nothing and will thus have the opportunity to destroy them she finished he looked puzzled he wont believe you he said with grave regret your reputation is too well known hester and unless he is a complete fool he wouldnt believe monk either oh i know that she agreed but he would believe you if you did it well enough he froze eyes wide there was nothing to do but continue if you were to go to him with us of course and say you would be interested in investing a little money in such a profitable sideline she knew she was speaking too quickly providing an examination of the books the debts still to be collected and so on were satisfactory then you would also be able to provide suitable young women in the future you come across them often enough in your practice hester he protested aghast for gods sake he swiveled to margaret i apologize miss ballinger but i couldnt possibly involve myself in usury and prostitution not to mention sanctioning the brutal punishment of people unable to pay their debts oh but you wouldnt be margaret said sincerely you would only have to go there once her eyes did not leave his and surely lawyers deal with some very questionable people a lot of the time you can hardly defend people who havent at least been charged with a crime whether they are guilty or not yes but thats he protested her smile lit her face with a softness and a warmth which were unmistakable she could not have hidden her admiration for him then even had she tried and at the moment she was oblivious of it if anyone were to mention it should they know you could be perfectly candid afterwards as to why you were there she said reasonably could anything be more justified than rescuing perfectly honest young women from a life on the streets his face was filled with confusion both intellectual and emotional hester who knew him so well could see it clearly thats not exactly what youre suggesting he pointed out reluctantly looking from one to the other of them i need to go to this squeaky yes squeaky robinson hester nodded and offer to be his partner in usury and pimping he finished only offer hester said as if it were the most reasonable thing in the world not actually do it the difference between intent and execution would be difficult to prove he said with a touch of sarcasm to whom hester argued who is going to know except squeaky robinson who will be in no position to retaliate and margaret and i who will be undyingly grateful and of course we know exactly where your real morality lies hester it is he tried again ingenious and unpleasant margaret answered for him of course it is her voice conveyed understanding and disappointment her eyes were wide full of gentleness as if she knew she had expected too much rathbone flushed he was perfectly well aware that she and hester worked in coldbath square almost every day regardless of dirt danger or risk to their reputations when were you planning on doing this he asked tentatively tonight hester replied without hesitation margaret smiled hopefully and said nothing tonight i rathbone was momentarily nonplussed i thank you hester murmured hester he protested but he had already surrendered and all three of them knew it margarets eyes were gleaming her cheeks faintly flushed although no one could have told whether the cause was anticipation of the possible victory tonight or her knowledge that rathbone had succumbed largely because of her hester stood up and rathbone and margaret did likewise time was short but quite apart from that it was wise to withdraw before triumph could be turned into defeat by a thoughtless additional remark thank you very much hester said sincerely where would you like to meet us coldbath square might not be the most advisable what about fitzroy street margaret suggested i can be there at whatever time you wish then i shall join you at nine oclock rathbone replied he looked at hester with a twisted smile what does one wear to buy into a brothel she regarded his extremely elegant gray suit and white shirt with its perfectly tied cravat i would not change if i were you dressed like that he will believe you have money and influence how about greed immorality and perverted tastes he asked with a slight curl of his lip you cannot dress for that she replied with perfect seriousness regrettably touché he murmured until nine oclock i presume you will tell me then whatever else i am required to know yes of course thank you oliver goodbye he bowed very slightly goodbye hester and margaret walked away side by side heads high without speaking each lost in her own thoughts hester assumed margarets were of rathbone perhaps driven by emotions rather than reason her own were also emotional the full realization that whether rathbone knew it or not he was falling in love with margaret ballinger quite as much as he had ever been with hester herself she felt a powerful mixture of regret and pleasure but she knew in a while the pleasure would win by the time the hansom stopped in the farringdon road at just after half past nine hester margaret and rathbone knew exactly what part each was going to play in what they hoped was going to be the downfall of squeaky robinsons business they alighted and walked the short distance in the fitful lamplight along hatton wall and across leather lane to the darkness of portpool lane under the shadow of the brewery none of them spoke each concentrating on what he or she was going to say and how to assume their various roles hester was nervous it had seemed a brilliant idea when she first thought of it now that it was about to become a reality she could see all the difficulties that she had so eagerly persuaded margaret and then rathbone did not matter she led them through the alley entrance which was still remarkably clear of rubbish and up the steps to the door as usual it was opened by the man in the castoff butlers suit you again he said somewhat ungraciously to hester then looked beyond her to the other two his face clouded oo are they he demanded friends of mine she replied confidently the gentleman is in a way of business which might interest mr robinson i am aware of certainshe hesitated delicatelyrequirements at the moment you had better tell him i am here he was empowered to make decisions it showed in his face it was also more than likely that he was fully aware of the problems occasioned by baltimores death it was probably he who had moved the body and left it in abel smiths house he swung the door wide slight surprise registering in his face then yerd better come in he suggested but dont take no liberties ill find if mr robinsonll see yer he left them in the small side room in which hester had waited before there was not even space or chairs for all three of them to be seated rathbone looked around him with curiosity and a slight puckering of his nose with distaste did you come here by yourself hester he said anxiously yes of course i did she replied theres no one to come with me dont look like that i didnt meet with any harm did monk know he asked no and you are not going to tell him she said hotly i will do so myself when the time is right he smiled very slightly and when will that be when the matter is closed she said it is not always a good idea to tell everybody everything you know one should keep ones own counsel at times he gave her a pointed look hester is very brave margaret said loyally far braver than i am in some things i hope you have more sense he said sharply margaret blushed and looked down then up again at him quickly i do not think you should criticize hester sir oliver she does what she has to in order to protect people who have no one else to care for their interests the fact that in some cases they may have made errors of judgment does not set them apart from the rest of us suddenly he smiled it was a warm and charming gesture you are quite right im not used to women who take such risks it is my fear for her which speaks i am very slow to learn that my discomfort may concern her but it certainly will not stop her would you wish it to margaret challenged he thought for several seconds hester waited surprisingly interested in what he should reply no he said at last i used to wish it would but i have learned at least that much margaret smiled back at him then looked away conscious of his eyes upon her the butler returned yerd better come he said jerking his head toward the corridor and leading them deeper into the warren of passages and stairways squeaky robinson was sitting in the same room as when hester had seen him before piles of papers were strewn around him and one gas lamp was lit throwing a pool of yellow onto the desk and again there was the tray with tea he looked tired to the point of exhaustion his skin was papery with dark smudges under his eyes had he been in ordinary trade hester would have been sorry for him but she was too aware of fanny and alice and others like them to allow herself such a feeling squeaky stood up slowly only glancing at hester then his eyes went straight to rathbone he barely noticed margaret at all perhaps women were largely invisible to him if he was not inspecting them as goods good evening mr robinson hester said as calmly as she could i have brought this gentleman whose name you do not need to know as yet because he is interested in investing money in a business a little out of the ordinary where he can have a fast and safe return it will also be desirable if it can escape the attention of the tax inspectors and not have to be explained to certain members of his family with whom he might otherwise have to share it she indicated margaret and this lady is good with books and figures always an advisable attribute to have when considering an investment squeaky stood up slowly his face like that of a man who has walked long across an arid plain and at last thinks he sees water he stared at rathbone taking in his immaculate boots his perfectly cut suit with its excellent cloth his cravat as clean as snow the humor and intelligence in his face how do you do mr robinson rathbone did not offer his hand mrs monk tells me that your previous partner in business met with an unfortunate accident and therefore the position is now vacant is she correct squeaky licked his lips his indecision was palpable whatever answer he made there was risk attached on one hand he might give away too much about himself on the other he might lose rathbones interest and thus the new partner necessary for his survival the silence was heavy in the room the building seemed to sag and creak as if settling itself deeper into unseen mire beneath it rathbone glanced at hester impatiently and frowned squeaky saw it yes he said abruptly he died suddenly a euphemism surely rathbone raised his eyebrows was he not murdered ah squeaky gulped his throat jerking yes nothing to do with his investment here a purely private matter a quarrel his own appetites most unfortunate i see rathbone looked as if he did although hester knew he had not the slightest idea well that will not affect me i have no desire to avail myself of your services i mean simply to invest money and reap the reward but i would prefer to think that you did not have many clients who meet with accidents it attracts the wrong kind of attention i am in a position to ride out one term of police presence due to murder but not two oh it wont happen again squeaky assured him its never happened before and ill take care of it the womans gone i assure you good rathbone almost smiled satisfactory so far but naturally i require to know rather more about your businessfor instance the financial side of it the incomings and outgoings the general historybefore i commit myself of course of course squeaky nodded vigorously anyone would it needs a careful man i am a careful man rathbone said with the barest smile hester had a sudden suspicion that part of him was enjoying playacting the role there was a casual elegance in the way he stood and his hands by his sides were relaxed his fingers loose she might tease him about this afterwards when it was all over he would probably never admit to it its a good business squeaky assured him very profitable and strictly legal mind just a matter of lending a little money to people who need it could almost be viewed as a charity he saw the look on rathbones face and amended his expression well theres no matter what anyone thinks is there cos nobodys going to know not from me rathbone replied dryly and if you are wise not from you either oh rest easy sir squeaky nodded vehemently his eyes wide rest easy you wont get any money until i do rathbone promised him how did your deceased partner become involved hester shot a quick look at him it did not matter how baltimore had started in this in fact she really no longer cared who had killed him if it was one of his own victims and not only for the money but for his appetites as well a certain kind of justice had already been served some gentlemen have different tastes squeaky said with a wry leer he was one of them and you take all such men into your confidence rathbone said with disgust hester saw his hand clench by his side she was afraid now that the answer squeaky would give would make it far harder for him to remain as an investor he had pushed too far should she say something to help but what you set up the business with him she interrupted i daresay it was his idea no it was not squeaky said angrily his voice rising alarmingly in pitch it was already a very good concern when he came in he resented her intrusion thats hard to believe she said scathingly squeaky pointed his finger at her look miss you just keep to your good works in coldbath and leave the business to them as know about it i had a very good thing going here before mr baltimore ever came along i was just unlucky my partner then preece his name was was a greedy man he tried to blackmail one or two of the betteroff customers thats a fool thing to do kill the goose that way enoughs enough he sliced the air with his stringy hand and its inkstained fingers anyway baltimore got very angry and they set at each other like prizefighters his lips pursed in a gesture of disgust but he looked a little pale at the memory preece was a big fat bastard and he took an attack went all colors and fell down on the floor clutching his chest died right there he looked past hester directly at rathbone heart he said savagely too much belly and no brain his own fault rathbone nodded apparently he agreed hester saw him relax so very slightly it was barely perceptible she shot a glance at margaret in the shadows behind him and read the relief in her face also anyway squeaky resumed i needed someone to take his place and baltimore needed the business to continuein his own interest like we were the only ones offering exactly the service he wanted otherwise hed have to start all over again looking from scratch as it were worked out very well all round until he died as well rathbone observed that was his own fault too squeaky said immediately he got stupid and thought just because he had a share in the place that he could go as far as he liked with the girls one of them killed him rathbone said very softly yeh but shes gone too wild that one pushed him out o the window top story an all he winced what a mess its all right though the police dont even know it happened here he grinned we put the body in old abel smiths place like he fell down the stairs very tidy rathbone observed you have a gift for making the best of bad luck thank you squeaky bowed margaret drew in her breath sharply now all i require is to look at your accounts if you please rathbone asked squeaky hesitated staring at rathbone as if to hold his attention while he deliberated he glanced at hester then margaret in the background barely moving then at rathbone again rathbone understood his meaning instantly miss then he changed his mind i cannot enter a business unless i have a financial opinion upon the books mr robinsonone that i trust he smiled very slightly hardly more than an easing of his features i do not care to consult my usual bankers in this particular matter squeaky grinned then nodded slowly satisfied he turned and went to a cupboard on the far side of the overcrowded room taking a key out of his pocketalthough it remained attached to him by a chainhe opened one of the doors he lifted up a large ledger relocked the door and carried the ledger over to the table margaret stepped forward i shall require a quiet place to study the figures she said it coolly but hester knew from the tension in her shoulders and the slightly higher pitch of her voice that she was desperately aware that everything hung on this moment alone and no interruptions if you please margaret added then if it is satisfactory you can make the arrangements squeaky regarded her with curiosity it was perfectly plain that she was nothing he had expected and he was confused she did not belong in any preconceived part of his world she waited no one interrupted the silence rathbone moved from one foot to the other hester all but held her breath right squeaky said at last he offered the ledger for margaret who took it with very slightly trembling hands and clasped it to her through there squeaky said pointing to a corner of the room where another doorway was partially concealed by a curtain thank you hester accepted immediately and to squeakys fairly obvious relief she and margaret left him alone with rathbone the next room was small and enclosed the turning up of the gaslight revealed one square uncurtained window overlooking rooftops almost indistinguishable against the night sky there was one chair and a table on rickety legs margaret sat down and opened the ledger and hester leaned over her shoulder and read with her it was written in a very neat crabbed hand all the figures sloping backward a little even at a glance the profits were plain to see if the entries were honest but it was the ious they needed whatever this proved was immaterial it was not illegal margaret started to turn the pages more hurriedly then picked up the whole ledger and held it upside down nothing fell out theyre not here she said with a note of desperation give it a few moments more as if we had read it all hester replied then ill go and ask for them ill say you need to get an idea of the future as well as the past obediently margaret returned her attention to the columns and perfunctorily added them up baltimore was turning a very nice profit on this she said bitterly after another few moments this looks like alices repayments here she pointed stopping about the time of baltimores murder actually there are hardly any repayments after that only this one right hester said firmly thats all i need ill go to see mr robinson she went straight to the door and without knocking back into the room where rathbone and squeaky were sitting facing each other in what seemed to be earnest conversation squeaky looked excited and anxious leaning forward so the gaslight threw his seamed face into heavy relief and rathbone relaxed back in his chair half smiling they both turned as hester came in what is it squeaky demanded rathbone frowned his eyes searching hers it all looks very profitable mr robinson hester said smoothly there is just one matter to sort out oh squeaky asked abruptly and whats that then there has been almost a complete stop in repayments latelyover the last three weeks to be exact she answered of course there has squeaky exploded gawd sakes woman theres rozzers on every bleeding footpath how dyer think anyones going to earn anything where are your wits at rathbone stiffened at wanting to see your paper proof that there are still debts owed hester answered perfectly levelly avoiding rathbones eyes no one wants to buy a business that has nothing coming in on a permanent basis squeaky shot to his feet i have he said furiously jabbing his finger in the air ive got lots o money coming still but nothings forever what do you think i need a partner for when these run out we gotter get more he went back to the cupboard where he had found the ledger and pulled the key from his pocket and opened the door he poked his hand inside and fished around for a few moments then withdrew it holding a sheaf of papers he ignored the wideopen door and came back to hester holding them out there all debts he said waving them at her so you say she agreed resisting the impulse to snatch at them we will add them up deduct a little for accidents and come to a figure to present she inclined her head at rathbone but carefully avoided using his name squeaky still held tight onto the papers hester looked at rathbone again rathbone pursed his lips and started to stand up all right squeaky thrust the papers at hester but only in that room mind theyre worth a lot of money of course rathbone agreed or i would not be willing to put my own money into the venture hester took the papers from squeakys reluctant fingers and walked straight over to the doorway expecting any moment to hear squeakys footsteps behind her she reached the door with relief and opened it then closed it again behind her margaret looked up at her her face pale and tight with tension she gulped when she saw the papers in hesters hand and relaxed a fraction hester looked at them just long enough to be certain that they were the original signed ious not copies of anything in squeakys own hand when she was satisfied that they were she looked up and nodded to margaret margaret took them and went to the fireplace she put a taper to the gas flame in the light caught fire to it then sheltering it with her hand bent down and set it to the papers all in absolute silence hester stood with her back against the door her heart pounding the flames caught and flared up margaret watched until there was nothing left then took the tongs and crushed the blackened pieces she turned around to hester a smile of triumph on her face hester picked up the ledger do you want to she invited her margaret shook her head its yours she replied but i want to watch hester made a little beckoning gesture then opened the door with her free hand and went back into the room with squeaky and rathbone squeaky looked up well he demanded didnt i tell you you did hester agreed putting the ledger down on the desk in front of him there was a lot of money owed but since i have just burned the ious you will not be able to collect it squeaky stared at her in incomprehension it was too terrible for him to grasp even rathbone seemed startled he had expected her to leave squeaky to find that out for himself when they were well outside the place he looked a trifle taken aback you you fool squeaky screeched as the truth of it dawned on him you you not a fool mr robinson hester said calmly although her hands were sweating and she knew she was trembling it was precisely what i intended to do im ruined squeakys face was red his eyes bulging he held out his hands as if he were thinking of actually grasping hold of her and strangling her she took a step backward just as rathbone stood up no you wont she said chokingly i have an idea how you could use this place really quite well you what squeaky said with total disbelief she was monstrous beyond credibility i i have an idea hester repeated we need new premises better than we have now and cheaper cheaper squeaky yelled you should pay me compensation thats what you should do you you lunatic nonsense she said briskly at least you will stay out of jail you can run this place as a hospital for the sick and injured theres plenty of room he gulped and choked the money can be raised by charity she went on in the deafening silence youve got lots of young women here who could learn to be nurses it would gawd almighty squeaky burst out in anguish hester rathbone protested it seems like quite a good bargain to me hester adopted an air of utmost reason squeaky turned to rathbone to appeal to him im sorry rathbone said a strange lift in his voice as if he were teetering on the edge between horror and laughter i have no intention of investing in your business mr robinson unless of course you adopt mrs monks suggestion i had no idea that she had such a thing in mind but it seems to me something to which i could donate a certain amount and possibly find others who would do the same he took a deep breath i appreciate that it would ruin your reputation among your colleagues but it might earn you a certain leniency in other directions what other directions squeaky wailed youre asking me to be worse than legitimate itd be downright good he said the word as if it were damnation the law rathbone said reasonably i am a barrister he bowed very slightly sir oliver rathbone qc squeaky robinson let out a long wordless groan then we will all be well suited hester said with satisfaction we shall even be able to tell mr jessop that his premises are no longer required margaret added i personally will enjoy that very much we shall of course not pay you well mr robinson but the donations will be sufficient without that expense to see that you are comfortable and properly fed and clothed if you manage the place it will give you something to occupy your time and the other work will need to be overseen the present young ladies can earn a modest living quite honorably squeaky howled good margaret said with deep satisfaction she glanced at last at rathbone and blushed at the admiration in his eyes she looked at hester hester smiled back at her youre all in it together squeaky accused his voice hitting falsetto in outrage you are exactly right rathbone agreed gently smiling as if extraordinarily pleased with himself and now you are fortunate to be in it with us also mr robinson my sincere advice for which i will not charge you is to make the best of it squeaky let out a last despairing groan and was utterly ignored chapter ten the journey to liverpool was just like the others he could hear the rattle of iron wheels over the joints in the rails even when he drifted into sleep although he fought against it he was afraid of what the dreams would bring back the sense of horror and grief the piercing sick knowledge of guilt although he still did not know for what he stared out of the window the rolling countryside with its plowed fields was dark where the grain was sown but not yet through the ground green like thrown gauze over the earth where the earlier crop had sprung the cherry and wild plum and pear trees were mounded white with blossom but all of them made no mark on his senses he got out and back in again at every stop eager to be there he reached liverpool lime street just before dark stiff and tired and found himself lodgings for the night in the sharp chill of morning his mind was made up where to begin whatever pain it might bring whatever revelations not only as to his life but to monks also he must start with arrol dundas where had he lived who had been his friends or his associates what had been the style and the substance of his life monk had wanted to know these things and at the same time dreaded it ever since the first splinters of memory had begun to return it was time to realize both the hopes and the fears the newspaper accounts had stated where dundas had lived at the time of his arrest it was a simple enough matter to check and take a cab out to the elegant treelined street he sat in the hansom outside number fourteen staring up and down at the beautiful houses which were spacious and meticulously cared for maids beat carpets in the back alleyways laughing and flirting with delivery boys or arguing over the price of fish or fresh vegetables here and there a bootboy idled a few minutes or a footman stood looking important monk needed no one to tell him this was an expensive neighborhood this right sir the cabbie asked yes i dont wish to go in just wait here monk answered he wanted to think to let the air of the place the sights and sounds swirl around him and settle in his mind perhaps something here would rip away the veils in his mind and show him what he hoped and dreaded to seehimself as he had been generous or greedy blindly loyal or a betrayer the past was closing in only another fact a smell a sound and he would be facetoface with it at last who lived in this house now was there still a stainedglass window at the top of the stairs before the flight turned up another story was there still a pear tree in the garden white with spring blossom there would be a different carpet in the withdrawing room not red and blue anymore probably not red curtains either suddenly with a jolt of clarity he remembered perfectly sitting at the dining room table the curtains were blue all along the row of windows opposite him the chandeliers were blazing with candles reflecting on the silver cutlery and the white linen below he could see the patterns on the handles as if he held one right now ornate with ad engraved in the center there were fish knives as well a new invention before that people had eaten fish with two forks mrs dundas was extraordinarily pleased with them he could see her face calm and happy she had been wearing a sort of plum color it complimented her rather sallow skin she was not beautiful but there was a dignity and an individuality about her he had always liked but it was her voice that pleased most low and a little husky especially when she laughed there was pure joy in it there had been a dozen people around the table all perfectly dressed jewels glittering faces smooth and happy arrol dundas at the head presiding over the good fellowship there had been money plenty of it had it been the product of fraud had all that elegance and charm been bought at the expense of other peoples loss it was a thought so ugly he was surprised he could entertain it without it leaving him with a raw wound and yet it did not perhaps he was too anesthetized by katrinas death and the snatched memories and imagination of the crash to be capable of still more hurt he leaned and tapped hard to get the cabbies attention thank you take me back to the records office please he instructed him yes sir right the cabbie had had his fair share of eccentrics and it made no difference to him as long as they paid he flicked the whip lightly and the horse moved forward glad to stand no longer in the sharp sunlight the overnight frost had not yet melted on the cobbles in the shade had the house been dundass or merely rented monk had followed enough other peoples affairs to know that all kinds of men lived on credit sometimes the last ones you would expect he remembered mrs dundas somewhere quite different when she had told him of her husbands death had she left this beautiful place for financial reasons or because she could no longer bear to live so close to her old friends after her husband was disgraced there would be no invitations anymore no calls no conversations in the street anyone might choose to movehe would have dundas must have left a will and there would be records somewhere of the houses being sold with the date it took him till the middle of the afternoon to trace what he was looking for it left him puzzled and acutely aware of a mystery he should already have solved but if he had there was nothing of it left in his memory the house had been sold before dundass death in fact by then his estate had been worth no more than the new very modest house in which his widow had lived and a very small annuity sufficient only to keep her in the necessities and even to do that she would have had to spend with care what startled him and left him with shaking hands and a tightness in his chest was that the name of the executor of the will was william monk he stood in front of the shelf with the book open in front of him and leaned over it his legs weak what had happened to the money from the sale of the house the court had not taken it the profit from the sale of land which had been charged as fraud was still to be realized dundas had owned the house for twelve years there was no shadow or taint upon his purchase of that so where had it gone he looked again and again but search as he might he could find no record of it if he had handled it himself and it seemed that dundas had trusted him to do just that then he had concealed all trace of it why surely the only reason a man hid his dealings with money was because they were dishonest it had been a fortune if he had taken it himself then he would have been an extremely rich man surely that was not something he could have forgotten when he joined the police he had owned nothing but the clothes he stood up inand a few others besides clothesdundas had taught him to dress well very well and he had never lost the taste for it glimpses of memory returned of fittings at tailors dundas leaning back elegantly and giving instructions a lift here an inch in or out there a little longer in the legsyesthats right this cut of shirt is best egyptian cotton that is how to tie a cravat smart but vulgardont ever wear one like that understated always understated a gentleman does not need to draw attention to himself discreet but expensive quality tells in the long run monk found himself smiling against his will a lump in his throat so high and hard it stopped him from swallowing the legacy was still with him he spent too much on clothes even now what had happened to the money what had mrs dundas bequeathed at the time of her death that too was easily discovered when he found her will very little indeed the annuity died with her the house was worth a small amount but some of that went to settle outstanding debts she had lived to the meager limits of her income if he had been dundass executor had he disposed of the money somehow where to whom above all why that question beat in his mind at every turn like the scrape of leather on a bleeding blister he drank hot coffee and was too tense to eat what did it have to do with baltimore perhaps the affairs of baltimore and sons would give him some of the answers or lead him to another avenue to follow in his search it took him until the next day to find someone both willing and able to discuss the subject with him mr carborough who made a study of the finances of such businesses with a view to investment in them for himself good company he said enthusiastically waving a pencil in the air small but good made a nice profit from the land deals not excessive and better of course from the railways themselves headquarters in london now i believe building another nice line to derby they were sitting in carboroughs office overlooking a narrow busy street down near the docks the smell of salt drifted up to the halfopen window and the shouts and clangs of traffic winches and bales being loaded and unloaded what about dundas and the land fraud monk asked keeping his voice casual as if it were of no personal interest to him carborough curled his lip stupid to get caught in something as trivial as that he said shaking his head never understood it myself he was brilliant one of the best merchant bankers in the city if not the best then he goes and does a foolish thing like changing the grid reference on a survey so they move the course of the track onto his own land and he makes what he shrugged a thousand pounds at most hardly as if he needed it and at the time he did it hed have expected to get an interest in whatever the company made on the new brakes he found the money to develop them what new brakes monk said quickly carborough opened his eyes wide oh they invented their own system of braking for carriages and goods wagons quite a bit cheaper than the standard ones used now would have cleaned up a fortune dont know what happened there they never followed through with it why not he asked the same flicker of memory woke in monk and died in the same instant dont know that mr monk carborough replied after dundass trial everything seemed to stop for a while then he died you know he put the pencil down next to his pad making it perfectly level in prison poor devil maybe the shock of it all was too much anyway after that they concentrated on new lines seemed to forget all about brakes built their own wagons and so on did pretty well out of it as i said moved down to london monk asked him more questions but carborough knew nothing about dundas personally and had not heard monks name before that he recalled neither was there any sign of the money that dundas must have received for his house it had vanished as completely as if the treasury notes it was paid in had been burned the next step was to pursue the reverend william colman who had given such telling evidence against dundas it might be an unpleasant encounter since colman would certainly remember monk from the trial he would be the first person monk had spoken to who had known him from that time dundas and his wife were both dead and so was nolan baltimore monk would be coming facetoface with the reality of who he had been and finally there would be no escape from whatever colman remembered of him had he hated the man then for his evidence had he been offensive to him tried to discredit him had colman even believed him equally guilty with dundas but simply been unable to prove it colman was still in the ministry and it was not a difficult matter to find him in crockfords the registry of anglican priests by late afternoon monk was walking up the short path to the vicarage door in a village on the outskirts of liverpool he was aware of a fluttering in his stomach and that his hands were clammy and aching from the frequency with which he was clenching them deliberately he forced himself to relax and pulled the bell knob the door opened surprisingly quickly and a tall man in slightly crumpled clothes and a clerical collar stood staring at him expectantly he was lean with gray hair and a vigorous intelligent face monk knew with a thrill of memory so sharp it caught his breath that this was colmanthe face he had seen sketched with the protesters against the railway immeasurably more vivid than that it was the face he had seen in his dreams and desperate fighting through the wreckage of the burning train in that same instant colman recognized him his jaw momentarily slack with amazement monk he stared more closely it is monk isnt it monk kept his voice steady with difficulty yes mr colman i would appreciate it if you could spare me a little of your time colman hesitated only a moment then he swung the door wide come in what can i do for you monk had already decided that the only way to achieve what he needed was for the complete truth to come out if indeed it was possible at all the truth necessarily involved being honest about his loss of memory and that bits and pieces were now coming back colman led the way to the room in which he received parishioners and invited him to be seated he regarded monk with curiosity which was most natural he had not seen him in sixteen years he must be looking at the changes in him the character more deeply etched in his face the tiny differences in texture of skin the way the lean flesh clothed the bones monk was acutely aware of colmans personality and the force of emotion he had felt in him beforenothing had diminished it the grief was all still there the memory of burying the dead of trying to scrape together some kind of comfort for stricken families colman was waiting monk began it was difficult and his voice stumbled as he summarized the years between then and now ending with the story of baltimore and sons and the new railway as colman listened the guardedness was there in his face the echoes of old anger and shattering grief they had been on opposite sides of the issue then and it was clear in his expression in his careful eyes and slightly pinched lips and above all in the tightness in his body as he sat one leg still crossed over the other his fists were closed his muscles rigid they were opponents still that would never be forgotten nolan baltimore has been murdered monk stated he saw colmans start of surprise then a gleam of satisfaction and immediately afterwards guilt for it even a flush in his cheeks but he was in no haste to express the usual regrets there was an honesty in him which prevented it by a prostitute monk added while in the pursuit of somewhat irregular pleasures disgust was plain in colmans eyes and that brings you here he said in disbelief not directly monk replied but it does mean we cannot question him about anything to do with what very much appears to be another fraud in baltimore and sons almost exactly like the first colman sat upright with a jolt another but dundas is dead poor soul you of all people must know that surely your memory cannot be so affected i mean he stopped monk rescued him in his embarrassment i remember that but what i dont recall is how the fraud was discovered not in detail you see it seems this time as if a man named dalgarno is responsible only the person who was his main accuser is also dead murdered he saw the pity in colmans face this time unmixed with anything else a woman monk continued she was betrothed to him and because of her privileged position as his fiancée discovered certain things about the business overheard conversations saw papers which made her realize there was something seriously wrong she brought it to me i investigated it as far as i was able but i could find no fraud a little questionable profiteering but thats all but she was murdered colman interrupted leaning forward with urgency yes and dalgarno is charged with it but in order to prove his guilt we need to show the fraud beyond question i see it was clear from his expression that he understood perfectly what is it that you want of me you were the one who first suspected fraud why colman frowned he was clearly fascinated by the concept of such total loss from the mind of something in which monk had been passionately involved you really remember nothing of it his voice thickened with emotion his body became rigid you dont remember my church in the valley with the old trees around it the graveyard monk struggled but nothing came he was picturing it in his mind but it was imagination not memory he shook his head it was beautiful colman said his face tender with sorrow an old church the original was norman with a crypt underneath where men were buried nearly a thousand years ago the graveyard was full of old families over fifteen or twenty generations it was the history of the land history is only people you know he stared at monk intensely reaching for the man behind the facade the passions which could be stirredand woundeddeeper than the analytical brain they sent the railway right through the middle of it now something clicked in monks mind a bishop mild and reasonable full of regret but acknowledging progress and the need for work for men transport the moving forward of society there had been a curate shy and enthusiastic wanting to keep the old and bring in the new as well and refusing to see that to have both was impossible and caught between the two of them the reverend colman an enthusiast a lover of the unbroken chain of history who saw the railways as forces of destruction shattering the cement of family bonds with the dead vandalizing the physical monuments that kept the spiritual ties whole monk could hear voices raisedshouting angry and afraid faces twisted with rage but colman had done more than protest he had proved crime was this it the elusive memory at lastthe proof who would it blamebaltimore or monk himself he cleared his throat it felt tight as if he could not breathe they destroyed the church he asked aloud yes the new line goes right over where it used to be colman did not add anything the emotion in his voice was sufficient how did you discover the fraud monk forced himself to sound almost normal he almost had the truth simple colman replied someone told me he watched rabbits on the hill they said they had to go around because it would be too expensive to tunnel through he was a parishioner of mine in trouble for poaching when i asked where hed been caught he told me rabbits dont tunnel in granite mr monk navvies can blast through pretty well anything solid mountains just take longer and therefore cost more i found the original survey when one looked more carefully at the one baltimore was using it was falsified whoever did it had been too clever to alter the heights or compositionhe found a hill that was exactly right somewhere else and altered the grid reference it was an extremely skilled job monk asked the question he had to but he had to clear his throat again to make his voice come arrol dundas it looked like it colman said with regret as if he would rather it had been someone else did he ever admit to it no nor did he blame anyone else but i think that was more a matter of dignity even morality than because he had no idea who it might have been it was a moment before monk realized the full meaning of what colman had said he had begun his own next question and stopped in the middle of the sentence you mean you doubted dundas was guilty he said incredulously colman blinked you always maintained he wasnt even after the verdict you swore he was not the one who had changed the survey and that his profit was through good speculation but not dishonesty he simply bought low and sold high monk was confused then who forged the survey references baltimore why would he he didnt have any land nor money in the bank from it afterwards colman agreed i dont know the answer if it wasnt dundas then the real money probably came in bribery somewhere but no one will ever prove it why would anyone else falsify the surveys monk pressed colman frowned weighing his answer before he gave it and then his words were picked with great care the railway cut through the middle of my church and that was all i could think of at the time his eyes filled with sudden tears and then the crash the children he stopped there was no way to express it and perhaps he saw some recognition of horror in monk and words became unnecessary monks recollection of him was growing sharper he had wanted to like him before it was his testimony against dundas that had made it impossible now all that had receded into history for both of them and there was no issue to be fought anymore colman blinked and smiled in apology i am afraid i am not much help in gaining the evidence you need to prove dalgarnos guilt for murdering the young woman or whether baltimore was the one practicing the fraud but if i understood you correctly he was already dead himself by the time she was killed yes by two or three weeks monk agreed then possibly dalgarno was in the fraud with baltimore and once baltimore was dead he would take all the profits to himself colman suggested or share them with the son jarvis baltimore monk amended it seems likely especially since dalgarno is now courting the daughter livia according to my wifes observation colmans eyes widened your wife is acquainted with the baltimores monk did not bother to hide his smile or the bubble of pride springing up inside him high and bright and with a pain like a dagger for what he could lose no she is running a house of refuge and medical treatment for prostitutes in coldbath square and livia baltimore went to her for help and in considerable anger and distress after her fathers murder hester learned some information and went to call on her she nursed in the crimea there is not much that deters her once she is convinced she is right colman shook his head but his eyes were shining i hope she does not have to enlighten miss baltimore as to the true nature of her father he said i think he may well have tried the same fraud a second time but i dont know how you will prove it to a jury without evidence of profit he escaped the first time because it was plain he had no financial gain from it and dundas did dundas died with very little monk pointed out old sadness and anger washing over him in a tidal wave colman became suddenly very solemn also i heard that although it was extraordinary he was an excellent banker quite brilliant but you cant have forgotten that surely i had but not now where did the money go colman stared at monk somberly i have no idea no one had and shortly after that the crash put all such things out of everyones thoughts suddenly his face was pinched and the color went from his cheeks again it was the closest thing to hell i think this life could offer i shall remember the screams as long as i live the smell of burnt hair still brings me out in a sweat and i feel sick but you know that you were there he looked ill monk lowered his eyes he knew what colman meant he had tasted something of it in his own nightmare it was strange an almost irrelevant reality to hear colman say that monk had been there he knew it far more urgently and terribly from the nightmare of his hidden mind what caused it he said aloud colman looked up slowly they never found out but it wasnt the new track that was perfectly good at least as far as anyone could tell the last vestige of blood drained out of his face and his body stiffened oh no you dont think its going to happen again please godno is that what youre afraid of it is what katrina harcus was afraid of monk replied but ive searched everything i can ive walked the track myself and i cant see anything wrong with it at all tell me mr colmanhow can i prove this fraud its happened againand i still cant see it colman looked at him with intense pity i dont know do you think if i did i would have stayed silent all these years whoever it hurt i would have spoken i simply dont know monk stared at him helplessly his mind caught like a runner through the breaking surf feeling the tide drag at his feet taking away his balance and still no sense came out of it look for the bribe colman urged thats all it can be monk did not argue as to whether there had been a bribe or not colman had long ago made up his mind he stayed a little longer then thanked colman and left walking more easily with lighter feet one old enmity had been exorcised now he would not dread seeing colmans face in his dreams but he had not found that one fact which he was convinced would let him unravel all the others from the fasttied knot of his memory there was something which he dared not bring back because of the pain and yet until he knew what it was and faced it all the rest was just beyond his reach he had the courage to look at it and the will in his conscious mind but that tiny part of him which looked too deep to touch which knew what it was still held it just beyond his reach was it defying him or protecting him he went back to london through derby checking once more on the original route before the alteration and seeing exactly whose land it had crossed there was a large and wealthy farm it would have cut in half making it impossible to have taken cattle from one side to the other effectively ruining the unity of it it would also have sliced through a spinney of trees one of the best in the area for drawing a fox a favorite place of the local hunt would it have needed bribery to divert the track a mile or two through unused land on the whole he thought not it seemed the obvious thing to do not to would have been an act of vandalism and earned a dangerous enmity among the people of the nearest town was any of this really a crime was it even a sin worth caring about more than with a passing regret michael dalgarno was a worthless man in his relationship with katrina he had taken her love while it suited him and then cast her aside when a financially better prospect had presented itself in livia baltimore but that was not a crime either a sin certainly but one many men were guilty of as men had married for beauty so many an empty woman had married for wealth none of that was motive for dalgarno to have murdered katrina to conceal fraud was certainly but where was the fraud none that monk could prove it was all only suggestion and suspicion monk remembered the letter with his own name in it that he had removed from katrinas his hand stung as if it had burnt him had he left it there it would be he that runcorn was after now and were it anyone other than runcorn with as much certainty of his guilt of course hes guilty runcorn said indignantly when monk went straight from the station to see him and report his failure as always his office was crowded with papers but they were all neatly stacked as though studied and dealt with he was too busy to offer monk tea anyway he seemed to regard him now as a colleague rather than a guest he looked at him skeptically and with some disappointment the fact that you still didnt bring back any proof of the fraud doesnt mean hes innocent he said grimly it just means he hid it too well for you to uncover presumably he learned from dundass mistakes two farms or estates or whatever you said yes monk replied stiffly and if id been planning that line you wouldnt have had to bribe me to divert around a hill rather than go through it if it meant not vandalizing a stretch of land like that and you think dalgarno is the same as you do you runcorn lifted his eyebrows in a mixture of surprise and disbelief monk hesitated the question had been meant sarcastically but he realized how much truth there could be in it there was a physical resemblance increased by their similar selfassuranceone might say arrogance the love of good clothes a certain grace of movement if the witnesses to katrinas death had really seen someone on the roof if their descriptions fitted dalgarno they would just as easily fit monk plenty of people had seen him with katrinaask anyone in the botanic gardens and to an onlooker they could have appeared to be quarreling with a chill in the pit of his stomach monk remembered how she had put her hands up and grasped his coat pulling off the button he knew when it had been tornbut she had died with it in her hand why what was she doing still holding it so long after without the motive dalgarno was no more proved guilty than was monk himself perhaps the evidence against dalgarno was just as rooted in chanceor mischance monk runcorn said loudly are you saying dalgarno was like you monk returned to the moment with a jolt somewhat he answered somewhat like you runcorn said amazement showing in his face that monk was considering it seriously monk felt himself on the brink of a precipice and pulled back superficially he answered already his mind was enmeshed in other thoughts farther into his own doubts and necessities only superficially he wanted to excuse himself as soon as he could he was feeling more and more impelled to see rathbone it was imperative perhaps it was almost too late now there isnt anything more he said aloud youll have to trust your prosecution sorry runcorn grunted i suppose i should be grateful that you tried he had to wait an hour and a half before rathbone was free to see him it was a wretched time far too long to sit and consider the difficulty and the embarrassment of what he must do when eventually rathbone came and he was conducted into his familiar elegant office he began without preamble michael dalgarno has been charged with murdering katrina harcus but the proof depends on his having a motive he said bluntly of course rathbone nodded looking at monk with sharpening interest they knew each other well enough for him to be aware that monk would not be there to say something so obvious nor would he be so tense his body tight his voice on edge were it not of acute personal importance even pain to him the relationship between them was deep at times troubled by rivalry between the smooth socially and intellectually confident rathbone who nevertheless lacked emotional courage and the arrogant uncertain monk who looked and behaved almost like a gentleman yet had the inner passion to commit his heart win or lose and was now so desperately afraid that after all the effort the change the hope it would be lose rathbone was regarding him gravely waiting for him to explain runcorn assumes it was because katrina had proof of his being involved in fraudulent purchase and sale of land for baltimores railway line to derby he began i thought so too but ive searched as thoroughly as i can even comparing all the dealings with the fraud in baltimore and sons in liverpool sixteen years ago when i worked for the banks concerned myself he saw rathbones slight start of surprise concealed almost instantly but i can find no proof he went on certainly not sufficient to hang a man for murder rathbone looked at his hands then up at monk exactly what was your involvement in the first fraud as much as you know he asked now was the time when only the naked truth would do any evasion might come back as guilt like a knife to destroy whatever good was left arrol dundas the man who taught me everything i knew and was almost a father to me was accused of buying land cheaply and then selling it at huge profit after falsifying the surveys so the railway would divert its course he replied he was found guilty and died in prison it was odd put so baldly devoid of the reality of passion that had made it acutely and irrevocably painful it sounded like a legal issue not peoples lives torn apart best to add the ugliest part of that now get it over and while he was in prison there was one of the most terrible rail crashes in history a coal train collided with an excursion train full of children rathbone was so moved by his own imagination of the horror of it that for a moment or two he did not speak i see he said at last his voice low enough to be almost inaudible and did it have anything to do with the fraud not that i could tell it was attributed to human errorpossibly both driver and brakeman proof rathbone raised his eyebrows very slightly none no one ever knew for certain but navvies have never been known to build a faulty track there are too many checks too many skilled people involved i see and was dundas guilty of the fraud or was it someone still alive now dalgarno not dalgarno he would have been a schoolboy sixteen years ago i dont know whether dundas was guilty i was certain he was innocent at the time at least i think i was his eyes did not leave rathbones i fought to get him acquitted and i can remember the grief and the sense of helplessness when he wasnt but rathbone probed gently like a surgeon with a knife and like a knife it hurt but i cant remember i feel guilty about something i dont know whether it was because i couldnt help in liverpool just now i looked into his financial affairs as far as i could with no authority he was very wealthy while i knew him and up until the time of the trial he was supposed to have made a profit out of the land deal rathbone nodded naturally one presumes that was part of the evidence of fraud what about it he died with very little this time monk did not look at rathbone as he said it he sold his large house and his widow lived extremely modestly in a far less salubrious area when she died she left nothing she had lived on an annuity which ended with her death and you dont know where the money went monk looked up no i dont ive done everything i can to remember been to the places again read the newspapers and it still wont come what are you afraid of rathbone spared him nothing perhaps that was as necessary as a doctor pushing to see where it hurt most could he lie at least about this what was the point he had to tell rathbone that he had burnt the letters which implicated himfalsely and there could be others saying that that i did know at the time he replied i was executor of his will he must have trusted me rathbone did not stay his hand at all although the reluctance the hurt at having to do it was in his voice could you have taken this money yourself i dont know i suppose so i cant remember monk sat forward staring at the floor all i can see clearly in my mind is her face his widow telling me he was dead we were in a very ordinary house small and neat i didnt have the money but i dont know if i did something with it ive racked my mind but i just dont remember i see rathbone said gently and if dundas were innocent as you thought at the time then was the truth that there was no fraud or that someone else was guilty i think thats the difference monk said straightening up slowly and meeting rathbones eyes sixteen years ago there was definitely fraud the grid references on the survey map were altered if it wasnt dundas then it was someone else possibly nolan baltimore why rathbone interrupted if dundas profited personally why would baltimore have forged a survey report i dont know it makes no sense that i can see monk admitted defeated again it closed in on him on every side but i dont believe there was fraud this time the track was rerouted but dalgarno didnt own the land if there was illegal profit then it was bribery in order to change the route and not divide farms or estates and placed as they are anyone could have done that out of a sense of preservation of the land without being bribed to rathbone stared at him his face very grave monkwhat you are saying is that dalgarno had no reason that you know of to kill this woman if he had no motive and no one saw him do it then there is no evidence to tie him into the crime at all there is a little monk said slowly very distinctly hearing the words drop like stones irretrievable he must tell rathbone all of it there is the paper katrina harcus left accusing him but she also left one which on the face of it accuses me and the button now it would be impossible to retract rathbone would force him to tell the whole truth button rathbone frowned she died with a mans coat button in her hand torn off in the struggle why the devil didnt you say so now rathbones face was keen his eyes alight that ties him in completelymotive or not no it doesnt monk said flatly even at this awful moment aware of the bitter humor of it rathbone opened his mouth to speak then sensed something deeper and beyond words and said nothing i met her in the botanic gardens earlier in the day monk went on she was very distressed and still passionately convinced that dalgarno was guilty we more or less quarreled about it at least that is what it would appear to be to any onlookers and there were many rathbone leaned forward a little across the desk concentrating intensely monk felt hot and then cold he was shivering she grasped at me as if to demand my attention then in pulling away she tore the button off my coat it was my button in her hand several hours later when fighting with her murderer rathbone said softly monk are you telling me the whole truth if i am to defend you i need it monk looked up at him slowly dreading what he would see i came to ask you to defend dalgarno he said ignoring rathbones surprise i think he may be innocent either way i need him to be defended to the best of anyones ability if he hangs i have to be certain beyond any doubt at allreasonable or otherwise that he killed her i am more concerned about keeping your neck out of the noose rathbone said earnestly you knew this woman you were seen to quarrel with her the day of her death and your coat button was in her hand and you didnt tell me what happened to the letters which incriminated you i took them monk told him runcorn asked me to show him the rooms where she lived i saw them before he did i took them and burnt them when i got home rathbone let out a long sigh i see and to whom were these letters written someone called emma but i dont know anything else except that she did not live in london i went backhe saw rathbone wince and ignored itand looked for more an address book but i didnt find one were they regular correspondents monks voice was hoarse i dont know he did not mention the diary no one had heard about it and he clung to the tiny thread of hope that somehow it would still tell him something about katrina which could provide a link however fragile and there was something of her dreams in it he wanted to protect perhaps if he were honest that was it i see rathbone repeated softly and you are afraid your actions will hang a man who may be innocent that was not a question he knew monk well enough for it not to need to be monk looked at him steadily yes please he may have his own barrister already rathbone warned but i will do everything i can i promise you monk started to say youve got to and realized how foolish that was he was asking a favor for which he could not pay perhaps an impossible one thank you he said instead rathbone smiled slightly like a moments sun on a winter landscape then let us begin if dalgarno did not kill her and you did not then who did do you have any idea at all no monk said simply it was the bare truth he realized how very little he knew about katrina harcus he could have described her to the minutest detailher hair her face her remarkable eyes the way she moved the inflections of her voice he could have told rathbone what she had worn almost every time he had seen her but until the day of her death he had not even known where she lived let alone where she came from or anything of her daily life her family or her past rathbone tightened his lips for a second then with an effort forbore from making any comment on monks gullibility perhaps if he considered it he knew as little about some of his own clients well then the first thing you can do is find out everything else you can about her and as rapidly as possible he said bleakly go wherever it takes you but report to me every day he knew he did not need to emphasize that monk stood up rathbone had been light in his condemnation saying nothing of criticism or blame but monk knew him well enough to be aware of his thoughts he felt as crushed by the mere fact of them as if they all had been put into speech rathbone handed him the funds he would need thank you monk accepted hating it whether rathbone would get any of it back from dalgarno was still an open question but monk could not afford to refuse he had no idea where his search would take him not only would dalgarnos life depend on it but his own conscience his identity and if things came to the worst his life too if it seemed dalgarno would be convicted then he would have to tell the court of the paper he had found at katrinas rooms and destroyed and show them that the coat button was his then how could even rathbone save him from the rope and yet he was innocent perhaps dalgarno was also i need to start with dalgarno himself he said aloud get me an interview with him the clock had struck nine by the time monk stood in the newgate cell rathbone sitting to the side in the only chair dalgarno pale and unshaven paced back and forth restlessly his face already haggard from the shock of realization that ahead of him lay the possibility of the gallows i didnt kill her he said desperately his voice rising close to breaking monk kept his own emotions icily under control it was the only way to approach thinking with any clarity then someone else did mr dalgarno he replied no jury will acquit you unless you provide them with an alternative i dont know who did for gods sake dalgarno cried out wildly do you think id be standing here in prison if i did he stared at monk as if he were a complete fool monk felt a pity for him and a guilt for his own part in it but he also could not like the man he had treated katrina harcus badly whether he had killed her or not hysteria wont help he said with chill logic is the only thing that may what do you know about her and please tell me everything and the truth whether it is flattering to you or not your life may depend upon it it is no time for protecting your reputation or your vanity dalgarno glared at him then at rathbone rathbone nodded almost imperceptibly i met her at a garden party dalgarno began his tone now subdued she was charming full of life i thought she was the most interesting woman i had ever seen but i knew nothing of her social background except that she was obviously wellbred and had sufficient means to dress in the height of fashion who were her friends monk asked dalgarno rattled off half a dozen names they meant nothing to monk but he saw rathbone register recognition maybe one of them killed her dalgarno said desperately i cant think why but god knows i didnt why would i i didnt want to marry her and she seems to think i did he colored faintly but there was no fraudi swear he waved his hands jerkily we may have shaved a little here and there but everyone does monk did not comment on that it was irrelevant now that is precisely why i need to know more about her mr dalgarno someone killed her where did she come from what about her family i dont know dalgarno said impatiently we didnt discuss it but you were intending to marry her monk pointed out as an ambitious young man surely you enquired dalgarno blushed i i believe she came originally from the liverpool area she said both her parents were dead it made excellent sense the fraud she had accused dalgarno of practicing was almost an exact copy of the one for which dundas had been convicted had she grown up in the liverpool area she could have heard of it and of the crash she had told monk about with such horror he asked other questions but for a man who had claimed to be in love dalgarno knew surprisingly little about her but then monk recalled with brutal honesty how little he had known or cared about some of the young women with whom he had thought himself in love perhaps it was because he had known hester since the first months after the accident and she had crowded all others out of anything but the surface of his mind she was real they were only idealizations he had thought he wanted had dalgarno been like that with katrina harcus if he had monk could not blame him for it there was little point in asking dalgarno about their relationship he would say what he wanted them to believe and there was nothing against which to check it what about your own family mr dalgarno he asked did you introduce miss harcus to them surely your mother enquired perhaps she would know more about her dalgarno looked away my family are in bristol my father is in poor health unable to travel and my mother does not leave him but you and miss harcus could travel monk argued dalgarno swiveled around his eyes angry i did not ask miss harcus to marry me he snapped she may have imagined i was going to but women do that especially if you give them cause to monk said equally sharply dalgarno opened his mouth as if to deny it then closed it again in a thin line monk could learn nothing more of use in the end he left the overpoweringly oppressive air of the prison and walked side by side with rathbone along newgate street neither of them mentioned a like or dislike for dalgarno or the fact that he had shown no pity for katrina harcus no remorse that he had used her badly liverpool rathbone said succinctly if it has anything to do with her past it will begin there the police will be looking into everything in london so dont waste your time with that honestly monk i dont know what you are looking for monk did not answer he did not know either but to admit it seemed like a surrender he could not afford when monk reached fitzroy street the house was empty but he had been there not more than ten or fifteen minutes when hester came in in a whirl of excitement her face lit when she saw him and she dropped her parcel of shopping on the table and went straight to him as if she had no flicker of hesitation that he would take her in his arms he could not help himself from doing so clinging onto her hard feeling the strength of her answering embrace she pulled away and looked up at him william i have solved the murder of nolan baltimore at least in part i dont know exactly who did it but i know why he could not help smiling we all know that my darling we always knew ask any bootboy or peddler he didnt pay his bills some pimp took exception and there was a fight not quite she said like a displeased governess that is only an assumption i told you there is a brothel where one partner hands money to respectable young women who have got into debt for one reason or another yes you did what has that to do with it he was the partner she said then seeing the disgust in his face i thought youd think so he lent the money and squeaky robinson ran the brothel but baltimore was a client as well that was why he was killed for taking his tastes too far one of the girls rebelled and pushed him out of a topfloor window squeaky had the body moved to abel smiths place have you told the police no i had a much better idea she was glowing with satisfaction he had a sinking dread that he would have to destroy it better he said guardedly yes i have burnt the ious and put squeaky robinson out of business we shall take over the premises without rent and the young women there can nurse the others who are sick or injured you did that he said incredulously how well not by myself indeed his voice rose in spite of himself and whose help did you enlist or would i very much prefer not to know oh it is perfectly respectable she protested margaret ballinger and oliver what he could not grasp it she smiled up at him and kissed him gently on the cheek then she told him precisely what they had done ending with an apology im afraid it doesnt help with the railway fraud it doesnt have anything to do with it no he agreed but there was a tiny spark of pride warm inside him i have to go back to liverpool for that oh then in turn he told her what runcorn had said it isnt proof is it she agreed but they must have rerouted the track for some reason and miss harcus said they were expecting an enormous profit which must be kept secret she looked at him very steadily what are you going to do it made it easier for him that without question she assumed he was going to do something go back to liverpool he replied try to find out exactly what mistakes arrol dundas made that he was caught he saw her eyes widen and heard her indrawn breath let out again without speaking for this case he replied not the past she relaxed and smiled he went back to the same lodgings in liverpool where he now felt familiar even welcome the first thing was to find if katrina harcus had been born here it would be in the early s to judge from her age that was just before the compulsory registration of births so it would be a matter of finding a record of her baptism in a local church there was nothing to do but go from one parish to another enquiring he telegraphed rathbone to that effect it took him four weary and tedious days to find the entry in the records of a small gothic church on the outskirts of liverpool katrina mary harcus her mother was pamela mary harcus her father was not listed the inference was obvious illegitimacy was a stigma from which few recovered he felt a stab of pity as he saw the solitary entry he stood in the faintly dusty aisle where the sunlight fell in vivid jewel patches from the stainedglass windows watching the parish priest walking towards him perhaps it was not so surprising that katrina had left home and gone to london where she was unknown even friendless to seek some future better than the taint of being a bastard which would follow her everywhere here did you find it the minister asked helpfully yes thank you monk replied does mrs harcus still live in the parish the reverend riders bland pleasant face filled with sadness no he said quietly she died nearly three months ago poor woman he sighed she used to be such a charming creature full of life full of hope always saw the best in everything never the same after he checked himself just before speaking after her benefactor died he finished was that a euphemism for her lover katrinas father were things hard for her after that monk asked solicitously he was affecting pity for the vicars sake ordinarily he would have felt it but at the moment he simply could not afford the emotional energy to let it fill him as it should yes yes rider pursed his lips and nodded his head to be alone in failing health and with little means is a hard thing for anyone people can be very unkind mr monk we tend to look at our own weaknesses with such charity and other peoples with so little i suppose it is because we know the fierceness of the temptation to our own and all the reasons why that exception to the rule was understandable with other people we know only what we see and even that is not always the truth monk knew more exactly what he meant than the vicar could have known his loss of memory had forced him to see his own actions with that partial and outward eye mostly through the lens of others and understanding nothing to be judged that way was acutely painful he could feel closing on him the threat of answering for wrongs committed in a time he could not remember and as if by another man he had tried so hard to shed the old ruthlessness the indifference was the past not now going to allow him that but he had no time for indulgence of his own feelings however crowding and urgent yes he agreed to avoid the appearance of abruptness it is a narrowness common to most of us perhaps a little time being judged instead of judging would be a salutary thing rider smiled perceptive of you mr monk do you know who her benefactor was perhaps the father of her daughter whom i knew and attempted to help with a particular problem she was seeking to address knew rider said quickly catching the past tense i am afraid she is dead monk did not have to pretend the grief and it was more than guilt that he had not prevented it it was a loss for someone who had been full of passion and urgency much of which he had shared even though she had not known it rider looked crushed a great weariness filled him oh dear i am sorry he said quietly she was always so very full of life was it an accident no monk risked the truth she was murdered he stopped as he saw the shock in riders eyes almost as if he had walked into something unseen and without any warning found himself bruised and on the floor im sorry monk apologized i should have told you less frankly i am concerned because i fear they may have arrested the wrong man and there is little time to learn the truth how can i help monk was not sure but he asked the obvious question who was her father and how long ago did she leave here about two years ago rider answered frowning in concentration and her father monk pressed rider looked at him ruefully i dont see how it can have anything to do with her death it was many years ago all those involved are dead now even poor katrina allow them to rest in peace mr monk if they are dead monk argued then they cannot be hurt by it i will tell no one unless it is necessary in order to save the life of a man who will be hanged for killing her and may be innocent rider sighed his face crumpled with regret im sorry mr monk but i cannot break the confidences even of the dead you already know from the baptismal record more than i would have told you apart from my personal regard these people were my parishioners and their trust was my charge if the young man is innocent then the law will find him so and for poor katrinas sake find the one who was guilty perhaps for his sake also although it is not ours to judge he took a long deep breath i am deeply sorry to hear of her death mr monk but i cannot help you monk did not pursue it he could see in riders gentle sad face that his conviction would not waver i am sorry to have brought you such news he said quietly thank you for your time rider nodded good day mr monk and may god guide you in your quest monk hesitated steeling himself and turned back mr rider did katrina have a friend named emma his heart was beating so wildly he could feel it lurch inside him he saw the answer in riders face before he spoke not that i am aware of i am sorry to my knowledge there was only herself and her motherand her aunt eveline austin but she died some ten or twelve years ago but of course i shall mention her death in church next sunday and no doubt word will pass he smiled sadly bad news so quickly does monk swallowed his mouth dry he could feel everything precious all the life he knew infinitely precious slipping away like water between his fingers and there was nothing he could do to hold on to it are you all right mr monk rider said anxiously you look a little unwell i am so sorry to be of of so little assistance no monk steadied himself this was an escape but he was far from free yet thank you you have simply told me the truth thank you for your time good day good day mr monk chapter eleven the arrangement with squeaky robinson at least so far was working very well it had been a major undertaking to move all the beds other furniture and medicines and equipment from coldbath square to portpool lane but the women who were now released from debt were mostly overjoyed to find a way of earning their living which was completely admirable and required of them no lies or evasions nor was there fear of being dismissed for not meeting with the moral standards of some mistress because of a past which must be hidden squeaky complained bitterly but hester believed that at least part of it was because he thought it was expected of him his most urgent concern was gone and he was immensely relieved even if he refused to admit it she had had great satisfaction in telling jessop that he would no longer be troubled by the questionable tenants in his coldbath house since they had found alternative premises which were larger and at better rentalin fact at no rental at alland would be leaving as soon as was possible a day or two at the most he had looked nonplussed it was an agreement mrs monk he protested you still owe a months notice you know no i dont she had said flatly you threatened to evict us and i believed you i have found another place as you said i should he had blustered and refused to pay back the rent for the week paid for but apparently not to be used she had smiled at him perhaps not as sweetly as she had meant to and told him it did not matter in the slightest which confused him that in turn had made him angry by the time the exchange was completed they had gathered quite an audience all very plainly on hesters side jessop had left enraged but knowing better than to make any threats it was not a neighborhood in which to incur enemies who might have more power than you did yourself and jessop knew his limitations whoever had given hester and margaret premises at no charge must have a good deal of money to waste and money was power they watched him go with immeasurable satisfaction bessie chortling with joy she also assured both hester and margaret that she could manage very well without them during the daytime once the trial of michael dalgarno began should there be an emergency she would send one of the local urchins for mr lockhart and then if that was still not enough for one of them as well however since there was still little business going on and the people of the streets were generally allied together against circumstances at least as long as this crisis lasted there was greater peace than usual among them constable hart also promised to give discreet assistance if such were needed hester thanked him profusely to his embarrassment and gave him a jar of black currant jam which he accepted taking it with both hands even bessie decided that perhaps he was an exception to the general rules about police so when the trial opened margaret hester and monk were all sitting in the public gallery dalgarno was whitefaced in the dock jarvis baltimore fidgeting unhappily a few rows in front of them livia silent and wretched beside him as mr talbot fowler began the case for the prosecution he was extremely efficient he called witness after witness to show that dalgarno was talented ambitious gifted with figures and that he was undoubtedly the one who had accomplished most of the land negotiations for baltimore and sons with regard to the londontoderby railway on the second day he demonstrated that dalgarno had paid court to katrina harcus albeit not as openly as he might have done they had been seen together quite often enough to substantiate her belief in his affection for her indeed two of the witnesses had expected them to announce an engagement within the month margaret sat beside hester leaning forward a little several times she seemed to be on the edge of speech and hester knew she was wondering why rathbone did not crossexamine the witnesses at least to appear to offer some kind of a defense it was only her care for rathbone which prevented her each time from putting her anxiety into whispered words it would seem like a criticism on the other side of hester monk was sitting equally tense his shoulders high and stiff his eyes strained forward he must be thinking the same thing but for entirely different reasons if rathbone failed for him it was far more than disappointment in someone with whom he was falling in love it would almost certainly mean changing places with the man in the dock and yet as fowler paraded one witness after another rathbone said and did nothing for gods sake monk said desperately that evening as he paced his sitting room floor he cant be going to let it go by default hes got to do more than just hope they cant prove it does he want to get accused of an incompetent defense he was ashenfaced his eyes hollow hes not doing that to save me is he no of course not hester said instantly standing in front of him not for me monk said with painful humor for you she caught his arm hes not still in love with me the more fool he he retorted hes in love with margaret she explained at least he soon will be he drew in his breath staring at her i didnt know that a flash of impatience crossed her face and disappeared you wouldnt she replied i dont know what hes going to do william but hell do somethingfor honor pride all kinds of things he wont let it go without a fight but rathbone was unavailable all weekend when hester went to fetch fresh milk on saturday morning monk snatched a few moments alone to look again at katrinas diary he hated doing it but he was desperate enough to grasp after any clue at all but he still could understand only fragments of it it was cryptic scattered words as if simply to remind herself of emotions the people who inspired them were so woven into her life she needed nothing more to bring them back to her nothing made a chain of sense he struggled with his own memory there was something just beyond his grasp something that defined it all but the shadows blurred and the harder he looked the more rapidly it dissolved into chaos leaving him dependent on the slow minute process of the law on monday morning when the trial resumed for the third day it looked as if letting go without a fight was exactly what rathbone was going to do monk hester and margaret all sat in an agony of impatience as fowler brought on the police witnesses first the constable called to the scene who found the body then runcorn who described his own part in the proceedings at last rathbone accepted the invitation now offered somewhat sarcastically to crossexamine the witness good gracious fowler said in amazement playing to the jury who until now had had nothing to consider but uncontested evidence superintendent runcorn rathbone began courteously you described your conduct in excellent detail you appear to have overlooked nothing runcorn eyed him with suspicion he was far too experienced at giving evidence to imagine a compliment was merely that thank you sir he said flatly and presumably you tried to find evidence proving that this cloak found on the roof from which miss harcus fell belonged to mr dalgarno naturally runcorn conceded and did you succeed rathbone enquired no sir mr dalgarno doesnt have a cloak yes sir but its not that one has he two then not that we can trace sir but that doesnt mean it wasnt his runcorn said defensively of course not he purchased this one secretly in order to leave it on the rooftop after he had thrown miss harcus off it to her death there was a nervous titter around the room several jurors looked confused jarvis baltimore reached across and slid his hand over livias if you say so sir runcorn replied blandly no no i do not say so rathbone retorted you say so i say it belonged to someone else who was on the roof and was responsible for miss harcuss death someone you never thought of trying to trace no one else had reason runcorn said calmly that you know of rathbone challenged him i will presently show you a completely different interpretation of circumstances superintendent one beyond your wildest ideas which you would never seek to prove because it is extraordinary beyond anything else i have ever heard and no man could be expected to think of it thank you that is all monk swiveled to look at hester his eyes wide i dont know she whispered back ive no idea the jurors were staring at each other there was a buzz of speculation in the body of the court grandstanding fowler said audibly disgust heavy in his voice rathbone smiled to himself but hester had a hideous fear that he was doing exactly that and that fowler was not blustering but knew it margaret sat with her knuckles white leaning forward a little fowler called his next witnessthe police surgeon of whom rathbone asked nothingand then began on the neighbors who had seen or heard something that evening rathbone glanced at his watch now and then what is he waiting for monk hissed i dont know hester said more sharply than she had intended what could rathbone hope for what other solution was there he had not shaken any of the testimony at all let alone suggested the alternative he had spoken of so dramatically they adjourned for the day and people trooped out into the halls and corridors hester overheard more than one say that they would not bother to return i dont know why a man like rathbone would take such a case one man said disgustedly as he began down the broad steps into the street theres nothing in it for him but defeat and he knows it he cant be doing as well as we thought his companion replied he knows his clients guilty the first man pursed his lips still id have thought hed try for the look of it hester was so angry she started forward but stopped as she felt the pressure of monks hand on her arm she swung around to face him what were you going to say he asked she drew breath to reply and realized she had nothing prepared that made sense she saw margarets misery and growing confusion hell fight she assured her because she knew how badly margaret wanted to believe it margaret made an attempt at a smile but excused herself to find a hansom home before facing the evening in coldbath square hester began the fourth day of the trial with a sinking heart she had lain awake in the night wondering whether to go to rathbones house and demand to see him but realized there was nothing she could learn that would help and certainly she had nothing to offer him she had no idea who could have killed katrina harcus or why she knew it was not monk and was less and less certain that it was dalgarno although she could not like the man looking at him through the days so far she had seen fear in his face in the hunched angle of his shoulders the tight lips and pallor of his skin but she had not seen pity for the dead woman nor had she seen any concern for livia baltimore who was growing more miserable with each new piece of testimony that showed how callously he had treated a young woman who had believed he loved her and whom all evidence showed deeply loved him in court in the morning she looked at livia her skin was pale and puffy around the eyes her body rigid and hester knew she was still clinging to hope but even if rathbone could somehow perform a miracle and gain an acquittal of murder for dalgarno was there anything on earth he could do to show him innocent of duplicity and opportunism fowler concluded for the prosecution hester slipped her hand over monks briefly it was easier than trying to find words when she had no idea what to say rathbone rose to begin the defense the public gallery was almost half empty he called the surveyor again fowler complained that he was wasting the courts time the surveyor had already testified in great detail the subject had been more than exhausted my lord rathbone said patiently my learned friend knows as well as the rest of us that i was able only to crossexamine him on the subjects already spoken of in direct examination can there possibly be any other subjects left fowler asked to a ripple of laughter from the crowd we already know far more about the building of railways than we need to or i imagine than we wish to possibly than we wish to my lord rathbone smiled very slightly not than we need to we have still reached no unarguable conclusion you are lawyers the judge said dryly you can argue any conclusion on earth however proceed sir oliver but do not waste our time if you appear to be talking for the sake of it i shall sustain mr fowlers objectionindeed i shall object myself rathbone bowed with a smile i shall endeavor not to be tedious or irrelevant my lord he promised the judge looked skeptical rathbone faced the surveyor when he had been duly reminded of his previous oath and had restated his professional qualifications mr whitney he began you have already told us that you surveyed both the originally intended route for the railway of baltimore and sons from london to derby and the route now taken is there a significant difference in cost between the two no sir not significant whitney replied what do you consider significant rathbone asked whitney thought for a moment above a few hundred pounds he replied at length hardly as much as a thousand a lot of money rathbone observed sufficient to buy several houses for an ordinary family fowler rose to his feet the judge waved him down again and looked at rathbone if you are intending to reach any conclusion sir oliver you have diverted further than the railway in question you would be better occupied justifying your own circuitous journey there was a titter from the crowd this at least was mildly entertaining they were happy to see rathbone baited he was better game than the accused who had long since lost any sympathy they might have felt for him rathbone took a deep breath and steadied his temper he acknowledged the judges remark and turned again to the witness stand mr whitney would it be technically possible to commit a far greater fraud than the one suggested here one worth several thousands of pounds by this same means of diverting a proposed route whitney looked startled yes of course it would this was only a slightly greater length a few hundred yards one could do far more to make money for example rathbone asked whitney shrugged buy land oneself prior to the rerouting and then sell it back at an inflated price he answered many things with enough imagination and the right contacts choose a stretch where a lot of construction was necessary bridges viaducts tunnels even long cuttings and take a percentage on materialsthe possibilities are numerous my lord fowler said loudly my learned friend is simply showing that the accused is incompetent even at fraud that is not an excuse there was open laughter in the room no one pretended not to be amused when it had died down rathbone turned to him i am attempting to prove that he is innocent of murder he said politely but with an underlying anger why is it that you seem unwilling to allow me to do that it is circumstances that are preventing you not i fowler returned to another rustle of laughter your circumstances rathbone snapped mine not only allow me to they oblige me to mr fowler the judge said very clearly sir oliver has a point unless you have some objection of substance in law will you cease from interrupting him or we are likely to be here indefinitely thank you my lord rathbone said ironically hester believed that he was in fact spinning out time but she had no idea what for what or whom was he expecting she felt the first sudden shiver of hope rathbone looked up at whitney you have given us examples of other ways in which a more efficient fraud could be perpetuated have you knowledge of any such fraudi mean a specific circumstance whitney looked slightly puzzled for example rathbone assisted him in liverpool almost sixteen years ago the company involved was baltimore and sons there was a falsification of a survey the grid references were changed fowler stood up again sit down mr fowler the judge commanded he looked at rathbone sternly i presume you have facts sir oliver be careful you do not slander anyone it is a matter of record my lord rathbone assured him a man named arrol dundas was convicted of the crime and unfortunately died in prison of jail fever but the details of the crime were made public at the trial i see the relevance to this present case may easily be guessed nevertheless we require you to prove it yes my lord i shall prove that records of it were kept by baltimore and sons therefore it was known to senior members of the present company even though they were not involvedin fact not even out of schoolat the time very interesting be sure that it is also relevant to mr dalgarnos innocence yes my lord rathbone drew out a few more details from whitney then excused him fowler looked as if he were considering asking him something then declined and whitney left the stand hester looked at monk but it was obvious from his tense white face and the confusion in his eyes that he did not know what rathbone was planning any more than she did he was frowning and staring at the court clerk busily taking notes his right hand bandaged fortunately he wrote with his left rathbone then called a junior clerk from baltimore and sons and drew from him the statement that the records of the earlier dealings were availablenot easily but a diligent search by a company member would elicit them all and was the case public knowledge rathbone said finally oh yes sir fowler tried to show that it was an abstruse piece of information never discussed and unlikely to come to the attention of dalgarno i couldnt say sir the clerk replied soberly i would think such things would be known sir even if only as an object lesson in what not to do fowler retreated i still say my lord that incompetence does not equal innocence he said tartly the crown does not say that the accused committed fraud well merely that he did it rathbone opened his eyes very wide if the crown wishes my lord i can call a number of witnesses to demonstrate that mr dalgarno was an ambitious and extremely able young man that he rose from a relatively minor position to become one of the partners the judge held up his hand you have already done so sir oliver we take the point that the nature of the fraud with which he is charged is far less efficient than the earlier example for which mr dundas was found guilty the only thing relevant to this case appears to be the fact that the earlier case may well have been known to mr dalgarno and one wonders why he did not emulate it if fraud was his intention so far you have not completed your task please be succinct yes my lord rathbone recalled the foreman of the team of navvies who had worked on the derby line and drew from him greater and more tedious detail of the cutting and blasting necessary to drive a track through a hillside coupled with the labor and cost of building a viaduct he could equally easily have asked jarvis baltimore but the navvy was not only more skilled in detail he was demonstrably impartial the court did not bother to hide its total lack of interest they adjourned for luncheon monk told hester to go with margaret and he would join them later unwillingly she obeyed and he strode forward shouldering his way through the crowd moving in the opposite direction until he was standing in front of the court clerk excuse me he said trying not to be abrupt and yet his voice was sharp the man made an effort to be civil he was still trying to catch up with his notes his writing was cramped awkward and with an odd backward slope monk felt a strange dizziness in his mind as if there was something familiar about it could his idea be right yes sir the clerk said patiently what did you do to your hand monk asked him i burned it sir the clerk blushed very slightly on the cooking stove you were writing with your other hand yesterday werent you yes sir fortunately i can write with either hand not so neatly but itll do thank you monk said with a surge of understanding like a blaze of sunlight he could picture exactly the odd characteristic capitalg s ande s in katrinas diary and sloping back but still the same in emmas and suddenly the inscription in the recipe bookeveline mary m austinemma she had loved katrina and katrina had kept her alive in her imagination by writing to her and even from her using her left hand it was a painful and eccentric thing to do and even with the explanation it troubled him at the beginning of the afternoon there were even fewer people in the public seats i call miss livia baltimore rathbone said to an immediate hiss of speculation and distaste livia herself looked startled as if she were unprepared but there was interest again from the crowd several jury members straightened in their seats as she made her way across the floor of the court and climbed the steps to the stand pulling herself a little on the handrail as if she needed its support i apologize for putting you through this ordeal miss baltimore rathbone said gently were it avoidable i would not do so but a mans life hangs in the balance i know she said so quietly it was barely audible the slight rustle of movement in the body of the court ceased as if everyone were straining not to miss a word i will do anything i can to help you prove that mr dalgarno did not do this terrible thing and your testimony will assist me greatly he assured her if you tell the exact truth as you know it absolutely exact please trust me in this miss baltimore i do she whispered the judge asked her to speak more loudly and she repeated it i do rathbone smiled i imagine you have a natural sympathy for miss harcus she was young like yourself not more than four or five years older and very much in love with a charming and dynamic man you must know how she felt her whole future before her full of promise she swallowed convulsively and nodded i am sorry but we need you to speak rathbone said apologetically yes i do she said huskily i can imagine it very well have you ever been in love miss baltimore even if it had not yet reached more than a matter of understanding between you fowler was on his feet my lord that is completely irrelevant to the issue of this court and it is grossly intrusive miss baltimores personal feelings have no place here and should be respected by the judge flapped his hand at him impatiently yes yes mr fowler sir oliver your point or you may continue no further on this rambling excursion of yours my lord rathbone looked up at livia miss baltimore has mr dalgarno paid court to you please do not be modest or discreet to the detriment of the truth trust me and do not oblige me to ask other witnesses to refute any denial made in the effort to protect your reputation there is nothing to be ashamed of in someones paying court to you even professing love and asking you for your hand in marriage her face was scarlet but she looked directly at rathbone yes mr dalgarno has done me the honor of asking me to marry him we are simply not in a position to make the matter public so soon after my fathers death it would be insensitive and wrong there was a gasp of breath around the court now at last rathbone had their attention the judges eyes opened very wide and he shook his head slowly from side to side not in denial but in surprise fowler rose to his feet and then before anyone directed him sat down again just so rathbone said when the noise permitted him not to mention the death of his previous fiancée who heard of his change of heart only weeks earlier but still kept her own passionate feelings toward him i assume miss baltimore that although she must have been made aware of you you were not aware of her hester looked across at dalgarno and saw the tight desperate look in his face he had to see the jurors increasing contempt for him in law to have deceived and discarded a woman unless there were a promise was not an offense but he also knew that logic does not always override emotion he shot a look of pure loathing at rathbone which had he seen it should have scorched his tongue into silence livia looked as if rathbone had struck her the blush faded from her face leaving her ash pale struggling to catch her breath michael wouldnt kill her she gasped he wouldnt but it sounded more like a plea than an assurance no miss baltimore rathbone agreed loudly and very clearly of course he wouldnt he had no cause to wish her harm merely to desire that she leave him alone to pursue a more fitting bride did you ever see her in your home after the time mr dalgarno began to court you she shook her head her eyes brimming with tears no rathbone repeated for her or in any public place seeking to embarrass or pursue mr dalgarno no she whispered in fact you were unaware of her interest in him at all yes i was thank you miss baltimore that is all i have to ask you fowler shook his head this is irrelevant my lord we are chasing ghosts all my learned friend has demonstrated is dalgarnos abandonment of his commitment to a relatively poor woman when a richer one gave him hope that he might woo her successfully no my lord rathbone contradicted him i am showing the court that miss harcus had every reason to feel desperately betrayed by a man she loved and whom she had sincerely believed loved her that with other facts i shall also bring witnesses and documents to prove will explain what happened on the night of her death and why and it will show that mr dalgarno had no intentional hand in it he is guilty of no more than abusing a womans love which i regret to say is something many men have done and walked away from it is regarded by most of us as contemptible but not as criminal then do so sir oliver the judge instructed you have still some way to go yes my lord rathbone said obediently he was bluffing hester knew it with certainty a coldness gripped her a witness if you please sir oliver the judge said plaintively let us proceed we still have at least an hour before we may reasonably adjourn yes my lord i call mr wilbur garstang we have already heard from mr garstang at some length fowler protested we have already heard from everybody at some length yourself included the judge retorted please keep your interruptions to the minimum mr fowler sir oliver is there really anything mr garstang can do beyond fill the time yes my lord i believe so rathbone answered although there was surely more truth in the judges comment than he could afford to admit call wilbur garstang the judge said wearily mr garstang climbed the steps and was advised by the judge that he was still under oath he was a precise little man with a carping attitude and an inclination to pick fault i have already told you what i observed he said to rathbone looking down at him over the top of his goldrimmed eyeglasses indeed rathbone agreed but i wish to reestablish it in the minds of the jury with rather a different emphasis you are an exact and acute observer mr garstang that is why i chose you to speak yet again i apologize for the inconvenience no doubt it causes you garstang grunted but a look of satisfaction smoothed out his features a little he did not consider himself susceptible to flattery in which he was profoundly mistaken i shall do my best garstang said straightening his lapels a trifle and assuming an expression of readiness rathbone hid a smile but he was tense even his movements lacked their usual grace thank you mr garstang you were at your window on the night of miss harcuss death would you please remind us of the reason for this certainly garstang nodded my sitting room is opposite her rooms and very slightly below the stories of the house in which my apartment is situated being a foot or two less in height i heard a noise as if someone were crying out in case that were so and they were in need of assistance i went to the window and drew the curtains so that i might see just so rathbone cut across him now would you tell us exactly what you did see as precisely as if you were painting a picture please do not tell us what you believed or have since heard that it was i realize that this is difficult and takes a very exact and literal mind oh really fowler groaned garstang shot a look of acute dislike at him he felt insulted cut short and dismissed before he had even begun please mr garstang rathbone encouraged it is of the utmost importance indeed someones life is at stake garstang assumed an attitude of intense concentration and held it until the court was silent then he cleared his throat and began i saw a dark shape on the balcony opposite it seemed to heave and change outline violently and to move from the open doorway across towards the edge it surged back and forth for several moments i cannot tell how long because i was horrified by the prospect of the tragedy about to happen why was that rathbone said you asked me to be literal garstang said crossly i described to you exactly what i saw but it was perfectly obvious to me that it was two people struggling with each other one intent upon hurling the other off the balcony onto the stones beneath but you did not see two separate figures rathbone asked i did not they were locked in mortal combat garstangs voice was schoolmasterly as to a particularly stupid child if he had even once let go of her she might have escaped him and we should not be here to see justice done after the event let us remember that we are here to see justice done rathbone reminded him not to exercise our personal feelings you have described what you saw very precisely so far mr garstang did you see a figure go off the balcony and actually fall yes of course i did that is when i left the window and ran out of the room and down the steps to see if i could help the poor woman or on the other hand apprehend her murderer garstang replied rathbone held up his hand just a moment mr garstang i am afraid i need you to be more precise than that i apologize for what must be distressing to any decent person i assure you i would not do it were there any other way fowler stood up my lord this witness has already told us in overlong detail what he saw my learned friend is flattering i am not flattering the witness at all my lord rathbone cut across mr garstang may be the only man who observed exactly what happened and is capable of telling us not what he has since concluded but what actually was if you do not have a point sir oliver i shall not indulge you again the judge warned proceed but be brief the relief in rathbone was visible even from where hester sat but she had no idea why she could see nothing whatever changed she glanced at monk and saw equal confusion in his face rathbone looked up at garstang mr garstang you saw her go off the balcony you are sure it was she who went off there was a moment of silent incredulity then a rush of sound a babble disgust laughter anger garstang stared at him disbelief giving way to a slow terrible memory the noise in the room subsided even fowler sank back into his seat monk craned forward hester sat with her hands clenched i saw her face garstang said hoarsely i saw her face as she fell white she was he shuddered violently she was between murder and death he put both hands up to his eyes i apologize mr garstang rathbone said gently and with sudden sincerity that was like a warmth in the room he was speaking for an instant only to garstang not the court but your evidence is the key to the whole terrible tragic truth and we all thank you for your courage of the mind sir you have saved a mans life today fowler stood up and swiveled around as if looking for something that was not there rathbone turned to him and smiled your witness mr fowler for what fowler demanded he has said nothing what on earth does it matter that he saw her face we all know it was she who fell he looked at the judge this is preposterous my lord sir oliver is making a farce out of a tragedy whether he is legally in contempt of court or not morally he is i am inclined to agree the judge said with apparent reluctance sir oliver you have certainly caught our attention but you have proved nothing i cannot allow you to continue in this manner we have the public in our courts in order that they may see that justice is done not as a form of entertainment i shall not allow you to yield any further to the temptation to become a performer in spite of your obvious talent in that direction there was a murmur of nervous laughter around the court rathbone bowed as if contrite i assure you my lord i shall shortly show how the fact that mr garstang saw her face is of the utmost importance are you questioning her identity the judge said with amazement no my lord if i may call my next witness you may but this testimony had better be relevant or i shall hold you in contempt sir oliver it will be my lord thank you i call the reverend david rider hester heard monks gasp of indrawn breath and saw him lurch forward in his seat margaret turned to stare at hester and then at monk the question in her face hester looked at her helplessly the court watched in silence as the vicar climbed the steps up to the witnessbox his hands gripping the rail as if to steady his balance he looked tired but worn out by emotion rather than any physical effort his skin was pale and puffy around the eyes and he looked back at rathbone as if there was some profound understanding between them of more than grief some overwhelming burden of knowledge which they shared rider swore to his name his occupation and his residence on the outskirts of liverpool why are you here mr rider rathbone asked gravely rider spoke very quietly i have been wrestling with my conscience ever since mr monk came to see me over a week ago and i have come to the conclusion that my greater obligation is to tell that part of the truth that i know regarding katrina harcus my duty to the living is too great to deny in order to protect the dead there was a slight rustle of movement in the court and then total silence hester looked across at dalgarno as did several of the jurors but they saw only complete confusion you knew katrina harcus rathbone asked from her birth rider replied fowler shifted in his seat in apparent discomfort but he did not interrupt then i presume you also know her mother rathbone said yes pamela harcus was my parishioner you say was rathbone observed is she now dead yes she died some three months ago i i am glad she did not live to see this indeed mr rider rathbone bowed his head in acknowledgment of the tragedy of it did you also know katrina harcuss father not personally but i knew of him then without waiting for rathbone to ask he added his name was arrol dundas monk let out an involuntary cry and hester reached out and put her hand on his arm feeling the muscles hard underneath her touch the judge leaned forward is this the same arrol dundas who was convicted of railway fraud sixteen years ago sir oliver yes my lord let me understand you the judge continued was she his legitimate daughter or illegitimate rathbone looked at rider in the witnessbox illegitimate my lord rider replied what has that to do with her death fowler demanded we all know that illegitimacy is a stigma that ruins lives the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children whether we wish them to be or not but it is irrelevant to her death poor creature it excuses nothing it is not offered as an excuse rathbone said tartly he turned back to rider to your knowledge was katrina aware of her fathers identity most certainly rider replied he provided handsomely for both pamela harcus and her daughter he was a wealthy man and not ungenerous she knew both him and his colleague who apparently regarded her as if she were his niece he was a man her fathers age i presume rathbone said as closely as i could judge rider agreed but in spite of this her father could not legitimize her rathbone went on rider looked even more unhappy he moved his weight slightly and his hands swollenjointed gripped the railing of the box it was obvious that he still struggled with revealing such information which in his view was private and painful hester looked at monk seeing in his face the crumbling of disillusion the fighting for memory hunting for any bright shards to redeem the darkness that was closing in she ached for something to help him but there was no shelter or balm for the truth he could have rider said so quietly that the silence became even denser as everyone strained to catch his words it was perhaps a dishonorable thing to do his wife was in no way at fault to leave her in her middle years would be barbarous a breaking of the covenant he had made in his marriage but it would not have been impossible men do put away their wives with money and lies it can be achieved but arrol dundas did not rider looked wretched he intended to he was very torn his wife had no children pamela harcus had given birth to one and might have had more but he had a protégé a young man whom he regarded almost as a son who in the end persuaded him not to i daresay it was for mrs dundass sake monk was so white hester was afraid he was going to faint he seemed scarcely to be breathing and was oblivious of her fingers gripping his arm she did not even glance at margaret do you know his name rathbone repeated yes it was william monk rider replied monk very slowly put his hands up to his face hiding it even from hester rathbone did not turn but he could not have been unaware of the effect the words would have i see he said and do you know if either pamela harcus or katrina was aware of who stopped their financial comfort and far more than that their honor their legitimacy their social acceptance katrina was only a child perhaps seven or eight years old rider answered but pamela was aware that i know for certain it was she who told me but i did verify it for myself i spoke to dundas did you try to change his mind of course not all i said was that he should be certain to make financial arrangement for them in the event of his death he swore to me that he had already done so so they were financially supported after he died riders voice dropped until it was almost inaudible no sir they were not they were not rathbone repeated rider gripped the railings no arrol dundas died in prison for a fraud i personally do not believe he committed but the proof at the time seemed unarguable but his will rathbone argued surely that was executed according to his decisions i imagine so the provision for pamela and katrina must have been a verbal one perhaps to protect the feelings of his widow she may have known of them or she may not but since a will is a public matter it would be deeply hurtful for them to be mentioned rider replied he looked down at his hands it was a written note or so he told me a personal instruction to his executor who was rathbone stared at him not for an instant turning towards the gallery where monk sat whitefaced and rigid his protégé william monk rider said not the colleague to whom you referred earlier rathbone asked no he trusted mr monk uniquely i see so all the money went to dundass widow no not even she received more than a pittance rider answered him dundas was a rich man at the time of his trial when he died a few weeks later he had barely enough to provide a small house and an annuity for his widow and that ceased upon her death there was a low rumble of anger in the room several people turned and glared at monk there were ugly words catcalls silence the judge shouted banging his gavel with a loud crack of wood on wood i will not have this unseemly noise in here you are to listen not to make judgments any more of this and i shall clear the court the sound subsided but not the anger in the air hester moved closer still to monk but she could think of nothing to say she could feel the pain in him as if it were communicable like heat on the other side of her margaret put her hand gently on hesters it was a generous moment of friendship then unless someone else assisted them i assume that pamela and katrina harcus lived in extremely straitened circumstances after dundass death rathbone asked relentlessly extremely rider agreed i am afraid there was no one else to assist them her aunt eveline austin was also dead by this time i see just one more thing mr rider would you be good enough to describe katrina harcus for us if you please describe her for the first time rider looked puzzled until now he had understood everything with tragic intimacy but this escaped him if you please what did she look like as exactly as you can tell us rathbone insisted rider floundered a little he was obviously uncomfortable with the personal details of such a thing she was she was quite tallfor a woman that is she was handsome very handsome in an unconventional way he floundered to a stop what color of hair had she rathbone asked oh dark dark brown with a sort of shine to it her eyes ah yes her eyes were unusual very fine indeed sort of golden brown very fine thank you mr rider i appreciate that this has been very difficult for you indeed both because it concerns the tragic death of a woman you knew since her infancy and because it required you to speak publicly of matters you would very much prefer to have kept in confidence he turned to fowler still not looking up at monk or hester beside him your witness sir fowler regarded rider shaking his head slowly a sad but not uncommon story has any of it got anything whatsoever to do with michael dalgarno having thrown her off the roof of her house i do not know sir rider replied i had assumed that was what we were here to decide from what i have heard from sir oliver i believe it may well from what we have heard from sir oliver it is simply a piece of very moving but totally irrelevant tragic theater fowler said dryly the poor woman is dead they both are and arrol dundas and his wife also and all except katrina herself were gone before the crime which brings us here do i assume that means you have no questions to ask mr fowler the judge enquired oh i certainly have a question my lord but i doubt mr rider is in a position to answer it fowler said tartly it iswhen is sir oliver going to address the defense of his client i am addressing something a little higher but which will answer the same purpose my lord rathbone said and perhaps hester was the only one in the room who could hear the edge of tension in his voice even through her own fear and her agony for monk she knew that rathbone was afraid also he was gambling far more than he could afford to losemonks life still lay in the balance rathbone was traveling at least partially blind she felt the heat rush through her and then the chill the truth rathbone finished i am trying to uncover the truth and before fowler could do more than sound a jeer he went on i call william monk my lord chapter twelve it was a moment before monk even registered what rathbone had said william hester whispered anxiously monk rose to his feet he had to be aware of the enmity of the court hester could feel it in the air see it in the eyes and the faces of those who turned to watch him make his slow almost stumbling way forward across the open space of the court and up the steps of the witness stand rathbone faced him without expression as if he were controlling himself with such an intense effort not even ordinary contempt could escape it i have little to ask you mr monk simply for you to tell the court how katrina harcus was dressed when she met you on the several occasions you reported to her your progress regarding your search for evidence of fraud my lord fowler said in an outburst of exasperation this is preposterous monk looked equally baffled his face was as white as dalgarnos in the dock and the jurors were staring at him as if they would as willingly have seen him there alongside the accused if you please rathbone said urgently at last his own nearpanic breaking through were her clothes good or poor did she wear the same things each time no monk said quickly as if breaking out of his stupor at last she dressed very well indeed i wish i could afford to dress my wife as well hester closed her eyes wrenched inside with anger pity helplessness fury with him for caring about something so trivial and saying so in public it was no one elses business to know that and she paid you appropriately for the work you did for her rathbone went on now monk looked surprised yes she did have you any idea where the money for this came from no no i havent thank you that is all mr fowler i am as lost as everybody else fowler said with rising temper the judge regarded rathbone grimly this raises several unanswered questions sir oliver but i do not see how they bear any relevance to the poor womans death it will become clear my lord with the evidence of my final witness i call hester monk she did not believe it it made no sense what on earth was rathbone thinking of monk was staring at her on her other side margaret was pale with fear her lips red where she had bitten them her loyalties were tearing apart in front of her and she was helpless to control any of it hester rose to her feet her legs trembling she walked unsteadily forward between the rows of people feeling their eyes upon her their loathing because she was monks wife and she was furious with them for their blind judgment but she had no power to lash out or to defend him she walked across the open space telling herself over and over again to trust rathbone he would never betray friendship not for dalgarno nor to win a case nor for anything else but what if he truly believed dalgarno was innocent and monk was guilty honor came before any friendship you do not let the innocent hang for anyone not anyone at all she climbed up the steps holding the rail just as rider had done she reached the top gasping for breath but it was not from the physical effort which was nothing it was from the tight suffocation in her lungs because her heart was beating too hard too fast and the room was swimming around her she heard rathbone saying her name she forced herself to concentrate and answer to state who she was and where she lived and to swear to tell the truth all of it and nothing else she focused on rathbones face in front and a little below her he looked exactly as he always had long nose steady dark eyes sensitive mouth full of subtle humor a clever face but without cruelty he had loved her deeply not so long ago as a friend surely he still did he was speaking she must listen is it true mrs monk that you run a charitable house for the medical treatment of prostitutes who are ill or injured in the general area of coldbath square yes why on earth had he asked that you have recently moved premises but on the night of the death of mr nolan baltimore was that house actually in coldbath square yes were you and miss margaret ballinger in attendance there that night yes we were fowler was getting noticeably restless rathbone very deliberately ignored himindeed he kept his back towards him with some effort mrs monk he continued were there any women who came to your house injured on that night she had no idea why he asked was it because he thought after all that nolan baltimores death had something to do with the railway fraud something monk had missed everyone was watching her waiting yes she answered yes there were three women who came in together and another two alone later on badly injured he asked not as badly as many one had a broken wrist she tried to remember clearly the others were bruised cut do you know how they came by their injuries no i never ask do you know their names fowler could contain his impatience no longer my lord this is all very worthy but it is a total waste of the courts time i it is vital to the defense my lord rathbone cut across him i cannot move any faster and make sense of it sense fowler exploded this is the worst nonsense i have ever heard in twenty years in courtrooms he stopped abruptly the judges eyebrows rose you may care to rephrase that observation mr fowler as it stands it is somewhat unfortunate on the other hand you may wish to allow sir oliver to continue in the hope that before tonight he may reach some conclusion fowler sat down do you know their names mrs monk rathbone asked again nell lizzie and kitty hester replied i dont ask for more than some way to address them and do you tell them more than that about yourself he asked the judge frowned do you rathbone insisted would those women have known who you were or where you lived for example please be very exact in answering mrs monk she tried to think back remembering nells banter her admiration for monk yes she said clearly nell knew she said something about my husband his appearance his character and she called me by name relief flooded rathbones face like sunlight thank you did they by any chance also know at least roughly the area in which you live yes roughly did anyone happen to mention mr monks occupation yes yes nell did she finds him interesting the judge looked at rathbone are you making any progress toward a point sir oliver i fail so far to see it i shall not allow this indefinitely i am my lord i apologize for the time it takes but if the whole story is not shown then it will not make sense the judge made a slight grimace and sat back rathbone returned his attention to hester did you continue to receive injured women in your house in coldbath square mrs monk yes was he seeking to expose the fact that baltimore had been the usurer in partnership with squeaky robinson but why his death had nothing to do with dalgarno or katrina harcus were any particularly severely injured rathbone pressed it must be what he was looking for yes she answered there were two in particular we were not certain if they would live one was knifed in the stomach the other was beaten so hard she had fourteen broken bones in her limbs and body we thought she might die of internal bleeding she heard the fury in her own voice and the pity there was a murmur of protest in the court people shifting uncomfortably in their seats embarrassed for a way of life they preferred not to know so much about and yet stirred to emotion in spite of themselves the judge frowned at rathbone this is appalling but this court is not the place for a moral crusade sir oliver justified as it might be at another time it is not a moral crusade my lord it is part of the case of the death of katrina harcus and how it came about rathbone replied i have not a great deal further to go and without waiting he spoke to hester again mrs monk did you learn how these women had been so badly injured yes they had been respectable women one a governess who married a man who put her into debt and then abandoned her they both borrowed money from a usurer in order to pay what they owed and when the debt to him could not be settled by honest means of work he forced them into the brothel in which he was a partner where they catered to the more unusual tastes of certain men she could not continue for the increasing sound of outrage and disgust in the courtroom the judge banged his gavel and then again slowly the sound subsided but the fury was still prickling in the air respectable young women with some education some dignity and a desire to be honest rathbone said his own voice rough with emotion yes hester replied it happens to many if they have been abandoned put out of a job and have no reference to character yes he cut her off did this cause you to take any action mrs monk yes she knew the judges tolerance would not last a great deal longer i was able to learn exactly where this brothel was and by means of questioning who the partner was who practiced the usury i never learned exactly who carried out the beatings or the knifing she did not know if he wanted this part or not but she added it does not continue any longer we were able to put the brothel out of business and turn the house into better premises for the coldbath refuge he smiled very slightly indeed what happened to the usurer he was killed did he want to know it was baltimore she stared at him and could not tell but his record of the debts he asked we destroyed it did you then know he was killed yes he was a client as well as the usurer he took his own tastes too far and one of the women who was new to the trade was so revolted by what he asked of her that she lashed out at him and he fell backwards out of the window onto the pavement beneath to his death there was a rumble of profound emotion from the courtroom someone even cheered order the judge said loudly i will have order i understand your outrageindeed i share itbut i will have respect for the law sir oliver this story is fearful but i still see no connection to the death of katrina harcus and mr dalgarnos guilt or innocence in the matter rathbone swiveled to face hester again mrs monk among those records did you find those of the young woman kitty who came to you with cuts and bruises on the night nolan baltimores body was discovered in leather lane near coldbath square yes was she among the oncerespectable young women who had been reduced to selling her body for a particularly repulsive type of abuse in order to pay the evermounting debt of such high rates of usury that she could never be free of it yes could you describe her for the court mrs monk what did she look like now she understood it was so terrible she felt sick the room swam around her as if she were at sea the silence was a roar like waves she heard rathbones voice only distantly mrs monk are you all right she clung onto the rails gripping them hard so the physical pain would bring her back to the moment mrs monk she was she gulped and licked her dry lips she was fairly tall very handsome she had dark hair and golden brown eyes very beautiful she gave me the name of kitty and the records said kitty hillyer rathbone turned very slowly to face the judge my lord i believe we now know where katrina harcus obtained the money to dress as well as was necessary for a handsome but penniless young woman born illegitimate left destitute when her father died and his promised legacy did not come she traveled south to london to try and make a fortunate marriage however within the space of two months her mother died her fiancé rejected her for a richer bride and her debts became so urgent she was drawn into the most repellent form of prostitution to satisfy the usurer her fathers colleague a man she had known as a child and to whom she had turned for help in a strange city and who had so betrayed her perhaps because of who he was his demands revolted her so intensely that she fought him off to his death the judge commanded silence in the growing swell of fury within the room but it was several long seconds before he received it so intense was the wave of emotion in the room he nodded to rathbone to continue and that very night when she was taken by two other prostitutes to coldbath square to have her own injuries treated rathbone resumed facing the jury now who should be the nurse who helped her but the wife of the man who was in her mind the author of her grief all the injustices against her from childhood she heard the name of mrs monk and the description both of monks appearance and his nature and his new occupation i believe from that moment on she began to plan a terrible revenge a hideous unbelievable thought danced at the edge of hesters mind fowler stood up but did not know what to say no one was listening to him anyway hester could think only of monk dalgarno the jury even rathbone melted from her vision monk was sitting motionless his eyes wide and hollow his skin bleached of every vestige of color margaret had moved closer to him but she had no idea what to do to offer any word or gesture katrina harcus had nothing left rathbone said quietly but in the now total silence every word was clear her mother was dead the man she loved had deserted her and she had no hope of ever winning him back because there was only too obviously nothing to win he was incapable of love or even of honor she was in debt beyond her means ever to repay and she had sold her body to a particularly degraded form of prostitution from which she may well have felt she would never again be clean and now she was also guilty of a mans death she was wise enough in the ways of the world to know that society would see it as murder regardless of the provocation she endured or that she may not have intended him to die it would be only a matter of time before the police found her and she would live in fear of it for the rest of her life he spread his hands the one thing left for her was revenge and fate handed her the perfect opportunity for that when she found mrs monk in coldbath square she knew all about the original fraud in liverpool for which her father arrol dundas was convicted she created the impression of another fraud almost exactly like it knowing that monk would not be able to resist the temptation to investigate it the likelihood of his recognizing her was remote she had been a child of eight when he had last seen her if indeed he saw her at all he looked from the judge to the jury she took good care that they met in public where they would be observed by impartial witnesses she may have made certain monk would be there at her house in cuthbert street that night we can call mr monk to the stand to testify of that if necessary he drew in a deep breath and faced the judge again that my lord is the purpose of mr garstangs so very exact testimony he saw her face as she fell inspector runcorn described her on the ground on her side not her back no one saw two distinct figures and the cloak was left on the roof my lord because she was not thrown or pushed offshe jumped he was momentarily prevented from continuing by the uproar of amazement disbelief and horror that engulfed the room but it faded quickly as the terrible truth sank into understanding and then belief when he resumed his voice fell into utter silence my lord michael dalgarno is innocent of murder because there was no murder at least not of katrina harcus when she went off the roof of her house and plunged to her death as for the night she killed nolan baltimore we shall he was prevented from saying whatever he had intended by livia now lurching to her feet her face gray thats not true she screamed thats a wicked thing to say its a lie her voice choked in a sob an evil terrible thing to say my father she lashed her arms left and right as if fighting her way through some physical obstacle my father would never have done anything like that its its filthy its disgusting i saw those womenthey were the tears were streaming down her face they were broken bleeding whoever did that was monstrous rathbone looked wretched he struggled for something anything to say to ease her grief but there was nothing left that cant be how he died livia went on turning from rathbone to the judge he quarreled dreadfully with michael and jarvis that night she said desperately it was over the railway again the huge order we have for the new brakes theyve invented michael and jarvis did it together and papa only found out that night my lord he flew into a terrible rage and said theyd ruin the company because years ago mr monk had forced him to sign a letter promising he would never manufacture the brakes again hed paid a fortune to silence somebody but the price was that nobody would ever use them monk shot to his feet wheres jarvis baltimore he shouted at livia where is he she stared at him the train she said chokingly the inaugural run monk said something to margaret then looked at hester once where she still stood in the witnessbox then he scrambled past the people next to him and ran up the aisle and out of the door the judge looked at rathbone do you understand sir oliver no my lord he turned to the witnessbox hester the rail crash sixteen years ago she answered i think i think he knows what caused it now she looked at livia im sorry i wouldnt have told you i wish you hadnt had to know most people get to keep their secrets livia stood for a moment the tears running down her cheeks then slowly she sank to her seat and buried her face in her hands im so sorry hester said again she hated nolan baltimore as much for what he had done to his own family as for the injury to katrina and alice and fanny and the other women like them they might recover she did not know if livia would rathbone looked at dalgarno white and bitter in the dock then to the judge my lord i move that the charges against the accused be dropped katrina harcus was not murdered she took her own life in a desperate attempt to achieve the only thing she believed was left to herrevenge the judge looked at fowler fowler swiveled around to stare at the jury then back at the judge i concede he said with a shrug god help her outside the courtroom the street was almost empty and it took monk only five minutes to find a hansom and scramble in shouting to the driver to take him to euston station as fast as the horse would go an extra pound was in it for him if he made the inaugural train on the new line to derby monk would willingly have given him more but he had nothing else to spare he must keep what he had in case he had to bribe his way onto the train the cabbie took him at his word and with a yell of encouragement at the horse and a long flick of the whip practically between its ears set off as if on a racetrack it was a hairraising journey with several close shaves where they missed other vehicles by inches and more than once pedestrians leaped for their lives some hurling abuse as they went the cab pulled into the station and lurched to a stop monk thrust the money at the driver because he felt the man deserved it whether they had made the train or not and sprinted to the platform actually he was there with more than five minutes in hand he straightened his jacket ran his hand over his hair and sauntered up to the door of the rearmost carriage as if he had every right to be there without glancing around to see if he had been observed which could have given away his lack of invitation he pulled the handle swung the door wide and climbed in the inside of the carriage was beautifully furnished it was a long train but only first and secondclass this was second and still of a luxury to be admired no doubt jarvis baltimore would be in the firstclass since his fathers death this was his train his entire enterprise he would be busy talking to all the various dignitaries making this journey boasting to them of the new track the new carriages and perhaps of the new braking system with its fatal weakness although presumably he did not know the full truth of that there would be several stops along the route monk would make his way forward on each of them until he found jarvis he nodded to the other people in his compartment then sat down on one of the polished wooden seats there was a jolt somewhere ahead the whistle blew and the carriage jerked forward and again then settled into gathering momentum billows of steam drifted past the windows there were shouts from outside and cries of excitement and triumph from the other compartments and through the open windows of the carriages ahead someone called out a toast and yelled hooray monk settled in for the journey expecting the best part of an hour to elapse before he had an opportunity to find baltimore but they were on double track all of that distance he knew the route probably as well as baltimore himself the train was gathering speed the gray streets and roofs of the city were sliding away there were more trees open land there were foot warmers in the compartment one close by him but he was still cold in fact he started to shiver there was nothing he could do about baltimore until the first stop his mind was filling at last with the knowledge he had forced from it since the moment he had realized about the brakes and that it could happen again there had been no murder of katrina harcus at least not from the roof in cuthbert street he could see her face with its brilliant eyes as if she were in the seat opposite him but nothing was the same as it had seemed it was clear now she had orchestrated the whole thing with passion and extraordinary skill even to tearing the button off his coat and clasping it in her hand when she felljumped it made him cold to the pit of his stomach to know that she had hated him enough to leap deliberately into the darkness and crash breaking her body on the stones beneath into the abyss of death and whatever lay beyond it simply to know that he would be destroyed with her and how close she had come to succeeding it was a dark and fearful thing to be hated so deeply by another human being it could never be retrieved because she was dead he could not explain himself tell her why soften any of the tearing wounding edges and she was arrol dundass daughter that was an indelible wound never to be eased away he sat huddled avoiding the eyes of the other man in the compartment until the first stop then he got out as did everyone else when the whistle blew for the next leg of the journey he got into one of the firstclass carriages and moved from compartment to compartment through the polished wood the warmth the soft seats but baltimore was not there he got out again at the next station and moved forward and at the next time was getting short he felt a flutter of panic he found him at last in the front carriage he must have gone forward also to speak to every one of his guests indeed he was talking to a portly gentleman with a glass of champagne in his hand monk must attract his attention if possible in a manner which would not cause embarrassment he moved discreetly until he was close enough to grasp baltimore s arm by the elbow firmly so he could not brush him off baltimore turned to him startled by the pain he recognized monk after a seconds hesitation and his face hardened mr baltimore monk said levelly staring at him without blinking i have news for you from london which you need to hear as soon as possible i think privately would be best baltimore took his meaning and was eager not to mar his moment of triumph with an awkward interview excuse me gentlemen he said with a smile that did not reach his eyes i will only be a moment please enjoy yourselves accept our hospitality he turned to monk saying something under his breath as he half pushed him out of the door into an unoccupied compartment of the carriage they were in what the devil are you doing here he demanded i thought by now theyd be questioning you on dundas s money or is that what youre doing attempting to escape his face hardened well im damned if ill help you my father told me on the night of his death how you tried to put him out of business what was that for revenge because he exposed dundas i tried to save hundreds of liveswithout putting you out of business monk said between his teeth he kept his grasp on baltimore s arm for gods sake just hold your tongue and listen we havent much time if liar baltimore snarled i know you made my father sign a letter that he would never manufacture the brakes again what did you threaten him with hes not an easy man to frighten what did you do to him he snatched his arm away from monks grip well you wont frighten me ill see you in jail first why do you think your father agreed to it monk demanded containing his temper with intense difficulty as he stared at baltimore s arrogant angry face and felt the train sway and jolt beneath them as it gathered speed hurtling towards the long incline and the viaduct beyond just because i asked him i dont know baltimore replied but i wont give in to you your father never did favors for anyone monk said between his teeth he stopped manufacturing the brakes after the liverpool crash because i paid to have the enquiry return a verdict of human error not to ruin the company but on condition he signed that letter never to make them anymore he startled himself with the clarity with which he remembered standing in nolan baltimores magnificent office with its views of the mersey river and seeing baltimore sit at his desk his face red his head shaking with shock and fury as he wrote the letter monk dictated and then signed it the sunlight had been streaming across the floor picking out the worn patches on the lush green carpet the books on the shelves were leather bound the wood of the desk polished walnut this was the piece at last this was it it made sense of it all now jarvis baltimore stared at him his eyes round and wide his chest heaving as he fought for breath he gulped and tried to clear his throat what what are you saying that the liverpool crash he stopped unable to put it into words yes monk said harshly there was no time to spare anyones feelings the crash was due to your brakes failing there were two hundred children on that excursion train he saw the blood drain from baltimore s skin leaving it pasty white and there must be a hundred people on this one order the driver to stop while you still can what money baltimore argued struggling to deny it shaking his head how would you get enough money to silence an enquiry thats absurd youre trying i dont know whyto cover yourself you stole dundas s money you had charge of it all you didnt even leave anything for his widowdamn you dundas s money monk tried not to shout at him they were both swaying back and forth now the train was gathering speed fast he agreed to it you dont think i would have touched it otherwise do you the man was in jail not dead i gave them all there was apart from the little bit for her but hellit wasnt much it took almost everything there was to make them keep silent on the truth baltimore was still fighting it dundas was a fraudster hed already cheated the company of no he wasnt the truth was there at last bright and sharp as daylight breaking he was innocent he warned your father that they hadnt tested the brakes well enough but nobody listened to him he had no proof but he would have got it only they framed him for fraud and after that nobody believed anything he said he told me but there was nothing i could do either it was only his word and by then he was branded baltimore shook his head but the denial died on his lips it took all the money i could scrape together monk went on but it saved the companys reputation and your father swore hed tar dundas with the same brush if i didnt succeed we couldnt sue the driver better he be blamed than everyone put out of work we took care of his family he felt a stab of shame but that wasnt good enough it wasnt his fault it was your fathers and now youre going to do the sameunless you stop this train baltimore shook his head more fiercely his eyes wild his voice highpitched but were supplying those brakes all over india theres tens of thousands of pounds of orders he protested recall them monk shouted at him but first tell the driver to stop this bloody train before the brakes fail and we come off the viaduct will will they baltimore said hoarsely they worked perfectly well when we tested them im not a fool they only fail on an incline with a certain load monk told him shards of memory falling into place more vividly every moment he could remember this same feeling of urgency before the same rattle of wheels over the rail ties the roar of movement steel on steel the knowledge of disaster ahead most of the time theyre excellent he went on but when the weight and the speed get above a certain level and with a curve in the track then they dont hold this is a far heavier train than usual and theres exactly such a place just before the viaduct ahead we cant be far from it now dont stand there for gods sake go and tell the driver to slow up then stop go on i dont believe it it was a protest and a lie it was clear in baltimore s frantic eyes and dry lips the train was already gathering speed they were finding it harder to stand upright even though baltimore had his back against the carriage wall are you sure enough of that to risk your life monk asked his voice ruthless im not im going with or without you and he backed away almost losing his balance as he turned and started towards the other compartments and the front of the carriage next to the engine baltimore jerked around and plunged after him monk charged through the next compartment scattering the few company men along for the inaugural ride they were too startled to block his way he felt a wild exhilaration unlike anything he had known in years he could remember dreadful as some of the memory was filled with pain and grief with helplessness and the knowledge that dundas was innocent and he had not saved him it was no longer confusion it was as clear as the reality of the moment he had failed dundas but he had not betrayed him he had been honest he knew that not from evidence or from other peoples word but from his own mind he was in the next compartment pushing through the men who were angry at his intrusion the train hurtling through the countryside toward the incline and the single track of the viaduct brought back the time before when he had been on that other train as if it had all been only weeks ago he remembered dundas telling him how he had tried to persuade nolan baltimore to wait test the brakes more carefully and baltimore had refused there was no proof only dundas s fear excuse me excuse me he cried more sharply they parted for him one caught at his sleeve whats wrong he said anxiously feeling the carriage pitching from side to side nothing monk lied excuse me he jerked free and went on forward baltimore on his heels now then dundas had been accused of the fraud and monk had forgotten about brakes in the fear and dismay of trying to prove his innocence but there was too much evidence carefully placed dundas was tried convicted sent to prison less than a month later there had been the crash a day exactly like this one another train roaring through the peace of the countryside belching steam and sparks blindly careering toward a death of mangled steel and blood and flames monk had realized it all but it was too late to do anything but save what he could out of the pieces and stop baltimore from doing it again dundas had been more than willing to give everything he owned to stop it that was it the last piece falling into place sickeningly making monk halt where he stood at the end of the carriage behind the engine baltimore a step behind knocked against him and all but drove the air out of his lungs he had not known it at the time he had handed the money to baltimore to bribe the enquiry he had known it afterwards when it could not be undone it was not to protect dundas s reputation or the baltimore company although that mattered a thousand men and their families nolan baltimore had said he would implicate monk in the faulty brakes it had been his signature on the banking forms that had provided the money for their development it had been to save monk that dundas had been prepared to sacrifice everything he had left as he lunged forward forced open the carriage door against the onrushing air and stepped out onto the narrow ledge at the side clinging to the door frame it was more than the wind the steam and the smuts that stung his skin and his eyes it was an agony of memory a sacrifice a loss the price of his own escape from ruin and prison as well he turned to see how far he had to inch along the carriage until he could scramble onto the plates that connected the carriage to the coal wagon and the engine baltimore was screaming something behind him by then dundas had understood what the price was he might even have felt the jail fever in his bones and known he would die there certainly he knew the hatred of the injured and the bereaved after the crash blame for it would have destroyed any man dogged him for the rest of his life poverty was a small price in comparison perhaps he trusted that his wife would have borne that lightly compared with monks ruin he might even have discussed it with her maybe that was why she had smiled even as she wept for him when she told monk of his death he must move the train was still increasing speed if his hand slipped if he lost his hold on the door frame he would be dead in seconds he must not look down the countryside was a blur like something seen through a rainsmeared window he started to inch along moving his hands then his feet it was not far to the front of the carriage two yards maybe but they were the longest two yards on earth there was no time to delay no time to think he put one hand along as far as he dared and stretched his foot to grip he let go with the other hand and jerked his body forward the carriage swayed and he slipped and grasped again he almost fell onto the footplate behind the coal wagon the sweat breaking out on his body until his clothes were cold and wet against his skin he turned to see baltimore teetering on the edge white with terror and shot out his hand to haul him in baltimore s knees crumpled and he sank down onto the plate the noise was indescribable monk gestured toward the coal wagon baltimore clambered to his feet waving his hands hell never hear us he shouted desperately his hair flying whipped about his head his face wildeyed wind stung already splotched with smuts monk waved at the coal wagon again and moved toward it you cant baltimore screamed at him shrinking back against the carriage wall i damn well can monk yelled and so can you come on baltimore was plainly terrified of the thought of struggling to climb up the wagon into the loose coal and trying to crawl on hands and knees over it in the teeth of the choking steam as the train careered over the rails growing faster and faster lurching from one side to the other the long slope was steepening ahead of them and monk could see the sweep beyond and down to the viaduct as if it were in his minds eye he swiveled around to face baltimore is there anything else due on this line he shouted driving his hand the other way to illustrate his meaning baltimore put his hand up to his face now ashen gray he nodded very slightly like a man in a nightmare he stepped forward swayed righted himself and put his hands onto the coal wagon it was a more powerful and terrible answer than any words could have been monk followed after him scrambling up onto the rough lumps of coal and feeling the wind batter him and the wagons bucket around like a ship at sea the stoker turned shovel in his hand his mouth fell open at the sight baltimore his fair hair streaming back his face fixed in a grimace of terror was clambering over the coal toward the engine a yard behind him monk followed more agile the stoker threw down his shovel and lunged toward baltimore baltimore screamed something at him but the sound was torn from his lips the stoker came forward hands outstretched the train was going ever faster as the incline steepened monk made a desperate effort to claw himself forward and catch up with baltimore the coal rolled underneath him a large lump unsettled and fell sideways and he slid after it narrowly missing injuring his shoulder against the mound above he heaved himself up disregarding his torn hands and threw his weight forward baltimore was almost on top of the stoker monk yelled at him but his voice was drowned in the roar and crash of steel on steel and the howl of the wind baltimore fell forward and the stoker went down with him monk hauled himself up and swung around to land on his feet the brakeman was staring at him his face streaming sweat as he struggled with the lever and felt it yield the driver was coming toward them waving his arms suddenly monk knew what to do he had done it before hurling his weight and his strength against the brakes and feeling them rip out just as they were now he knew exactly what it was and the memory of it turned him sick with terror only then he had been in the rear wagon of the train and the impact had thrown him off to roll over and over bruised and bleeding down the slope but alivewhile the others died that was the guilt that stabbed through his mind with painhe had survived and they had notnot one of them they had all been crushed in that inferno of flame and steel stoke he yelled with all the power of his lungs he swung his arms he understood now what they must do the only chance the brakes are gone theyre no use go faster behind him baltimore and the stoker were struggling to their feet he swiveled around stoke he mouthed to baltimore faster he swung his arms baltimore looked terrified the stoker made to move forward and catch monk and restrain him physically baltimore charged at him the two of them rocked and swayed as the train roared through the gathering dusk pitching like a ship in a storm monk picked up the fallen shovel and started to heave more coal into the boiler it was already yellow hot at the heart and the blast from it scorched his face but he threw in more and then more they had to pass over the viaduct before the other train came it was the only chance nothing on earth could slow them now baltimore was shouting behind him waving his arms like a windmill the stoker was stupefied suddenly his kingdom was invaded by madmen his train was screaming through the twilight like a rocket on fire and the singletrack viaduct lay ahead with another train due on it in minutes then at last the brakeman understood he had felt the brakes tear out and knew how useless it was to hurl his weight or strength against them anymore he picked up the other shovel and worked beside monk they were going faster ever faster the sound was deafening like a solid thing against the head the heat seared the skin burned the eyelashes and still they threw the coal on until the stoker grabbed monk by the arm and pulled him back he shook his head he held his arms across his chest then flung them wide monk understood any more and the boiler would explode there was nothing to do now but wait and perhaps pray they were going as fast as any engine on earth could take them sparks were flying in the air steam like clouds tore from the stack and shredded in the wind the wheels on the track were one continuous roar the viaduct was in sight and the next moment they were on it monk looked at baltimore and saw the terror in his face and a kind of jubilation there was nothing now but to wait either they would make the end of the single track in time or there would be a crash that would explode and send the wreckage a thousand yards in every direction until there was nothing human left to find on the rocks below the breath was torn from their lips the wind burned and stung with ash smuts red sparks like hornets their clothes were torn and singed the noise was like an avalanche falling but monk had been right dundas was innocent the brakes were as he had said he had paid a terrible price for it but knowing it willing it to save a young man he had loved profoundly selflessly and without limitlove greater than katrinas hate to be held in the heart forever and now his name would be vindicated there was a darkness an even greater noise and something rushed by them so quickly it was gone before monk even realized they were on double tracks again it had been the train in the other direction they were safe around them the other men let off a cheer but he could hear nothing of it only see in the furnace light their upraised arms and the triumph in their blackened faces the driver staggered back against the wall the controls barely in his grasp the stoker and the brakeman clasped each other jarvis baltimore held out his hand and monk took it thank you baltimore mouthed thank you monk for the past and the present monk found himself grinning idiotically and could think of nothing at all to say anyway he could not have spoken his voice was choked with tears
