geoffrey jenkins hunter killer easy is the descent into the dark deeps but to retrace your way and issue into spacethere is the toil and there is the task virgil aeneid commander geoffrey peace r n geoffrey peace was dead i could not believe it for three days ever since a naval officer had enquired mr john garland and handed me that agonizing message from the flagship i had not believed it even when the ominous shape covered by a tarpaulin had been brought alongside in a launch by a naval party my mind rejected the thought but now there could be no doubt i stood looking through the glass trap in the coffin lid into the hard face of the man who had been so much a part of my life commander geoffrey peace royal navy dso and two bars death had not softened the cleanshaven face the strong jaw with the cruel line of the mouth was held shut by the black rubber divingcap he had worn at the time of his death they had dressed the body again in the underwater suit its cowled effect brought no feeling of sanctity but rather one of evil ori told myself in hurried excuse for the deadthe desperate rejection of any hope of afterlife like the wild keen of a pipers lament in the outer isles geoffrey peace should not have died like this i thought angrilyto be hauled from a few feet of water with heart failure automatically my eyes sought the hands which had sent so many other men to their deaths but they were hidden all the peaces had died hard a strange resentment welled inside me that this one should have met his end so tamely after so violent a life simon peace his grandfather had gone to meet his maker with the cry of the sea and england on his lips old sir john peace his piratical ancestor who had terrorized the indian ocean had been cut in half on his own quarterdeck by a tripleshotted broadside but geoffrey peace who was in the full glare of the public spotlight in britain and america because of his part in the controversial american navy missile project had died no more excitingly than an overfed businessman who drops dead after a dip at ramsgate now he lay slung atween the roundshot not old sir johns way perhaps but as near as they could get to it in this age when men had already stepped on to the moon for geoffrey peaces wasnt an ordinary coffin at all the coffin at which i looked was steel fashioned like a cylinder it might have been a section of torpedotube or more likely a length of discarded missilecasing from a cruiser in the bay no it couldnt be that i realized bending closer the metal was riveted not welded and a missile needs a smooth bore i ran my fingers unseeingly along the line of greypainted metal studs perhaps if the sight of my dead comradeinarms had not affected me so greatly i might then have suspected something of the secret which was to shock the world and the united states in particular the sound of a powerful jet engine overhead jerked my attention away from the dead mans face here were the top brass coming to pay their last tribute to geoffrey peace the plane circled the anchorage peace was lying in state aboard his own luxury motoryacht bellatrix in the bay backed by palmfringed islets i could see the american seventh fleet a magnificent array of fighting ships among them were two of the new shenandoahclass nuclear subs replacing the first polarisfiring george washington class which had become obsolete in the early s to the northeast lay the royal navys new limuria squadron a crack taskforce which had again raised the navys battle ensign of glory after the long starved years of the fifties and sixties it did my sailors heart good to see the lean deadly silhouette of two lochclass cruisers loch vennachar and loch torridon complementing the american submarines were the british devastationclass nuclear subs bellatrix was at anchor in port victoria mahe island largest of the seychelles group in the northern indian ocean the seychelles a square mile agglomeration of islands atolls cays and coral reefs lie about onethird of the way between east africa and india this group stands at the head of another immense chain stretching away boomerangshape for over miles to the southeast the northern pivot is mahe and the southern mauritius these islandsoften no more than a fringe of coconut palms round a strip of sand a few feet above waterlevelhave been named collectively limuria they are inhabited by fewer than people spread over tens of thousands of square miles of sea the islands are believed to be the last visible peaks of a drowned continent which once lay between africa and australia the inhabitantsdescendants of pirates natives and slavesspeak creole a tongue which has mutated as far from its original french as have the strange animals of limuria from their african homologues limuria is a nevernever land of soft tropical islands and languor a surfeit of sweetness among the endless palms lagoons of breathtaking loveliness at dawn and sunset here some years ago britain had established her big missile base i screwed up my eyes against the afternoon sun and watched the big jet bank round mount howard mahes northern tip and circle over the densely wooded ravines and peaks which back port victoria i lost it momentarily then it reappeared from behind morne seychellois the highest peak in the island to make its landing approach i turned away from it sick at heart dreading it for what it represented the publicity ordeal of peaces funeral with myself as the chief mourner what secret did that hard face hold below the glass the secret which he had summoned me to tell and yet for reasons which had died with him had held back for one week a week which was to prove his last on earth my eyes searched the dead face tried almost to get beyond the halfclosed lids to find out what was it all about i kept asking myself as i had done while we had raced towards the seychelles from mauritius where we had met i had sought the answer then but in life peace was not the man to be approachednot even by his closest friendif he did not want to be approached i saw now that his tense highly nervous state in the days preceeding his death was not as i thought due to the weight of his secret but was caused by the shadow of the heartattack which had killed him the superficial explanation he had given for asking me to come all the way to mauritius from south africa was of course a blind that was clear to me soon after our meeting i had left the royal navy to take charge thanks to my knowledge of navigation of the head office of naccam an advanced commercial air and sea navigational system in johannesburg under my supervision we had installed navigational aids for ships and aircraft round the southern strategic tip of africa peace had cabled me asking if i would meet him to discuss the installation of a similar system in the islands of the indian ocean he had suggested mauritius as the rendezvous since the island is only six hours by jet from johannesburg peaces message came as a surprise to me for i had been out of touch with him for several years although his work in connection with the british missile mission to america had kept his name constantly in the news for months before his death peace had been the centre of a bitter controversy over an angloamerican missile british scientists had developed a small lightweight nuclear power plant for missiles and satellites the newspapers nicknamed it snapsystem for nuclear auxiliary power the motor according to the papers was considerably in advance of anything in america or russia peace had led a british technical mission to the united states offering the americans the new motor as a cooperative effort in space exploration britain made no secret of her pride in her invention and snap was equally well received in the united states its merits were endorsed by no less a man than marvin k green the brilliant young american astronaut and scientist who had become vicepresident mkg as he was popularly known had turned that rather stultifying office to splendid account as the representative of the new technocratic society which had sprung into being in the united states he had assumed the chairmanship of special projectsan independent body answerable to the president onlywhose function was the development of special american missiles special projects was enthusiastic about snap mkg and peace formed a close friendship and it seemed that a new bond in angloamerican relations was about to be forged thensuccess struck the americans launched two men davis and acton to the moon using a landbased air force sirius rocket staged from a spacestation orbiting round the earth these astronauts reached the moon but failed to return and were cremated in a shallow orbit round the earth the great american successa skyport was established on the moon itself by davis and actonkilled the new angloamerican project against the wishes of the president an economyminded congress scrapped it what point had it they argued now that there had been a successful landing on the moon peaceand to a lesser extent mkghad been publicly outspoken against the dropping of the project and peaces forthright views had made him the storm centre of the controversy in the united states i had thought peace to be in england when his cable arrived glad to go and eager to see my old friend i had been shocked at his tenseness when he met me at mauritius as the south africaaustralia jet landed he had hurried me aboard his luxury yacht bellatrixanother surprise for meand persuaded me that the place for the discussion with unspecified persons over the naccam installation was the seychelles we had sailed from mauritius within a few hours on the fourday trip apart from his tenseness the first indication i had of the impending shadow over peace was a diversion to a remote island group miles northnortheast of mauritius known as st brandon or cargados carajos st brandon is nothing more than a hellish group of islets and coral rocks with one tiny port on raphael island peaces excuse was that his ancestor sir john peace had used st brandon in the reign of charles ii as a base for piratical forays against shipping in the indian ocean peace made much of the fact that sir john had been the first englishman to chart the group to my astonishment he had insisted on spending days in an island boat charting the risky seaward passages of st brandons great mile coral barrier reef when i protested and pointed out that i had joined him to discuss a big business proposition he became withdrawn and angry i got no more out of him until we reached the seychelles where instead of going ashore at port victoria to discuss what i had irritably ceased to regard as a deal he decided to go spearfishing when peace announced that he intended to take bellatrix to a cluster of islets centering on frigate island miles east of mahe i exploded if he wanted me i told him angrily he would find me ashore at the hotelif i hadnt left on the next plane for south africa macfadden the tough scots engineer who had been with us on the skeleton coast of southwest africa in earlier years had gone on a bender ashore immediately we arrived i sympathized with him i had no wish to go wandering aimlessly about the islands under the pretext of a business deal in the offing my irritation with the whole affair increased when i found that i would have to stage back to johannesburg via east africa and that the aircraft was an old flyingboat which only made the leisurely trip once a week that meant a further delay of three days in the seychelles i cursed the soft languor of limuria peace had seemed animated less tense when i announced my intention of going ashore he didnt try to stop me for a moment i thought he was about to say something but then he shrugged as if he had changed his mind as i sat at dinner at the hotel that evening a naval officer came to my table and saluted mr john garland i nodded wondering if my anger had provoked somebody to do something about discussing the deal he handed me a note which i took more in irritation than anticipation it said i have to inform you that the body of commander geoffrey peace was taken from the water at noddy rock half a mile northward of frigate island at approx hours today by a boats crew from hms loth vennachar operating in that area artificial respiration was applied without success commander peace was taken aboard loch vennachar where he was pronounced dead by the senior naval surgeon the body will at the direction of the commanderinchief limuria command be held aboard loch vennachar until suitable arrangements have been made i hadnt seen the room after that all i saw was an indelible vignette from the past peace at the periscope of a submarine peace going in for the kill the sublieutenant was dutifully sympathetic you were his friend sir werent you they say he was the greatest skipper that ever took a submarine to sea i had my own memories of that i cut him short the manner of our parting ate into me like acid now can i see him afraid not sir i got up i had to see geoffrey peaceonly once again not the way we had parted with a flare of anger and a shrug by whose orders i demanded commanderinchiefs sir no one allowed to see the body as a serving officer i must have raised my voice for several of the diners turned take me to loch vennachar the sublieutenant had obviously been chosen for the job sorry sir no civilians allowed aboard missile cruisers security and all that civilian i exploded im no bloody civilian man i m a reserve captain in the royal navy ask ask he was cool and sure of himself askwho sir perhaps we could discuss this ah away from he gestured at the staring diners he led the way outside i demanded again to see peaces body the cinc the senior naval officer ashore the most i could wring out of the young sublieutenantwhom i heartily detested by nowwas that he would try and establish my bona fides i walked down to the pierhead i do not know how long i stood and stared at the lights of the fleet he could not end like this i told myself over and overnot geoffrey peace i had to talk to someone i spent the next few hours looking for macfadden among the pubs and joints there was no sign of him i tried to telephone the sno but the naval exchange was adamant for the next two days i fretted and fumed then the sublieutenant came to the hotel and reported that bellatrix was back in port i could go aboard i was informed politely but must not leave harbour i tried again to find macfadden but he must have holed up somewhere if however the body of peace was being concealed the news of his death was not the morning after his death the bbc gave it a high place in its early bulletins the evening newscast contained a tribute from the prime minister to peaces part in the development of the snap motor and his mission to the united states other bulletins stated that peace would be buried at sea with full naval honours by the limuria squadron and the us seventh fleet this seemed to me a belated attempt at recognition of what on the face of it might have been a highly successful joint space effort between the two nations the british defence minister would fly to mahe to attend as well as senior naval officers from allied countries it was stated i took it was because of peaces famous wartime exploits i was interviewed by longdistance telephone from london about peace a television news crew arrived and the hotel foyer looked like a studio through all this i was denied access to the cinc i went aboard bellatrixstill no macfadden then came the awful moment when the naval party arrived with the body and my realization that the face below the glass was indeed dead there was also a message to say that the cinc would be pleased to discuss the funeral arrangements with me at my convenience the funeral was to be delayed i was informed pending the arrival by plane of more vips the big jet came round once again flaps hard down for the landing perhaps this was a planeload of them if i could have had my way it would have been a quiet committal to the sea from the deck of bellatrix had the soft thump on the hull come a few minutes earlier it would have been lost in the roar of the jet its very gentleness made it sinister a boat makes its own particular noise against the hull of a bigger vessel this was the thump ofa body i slipped over to the opposite porthole and crouched down with my ear against the sycamore panelling there it was the slow slide of a body pulling itself up to the deck with great caution had this suspicious approach something to do with the secret peace never told me i glanced round the cabin hurriedly and then ducked behind the barcounter in the corner whoever it was made no sound on deck i waited then the after door of the cabin began to open slowly out of sight i would have to rely on sounds from now onwards in order not to be seen silence i risked a quick sideways glance round the bottom of the bar back towards me a man wet naked except for swimming trunks was kneeling at the side of peaces coffin his head was cocked to one side and a rubber tube led from his head to the steel cylinder a stethoscope like a veterinary surgeon sounding the heart of some strange creature the man placed the stethoscope against the metal i could almost hear his breathing as if the instrument were not functioning properly he slipped the earplugs off and put his earface sideways to meagainst the coffin still not satisfied he went to the head and listened again i heard the faint hiss of his breath i craned round the bar it could not have been his breath for the man was standing every nerve alert looking down at the coffin he was muscular suntanned and i saw thrust into his belt the walnut butt striking against the whiteness of his belly a colt detective special he moved slightly and the gun clunked faintly against the steel he must have been as taut as i was for he wheeled round on the empty room i jerked my head back colt special that was the gun used by american police the fbi and detectives a beautiful little weapon with a stubby barrel and a lethal s t r i k e i h a d s e e n t o o s o m e t h i n g t h a t a l a r m e d m e t h e hammer of the colt had been hocked to enable a quick draw f r o m a s h o u l d e r h o l s t e r w h o e v e r i t w a s k n e w h i s w a y around with guns i peered out from behind the bar the man had dropped the stethoscope and now leant with his chest across the glass w i n d o w i h e a r d h i s r a p i d b r e a t h a s h e t h r u s t d o w n o n a s c r e w d r i v e r h e w a s u n s c r e w i n g t h e p a n e l t o g e t a t t h e corpse loyalty to peace devotion admiration grief at our unhappy parting made me blind that anyone should desecrate peaces body in front of my eyes i was on his back my hands reaching for his throat before he heard me even as he swung and grappled dropping the screwdriver i knew i had been a fool this man was skilled at infighting there was no blind panic in his actions simply a swift muscular reflex to offset the ground he knew he had lost in that splitsecond of my surprise attack i dodged the s w i f t k i c k t o t h e g r o i n a n d h u n g o n t o h i s t h r o a t t h e r e w a s n o f e a r o n l y a h i n t o f a c k n o w l e d g m e n t o f a w o r t h y enemy in his greygreen eyes he feinted with a knee to try and prise loose my grip on his throat and then with a spasm of strength jerked me over his head my spine crashed sick eningly against the top of the coffin my grip eased and he struck me savagely across the heart with a flat blow from his forearm my scream of pain died from lack of air in my lungs he eased back drew in a deep controlled breath like a swimmer and his hand went to the colt i lay spreadeagled across the coffin my face to the ceiling the swift cool actions of my unknown enemy were those of a professional i lurched forward as his hand clutched the butt and struck a karate blow to the carotid artery with my left hand it wasnt a heavy blow for i was completely off balance and it was my left handa blow like that can kill when administered with the right i saw the face go blank with pain and semiconsciousness the colt came up though he was a foot from me then as if from nowhere a bottle smashed down on his head and he fell half across me showering me with whisky and glass splinters his face hit the steel side of the coffin and he slid slowly to the floor mac stood looking at the label of the broken bottle in his hand glenflddichl was all he said waste of t best whusky in t world the unconscious man lay grotesquely on the thick carpet blood and whisky about his head mac walked over and looked through the glass trap he drew back a little and the dry sob which shook him was the most terrible thing i have ever heard geoffrey i began i heard about it he rasped whusky i went over to the bar and pulled out another bottle while mac simply stood there i handed him the unopened bottle he tried to pluck off the foil and unscrew the cap but his hands shook so uncontrollably that he could not with an oath he smashed the neck across the coffin and the amber liquid flowed across the glass blurring the face below he threw back his head and gulped some of the spirit drinking from the broken edge a trickle of blood ran from his lips but i do not think he noticed mac i said sharply mac he stared unseeingly at the dead face i shook him roughly by the shoulder he took another strong drag from the ragged edge of the bottle aye he said quietly under control now aye nothing i broke the silence i nodded at the unconscious man thanks for that he was going for his gun mac said uncertainly he was i told him briefly about the stethoscope and the screwdriver mac picked them up and we rolled the intruder over he wont die said mac with the ghost of a grin i hit him hard enough just to break the glass i knelt down and tried to find something to identify him except for the colt there was nothing visible the numbers had been filed off the weapon i emptied the shells the trigger was hairlight nothin said mac in disgust not even any clothes i bent down again and threw back the mans limp left arm i pointed to the back of the armpit the skin was chafed and rougher than the rest shoulderholster i remarked to mac but that wasnt what i was looking for i stretched the arm out so that the skin of the inner arm was visible on it grouped in a triangle were three small brown dots like small moles it was enough i rose balanced the colt central intelligence agency american mac peered and shook his head all i see are three brown moles take a close look and youll see theyre not pigmented i said shortly its the secret mark of the cias agents its how they identify each other mac examined the moles closely and gave a soft whistle tattoo he looked admiringly at me where didyer pick up that one i shrugged i worked a long time with geoffrey peace and peace worked with naval intelligence mac looked thoughtfully at the muscular figure what did he want with he nodded leaving the name unsaid as if he couldnt bring himself to speak it mac was closer to peace than even i had been it was a blind headlong devotion backed by a cunning and ruthlessness learned in the gutters of glasgow i knew macs past i also knew there was nothing he would not have done for peace perhaps it was only because he was still suffering from his bender that he hadnt killed the cia man with the jagged whisky bottle he looked dangerous enough now he knew who the intruder was what did he say to you he asked hoarsely not a word i replied he came at me as silently as a snake an order was shouted from outside and an engine went into reverse i felt the launch come expertly alongside another order and heavy feet on the deck quick i said to mac thats the navy e n g i n e r o o m h e r e p l i e d h e l p m e w i t h h i m j u s t a s far as the companionway we halfcarried halfdragged the limp figure from the cabin as several pairs of boots fell into step on the planking a b o v e i s n a p p e d t h e d o o r s h u t b e h i n d m a c a n d t r i e d t o straighten my clothes in the bar mirror but before i had run a comb through my hair a man in admirals uniform with two officers behind stood in the doorway he came forward stopped at the sight of me the broken bottle and the stench of whisky he stretched out his hand mr john garland i am admiral sir william irvine the cinc himself i was not in any mood for him or any of the others who were staging a roman holiday out of peaces death i was still short of breath from the fight i have been trying to get hold of you for three days one of the officers looked shocked at my abruptness irvine remained bland youll appreciate that in view of the high public esteem in which commander peace was held it was not possible to rush through the arrangements arrangements be damned i retorted if peace had had his way he would have asked to be thrown over the side with some old iron at his feet to take him down commander peace was very unorthodox we know he replied thinly he frowned at the whiskyblurred glass and the broken bottle it appears that his friends are too mac the engineer and i were saying goodbye to him in our own way i snapped back we broke a bottle of whisky over his face its the sort of thing that would have appealed to him the admiral looked pointedly at my dishevelled appear ance may we sit down and discuss the arrangements he and the officers found themselves chairs and one of them smoothed out a typewritten sheet ackroyd the officer went into action with the smooth competence of a computer he read funeral arrangements for the late c o m m a n d e r g e o f f r e y p e a c e t h e b o d y w i l l l i e i n s t a t e aboard the yacht bellatrix for three days three days i exclaimed you mean this sideshow i gestured at the coffin is to go on for three days just to satisfy the ghoulish whims of a lot of sightseers the admiral dropped his blandness i think you should moderate your tone mr garland it is not a sideshow as you choose to call it commander peace is a national hero an internationally known figureand he will be accorded the recognition due to him a naval guard of honour will stand watch over the coffin i am afraid we must ask you to leave bellatrix until after the funeral i scarcely heard him my mind was on that strange figure listening at the coffin trying to get in had he taken a chance in broad daylight because he knew there would be a naval guard after that following the lyinginstate the body will be conveyed aboard loch vennachar droned on ackroyd limuria squadron will put to sea at hours using the north entrance the us seventh fleet will also proceed to sea and take up station in line ahead two miles northward of recif islet bearing degrees while limuria squadron will be stationed in line ahead approximately three miles south of renommee rock we are burying commander peace as near to the area where he was drowned as we can consoled the admiral frigate island is a bit tricky for the big ships particularly if we get a squall from the northwest ackroyd resumed a fighter escort over the fleet will be provided jointly from hms teaser and usn springfield the more i thought about the grand display the less i liked it the mourning party will be abroad loch vennachar intoned ackroyd launch for the chief mourner to be at victoria pierhead at that means me i said the cinc was patient the admiralty has informed me that no relatives of the late commander peace could be traced as his close friend the honour falls to you honour at heart i felt like maci wanted to smash something ackroyd went on the official naval party the admiral broke in sharply what about the dm the director of naval intelligence sir no invitation was sent the cinc smiled apologetically not the current dni no the oldman himselfjust retired i felt a thrill go through me how often had peace spoken of him although i had never met that legendary figure of british naval intelligence i said offhandedly theres no call for the dni to come all the way from england for this circus the cincs glance contained something i did not understand he does not have to come from englandhe lives herein the seychelles he watched me closely too closely first the cia man and now the head of british naval intelligence himself when i had thought him to be living in a country cottage in england or sailing a yacht at cowes stranger still that peace had not mentioned him in the week we had been together he must have known he was in the seychelles where did peaces secret come in i was in deep waters didnt you know asked the cinc hes living here at maheretired and came straight to the seychelles hell be aboard loch vennachar for the funeral you can renew acquaintance i never met him i replied strange he murmured watching me still the tenseness seemed to go out of him with my last remark however mac and i would have to find out more from our faceless stranger even if mac had to rough him up a little in the process the odd coffin began to look odder still as my suspicions mounted ackroyd cleared his throat and broke the tight silence at least the funeral arrangements were neutral ground the committal service will be conducted by the reverend miles sands fleet chaplain the customary salute will take the form of a salvo fired from the main armament of loch vennachar the bizarre ceremony took shape in my minds eyethe double row of british and american ships stopped for the committal the ramp over the cruisers side the weighted body tipped as the padre intoned we therefore commit his body to the deep the uptilt of the ramp the faraway splash as the object hit the water following which a wreath will be dropped over the spot by helicopter flying from hms teaser i had to be aboard that helicopter only if i saw peaces body sink into the depths would it allay the crowd of doubts and questions which clamoured now in my mind id like to fly in that helicopter i said quickly the cinc froze his reply confirmed my suspicions ill consider it consider i retorted you dont have to consider you can okay my request here and now he said steadily i said ill consider it ill inform you of my decision in good time i can however promise that if you wish the pilot to drop a personal floral tribute personal floral tribute i laughed in his face the reek of whisky was in my nostrils macs personal tribute was raw from the heart and it could stay at that for my part the mystery remained larger than before forget it i muttered ackroyd had been well trained he glided on trying to reduce the tension the fleet will then make halfspeed to a p osition eastnortheast of recif islet to bear degrees my sharpened mental reflexes jerked at the mistake in the orders the fleets stopped for the committal snapped there was a flash of anger but also amusement in the cincs eyes ackroyd dutifully fell silent my eyes followed his steady stare at the coffin i saw toothe thing weighed a ton id been thinking in terms of a body sewn in canvas how would they get that heavy object over a ships side the fleet will not heaveto replied the cinc evenly if you get it overboard itll foul the cruisers screws i expostulated cruiser echoed the cinc playing with me who said the ceremony was to be from loch vennachar i half rose but he waved me down i think you should get the picture clear in your mind commander peace will not be buried in the ordinary way the method might have pleased his own macabre taste no the british and american fleets will steam in line ahead the mourning party being on loch vennachars bridge the fleet destroyer hms amirante will detach and proceed at full speed between the lines of ships amirante will carry commander peaces body while the chaplain conducts the service from loch vennachar it will be relayed by radio to the other ships he turned to ackroyd what is amirantes speed thirtyfive knots sir i was revolted at the thought of the hollywoodtype spectacle to please millions of television viewers there was to be a hookup via telstar satellites which would also massage the egos of the british and american naval commanders the press radio and television ballyhoo had also been deliberately engineered my anger flared thirtyfive knots dont be bloody silly manyou cant drop a body overboard at thirtyfive knots who said we intended to drop him overboard i rose to my feet in incredulity not dropfire fire yes said the cinc evenly we are going to fire peace into his grave from a depthcharge mortar mortar ride for a corpse i could not believe that he was serious it sounded like a circus display to me the cinc went on you must have wondered about the special coffini think loch vennachars engineering shop did a fine rush job you sound like a professional undertaker i grated he shrugged commander peaces burial demanded special arrangements you must have wondered why your request to see the body was not granted i dont wonder any longer whose bloodyfool idea was all this mine i wont have any part in it i retorted you and your your arrangements can go to hell i did not seem to get through to him it would look rather strange would it not he went on blandly if john garland peaces friend and comradeinarms sulked while the hero was given the honours and recognition due to him honours and recognition be there is still time to call off this whole silly farce is there he was cool sure of himself tell the defence minister not to come tell the top representatives of the limuria grand alliance that john garland claims the exclusive right to bury his friend as heand no one else thinks fit reverse the chain of communications now in motion to relay the ceremony tell millions of television viewers i cursed myself for not having broken through the obstructions when i first heard of peaces death now it seemed too late dont you wish commander peace to be honoured not in this way how then if i may ask i i i all i know is that he should have been buried quietly at sea my voice trailed off the cinc rose to go you have not made any of the constructive suggestions i had hoped for from someone so close to commander peace bloody hypocritical bastard thought i think we may take it that the present arrangements will stand ackroyd will keep in touch with you can you have your things packed in say an hour i must ask you not to come aboard bellatrix except during the formal lyinginstate hours naval guards will be posted with orders he shrugged slightly i hope you will not embarrass either me or yourself i suggest you be as accommodating as pos sible mr garland captain garland i reminded him he smiled the iron hand in the velvet glove to me mister had you fallen under my orderswell this interview might have proceeded somewhat differently his remote formal air was impenetrable he picked up his cap and ground out his goldtipped benson and hedges cigarette the two officers matched his actions a formal salute and he was gone the steel coffin creaked gently under bellatrixs quiet lift what had an american intelligence agent sought to find out with that stethoscope had he suspected that peace might not be dead i didnt want to look at the dead face again but the tumult of questions hammering in my brain drew me to the coffin itself those heavy rivets i fingered them had loch vennachars engineers indeed fabricated the strange contraption could they have made it in a brief two or three days i was drawn to the glass trap what secret big enough for the cia to be interested in lay behind the closed eyes framed by the monkish cap i had not noticed previously that peaces head was pillowed on foam rubber i wiped away the last of the whisky the glass still wasnt clear there seemed some condensation inside but the humid climate would account for that they must have embalmed the body for it to lie another three days in state six in all since his death then i noticed that the entire interior was of foam rubber i took the stethoscope adjusted the plugs in my ears and listened nothing that layer of foam rubber would have damped any sound however although the admiral had said peace was to be fired from a depthcharge mortar the body did not seem to be strapped in i calculated the width of peaces shoulders against the size of the cylinder and recalled his height strange the coffin was much longer and wider than necessary i explored the foot there was a heavy flange i ran my fingers over it the metal was rough and painted but i felt something i looked round for some instrument then went and fetched an icepick from the bar with it i scratched and found lettering it read cammelllaird ltd shipbuilders liverpool i reflected grimly that the key might well lie with the unconscious cia man mac and i would have to make him talk as far as cammelllairds were concerned the coffin was probably a stray section of casing or tubing from a submarine bearing their imprint that would account for its shape and size the cinc had been very much on the defensive with me but he had warmed a little when he had spoken of the dni the thought of the dni decided me i would go and visit the man whose fame behind the scenes was matched only by his anonymity outside the service he was of course peaces friend the cinc had said he had settled recently in mahe it would not be difficult to track him down in a small place like port victoria even at this late moment i thought he might be able to have some of the undignified extroversion of the funeral modified he might also know peaces secret i started towards the engineroom and as i did so i heard the naval guard of honour coming alongside mac was wry the bastards still out nothing to be had from him for hours he looked down at his oilstained hands we may have softened him up a little though weve got to be off bellatrix soon i reminded him looking at the muscular figure lying on the gratings mac had patched up the wound on his head and he looked corpselike with the blood cleaned away we cant carry an unconscious man past the guard i pointed out well lock him up and come back in an hour or two on the pretext that weve forgotten something macs voice was savage andquestion him i nodded hell be tough though the cia boys arent given to shooting off their mouths least of all to a couple of amateurs like ourselves mac said coldly he tried to get at the skipper thats enough for me hell talkor else he picked the man up under the armpits and halfpushed halfthrew him into one of the steel lockers it had a latch but no lock it was the best we could do with the guard already aboard i pocketed the colt and went to the cabin the naval party had grouped themselves with reversed arms round the coffin the officerincharge frowned to see mac and me still there i packed quickly leaving some of my things as security to be allowed back aboard from my locker i took the cherished yachting cap i had worn with peace on the skeleton coast i decided to carry the old cap at the funeral as a token of sentiment despite the fact that i would be in civilian clothes a boat was summoned to take us ashore before it arrived i went and stood at peaces head a long shaft of sun struck down over morne seychellois enriching the sycamore panelling of the cabin the curtains over the portholes shifted in the land breeze it was all sunshine softness and light the bizarre grey coffin was as out of place as a viking handaxe on a silk cushion this was goodbye yet i felt nothing i would never look on geoffrey peaces face again i tried to concentrate my thoughts on that square foot of rather dirty glass but they kept wandering out across the gentle anchorage listening to the sounds of the fleet to the raucous note of a patrolboats loudhailer keeping the curious at bay i abandoned my silent farewell telling myself that wed looked death in the face together so often that now when it had come in such commonplace fashion all i could do was to recognize the fact ashore at the hotel i traced the dni easily though the english receptionist had been a little stiff saying merely that he lived in a cottage with a companion she didnt elaborate now i walked beyond the town up a valley towards the mountains they were striking the union jack at signal hill at the northern end of the redsoiled valley it wasnt far the high casuarina tree screen with its tangled lush undermat of plumbago golden allamanda and hibiscus in which creole negrillons played hideandseek thinned to show me my objective here indeed were roses better than the dnis in kent but there the resemblance ended the cottage was topped by palmleaf thatch and the slabs of pink coral of which it was built still held some of their underwater colour in the dying sun my eye did not linger on its beauties the object of the negrillons interest was a royal navy petty officer with a submachinegun at the gate in the garden were more men with smith and wessons and a walkietalkie the petty officer looked severely at me sorry sir no admittance orders tell the dni its john garlandcommander peaces friend hell understand the mans voice held a new respect but he remained adamant nothing i can do about it sir it isnt for the dni to say who comes and goes i have a list here he tapped his pocket and you arent on it anger and frustration boiled inside me what the devil is all this i demanded the negrillons sensing a diversion crept closer chattering like monkeys whats going on that an armed guard has to be thrown round the home of a harmless old man i wouldnt say thates very spry still the petty officer gave a quick glance round and dropped his voice maybe she keeps im young sir he leered what do you mean young lady in there he grinned now wots e got that i aint my concept of the dni was shaken peace had spoken of the dedicated aesthete here was a sailor leching over an old man and his trollop in st brandon the islanders will tell you how the women who come from the seychelles have corrupted the men and certainly to see a sega danced on neighbouring agalega is to understand how easy it is to obtain a poultrykeeper trial bride or sleeping partner as you wish agalega pioneered the system of a husband selecting from among his friends several to share his wife under a gentlemans agreement that the right man is at the right place on the right night and agalegans who consider themselves moral point accusing fingers at seychelles women no wonder the receptionist had been prim when i had asked about the dni he was likely to be useless in the present crisis my wish to see him left me its nothing important i said the petty officer reacted to my tone we all eard about commander peaceyou was is mate wasnt you yesyes you could call it that he went on did you ear the radio today sir bbc we aint sposed tlisten except on our own wavelength but we didwas e really like that sir an iron band seemed to constrict round my head if i didnt break free of this publicity buildup and sloppy patriotism i should he was a brave cruel heartless determined ruthless bastard who killed more men than he could remember i grated but if i had thought he would have had to endure this bloody rubbish when he died i would have killed him long ago with my own hands the petty officer gave a gasp i swung on my heel and stalked down towards the town i found mac and in a savage mood i rowed out to bellatrix i rode roughshod over the officer of the guard and mac and i went to the engineroom he let out an oath at the sight of the empty locker an open porthole told its own tale either the intruder had been foxing us or he had come round sooner than we had expected silent angry we returned to the port the morning of the funeral broke crystal clear as had done a million other mornings in limuria i had been awake since first light due to the clump and clatter of the television crews moving out their equipment i dressed and looked out from seawards came the heavy revving of british and american jet carrier planes bellatrix looked forlorn guarded only by a small naval launch the prying small craft were missing the reason was on the radio the bbc said last night the body of commander peace the british naval hero who is to be buried today with full honours at sea in the seychelles islands was conveyed aboard hms amirante as listeners already know commander peace will be committed to his final restingplace by the unusual method of firing his coffin from a destroyers depthcharge mortar television cameramen have been stationed aboard the destroyer amirante and by courtesy of the admiralty viewers in many countries will be able to see the actual moment of firing with an oath i switched off cap under my arm i strode down to the pierhead to the launch taking me to loch ven nachar they hadnt expected me early and i had the bridge to myself a few cables length away was amirante cameramen reporters news commentators and tv crews clustered round the stern depthcharge throwers peaces coffin was lashed to one of them shrouded by a tarpaulin i tried to watch the fleet but my eyes always went back to that two hours later i still stood alone on the bridge wing as chief mourner who couldnt mourn i had been treated by the cincs staff as a sort of pariah set apart by being peaces friend but without the status of a relative the defence minister and naval officers stood together in reverent silence as the fleet chaplain intoned the wellknown words into a microphone black cassock and white surplice blew in the wind a foil to naval blue and gold braid and black formal coats the fleet steamed slow ahead for miles ahead and astern was a superb array of missile cruisers aircraft carriers fleet destroyers and corvettes in the centre near loch vennachar were the tall sails or conningtowers of six nuclear submarines this was britains crack limuria squadron parallel a mile distant was the american seventh fleetthe same ships in line ahead but instead of six submarines they had ten keeping precision station almost under my feet was amirante with peaces body lashed to her mortars at the chaplains windblown words thou hast showed us terrible things and the wonders of the deep an officer stepped over and raised his hand to amirante if i disagreed with the cincs publicity methods i could not fault his ships amirantes engineroom bells rang there was a quick thresh of water as her screws went full ahead simultaneously the tarpaulin was jerked from the coffin i looked for the last time towards geoffrey peaces body only then did i feel the surge of my pentup emotions at the sight of the armada of fighting ships the long swell rolling in on the southeaster the throb of powerful marine engines the scream of carrier jets trailing wingtip smoke thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads we went through fire and water a dollop of sea creamed over the destroyers stern inundating the depthcharge throwers amirante raced down the line of ships recif islet a white cuspate guanostained rock fell astern and fine on the starboard bow was frigate island where peace had died a flock of frigate birds circled over it like a squadron of planes protecting a fleet the swell was increasingwe were getting into the cyclone seasonand the coral reefs and cays where peace had spent his last hours were white amirante reached the head of the fleet swung towards the american side and came round in a dramatic fullahead turna bone in her teeth a splendid unforgettable sight the destroyer reached us her timingand the chaplains were splitsecond as he spoke the sonorous last words amirante was alongside we therefore commit his body to the deep there was a sharp explosion a puff of smoke at amirantes stern the ungainly coffin cartwheeled high into the air cameras locked on the grey object as it hurtled upwards and news commentators hanging on to the stern rails with one hand and with microphone in the other gave their word pictures slowly the thing rose up and up it arced downwards i thought almost i heard the splash above the destroyers engines the cinc allowed the raw drama to sink in the chaplain was silent too before the benediction an officer pressed a button at the rear of loch vennachars bridge the deck trembled and shook four missiles leapt from the cruisers launchers in a flurry of flame four others rose from an american cruiser there seemed scarcely any time between the launch and a thunderous detonation overhead then a helicopter was over peaces grave and a huge wreath floated down at the end of a parachute as it hit the sea i felt a sudden impulse something of peace for peaces end i reached out my hand i wouldnt waste a good cap said a prim voice peace had spoken of that voice a thousand times didactic precise the dni stood next to me screwing up his eyes at the water like me he was not in uniform i held my capthe skeleton coast capuncertainly ny anivon riaka he said articulating the words with a slight forward throw of the lips like an actor he smiled my creole isnt the best but it means that which is in the midst of the moving waters mamzelle adele says creole was once a french patois but no longer everything in limuria seems to undergo a seachange could this indeed be the man whose influence over peace had been so great i could not equate his blathering about an obscure language in an obscure ocean with his knowledge of submarines and underwater strategy which peace claimed was greater than that of anyone living he went on you would not think that so scattered a community as the limurian islanders could have a language with the subtletly of expression which creole has its as diverse as their brede dishesin south africa there is almost the same word bredie which means rice with things like peppers and tomatoes there are any number of nuances for bredes brede giraumon with pumpkin leaves brede martin brede malabar no wonder peace admired the dmthey were equally heartless you feel all this is appropriate to i nodded towards the swiftly disappearing patch where peace had been fired he seemed amused you yourself wanted to give him his own sort of farewellfrom what i hearbut now you object to anything but formal funeral conversation about the departed hero departed hero if a sneer is all peace could expect he remained smiling and gestured with his hand it seemed wrong too that he should be smoking i think youve missed your moment with that cap annoyed thrown offbalance i went to the dodger the mocking and ironical words followed me i raised the cap to throw it the camera crews are working hard to record the last dramatic gesture of peaces comradeinarms i looked downinto a battery of cameras and telephoto lenses aboard amirante it would be a futile gesture anyway went on the cool voice during our cpnversation we gathered speed and i doubt if anyone could locate the spot now where they fired our hero i saw the reason now for his smalltalkhe had saved me from contributing one more of the kind of histrionic gestures which i had so deplored thanks i said thanks very much the clear greygreen eyes were expressionless he said with an almost conspiratorial air come onlets give it to thema smart double salute from two old comrades he flicked the cigarettestub into the water theres a fagend for friend peaceits all right dont look so startled were not being broadcast now he jumped smartly to attention and pistoned a salute which would have been the envy of a starsintheeyes midshipman i saluted too well thats that said the dni wish we could get a pink plymouth in the wardroom but i dont suppose everyone is as broadminded as to pour glenfiddich into a dead mans face i went cold glenfiddich only mac and i had been there had the dni heard from the cia agent what was the tieup i turned from watching the two fleets complicated manoeuvre to bring them back to port to find the dnis eyes on me unsmiling hard you came to see me a couple of evenings ago it was a statement a demand yes why come to me i wanted you to help stop this silly charade i a retired naval officer living quietly among the back blocks of the sea yes you still carry a good deal of weight in high places my dear boy you overrate me i dont think so he said quietly the petty officer underrated mamzelle adele you mean to say oh come garland he was impatient but pleased at his minor triumph in disconcerting me i naturally heard all the petty officer said about myself and my young ladyi had him dismissed from the guard how you cant live all your life surrounded by cloakanddagger listening devices without taking some into retirement he replied i had an ultrasensitive mike in the postbox which recorded everything the petty officer said there are others in the garden too he was pedantic your outburst and character delineation of the late commander peace was apt penetrating and very touching you must hear the tape i regret that the petty officers eliza doolittle exclamation is a little blurred but i was delighted to have the negrillons patois a patois within a patois as it were mamzelle adele says the language is perfect the petty officer didnt seem so very far off the mark the way he enthused about his mamzelle adele she must be a cut above the ordinary seychelles goodtime girl though a teacher of languageswell that was as good a cover as any even though it didnt deceive the locals he watched me closely i couldnt make out why you suddenly went back without pressing your desire to see me i could not tell him why i improvised something about his being part of peaces funeral circus but i could tell he was not deceived the fleet split up for the difficult north passage past st annes into the main harbour the lush green hills of mahe were so close that i could pick out the dnis cottage come and have a drink with me tonight said the dni with the peculiar type of authority the experienced clubman conveys with an invitation not to be refused a drink and some dinner i have some excellent turtle steaks from agalegathe real thing not the sort of mush they pass off as turtle in mahe varravarra to start withive never seen a fish look more like copper mamzelle adele will be delighted mam zelle adele mamzelle adeles smile was welcoming but her eyes were shadowed it seemed almost as if a light had been deliberately dimmed above the high cheekbones and it gave to the sensitive volatile face and expressive lips a strangeness which in the unusual tropical halflight before the dark set my pulses racing she answered my knock at the dnis cottage door and stood holding it open for me to enter with her was a limuria creature as strange and elegant as she wasa small palegrey ringtailed lemur i was later to know him as nossi be he rubbed himself gently against her unstockinged legs watchful friendly but with reservations like mamzelle adele herself she could not have been thirty and the pinkish cotton dressa flushed coral colour favoured by the islandersdid nothing to hide her exquisite figure she wore coconut fibre sandals her face was tanned her light hair sunbleached that perfect vignette of her standing at the door in the halfdusk is with me yet youre staring she smiled as she said it i knew that it was important for me to remember every detail about her her voice had a strange dammedup quality like a current race through a reef passage when i did not reply there was a touch of light somewhere in the back of those shadowed eyes like sun striking on the flash of a frigate birds wing youll be john garland commander peaces friend somehow the voice had drawn a subtle distinction between myself and peace by using his title i was glad of it yes i said at a loss under her scrutiny yes thats right a silence fell between us and she said im mamzelle adele not adele someone or other butjust mamzelle adele she laughed a quiet easy laugh which met my query halfway in the grands carreauxthose are the big fishinggrounds north of st brandontheres a poisonfish which they call mamzelle adele so its difficult for anyone in these parts to say simply adelethey must add mamzelle she looked hard at me a title gives status you know was she perhaps trying to explain her relationship with the dm i didnt want to discuss it looking at that unusual face st brandoni like that better than the portuguese cargados carajos before she could reply there was a soft taptap from inside the bungalow like a blind persons cane my fatherim french you knowheld the oil puissance for st brandon jouissance concession she gave a soft value to the syllables like a pirogues keel on sand she added st brandon has a ring about it i shared her warmth remembering a grey old ruined abbey on the atlantic shore of ireland where once i had made a pilgrimage to st brendans grave when the squadrons of clouds come to obscure the mountains above the saints grave they will tell you in the soft connemara tongue that it is st brendans angels bringing him safely home across the sea from america years before columbus i wanted to tell her the soft taptap came to my ears again it reminded me of the intruders stethoscope against peaces coffin it broke the chain she sensed it taptap taptap youve been there then her voice was flat as if she already knew the answer commander peace and i called there on our way from mauritius here i replied an ancestor of his sir john peace was the first englishman there he charted it peace thought it might be fun to do the same a bit of fun she exclaimed ironically yes that is what commander peace would have said so peace had been in touch with the dni the shadow of his death lay between us taptap taptap she looked at me a little puzzled then said formally sir george is expecting you sir georgethe dni to me i wondered less now that i saw her why he had set up with mamzelle adele but it left me with an inexplicable resentment nevertheless she led the way into the fairsized bungalow pressurelamps gave a comforting sizzle taptap taptap steel against steel mamzelle adele opened a door taptap taptap the toughened steel punch was against the white bone he was tapping it with a tiny hammer taptap taptap the skull lay on a cushion surrounded by bluegrey chips the dni did not look up but taptapped again a flake came away and the bone stood out dirtywhite got it he exclaimed with satisfaction he blew the chips away isnt he a beauty scarcely distorted at alllook at those teeth the skull was the size of a horses bat the teeth were predatoryas long as a mans fingerand hooked above the eyesockets its shape broadened like an aeroplanes tail if hes not an aulacephalodon ill eat blue shale the dni remarked i drew closer to the grotesque thing on the cushion much of the bone was free of its stone matrix aulacephalodon i queried this chap was a reptile which wandered about africa two hundred million years ago up to now specimens have been confined to the semidesert karoo region of south africa never found anywhere else now ill rock themheres blue karoo shale among the corals of the saya de malha bank peace and i had skirted saya de malha after st brandon on our way to the seychelles it is a vast collection of shoals atolls and cays scarcely above waterlevel extending over thousands of square miles in the sea of limuria youre talking greek to captain garland and me mam zelle adele chided him gently the dni laughed why yes i amaulacephalodon is greek for a winged head look at the winged formation of the back of his skull mamzelle adele was reproving i think we all need a drink dont you sir george usual please i asked for whisky wondering at his commanding tone well hed been used to ordering people around all his life he got up and sat on the edge of the table swinging a leg he asked didactically you realize what this means im afraid i dont the karoo he said with a schoolmasterish air is a unique semidesert area of south africa which is the richest repository of reptile fossils in the world man of course had not yet appeared on the scene when they lived he looked at me penetratingly man is still young in the scheme of thingsonly a million years maybeand some of these creatures were adaptable enough to survive for sixty million but in mans short stay on the face of the earth he has evinced one characteristic which may cause him to survive longer than any other creaturethere has never been a killer like him there is nothing man will not kill has not killed he knows the lesson these creatures never learnedkill first have the best weapon and you live his voice was precise prim man must kill in order to survive geoffrey peaces philosophy i replied but before the words were out i knew i was wrong peace had learnt his killerphilosophy from this man i looked away the room commanded a panorama of the fleet anchorage the isles and the sea beyond there was still enough light to see the white tip of recif where we had buried peace the fullwidth glass doors were closed against the seabreeze and below them stretched lawn and flowerbeds was it coincidence that the dni was in the seychelles for the mighty resurgence of british naval power the limuria squadron what had been his part in restoring the royal navys power and prestige mamzelle adeles arrival with the drinks broke the spell you see what this means he repeated although the didacticism was there the fervour had gone from his voice i sipped the whisky no it contradicts all previous theories that saya de malha was due to subsidence not upsurge of the land mass underneath i winced at the academic sophistries mamzelle adele said with that odd pitch to her tone hes trying to say the karoo and saya de malha are related what did it matter to me whether the karoo was or was not related to a bank in the indian ocean at that moment i was more interested in mamzelle adele where do you figure in this i asked her the dni replied before she could answer mamzelle adele knows the islands she speaks creole like a native she is my guide on my fossilhunting expeditions st brandon she sipped a cloudy drink it wasnt alcohol but her own mixture of fruit juice and the nectar of coconutflowers the silence was oppressive the dni went on you find these fossil reptiles only in blue shale this piece was overgrown by coral at saya de malha it had enormous implications i waited politely if it had not been for that flash of his while mamzelle adele was fetching the drinks i would have been bored stiff implications why yesit means i have definitely proved the existence of limuria im afraid im not with you he sat swinging a leg the presence of blue shale in midocean thousands of miles away from the karoo itself proves the existence of a common tie hundreds of millions of years ago here ive found a karoo creature in limuria he tapped the skull it shows that africa was once linked to limuriaby land it is not fantastic now to speak of limuria as an indian ocean atlantis of course theres a great deal yet to be done but i am inclined to think the same upheaval which threw up the karoo mountains was the one which drowned limuria under the sea very interesting i murmured he went off at a tangent speaking rapidly to mamzelle adele asking if dinner was nearly ready offering me another drink she took my glass there was a lot in her eyes i wanted to understand what were we talking about he asked when she had gone here was my cue the clear eyes watched me intently killers i replied man the killer good he said good there had been a message and i had got it the voice became more precise and i knew i was in deep waters all mans long tale of killing he tapped the grotesque skull from this fellow onwards has one short moral kill first he tapped the hooked fangs with a fingernail have bigger and better teeth or i said it very slowly the weapon to end all weapons the voice was gentle almost prim the ultimate weapon yes the words came from deep inside the man the soft tones belied the steel beneath i put the sixtyfourthousanddollar question in this age the clear eyes probed me assessed then he walked over to the glass door it was dark now and the lights of the fleet stood out the dni jerked his head towards them in this a cold thrill went through me for peace had spoken of that slightly worldweary compassionate tone which the dni was given to use in times of great crisis i joined him we stood saying nothing then he sighed glanced at his watch and threw open the doors a lovely night i wonder if one gets nights like these anywhere else in the world except south africa i did not hear mamzelle adele in her soft sandals she handed us new drinks the dni stood looking no one spoke then he said turn out that light will you johnit rather spoils the effect it was an order not a request john not garland or captain garland but john for him to address me like that i knew i had surmounted some obstacle he had laid in my path i was surprised to see mamzelle adele put out a bottle of glenfiddich and a glass i turned out the pressurelamp my eyes were blinded by its closeness a soft arm was slipped through mine and mamzelle adele said let me guide you she was close i smelt the sunsmell of her and was glad i had come i stumbled to the doorway still halfdazzled i didnt see him only the gleam of the knife i jerked aside dragging mamzelle adele with me i can noned into the doorframe then as he laughed i froze it was geoffrey peace he pulled off the black rubber cap and grinned at the dni nothing much wrong with johns reflexes is there i blinked in disbelief peace stood on the terrace in the same black rubber suit in which i had seen him in his coffin a long divingknife was in his hand i tried to speak but the words would not come peace said ruefully next time you want an arseoverelbow stunt youd better give me some astronaut training beforehand i thought the bloody thing would never stop cartwheeling the dni laughed too you went up a lot higher than i expected peace said im black and blue despite the foam rubber the ejector gear work all right asked the dni peace laughed again if it hadnt i wouldnt be here now the dni said get inside will you geoffrey nobody saw you peace shook his head i gasped geoffrey pour me a whisky boy will you if theres such a thing in the house christ to watch that bloody macfadden pour the stuff all over my face and i dying for a drink mamzelle adele was still on my arm peaces greeting to her was level comradely hello mamzelle adele she detached herself good evening commander was it a good trip get me a drink and ill tell you he replied geoffrey i started again he cut me short the funeral act must have been pretty convincing judging from your reactions thenand now the dni locked the glass doors and drew the thick coconutmatting sunblinds he relit the lamp peace glanced at the bottle hmmm glenffiddich for the returning prodigal my hands shook so that the drink slopped what is all this about later peace grinned what i need is whisky food and lack of adulationin that order he swallowed the smooth spirit at a gulp your clothes are in your room said mamzelle adele whats to eat he demanded varravarra replied the dni varravarra and turtle steak excellent you want to live on those bloody spaceman pills inside a steel coffin for days to appreciate what a square meal means if id been one of those blokes who first got up on to the moon id have come back to earth just for a decent meal he laughed and added i nearly indulged in an old limuria remedydrink a pint of turtles blood to restore your own i felt the amused twitch of mamzelle adeles lips was meant for me as she said i should have kept some of tonights dinner gravy for you then rather than scotchits turtle steak peace dropped his gay mood and turned to me dont look so damned serious johnthe whole thing was a hoax the dni and i engineered it i breathed air from scuba bottles they stacked in the bottom of the coffin when you mourners werent grieving over the dear departed i took a whiff through my facemask i remembered the sharp hiss i had heard while hiding behind the bar the cia man had heard it too peace swung on me as if he were reading my thoughts thanksfor that other business other business the dni was sharp i pulled out the colt with the hocked hammer and held it in my palm peace gave a low whistle the dni took it while i explained about the intruder i realized from his reaction that it was not the intruder who had told him about mac and the glenfiddich adeles eyes never left my face the dni and peace stared at one another peaces face was bleak which always spelled trouble for somebody the dnis impassive cold the dni addressed himself to peace this puts a different complexion ona lot of arrangements how are you sure he was a cia man asked peace abruptly i told them about the three smalls moles under the armpit the dni permitted himself the ghost of a smile this is the man we want geoffrey i told them about the mans disappearance from the engineroom peace pursed his lips no other identification nothing except i nodded at the weapon that the dni sniffed the barrel highvelocity powder been fired recently too undoubtedly he stopped looking at peace for confirmation handload he replied therefore probably american bears out what john says about the cia marks the tense silence fell again i had not yet recovered from the shock of peaces return i remembered the diecut lettering on the coffin it seems to me far too many people were on the inside of this hoaxthe cinc for example peace became uneasy what makes you say that john i told them about the cammelllaird nameplate the dni frowned too many loose ends it seems geoffreyespecially when a man like john smells a rat no the cinc was not in our confidence nor am i i retorted touche replied the dni inclining his head the coffin was built specially for the job in england it wasahinsinuated in the right place at the right time i looked at the three it was clear that mamzelle adele knew all about it too i remembered the strange undertones in the dnis voice earlier youre not a couple of schoolboys to play a practical joke lets take it from there i snapped mamzelle adele started to withdraw my dinner is spoiling she excused herself the dni did not give me the chance for further questions when she had gone he said to peace was the pirogue in the right place geoffrey no other leaks no one in sight we had an island boat waiting in a cove at recif for me peace explained to me i paddled here under cover of darkness the coffin had an ejector device i pulled the chain and it shot me clear there wasnt anyone around how deep were you i asked sixty seventy feet it seemed fishy to me that the cinc refused me a ride in the helicopter he had his orders replied the dni in his precise voice peace went on i had to get out tonight tomorrow there was a chance that someone might have taken a boat oer the grave where our hero was buried they would have seen the coffin halfsubmerged i took the colt from the dni the owner of this for example how much did he suspect peace demanded i didnt give him much of a chance but we both heard the hiss of air escaping from the coffin i dont like the idea of that coffin still floating around the dni shook his head no it was loaded with two explosive charges one for geoffreys ejector seat and the other for a demolition charge geoffrey peace is at the bottom of the sea to the best of everyones knowledge mamzelle adele came back dinner in ten minutes whether youre changed or not changed her arrival broke the tension peace and the dni went off i stood silent an avalanche of questions in my mind nossi be rubbed himself softly and affectionately against me adele said another drinkjohn her eyes were level unsmiling i started to say yes but stopped peace might drink whisky like that but not me if i wanted to catch the undercurrentsthere were plentyof the dnis words and adeles she paused fractionally at my refusal then picked up the elegant lemur and put him on the table she was relaxed easy come my lovely one she said shake hands with our tough fellowconspirator nossi be extended a jetblack paw he was as much a creature of limuria as mamzelle adelestrange lovely sunwarmed gentle the creatures action momentarily stilled the tumult in my mind i scratched his chin its sheer magic the eyes warmed above the high cheekbones magic less than a fortnight ago i was sitting in an airconditioned skyscraper office in johannesburg i replied my whole world revolved round naccam and its affairs a touch of the button and she smiled a man under authority i sounded a little unreal to myself and now she prompted when i fell silent nossi be i replied limuria mamzelle adele the languid charm of the islands she teased then that odd quality of light round her eyes dimmed you underrate yourself she said quietly id add a man who halfkills another with a karate blow to the throat and is quite prepared to rough up a semiconscious man to extort information from him the chosen companioninarms of commander geoffrey peace the suddenness of it took me aback she picked up nossi who was grumbling under his breath there are things about you which also dont add up i said youre french for example yet your english is impeccable she knelt putting nossi be on the floor and looked up into my face the v of her breasts under the slight cotton sent the blood into my ears i act as the dnis interpreter she replied evenly he told you so himself i speak creolewell but your english she shrugged i went to school in england i learned my trade there trade i echoed but she stood up and turned away there were as many questions i wanted to ask her as i wanted to ask peace and the dni then with an odd little gesture she swung back and slipped her arm through mine and led me in to dinner her dinner was a masterpiece but my preoccupation prevented my enjoying it fully the varravarra was served with a beurre vert in tiny flat wicker baskets on a bed of fernlike langue de vache the turtle steaks were sweated in butter with a thickish sauce of coconut flour flavoured with sherry the wine was a favourite of peaces a superb south african bellingham grand cai served in an icebucket made from the famous double coconutshells of the seychelles mamzelle adele sat at the head and the dni at the foot i faced peace we had just finished the varravarra and i reached forward for the wine the colt fell like a reminder on the table mamzelle adele picked it up and handed it back to me the colt pythons better she remarked a sort of cadillac among handguns i saw peace stiffen he stared at her his eyes were deadly cold and his mouth hard the dni caught the look from that moment the meal seemed to go dead the dnis voice became more precise and he talked palaeontology peace was withdrawn my conversation i felt fell flat mamzelle adele alone seemed unaffected though she must have sensed the tension she was gay beautiful in her strange way as nossi be who jumped on to her chair and curled his long tail round her neck in imitation of a fur a frozen lemon sherbet rounded off the meal we went back into the big room overlooking the harbour mamzelle adele brought coffee and cognac the silence was intense the dni swirled his napoleon brandy round in its balloon glass he said to me you must be asking yourself what this is all about his glance went over the rim of his glass to peace then to mamzelle adele and back to me the prim voice was slightly defensive i had to convinceaha number of people that geoffrey peace was dead including john garland i rejoined he went on the deep damnation of his taking off had to be spectacular something everyone could see for themselves at least the cia man had his doubts peace stirred in his deep cane chair i wonder if you didnt overdo the business of the depthcharge mortar there was that risk replied the dni but everyone had to see geoffrey peace go to his grave it all looked very real and decorous on tv interjected mamzelle adele was the glass hatch a calculated part of the display i asked the dni nodded it was armourplated of course did you see anything publicly in the setup to make you think it might be a fake nothing except your flippant attitude on loch ven nachars bridge he frowned at my tone youre on the inside of this i wasnt thenim not sure now now he went on having publicly disposed of geoffrey peace i bring him back because i i interrupted him it strikes me as peculiar the way you keep saying i youre retired youre spending your declining days messing around with reptile fossil and learning creole i froze when i saw his eyes im doing neither he looked at me thoughtfully calculating it was the most frightening glance i have ever had directed at me it struck me that he was assessing how if he had to kill me he would have done it the gentle slightly weary voice lent high drama to his words mamzelle adele sat very upright and still peace no longer lolled in his chair maybe he was remembering his own excoriation by that same gentle deadly voice the dni rose and sat on the arm of his chair i of course have a secret geoffrey of course has a mission and some hellish weapon is involved i added grimly his smile was wintry ultimateit softens the concept somehow a small handful of people share this secret they include the prime minister of england and the president and vicepresident of the united states i shot a glance at mamzelle adele the skin was stretched tight across her cheekbones as if someone had put hands over her ears and pulled it back she pushed nossi be absently from her knee there was a long pause the only sound was the swish of the trade wind through the broad leaves of the latanier trees the dni placed the tips of his fingers together in my heightened state of mind i saw the gesture as akin to the crablike pincers of the cannibal centipede of the islands when it throttles its victim their rasp was in his voice too we are going to launch the vicepresident of the united states into space little bear like the curtain suddenly going up on a startling and unfamiliar stageset the dnis words seemed to bring unreality with them the room itself now looked unreal to me like looking through the wrong end of a telescope i felt almost clinically detached from the groupthe lovely woman the silverhaired intelligence chief the submarine ace tough and alert as if he had undergone a resurrection rather than an immersion i repeated the vicepresidents name for want of anything better to say marvin k green mkg corrected the dni better get used to calling him that youre to see a good deal of the man shortly i looked at peace for it was with mkg that he had worked on the snap nuclear motor project hes a regular guy as they say he replied the dnis precise voice cut in you and geoffrey will see him launched safely into space that is your assignment mamzelle adele spoke for the first time more to me than to the others im part of the assignment too i banged down my glass this sounds like science fiction on the contrary replied the dni there is no fiction the prime minister has guaranteed to the president our full cooperation in launching mkg mkg had emerged as product and leader of the american technocratic society which had grown up round nuclear science and missilery he had graduated from the famous naval research laboratory and as the nations top scientist had been picked for the vicepresidency as a result an aura of glamour had developed round this office which in the past had been regarded as rather a backwater consonant with americas lead in the space race and mkgs not inconsiderable part in it the united statesand the worldhad watched the youthful mkg in his thirties train as an astronaut and set the seal on his devotion to space exploration by actually making a trial orbit and splashdown from that moment he was the darling of the nation in brief mkg personified the rule of science in the space age peace said as if following my line of thought mkg is a navy man through and through he has what the us navy calls inhouse capability but this isnt a simple orbiting job like he has done before its the big thing mkg will spaceliaise and land on santa fe the americans had christened their principal skyport for davis and actons moonshot after the great trail of the old west which certainly sounded more homey than the official designation space logistics maintenance and rescue spacecraft without my asking mamzelle adele took my glass and poured me a stiff shot from the brandy decanter peace also splashed more liquor into his rummer he was very tense all the world knew that peace a nuclear submarine commander and one of the bright stars of britains new navy had headed the topflight snap team to the united states after meeting peace and the british team mkg had been sold on the snap miniature power plant for missiles and by virtue of his scientific status had been designated by the president to head the maze of committees handling atomic energy projects with mkgs endorsement of snap it looked as though the world was to benefit from a highlysuccessful angloamerican space project then davis and acton reached the moon in a sirius an air force liquidfuelled rocket the americans went crazy over sirius despite the fact that it was hinted although not officially admitted that its failure to return safely to earth had been due to the erratic behaviour of the capsules solarpowered batteries the two astronauts had been unable because of power failures to reenter the earths atmosphere and had been burned up with their spaceship the builtin genius of snap averred mkg and peace would prevent any similar recurrence in future a bitter controversy had arisen and the british public then became aware of the complicated system of checks and balances which operated in the american atomic programme they learned that overall control of the atom in the united states was vested in the atomic energy commission a civilian body of five appointed by the president but that the budget and legislative side was handled by the joint congres sional committee on atomic energy whose eighteen members divided equally between the senate and the house were policymakers and watchdogs the commission also relied on the advice of its own body of nuclear experts this body despite pressure by mkg and the presidentwho was known to favour snapthrew out the british project the british public became aware at the same time of a revival of the old rivalries between the american services mkg and snap stood for the navy sirius for the air force the air force rightly pointed to the successful moon landing and countered the navys claims by insisting that snap had never been tested in space whereas sirius had and moreover snap was a nonamerican motor which should give way to american enterprise peace had made himself very unpopular in the united states because of his outspoken criticism of the dropping of snap his remark that sirius was no more than a landbased missile of little advanced strategic value had aroused a storm of resentment amongst the american populace blinded by the success of their two astronauts in reaching the moon first peace had returned with the snap team to england licking his wounds still a target for american criticism now he and the dni were talking of launching mkg himself into space i got to my feet and faced peace are you really serious about this incredible idea of shanghaiing americas top scientist in order to launch him into space to prove the value of snap we are not shanghaiing him mkg wants to go i turned to the dni but he ignored me and picked up his tiny punch and hammer taptap taptap the dni prised loose a chip of shale i should have made it clear this is not a kidnapping job it is more than that if geoffrey got the publicity works for his socalled funeral imagine i said what mkgs launching will be like a roundbyround secondbysecond commentary by every radio and television station in the world taptap taptap the dni let my words fall dead peace stared into his brandy i was conscious of mamzelle adeles eyes on me then the dni looked up and hooked his thumb into the eyesocket of the fossil he said mkg goes alone no publicity you john and geoffrey and mamzelle adele apart from a handful of expertswill be the only people present at the launch siriuss sendoff from cape kennedy with the two american moon astronauts aboard had been one of the most spectacular shows the world had seen to date now the dni was talking of a secret launch of the vicepresident with a handful of men and one woman youre talking in riddles i said shortly peace inclined his head slightly towards the dni as if he masterbrainwasher that he was should explain the measure of rapport between them was plain to see you see began the dni mkg is a navy man i realizedthe sea the dni had moulded the great new royal navy with peace as its star mkg was the navygraduated supreme technocrat of the space age the common bond which held them together was the sea man is the sea the pedantic voice said softly he tapped the fossil skull this creature was the remote ancestor of old fourlegs the coelacanth fish that science asserted had been extinct in these very waters of limuria for millions of years today the coelacanth still swims among the drowned peaks of limuria man came from the sea he must find his salvation againin the sea the ultimate weapon in his hand must befrom the sea peace saw what i was thinking snap was to power the ultimate weapon that is what mkg and his team had been working on observed the dni the ultimate weapon it was to be fired from the sea and i said slowly congress threw it out there was a rasp in his voice the pentagon has a military liaison committee which works with the atomic energy commission they were all for it but it was the joint congressional committee on atomic energy drawn from the senate and the house which put paid to it they like their experts were blinded by the moon landing they hold the pursestrings it wasnt congress but this joint committee which killed it they threw away the ultimate weapon which mkg and his team had developed in favour of a modified sirius rocket snapa small magnificently ingenious machine was to have provided the power for the new weapon the power plant was the one thing in which american genius had not quite succeeded snap the briton was to be married to the american little bear little bear the dni smiled thinly yes thats its namelittle bear you would have thought the americans would have learned from their past experience over the nuclear submarine and the polaris missile both of which in a previous epoch nearly underwent the same fate as little bear the most underrated and underpublicized breakthrough in the whole history of modern armaments was the polaris missile the americans for all their publicityconsciousness did it less than justice the first crude polaris fired from a submarine submerged hundreds of feet down introduced a completely new concept into war the voice became schoolmasterish up to then all war had been a battle of refinements but polaris was the untraceable missile fired from an untraceable source a submerged submarine a minute pinpoint in the ocean deeps beyond the power of any tracking device to locate polaris was crude but the concept was right crude i exclaimed jesus christ i gulped down my brandy i dont mean the weapon itself went on the dni there were fantastic refinements of guidance pioneer work on solid fuel blastoff in the confined space of a subs hulli mean the principle was crude polaris was dependent on extraneous factors the vulnerability and complexity of the submarine the human factor of the men in herno the concept needed simplifying to be fully effective the sirius rocket i began the dni picked up his punch and tiny hammer and inched it round a sliver of bone taptap taptap it was as inexorable as chinese watertorture the dni became more emphatic sirius a liquidfuelled rocket put two men on the moon it is useless for anything else it has no strategic concept tactical yes but it is simply an old artillerypiece superrefined i looked at peace as the dni returned to his tapping peace said about two years ago wethat is the snap teamevolved what we considered a firstclass miniaturized power plant for missiles i naturally informed the dni i then went to washington where i met mkg for the first time i knew geoffrey peace that would be fertile soil for a friendship he smiled easing the tension and adele flicked a grateful look at me when mkg heard about snap he indicated that they themselves were working on an exciting new weapon i too met mkg in the united statesa very remarkable man said the dni at our first meeting i had the temerity to suggest that polaristhe new polaris as i conceived itwould rule the world with me it was purely an idea but mkg revealed that he and his team were in fact working in a practical way on just such an ultimate weapon i offered them snap from that moment there was no question but that we would go along with them you know the president has delegated so much of his authority in all things atomic to mkgand rightly sothat the sayso is virtually his in the maze of committees clustered round all nuclear projects except peace put in in the joint congressional committee on atomic energy the dni frowned and went on mkgs missile had only a code number but we three mkg geoffrey and i decided to keep the generic name polaris so we called the new weapon little bear for polaris the pole star is the brightest star of ursa minor the little bear constellation he smiled with grim satisfaction little bear is all hell i felt the dni had been carried away i shrugged little bear is still only a refined polaris fired from a nuclear submarine it is not fired from a submarine he replied little bear is completely selfcontained it is like a big submersible mine the missile proper fits inside a casing it is sunk hundreds of feet beneath the sea and is virtually untraceable since its radio antenna sticks up only a foot or two it is fired by ultra longwave radio from thousands of miles away like polaris though a shot of compressed air lifts it to the surface after which the solidfuel motor takes over the ultimate weaponalmost i conceded but its still not wholly independent little bears inertial guidance system is preset on its target continued the dni once the missile is down it cannot be changed until the whole thing is brought to the surface again its enough thoughlittle bear is fully independent of gantries crews tracker teams and all the complicated paraphernalia of the sirius moonrocket it guides itself like the old polaris little bear is compact reliablea killer in the truest sense the prime minister promised full british support for the little bear project said peace you can see what it means to the navy it puts us up alongside the americans both of you talk as if little bear were a fact i thought you said little bear was killed dead finished i pointed out the dni started his unnerving tapping again mamzelle adeles long fingers tattooed on nossi bes head in sympathy hers looked like the long fingers of an artist or a pianist where did she fit into this strange project no replied the dni on paper little bear is finished but mkg believes as we do that little bear is the ultimate weapon which puts the west way out ahead officially little bear cannot be revived but mkg to prove its worth will rocket to santa fe in little bear think added mamzelle adele the vicepresident of the united states the nations darling said peace what about cape kennedy i started to say how asked the dni how could he use the facilities there for a project which has been axed i shook my head peace went on little bear was practically complete when the axe fell it was tested in secret there are just a few little bear prototypes in existence the one which mkg will use to santa fe will be readied by a small teamfour or five american expertsunder dr boz blair another genius from the naval research laboratory at anacostia who is coming to limuria for the launch from our side it will be us and captain trevordavis the top british missileman who was with geoffrey in washington on the snap project our mission is simply to get mkg safely into space the american experts will come out in a freighter carrying the missile and mkg in the navys latest sub usn willowtrack my mind went back to the intruder with so many people in the know it is easy to see why the cia became suspicious the dni looked uneasy but retorted no one could undertake a project of this magnitude without outside help the us navys in the know because they appreciate as we do the enormous implications of this ultimate of weapons the navy was quite willing for the sake of a man of mkgs status and prestige to detach a nuclear sub to bring him to limuria the navy also feels pretty sore about the sirius rocket you must realize how bitter interservice rivalries are in the united states the air force is now completely cockahoop about sirius and billions are coming its way for future moonshots the navy is solid behind mkg the vicepresident isnt only a man hes a vital cog in the american constitutional system i objected i dont see a vicepresident simply chucking everything overboard in order to be shot off secretly into space any man who acted so irresponsibly wouldnt be fit to hold the office of vicepresident it was a big decision to take replied the dni thoughtfully and it could not have been done without the fullunofficialendorsement of the president the president like mkg and ourselves appreciates the value of little bear america will be supreme in a military sense for at least a decade by virtue of little bear the president is taking a calculated risk hes deputed willowtrack with an s special gold crew to bring mkg out her skipper is revs tyler and you know what that means revs tyler was the man who rose to fame and earned his nickname by taking a nuclear sub feet under the ice of the south pole to prove to the sceptics that a deepwater channel existed between the two halves of the antartic continent cut by a seasonal warm current tyler made the run at full speed dodging ice projections the size of a skyscraper at knots knowing that one touch would have sent him and his crew to instant death more revolutions he demanded throughout this amazing voyage always more revs is revs in on the secret too i asked up to a point only replied peace he and his crew naturally know they have the vicepresident aboard but they believe he is to conduct firing tests on a new secret missile after all theres nothing unusual in that except that its so far away from home dont forget either that mkgs a trained astronaut theres a sword of damocles over this whole mission said the dni gravely its something you must not lose sight ofi watched peaces mouth go taut as the dni said it and the cruel ruthless lines assert themselves little bear was not only a personal matter with him the future of the new royal navy depended on it willowtrack has orders to make the voyage submerged went on the dni but both the president and mkg were adamant that there should be a daily signal from willow track to the white house in code he smiled slightly i suggested twilight every eveningas the uboats used to do when the light makes it the most difficult time of day to spot a sub on the surface a nuclear sub doesnt have to surface i said i know i know he replied impatiently but it is a good time willowtrack will simply stick up a radio antenna and signal the white house in order to preserve maximum security no other signals or reception will be permitted and if revs tylers in command hell keep to thathe wont even listen to a newscast peaces face was bleak i wanted full radio silence the dni went on if for any reason whatever in the intricate complex of the american political system it is necessary for mkg to return to the united states the mission will be called off mkgs first duty is to the american nation not to little bear the royal navy or ourselves he turner on peace his voice very quiet do i make myself clear peace said nothing the dni picked up the hammer and punch taptap the prim voice was in deadly earnest unless i have a categorical undertaking from you geoffrey the little bear mission is offnow peace looked down at his hands the hands which had sent so many men to their deaths turned the palms inwards and the knuckles outwards again a strange sinister gesture he nodded adeles face was pale like me she realized what it must have cost peace to put a halter and bridle on a mission so close to his heart the dni went on quickly trying to obliterate the tension the original plan called for geoffrey to go to st brandon in hms devastation our newest nuclear sub and rendezvous there with willowtrack and mkg the two subs would then go to a remote island called loveapple crossing willowtrack would receive her onward briefing at st brandon tyler doesnt know where the testfire is scheduled from as an additional security measure we chartered a french freighter called the semittante trading to these waters to carry little bear boz blair and the scientists are signed on as ordinary members of semittantes crew semittantethat was the name of one of napoleons frigates mamzelle adele exclaimed peace smiled for the first time not this semittantejust an old battered tramp grown rusty humping guano and coconuts from limuria to whoever wants them anywhere in the world i said to peace i wondered why you took bellatrix past loveapple crossing on our way to the seychelles mamzelle adele smiled her strange smile another strange name loveapple crossing is a speck on the map and most maps of limuria are old about miles east of the beautiful twin island of agalega which is situated almost exactly halfway between st brandon and the seychelles from mahe it was about miles east again of loveapple crossing is a great collection of shoals and shallow banks over square miles each in extent where the ancient peaks of limuria project above the sea you say original planwhat is the new one i asked peace glanced across at the dni the news of the firing of little bear has leaked out the dni added quickly a partial leak only i looked from one to the other the cia man at the coffin it proved what we suspected said the dni and it doesnt make us any easier in our minds somebody in the united states has been asking what mkg is up to the president considered that it would be quite safe for him to be missing from the public scene on the grounds that he was carrying out secret work hes a bachelor as you know so we dont have to worry about home security but how would your mind work if you were in the cia or connected with it or had confided in it if suddenly both mkg and peace were missing where peace was mkg might be i replied we made no secret about geoffrey coming to the seychellesafter all its the biggest missile launch site outside the united states you dont have to be a genius to work out that mkg might be here tooif you had the right clue to start with therefore the dni went on quickly iwehad to convince the world that geoffrey peace was dead all suspicions had to be stifled they had to see him go to his grave hence the funeral buildup remember that stethoscope i said the cia wasnt one hundred per cent convinced im glad i didnt give him time enough to find out you were alive in the coffin geoffrey peace said warmly we owe you a big debt of gratitude for that john i always could count on you in a tough spot it worries me that he went free said the dni maybe we should change the plan again not now broke in peace john we want your navigational skill how i asked ive said the original plan was for willowtrack and devastation to meet at st brandon and go together to the firingpoint at loveapple crossing actually its not the island itself but a spot at sea near by using a nuclear subs gadgets you cant go wrong in pinpointing a minute spot like that now weve had to change all that we feel certain that any unusual movement of subs in these waters is being watched loveapple crossing is right in the middle of the missile firingrange nuclear subs give off electrical emissions two and two make little bear said mamzelle adele the plan for the two subs to rendezvous at st brandon still stands said the dni taking up peaces explanation willowtracks daily sunset signal is to and from the white house only its at a fixed time and as brief as they can make it for obvious reasons but weve decided to change the whole plan from the st brandon rendezvous onwards you john will take bellatrix to st brandon geoffrey goes to devastation bob peters devastations number one is in the plot and the officers know no more than that peace is not dead but involved in some hushhush britishamerican experimental missilefiring project theyre all top men they wont talk little bear is being carried in semittanth under the guise of a new coconutoil plant for the islands mamzelle adele smiled the two main exports of limuria are coconut oil and rugged individualism semittante is bound for loveapple crossing from new orleans she was just too glad to get a load to take her halfway across the world youll rendezvous with her there peace prowled about uneasily i could see that the incident of the cia man was eating into him as the dni elaborated the launching programme there is an exact firing schedule to be met continued the dni you dont simply point a missile at sante fe and blast off trajectories orbits what have youboz blair and mkg have them all taped as far as we are concerned all we have to know is that little bears instrumentation has been set to coincide with the optimum position of the earth relative to the space station sante fe tomorrow is february st on february th sante fe will be at its best orbital position for little bear to rendezvousspaceliaise with it the missile has a computercompensated docking device which will guide it in to sante fe little bear must be fired at nine oclock on the morning of february th hours on february th local limuria time yes eight oclock is no good nor is seven it must be nine peace put in using a radiofiring device i shall pull the plug on mkgs behalf six hundred feet down in the sea pull the plug fire the bloody thing peace retorted the tone of his reply betrayed his anxieties the ultimate push of the button is from the surfacea small instrument tuned in to the radio antenna which little bear shoots to the surface when she is at the right depth mkg does the countdown i send the bird flying he suddenly swung round on me all of ushave been taking one big factor for granted are you in this thing with us i looked round the three facespeace hard dedicated ruthless the dni with his pedagogic whims overlying the tempered blade beneath mamzelle adelewhat did i know of her yes i replied yes of course all i need is a good set of navigating instruments the dni relaxed i felt peace had been sure of me all along despite his question ive got the best he said nothing that gives off a single amp of power its all skilljohn garlands skill good ill want to check them over peace went on speaking to the others his tone warm all this man needs is the traditional star to steer her by he i cut short his eulogy we cant launch a missile without radio guidance the dni gave a short laugh youre saying almost exactly what the early american landbased missileers said about the first seabased polaris admiral red raborn the father of polaris confounded the critics he successfully fired polaris from a moving platform in a liquid evershifting medium because he went back to that primary element at the base of all mans activitythe sea youll have lots of technicalities thrown at you in the next few weeks but sins is the heart of it all tell him geoffrey ships inertial navigation system he explained raborn put his guidance package inside polaris it needed no help from outsideradio guidance or the rest of it weve done the same with little bear a development of the a polaris now in service with the us fleet our little bear follows the same pattern of course the sins system has now become highly sophisticated in little bearthe guidance package is a marvel boz blair will talk for days about it but essentially it is a selfcontained missile inside its own casing a combination of mine and torpedotube how big is it i asked the missile itself is forty feet long six feet across and weighs twenty tons replied peace the casing is another fifteen feet in length all of it is highly streamlined the casing is so to speak the gunbarrel it seems so involved and yet so simple can a handful of men really get a thing like that to a launchpoint at sea its highly streamlined replied the dni has to be goes through water air space its a piece of cake for bellatrix to tow it to sea peace replied you could do it with an outboard motor what about the submersion its got ballast tanks like a sub to take it down it is kept at a constant firing angle by two mated gyroscopes if you want to hear all about accelerometers earth rate and coriolis computers automatic precision fathometers and all the rest of it boz blair will oblige with the greatest pleasure our job is to get little bear in position to fire when sequencer starts an hour before blastoff sequencer whats that countdown he replied weve got to have mkg in position one hundred fathoms down before eight oclock i suggest we pull rods at dawn and have little bear hot to trot by seventhirty i looked helplessly at mamzelle adele im as foxed as you are she said peace smiled all the terms like those of the nuclear subs are americanrightly so after all they pioneered the damn things translated we must get the snap nuclear reactor operating by dawn so that little bear is ready to be launched from seventhirty onwards countdown to begin an hour before blastoff you dont have to know any of thisboz blair and mkg have the most detailed schedules and technicalities written downpages and pages of it theres a firing checklist as long as your arm too the dni broke in the americans are great on code names we looked for one when the little bear project was under way originally it went under the code name brickbat zero onehighest priority top secret most urgent the lot weve kept thatbrickbat zero one i turned away from technicalities to something close at hand and where does mamzelle adele come into all this code and cipher expert said the dni briefly my best girl break anything wide open i thought she was an islander i am she smiled making a gesture as if to lay her hand on my arm adele dauguet my father did hold a jouissance at st brandon and it covered loveapple crossing what sir george didnt say was that theres only one landingplace on loveapple crossing and its called vingtcinq coups twentyfive lashes something cold seemed to come into the conversation as she said it loveapple crossing was a solitary confinement cell for the agalega plantations in the slavery days she explained vingtcinq coups means exactly what it saystwentyfive lashes you can still see the remains of the flogging grating there peace was watching her calculatingly as he had done at dinner both she and the dni sensed his scrutiny the dni said adele was one of my girls in london and when this project first blew up what more perfect cover than a girl from the islands teaching creole to an old dodderer of a naval officer in retirement she blushed slightly i dont think thats the way the locals look at it it was necessary retorted the dni crisply a whiff of scandal only gave credence to it so i said slowly to the dni you arent even retired officially he smiled but the prime minister and i remain in close touch he turned to peace i wonder if we couldnt risk taking maude along too another woman i burst out adele gave a low laugh maud eshort for morse automatic decoder peace grinned too i think maude can stay at homeher power system might give the game away from what you say adeles quite good enough the dni was conspiratorial one of my men smuggled the new us navy codebook to me we can read anything the us navy sends peace whistled offence punishable w i t h the dni nodded adeles been swotting up on it mkg also sent methis he took from his pocket what looked like a magnetic tape casset and switched on the radiograms tape recorder i want you both to memorize this he said its from the us navys antisubmarine warfare library he turned up the volume the sound came through foggily a jumjumjum noise and then a faint squeak then the noise blanked out giving way to a dissipated crackling like breaking cream crackers by the thousand then a faint irregular hammering peaces jaw was tense and his head slightly cocked jumjumjumsqueak crackle silence then a low droning hum like a generator sound signature of a nuclear subdeep said peace with satisfaction not in these waters though jumjumjum squeak the dni gestured willowtracks sound peace whistled softly this could be worth almost anythingin the wrong hands i asked whats the rest of it besides the main noise fish the dni nodded the crackle is shrimp this was recorded off greenland bywell let us say by an unauthorized source jumjumjumsqueak peace said why dont they fix that circ pump its the biggest giveaway you wouldnt believe what heartache that little squeak has caused replied the dni its a special seal where the driveshaft enters the pump oddly theres nothing wrong with it the nearest the backroom boys have got to it is saying that it is caused by some sort of ultrasonic vibration revs tyler had this seal in willowtrack unseal itself a thousand feet beneath the south pole peace said grimly only revs could have made it after that he turned to me youll play act about my death still but you must of course tell mac after a couple of days youll give out that youre taking bellatrix back to south africa for sale in accordance with my will youll let it be known that youre going back via madagascar trevordavis will come aboard at night keep him out of sight when you leave port steer a course for a couple of hundred miles as if you really were heading towards africa then double back and make for st brandon at your best speed well meet you there mkg and i what about willowtrack i began shes due at st brandon after thirtysix days mainly submerged from connecticut and if i know revs hell be there to the hour peace replied he added no radio radar or other transmissions from bellatrix better keep even the receiving radio dead until youre out of range of all the tracking equipment of the missile range youve forgotten mamzelle adele said the dni she goes with you john my heart lifted and she smiled back at me suddenly despite the extraordinary nature of the project life felt very good johannesburg naccam highpowered sales talk all seemed a very long way away it was the dnis cold voice which brought back the dangers the realities of the mission there is a complex meshing together in brickbat zero one of imponderables all sorts of factors which could ruin the projector cost someones life he said mkg might even find himself a victim rather than a conqueror of space the gentleness of his voice made it sound more sinister the missilemen always allow an extra safety margin for the imponderables i have tried to do the same they also have a name for it they call it the jesus factor peace said nuclear highway the black whalebacked sail rose sinisterly out of the sea half a cables length to port her identification numbers had been newly painted out and above the fairwateri still thought of it as a conningtowerrose periscope masts radar and radio antenna the long shape of the nuclear sub swung and held station on bellatrix it was our second morning at sea two days after the meeting in the dnis cottage i was in the wheelhouse after breakfast it was a perfect day bellatrix under my command had cleared the seychelles bank and was making a breathtaking eighteen knots i could almost hear mac singing along with the twin rollsroyce diesels captain trevordavis the royal navy missile expert was checking the fuel levels below i had taken an immediate liking to this tall flaxenhaired englishman when he had come aboard bellatrix in port victoria the night before we sailed he said little yet there was a sense of strong competence about him i saw why the dni had chosen him for the job out to starboard a white line of foam announced la perle reef when we had first sighted mamzelle adele and i from the weatherdeck dinette during breakfast she had asked me to take her up on the coachroof to see my heart missed a beat at her unusual loveliness as the northwesterly wind blew her hair into her eyes and i slipped my arm round her shoulders for a thousand miles to every point of the compass limuria stretched away from the submerged continent under our keel life had first sprung millions of years ago and now from its deeps again a man would try to make a strange imperishable and wonderful new journey in a vehicle named after the stars i found myself sharing my thoughts with adele but when she looked gravely up into my eyes the dnis words hit us bothsomewhere was the jesus factor somehow her own presence on board threw that warning into sharper relief despite the mild morning she shuddered with a sense of foreboding without a word she turned and went to her luxury cabin belowdecks i occupied peaces own weatherdeck cabin which commanded an unimpaired view of the ocean i switched bellatrixs helm over to the sperry auto and kept the telegraphs at full ahead the sub kept pace effortlessly three figures appeared on the black bridge minute by comparison with the rest of the structure i focused my glasses on them an officer picked up a microphone from its waterproof housing and looked across the stretch of sea between the two craft the closeness of the metallic voice of the loudhailer took me by surprise it brought adele and trevordavis to the wheelhouse at a run bellatrix keep course and heave to understood it was an english voice at least i clicked on bellatrixs own loudhailer who are you the other voice came back imperative do you understand trevordavis said quietly devastation class look at the flared bow yes i replied understood adele stood next to me john this isnt part of the plan trevordavis said reflectively the plans only two or three days old too the metallic voice from across the water said bellatrix is that mr garland yes captains compliments we are sending a boat for you and there was the slightest pause mamzelle adele what was peace up to i asked myself angrily the dni had ordered him explicitly to take devastation to st brandon and here he was hundreds of miles out of his way had peace after i had sailed prevailed on the dni to change plans again in the light of the cias snoopings i had kept rigid radio silence in bellatrix as the dni had instructed and had cut down the use of the electrics to the minimum i used the engineroom voicepipe mactheres a big sub alongsidenumbers painted out i think it must be devasta tion stop will you there was something suspiciously like a chuckle at the other end i would never forget the moment when i told mac that peace was still alive it had been worth all the glory of limuria macs allegiance to peace right or wrong had never known any bounds and since setting out in the knowledge that his beloved skipper was indeed still alive he had been less dour than i had ever known him commander peace requests that you and the lady bring some clothes give you ten minutes i shrugged at adele no point in arguingo k ok but what about me what about you a woman aboard a nuclear submarine trevordavis smiled slightly these new subs have every creature comfort mamzelle adexle hot baths washing machines the lot she still seemed very uneasy john i thought commander peace would have stuck to orders her tension communicated itself to me she was putting into words what i had felt from the moment the long shape had surfaced mac joined us before i could reply what the bluidy hell is the skipper playing at he grumbled goodnaturedly i thought the sub circled bellatrix which was now stopped bellatrix came the loudhailer captain trevordavis to assume command macfadden to remain you are to steer a course of onesixzero true repeat onesixzero true bellatrix will proceed on that course at twelve knotsrepeat twelve knotsuntil again intercepted is that clear i turned questioningly to trevordavis he nodded not to worry i said theres no land in any direction for six hundred miles i marked our position on the chart not an hour ago no other ships he asked laconically this is a prohibited areamissile range dont forget adele said ill get my things together slacks i replied dont try to be glamorous aboard a submarine pants are womans best friend for the modest negotiation of ladders hatches and watertight bulkheads she smiled but she was worried thanks bellatrix called the sub have you briefed captain trevordavis and your engineer any problems briefing complete i replied what about the weather seems good enough came the curt reply nothing exciting from chagos in the chagos archipelago south of ceylon the limuria squadron maintained a big weather station chagos is where cyclones are born this was the cyclone season in the sea of limuria adele was waiting in the wheelhouse when i returned with my hastilypacked case trevordavis was as economical as ever with his words when i said goodbye i resisted the temptation to call the anonymous subs name on the loudhailer in the traditional manner of the sea ready standing by for your boat as we watched a topside handling party debouched on to the subs casing deck a rubber dinghy pulled clear of her side i noticed that devastation lay deep and air hissed round the hull like a hippo surfacing i helped adele to the dinghy as it came alongside and willing hands assisted her the gunners mate in charge looked up at me and winked from a deadpan face we pulled across to devastation a rating waited on her deck for us round his waist he wore a monkeytail safetybelt with a chain and traveller running on rails along the deck here indeed was a far cry from the days when submarines risked their lives unprotected on the casing in foul weather the officerofthedeckthe oodlooked down from his high perch he sang out controlbridge hereblow forward grow for one second air burped and the deck lifteda raleighlike spaceage courtesy which kept adeles plimsolled feet dry as she held out her hand to the monkeytail rating the gunners mate lifted her under the arms and snicked a quickrelease safetybelt about her i could imagine the way this story would be told in the mess follow the tramrails miss he grinned cant go wrong first stage fare fourpence mind the step our arrival crowded the tiny bridge its lack of instruments surprised memerely a mc set to communicate with the control centre in the subs heart a gyro repeater a loudhailer mike collision and diving alarms and rudderangle indicator all heavily waterproofed behind the radar radio mast and twin periscopes were snugged down alongside an upwardseeing televisioncamera eye controlbridge bellatrix range three hundred yards and steady the ood listened aye aye sir stand by to dive he leaned over the bridge handrail at the double boat party below he glanced round the horizon and pressed the diving alarm clear the bridge clear the bridge the two lookouts stood back and raced past below as the raucous sound came uphere at least was something familiar from my submarine daysthe oldfashioned ahooga of the alarm klaxon i gripped adeles arm and ducked through the hatch the ood followed snapping it shut with a length of steel cable the quartermaster flattened himself to allow us to edge by then he spun a wheel and secured the hatch the compartment into which we emerged was shadowed unreal infrared light muted the faces of the eight or so men who stood about in the glow of the luminous instruments my eyes automatically went to the nervecentrethe periscope stand caught by the strange light drops of water from a faulty packing gland seeped down the barrel peace stood there his mouth tight his whole being alert a black sweater and matching dacron trousers gave him the same sort of swaggering deadly look as the great uboat aces it was a silhouette i would remember all my life the tight compactness of the control centre was a newold world for methe intricacy of valves cables lights and electronics two planesmen sat in deep red leather chairs before what might have been an aircrafts instrument panel their hands gripping halfwheel joystick columns to dive and steer the sub behind them was the diving officer one arm draped carelessly over the sail planesmans chair the soft red glow of the compass repeater lit their faces its red merged into the green fluorescence of the radar a few feet away on the ballastcontrol panel glowed a series of straight little red barssubmariners call it the christmas tree the red bars indicated i was to learn a straight board which meant that all the openings in the subs hull were closed beyond the divingstand to starboard was the sonarroom and aft the radioroom abutting on to the navigators chart desk the inertial guidance system the fathometers and the television eye the agglomeration of sounds in the control centre was new to me intriguing the discreet burr of the hydraulics generators and turbines in place of the thumping diesels fumes and stink of the old subs a highpitched whine from the fathometer a lionlike purr from the sonar most unfamiliar was the warm waxlike smell instead of the doggy odour of the old boats the bright colours toothe floor was inset with bright red vinyl blocks among discreet greys and greens so far i had not heard a command this was the stillness of automation then the radar operators voice came over the loudspeaker contact now bears threezerozero true range opening peace drew to his mouth a microphone on a flexible cable his orders were clipped and tight his dark clothes merged into the shadows he seemed disembodied shut the induction he ordered his eyes rested imper sonally on me for a moment and then went round the control centre all clear topside called the ood open the vents the petty officers fingers played on the toggle switches of the ballastcontrol panel like an electric organ i noticed peace incline his body slightly as if by reflex as the water poured into the tanks adele looked at me awed by the complexity of the intricate fighting machine from that moment too i think she gained a new respect for peace his eyes were everywhere right full rudder ahead full four hundred feet smartly he ordered steady on course zeroninezero one planesman reached up and turned the handle of the engineroom annunciatorsin my day we called them engineroom telegraphsto ahead full a red pointer responded answers ahead full sir another voice said course steady on zeroninezero sir the sonar operator came through contact now bears twoseventwo degrees true peace nodded satisfied the exec was looking across at him from his station okay number one i grinned to myself at the familiar termnowadays it is exec the exec replied four hundred feet sir speed sixteen knots steady on zeroninezero take over number one will you aye aye sir how much water under her the fathometer operator replied without waiting for the direct question via the diving officer eighteen hundred and seventyfive fathoms sir eleven thousand feet certainly devastation was not yet over the ancient landmass of limuria peace gave a quick glance at the riggedfordive panel and nodded to adele and me to follow him into the dark passageway he strode quickly down to his cabin door and flung it open not waiting for us we stepped into a small compact room lshaped with a pulldown bunk littered with papers there was also a small folding desk a safe steel locker cocktailbar type stools a foldup washbasin snugged into the wall and no fewer than three telephones and two intercoms by the foot of the bunk in the steel wall were a gyro repeater fathometer repeater and speed indicator i saw that this section of the wall was in fact a door leading to a pintsized shower and toilet cubicle here indeed was luxury for a submariner i found myself blinding in the cheerful white light reflecting off the eaudenil colour scheme red floor green shellbacked rubber matting and blue ceiling pale as a limuria dawn pansy isnt it said peace abruptly scrabbling among the papers on the bunk psycho boffins say its good for morale but give me battleship grey any time as he spoke peaces eyes strayed to the gyro compass repeater mine followed only then did the significance of the new course he had given in the control centre strike me zeroninezeroa ninetydegree turn away from bellatrix we had turned away from the rendezvous at st brandon i gestured at the compass geoffreywhat the devil this submarine is heading away from its course to meet mkg its heading for saya de malha a glance at adele was enough to show that she was equally puzzled the bleak troubleerupting look was in peaces hard face yes he said curtly im heading for saya de malha why i demanded id sailed with peace long enough to respect his seafoxiness but his intended breakin into thousands of square miles of shoals coralheads innumerable seadeeps and unmapped islets seemed madness there was a pause for a moment the only soundin the tiny cabin was the distant hum of turbines adele made a tiny gesture of helplessness with one hand then peace said your intruderhe was back the cottage peace nodded in grudging admiration yes he got past the guard which was pretty smart but he hadnt reckoned with the dni every room was wired with its own independent alarmsystem working off a separate circuit the cia man craftily immobilized the first one which worked off the mains that in itself must have taken some doing but he walked into the second like a fly into a spiders web who was he asked adele my one and only glimpse of him was sprinting across the lawn tall wellbuilt plenty of muscle thats him i kept out of the way added peace it was a hell of a temptation to go out and mix it with him but in that case he would have got what he came for a sight of me i had to content myself with a long shot as he ran any luck he shrugged maybe maybe not he stumbled but it could have been a blind but one thing it told him for a house to be protected like that meant it had a big secret somewhere the dni and i decided to change the plan then and there thats why i intercepted bellatrix i couldnt signal you because of your radio silence moreover it might have given the show away i jerked my head upwards identification numbers painted out thats the least of it he said and youre still going ahead with little bear his determined look answered me my first duty is to this mission it means more to me even than it will mean in terms of balance of power between west and east snap is mine little bear is supreme power at sea for whoever has it no wonder he had jibbed when the dni had pressed him to agree that micas first duty was to the american nation assume he went on slowly that the cia only suspected devastation was on her waywhat then all the nuclear subs based in the seychelles take the milkrun route through deep water to st brandon at any time experts could pinpoint devastation downrange within a few miles but he added grimly not in the saya de malha what about the rendezvous interrupted adele drawing closer to me i intend to keep the rendezvous he replied red indians used to cut branches and brush out their trail im brushing out devastations trail just in case once in the saya de malha the tracking stations in the seychelles and chagos will never find this sub he let the words fall dead and then said sombrely this is a topsecret mission and i intend it to remain so i think i know a new nuclear highway through the drowned land of limuria i gave an involuntary shudder on the map saya de malha looks like a disney elephants head with a sawnoff trunk blowing bubblegum the bubble is the small northern sector the head is the south between is a gap of fifteen to twenty milesno one knows exactlyand through this peace would have to dive the depths were vague but the overall picture was clear as cruel a collection of shoals as any sailor could hope to miss and after saya de malha i asked a deep dive between the saya de malha and the nazareth bank then st brandon i shook my head peace was laying his ship open to the gravest risk making a mile corkscrew through shoal waters which have a traditionally evil reputation among sailors rather than following a straight course to the rendezvous i started to object but he shrugged off my words and said to adele youll take this cabin he opened the door which led into the shower decorated with gay flameproof curtains toilet shower john and i will shack down on the other side in bob peterss cabin we share the facilities hell have to hotbunk somewhere he swept the coverlet from the bunk as he gathered up some papers looks like a damn geishas kimono he snapped there was a knock at the door and a rating handed peace a signal he read it through quickly and dismissed the man who looked grey with fatigue adele glanced at me and said commander peace that signalman looked dead on his f e e t this is a secret mission he replied curtly twentyfour hour shifts too bad if he cant stand up to it its my field code and communications she went on impulsively ill gladly take a shift peaces reaction astounded me youll stay right here he snapped dont fiddle with the phonesyou might cause a crisis youll be quite comfortable you may not go beyond the control centre without my express permission the colour flushed her face and she turned to me hurt puzzled wanting my support peace turned away and picked up a phone dialling i reached out and touched her arm despite my anger at his harshness i almost blessed peace for that momentary unmasking of her heart ood asked peace commander here all calls to me in future to be directed to the execs cabin he laughed shortly yes your cabin bobjohn and i are taking it over whats the score i heard peters formal reply distorted through the instrument very deep sir weve crossed the eighteenhundredfathom curve sounding is now nineteenhundredfifty fathoms corrected peace raised his eyebrows to me very well plane down to six hundred feet echo range and take soundings continuously where do you reckon well cross the continental shelf cant rightly say sir but navdac estimates about eighteen hundred gmt call me at sixteen hundred earlier if theres anything aye aye sir whats navdac i queried navigational data assimilation centre its a very sophisticated device to pinpoint our positionthe sort of thing we would have used for finding little bears blastoff position had we followed the original planweve got three sins computers and we flood the bloody things with their readings plus data from the radio direction finders the star trackers and the magic box which is really a radio telescope in m i n i a t u r e h e s m i l e d i b r o u g h t y o u a l o n g t o m a t c h a l l that with your skill i relaxed slightly he picked up the bluebound us navy code and said ultratopsecret the dnis parting gift adele was about to speak then bit her lip and turned away i w o n d e r e d w h e t h e r p e a c e e v e n n o t i c e d i m s a c k i n g down he said been up all night come on he led the way to peterss cabin on the other side of the bathroom without a look at adele the cabin was a replica of his own except that it had two bunks i remained silent away from adele the hurt to her seemed magnified in my mind peace lit a cigarette he seemed eager to talk smoke the carbon dioxide scrubbers and gas analyser take care of all that here we make our own fresh air from seawater i took one and lit up not replying peace paced three steps each way he stopped in front of me whats eating you john i met his eyes was the brushoff to adele really necessary geoffrey shes a code and cipher expertyou have the dnis word for it he blew a smokering with careful deliberation she was just too keen thats all what in hell do you mean nice girl very affectionate i felt slightly embarrassed at dinner that night at the dna he went on remember what she said about guns y e s i r e p l i e d i r e m e m b e r c l e a r l y s h e s a i d a c o l t python was better than a detective special h e l o o k e d h a r d a t m e h a n d g u n s n o t g u n s s h e s a i d colt python cadillac among guns no one but an american speaks of handguns in england theyre pistols revolvers small arms but never handguns her entire metaphor was american the implication of what peace said knocked me back youre suggesting shes a double agent i said slowly dont know he replied carefully im just careful with so much cia around and thenso soon after finding out that i intend making for the saya de malha she volunteers for radio duty radiowhom i dont believe it i retorted emphatically i dont believe adele is tied up with the cia intruder he came and clapped me gently on the shoulder i hope for your sake not but theres such a thing as softening up the opposition you know he grinned lopsidedly youre a man who takes some softening up too adele is another good reason for the saya de malha he did not give me time to reply but started pacing up and down the tiny cabin again his uneasiness communicated itself to me whats up geoffrey this ship is an electronic marvel he said choosing his words carefully every marvel aboard her has a backup marvelin other words there are two of everything in case one goes wrong there are not on our assignment he crushed out his cigarette impatiently it iswasall too bloody tailormade take one nuclear sub and meet another eight hundred miles away one thats been practically out of touch with everything for over a month under the sea cruise down a wellcharted ocean highway pick up the vicepresident of the united states rendezvous with semittante an old tramp which has been at sea for god knows how long out of new orleans shoot off the bastard in supermissile practically untried untested mission accomplished its already out of gear i observed dryly the sea john the sea thats the great imponderable the jesus factor i added he nodded we havent allowed for the safety margin of the sea you know it i know it the dmhe doesnt know what it is to love a hunk of metal filled with machines computers and other electrical wonders something that takes you and brings you out on the other side hes cold for him devastation willow track little bear are all expendable us too us too he echoed sombrely he swung on his toes and started to pull the sweater over his head the muscles apparent in his chest and arms like to see the ship he asked get a dosimeter from the hospital orderly to check your exposure to radioactivity but i can tell you now theres less aboard devastation than you get every day in london or new york id like to see the missiles i ventured he held up a small key which hung on a gold chain round his neck i could start a nuclear war with this it unlocks devastations polaris as youre free to go into sherwood forest he made an expressive loop with his arms big sevenfoot steel tubes from keel to deck like treespolaris silos our little bear is experimental but these polaris missiles are operational better get bob to take you round only officers and operating ratings are allowed in sherwood forest sherwood forest itself was a disappointment i felt my heart quicken as bob petersa short cheerful sandyhaired man with quiet shrewd eyesunlocked the main door the compartment consisted merely of double columns of circular tubes wrapped in canvas painted an artistic green there was nothing to show that these were the deadliest missiles afloat in the keels mushroom factory at the base of the missiles i had the same feeling of clinicism rather than power under each polaris a was a big steel ball like an enclosed outsized kaffirpot these were the compressedair flasks which tossed the deadly birds to the surface the same sort of thing was built into the casing of little bear for the initial takeoff peters took me forard through the crews quarters to the torpedocompartments in the bows through a low steel door i saw a heavy bronze tube running out of sight into the bulkhead above set into it was a hatch like an outsize oven door peters explained that this was an escape route for the crew if the sub should be flooded it worked on the principle that when the air pressure inside the tube equalled that of the ocean outside all the five or six men in the bronze tube need do was to rise to the surface a telephone buzzed a rating answered and automatically jumped to attention he handed the instrument to peters for you sir peters listened for a moment and slammed it down quick he said control centre he raced through the ship with me at his heels and reached the control centre breathless the d said quickly sonar reports contact bearing zeroninezero true twelve miles peters took a quick glance at the fathometer whose stylus was clicking and chuckling as he asked all round aye aye sir something massive is blocking our way sayademalha peters snatched up an intercom captain in the controlroom sir in a moment peace pulling on a shirt joined us at the divingstand the sleep seemed to have evaporated from his eyes in the few short moments it took him to get from his cabin to the control centre peters explained the situation briefly peace nodded ahead onethird he ordered six hundred feet chanted the diving officer bring her upfour hundred feet handsomely went on peace the strong sound of the pumpsthe diving officer was careful not to blow the vents for a too rapid rise through water of unknown salinity and temperaturefilled the control centre sonar contact now bears zeroninezero true confused background echoes is it moving no sir steady range and bearing come right to onetwozero ordered peace he swung devastations bows away to point at an oblique angle the sonarman said in his flat voice contact steady on zerosixzero confused background noises what the hell is it i asked peace these are seas with coral formations he replied theoretically there should be a gradual shelving approach towards land or shoals like the saya de malha he swung round depth four hundred the fathometer sounding read fathoms under our keel and on peaces orders devastation lost way hanging in midocean the diving officer stood with his eyes glued to the ballastcontrol panel trimming adjusting holding her delicate balance the sonarman reported contact now bears zerofiveseven ten miles without warning devastation rocketed upwards caught by some formidable power combination of current and salinity flood her downemergency roared peace my ears clicked and clacked as scores of tons of highpressure water poured into the tanks thendevastation plunged downwards in the opposite direction the men in the control centre hung on to the trolleystraps blow negative to the mark rapped the diving officer with a roar like an express train highpressure air creaked against the cork insulation lining the controlroom dome blow secured negative at the mark came the answer shut the flood vent negative pump auxiliaries to sea jenkins geoffrey hunter killer my stomach righted itself as we pulled out of the unexpected dive beads of sweat stood out under peterss eyes peace at the raised periscope stand glanced round with narrowed eyes there was an indefinable atmosphere of fear john it cant be coral said peace limuria i saw it so clearly that i could have laughed limuria had died a million years ago not by volcanic upsurgewhich would have meant customary coral formations but by subsidence by falling into the sea the huge obstacle barring our waywas it the high rim the ancient boundary of limuria a giant rock soupplate resting on the ocean bed the inside of it being the saya de malha my idea would account for the lack of shelving and the shallow unknown broken waters extending over square miles of treacherous ocean i told peace quickly what was in my mind before i had finished he ordered make your depth two hundred feet i was becoming more accustomed to the swift deft responses of the planesinen and the ballast control by god john peace exclaimed after giving the order the only person with the guts to run these shoals was old surcouf the french corsair surcouf logged an island two hundred years ago somewhere off the northern extremity of saya de malha he named it roquepiz today its supposed not to exist i indicated the fathometer but surcouf didnt run like a bull at a gate at his shoals in my minds eye i saw the picture straight ahead the drowned land of limuria a giant rim probably volcanic the wall of a vast plateau on which the ancient continent had stood our sonar showed that the rim lay in a broad arc across our bows inside that rimwhat few except some eighteenthcentury pirates had ever ventured to saya de malha on the surface beneath the ocean we were the first what was under that narrow slot shown on the charts as lying between the main mass of saya de malha and my disney elephants head captain sir it was the sonarman peace and i joined him forard listen to this doppler effect sir t h e o p e r a t o r t u r n e d u p t h e s o n a r s c o p e v o l u m e o n t h e sound reproducer even with the primitive instruments i had been schooled in i had been able to recognize the change in pitch of the echo which comes back to a listening sub from a target or underwater obstacle devastations sona was sophistication itself the doppler effect was clear through the transducer we were converging on a solid object in our path the searching sound went out as a long purrpurr impulse but it returned with a faint break in it land peace too was puzzled aye aye sirbut moreseems something solid is standing out sort of from the land hill no sir you can hear yourself regular all round the clock waves too sir i caught the faint crunch of water on the transducer peace shook his head water not waves could be sir replied the sonarman tiderace against these unidentified objects my mind was out in front in devastations sonardrome where hypersensitive instruments probed ahead through water where sunlight never penetrated parallelling the dark dreadful night of the spirit when all is lost i shuddered we were deeper than man had ever been before over the detritus of a oncegreat continent which had fallen victim to the sea i was afraid peaces voice broke the oppressive silence navigator what is our position w i t h o u t w a i t i n g f o r a r e p l y h e s t r o d e o v e r t o a g l a s s t o p p e d t a b l e u n d e r w h i c h m o v e d a n e e d l e p o i n t o f l i g h t striking up through a chart folded over it the navigator marked its path towards the opening between the two great banks of saya de malha he gestured unspeaking the sonarman chanted formally contact evaluated as land with confused echoes may be surf peace watched the bug as the needlepoint of light is called move across the deadreckoning tracer then he went to another instrument console to watch the nervous whip of the precision depthrecorder stylus on its sensitized paper sketching with frantic haste it seemed every seabed undulation he walked slowly back to his raised stool at the periscope stand glancing halfleft beyond the attack periscope to the depthgauge and courseindicator the crew were tense overattentive to every sound this sort of waiting game is the test of the submariner peace said softly to me theres a temperature or salinity barrier blocking the sonar returni think he paused i dont think its land then as if ashamed of his confession of uncertainty he ordered left fifteen degrees rudder come left to course zerofourfive decrease speed to ahead onethird peace had swung devastations nose in towards the barrier would he dare go in at this depth unconsciously i turned to the person next to me it was adele i whispered keep quiet ease her uptwofifty feet said peace i breathed again with his deadly instinct peace was easing up on his targetwhatever it might be rig for ultraquiet a pall of silence fell on all on every machine not vital to the running of the sub from the sonarrepeater came a curious fogged thump like the sound of a distant diesel peterss eyes were wide with anxiety the thump was followed by a sharp whining swish and a noise like brown paper being crumpled possible goblin contact bearing onezerozero came the sonarmans chant goblin only a hostile submarine is called a goblin catandmousebut devastation had the edge for she had gone ultraquiet first the disembodied voice went on range twelve thousand yards approximate course zerotwozero degrees speed fifteen knots a cold thrill of excitement passed through me as i watched peaces hand reach out for the general alarmbutton he unhooked his command microphone with the other an unidentified submarine was passing across our bows at less than seven miles we knew there were no friendly subs in the area then came a faintly apologetic note in the sonarmans voice contact now evaluated as giant ray he said to peace sorry sir at first i thought it might be a onethirty r pm fish but there was that extra something i couldnt account for fish are a sonarmans nightmare the brown paper crum piing noise we had heard was probably a school of small fish and the sonarman could be forgiven for being ultracautious the operator went on that doppler effect is still there sir it was clearer now a curious sort of measured echo coming back to the transducer the precision depthrecorder showed a steep shelf leading to the entrance slot peace committed devastation the ship was still rigged for ultraquiet peters whispered bottom shaliowing rapidly sir peace went to the precision depthrecorder i saw the twitch of his jaw muscles and his look of surprise john come over here will you the stylus had given up its st vitus dance movements instead it was moving up across down up across in regular patterns its packed up i said briefly no seabed ever looked like that peace shook his head no there are other instruments monitoring this one its okay i peered closer traced on sensitized paper were a number of small rectangular blocks followed by an intersection and then the small blocks began again when the stylus came opposite the next intersecting line peace gave an order and devastation swung along the course of the plainly demarcated line the stylus traced it straight unfalteringly we had feet of water under our keel peace then reversed course and devastation glided over the straight line being traced by the stylus then the precision depthrecorder started to rise vertically all stop rudder amidships speed zero reported the navigator the needlepoint of light under the chart was still the planesmen sat quiescent in their red leatherbacked bucket seats there was a faint splash of water down the leaking periscope gland all eyes were on peace at the ballastcontrol panel the petty officer might have been a statue hands extended to the multiplicity of switches in front of him bring her up to five hundred feethandsomely commanded peace slowly now stop her there the first mechanical noise i seemed to have heard in hours brought reassurancethe purr of a ballast pump like a navy dirigible hanging over a suspect contact devastation drifted slowly upwards twenty feet thirty feet the stylus levelled off secure said peace devastation hung a masterly example of touchandgo whatever it was was right under our keel the pointer outlined a big flat slab ahead onethird one minute the foot propeller bit turned slowed the stylus fell away showing a gully or way about feet in depth the pattern on the sensitized paper was now one of big rectangular blocks divided by channels some feet wide ease her down take it very easy again the quick purr of the pump and a slight thump as devastation settled on the seabed peace went to the periscope his face was strained by his skill he had already undertaken a manceuvre so delicate and so dangerous that few men afloat could have matched it i remained at the precision depthrecorder what could those rectangular blocks be they looked like fashioned pieces of concrete used for building breakwaters except that they were ten times the size among the rectangles were bigger and smaller ones only a few were square up periscope the periscope jockey flicked the controllever and with a hiss like a spitting cat the long tube rose up slowly lethargically thrusting against the outside seapressure the leaky gland gave a spurt the eyepiece with its double wooden handles emerged from the well with the gesture i knew so well peace snapped down the handles and fiddled with the focuslever he gestured to me i put my face to the soft rubber eyepiece i swung round darkness nothing at my elbow peace ordered turn on the sail floodlight active television eye i was still at the instrument automatically i put my eyes to the periscope i looked straight into the carving of a ship it lay in sharp focus in the middle of a carved pediment the spotlight illuminated a small area carved pedimentbuildinga city i knew then i was looking at the ancient drowned city of limuria the rectangular blocks were buildings some big some small the channels between were streets limuria my thoughts raced to something which had stuck in my mind from mauritius the mauritius institute recorded that when the first explorers set foot on the islandthe portu guese about years agothey had found carved tablets in wax inscribed with lettering which they thought to be greek hands trembling i swung the eyepiece round above the dim ship outlinecould it be lettering i snapped up the handles and turned to peace the iv screen showed nothing beyond a murk of water a city all eyes in the control room were on me how could one tell i gestured silently to peace he went to the eyepiece looked and withdrew our eyes met there lying on the steep rim of the slot was what must once have been a harbour and with the cataclysmic collapse of the ancient continent it had halfslid down the steep side of the undersea mountain plateau well plot this said peace in a quiet voice this was perhaps what was meant by the flood down periscope the sleek tube hissed into the well secure from ultraquiet there was a subdued whispering among the officers peace picked up the controlstand microphone captain here we have just made what may be a major oceanfloor discovery i am about to carry out a gridsearch he clicked off the instrument bring her up to four hundred feet handsomely grid pattern search ahead onethird the resumption of conversation eased the tension call the depths commanded peace fivetwenty chanted the diving officer five hundred we were now feet above the level of the ancient city take a sweep round peace told the sonar operator without warning the precision depthrecorder stylus gave a jerk and plummeted to fathoms there was a gigantic hole under devastation the patterned line of the houses and buildings fell away into abysmal depths the sound reproducer of the sonarscope still fully switched up which a few minutes ago had dominated everybody now was relegated to the background by the steady flow of orders and the comforting hustle of machinery devastation was changed from the stealthy killer of the deeps to a ship tinder way and her men were human again not hypertense listeners on whose acuity of hearing depended their salvation then the sonar beam swung round something hit me like an express train deafening pulsating terrifying sound blanketed the control roomhighpitched screaming grinding like a giant pencil being scratched across a giant slate i saw peace shouting an order but his words were lost in the crescendo devastation shuddered under an immense crash i was thrown sideways across the control centre the lights went out i and several others lay in a heap a torch snapped on and i saw peace bleeding from a cut above the eye crawl towards the divingstand emergency circuits he shouted the emergency lights flickered disappeared in a flash of blue sparks i dragged myself towards peace battle lanterns he rasped break out the battle lanterns for gods sake as the first dim light came on i grabbed adele and put my arm firmly round her shoulders the floor of the controlroom canted sharply downwards the fathometer spun we were racing for the bottom eight hundred feet i yelled men were crawling up the inclined deck to their stations stunned bewildered but training and discipline brought them back to their posts peace snatched up the engineroom intercom i heard his muttered thank god as the emergency circuit came alive the controlroom became dimly eerily lit as one battle lantern after anotherbatteryoperated lighting independent of the main circuitcame on eightfifty i called devastation fell as if through air chief peace started to say but his voice was drowned the sonar screamed like a madman in his dreams peace said fear in his voice shes still under power nine hundred responded the diving officer he was back on the job all right christ panted peace shes going for the bottom bottom is twelve thousand feet i exclaimed devastation was designed to reach one thousand bob peters returned hanging as i was on to one of the overhead grab straps devastation spiralled down twisting like an aircraft in a spin peace crouched jammed with one shoulder against the periscope operating gear devastation was completely out of control blow all ballast roared peace the burst of highpressure air made me swaliow hard and my eyes watered emer gency ahead flank left fifteen degrees rudder a planesman brushed a trickle of blood out of his eyes and yanked the controlstick peace was giving him every ounce of horsepower he could to get the planes on the sail to bite and pull her out of her deathdive sounding ninefifty feet falling fast blow all main ballastblow again again the roar of air sounding one thousand feet there was fear in bob peterss voice for the first time in devastation i smelled the smell of men who were afraid desperately afraid the faulty packing gland on the periscope gave a vicious spurt peace snapped ahead flankemergency the planesmans reply was mildly reproachful answers ahead flank emergency sir then what the hell as if in answer the long mournful wail of the oversteam alarm burst through blow main ballast tanks again again the desperate rush of highpressure air sounding eleven hundred feet there was a crack in the planesmans even voice cant hold her sir devastations nose pointed twenty degrees down peters called eleven hundred and fifty slowing i saw the prickle of sweat on peaces upper lip in my heart i blessed whoever had built that extra two hundred into her the hull gave an ominous creak a fountain spurted down the periscope barrel under the immense sea pressure peace had given the planes their chance to save us they had failed now the engines but even if we pulled out now there would be the mushing effect of a fullpower downangle nosedive which would mean we would travel another feet deeper devastations hull was already past the point of no return blow secured negative at the mark reported ballast control we had blown every ounce of seawater out of her still we went down trim her a little for gods sake urged peace then he addressed himself to the planesman as if he were the only person there he spoke slowly and distinctly all stop back emergency the planesman leaned forward and turned the engineroom annunciator he said quietly answers all stop back emergency sir suddenly the floor tilted almost horizontal a further sickening movement and devastation was on an even keel the diving officers face was grey somethingsomething turned us like that sir it wasnt us something i exclaimed sounding i felt the massive powerbite of the screw racing astern the oversteam alarm whooped and bayed like hounds of death inclinometer reads zero said peters devastation hung in her deathdive held against the massive downward force by the reverse thrust of her screw now it was as dangerous to break loose as it was to be forced down for if released the sub would shoot to the surface like a cork peace spoke into the engineroom intercom chief he paused main circuit shorting blowing every time can something he glanced round be outside the thunder of water racing past the cracking hull matched the braying of the alarms adele was close to me is it very bad were holding our ownjust the hull may go at any moment eleven seventy five reported peters we had gained feet adele said i think its a devilfish peace halfhearing above the din extended the trolleystrap to the full to join us what did you say devilfish she repeated loudly the fishermen of agalega think of them as gods at night you see them glowing hundreds of feet down the electrics murmured peace that explains the shortcircuits what size is this thing very big the fishermen say like an islet the biggest of all big rays what else do you know island cuttersbig shipshave been pulled down by them they are from deepdeep eleven hundred you wont hold her if she frees geoffrey peaces face became set over the strong line of his law im going to try something he said if this is a devilfish it may be a natural depth ill flood her to regain trim and try to shake it off i gestured hopelessly he slid back along the trolleystrap to the controlstand stop all rig for ultraquiet he turned informally to the petty officer who had remained so stoically at the ballastcontrol panel trim her as best you can will you if she shakes free flood her down see flood her down aye aye sir the ghastly cacophony of braying alarms stopped with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach i felt the strong backward thrust of our propeller cease the silence was as ominous as the previous racket devastation hung suspended between life and death at feet below the surface nose down the second planesman stunned in the first violent dive rose and staggered to his seat he automatically felt the control he turned to his companion there was a note of hysteria in his voice this bitch has got lead in her tits the other laughed lead christ its broken right through her flippin bra a sharp hissing like water on a fire came from outside the hull the angle of the deck changed the planesman jiggled the control column answers now sir the sonar shrieked momentarily as it was turned up contact not evaluated said the operator laconically in the tomblike silence of ultraquiet every face was turned towards peace what wouldcouldhe do tons of weight lay across our forward topside casing and bows could peace take the risk of startling the creature to clamp itself again across the controls could he risk another massive electrical discharge like an outsize electric eel again the sharp sizzling hiss the monster moved slightly placated by the silence perhaps peace must make the captains decisiona decision which would take a hundred men to a bottomless ocean grave or back to life in limurias soft air he reached for the microphone rig ship for hydrobatics he rasped right full rudder ahead flank six hundred feet smartly hands clutched the trolleystraps in anticipation of the violent movements to foliow in terms of aircraft peace meant to go stunt flying to shake the creature free the planesman turned the dial the diving officers knuckles were white on the back of his seat answers ahead flank secure from ultraquiet peace knew there was no reason now to keep silent he had cast the die the propeller bit full thrust the controlcolumn went hard over i gasped and hung on devastation swung into a snap roll and her bow came up another sharp slithering hiss devastation gave a wild lurch and her bow came up but the weight held it from the swift movement which would shake the creature free depth eight hundred the bow dipped would she dive never to come up again peace said man battle stations torpedo the heavy alarm for general quarters pulsed through the ship striking at my chest like a drum peace would lighten devastation by firing her bow torpedoes men hung on trying to get some sort of attack discipline he ordered we will fire six speed high depth maximum speed highdepth maximum make ready tubes and open outer doors torpedoroomtubes and ready in all respects outer doors open set shoot peace stood balanced shoot came the repeat fire there was a faint jerk a torpedo was on its way one fired electrically set shoot fire two fired electrically set shoot fire three fired electrically peace said left full rudder ahead flank six hundred feet smartly he turned devastation into a fullspeed degreeangle turn in the other direction as he emptied her torpedotubes set shoot fire four fired electrically the bow jerked upwards outside there was a savage hiss like steam blowing and at the same time a heavy movement blow all the main ballasthandsomely now commanded peace the burst of highpressure air drowned the firing orders as it roared into the tanks peace whipped out right fifteen degrees rudder back emergency devastation shook her head like a crocodiles jaws savaging a great fish to deatha lash and whip from side to side the propeller gripped gathered sternway there was a heavy rending and crackle outside devastation leapt free peace shouted hold her bob dont let her go the submarine spiralled upwards a wild angle on the floor flood her downemergency roared peace again the choking burst of air pressure as tons of water boiled into the ballast tanks a fusillade of helm diving and trimming orders brought the great sub on to an even keel as if to crown our escape the main lighting came on controlroom routine was reestablished the turbine reduction gears and hydraulics hummed we sauntered along safe peace climbed on to the divingcontrol stool sonar any contacts hes running like a bat out of hellbeg pardon sir bob said peace ill take the conn you get aft and have a spot of sleep he added briskly to the operators keep that fathometer and precision depthrecorder going and send me some coffee will you we went dead with fatigue and strain at the bulkhead door i looked back peace in his turtlenecked sweater sat tireless commanding devotedto what i asked myself i found the answer as my head touched my pillow the sea peace belonged to the deep sea the man from anacostia up periscope with a cheerful hiss the long barrel slid up from the well of the ship peace snicked down the hinged handles and looked into the eyepiece it was three days later we had made our rendezvousst brandon four hundred miles to the northeast lay the saya de malha fifty feet reported the diving officer all stop ordered peace there were great shadows under his eves he seemed never to have left the control centre during the long plot of an oceanbottom contour chart of saya de malha the abstruse technicalities of it had kept at bay the foreboding which grew in my mind as we approached the rendezvous peace still refused to aliow adele to do a radio stint she had been listless almost a prisoner in the tiny cabin but during the long hours of her company one thing was clear and i would have traded away little bear for it her deep and growing affection for me there had been no signals from the dni nothing to indicate that willowtrack was converging on the remote reef to meet us the isolation of being feet beneath the widest ocean in the world completely alone preyed on my mind shadowing my anticipation of the coming meeting with the vicepresident and making it seem unreal on peaces curt order the needlepoint of light under the glasstopped chart table slowed halted it was scarcely necessary for peace or myself to consult it since we had drawn the chart ourselves during our trip from mauritius to the seychelles in his yacht it seemed years away now the great boomerangshaped reef of st brandon twentysix miles long and five wide narrows at both extremities and is broadest northwards diminishing to less than a mile in the south inside its enclosing horns are islands and islets all on the western side of the main reef the islands are ludicrously smalleven raphael which has a permanent population of little over a hundred is less than half a mile long and a few hundred yards wide like a look peace asked i adjusted the focus lever blinking at the bright sunlight the day was brilliant it seemed impossible to distinguish where the chinablue sky began and the chinablue sea ended dead ahead were two islets no more than sandbanks a strip of yellow sand a few coconut palms a millrace of water between them backdropped against a high misty curtain of spray which stretched out of sight westwards as far as the eye could seethe great st brandon reef over this immense and awesome natural barrier the open ocean pounded and thundered throwing spray high into the air to be caught by the trade wind and flung far across the coral barrier a big shoal of fish tore for the shelter of the reef and above it like a tenacious carrier attack squadron hung grey noddy birds sooty terns startlingly white love terns and white tropic birds majestic and deadly echelons of broadspanned frigate birds crashdived the mass to snatch a tasty morsel the sunlight flickered flashed reflected off the wheeling birds and the churnedup sea it turned to pale pink and rose against the two islets and then blurred into a breathtaking gauze of reds violets yeliows greens and blues as the seaspray separated out the colours of the spectrum delicate as a watercolour the tiny twin islands of big capitaine and little capitaineour rendezvouspoint with willowtrack stood out against the spumefilled mist i drew back from the exquisite scene in the periscope peace was at the radar repeater its eerie green glow reflected his face as the electronic sweep revolved anything yet he asked no sir nothing yet plenty of land echoes report any moving target immediately aye aye sir peace glanced briefly into the eyepiece no sign yet of willowtrack he said but glancing at his watch we are ahead he went on lets get some fresh air down periscope a flick of the periscope jockeys hand on the hydraulic oil control and the steel tube slid out of sight stand by to surface like a spring released men went into action all vents shut sir ready to surface reported the diving officer the surface alarmklaxon sounded three times peace said blow all ballast surface surface surface said the loudspeakers peace checked the controlroom barometer after the lowpressure blower had taken a suction on the ship open the hatch the rating spun the handles of the locking dogs and opened the vaultlike cover peace as was his prerogative was first out i waited for the bridge personnel before i squeezed out the fresh air on the trade was moist salty satisfying after the sterile dryness of devastations interior but with it was the fishy deepwater smell which a submarine gathers after long submersion here was the full beauty of big capitaine and little capitaine both were miniature replicas of a hundred other islands in limuria flanked by yeliow and rose coral the lagoon of each islet stood out like a green gem set in the deeper circle of the blue sea the illusion of a ring setting which sprang into my mind was enhanced by the platinumwhite reflection of the sun glancing off the restless water as it surged and plunged through the pass between the two islets limurias daylight dreams nighttime and the trades breathe with a curious rise and fall through the palms and scrub thickets and in the distance is always the sea eternally burnishing the coral for the next days loveliness peace called out take a look there john he pointed at the hull the forward bank of stabilizers like projecting bollards were twisted aside devilfish there too paint was stripped raw to the hull a ragged fringe curled and blackened along the casing marked where the monster had lain peace added he took a bit of devastation for a souvenir too about six feet of bridge handrail was missing what do you really think it was i asked he shrugged devilfishthats good enough i suppose finding it difficult to shake off my uneasiness i said these are coelacanth waters god knows what else they conceal he looked round the gentle scene and then his eyes moved to the south from which willowtrack would come from what ive heard about tyler i said it would have been better to have told him everything no retorted peace more than enough people know look at the leak look at the intruderand this business of my funeral are you going to tell tyler straight from the shoulder that from st brandon onwards his part of the mission is accomplished peace looked uncomfortable ill play it by ear when we meet the metallic voice of the speaker cut in bridgecontrol possible radar contact bearing onesixzero degrees peace snapped the knob of the bridge command speaker controlbridge keep and log ranges any sonar contact none sir came the answer the reefs in the way we searched the quadrant of sea with our binoculars but it was obstructed by the blowing spray contact now bears onesevenzero true moving right it must be willowtrack said peace coming round the point contact not evaluated droned the radarman approximate course twosevenfive degrees approximate speed sixteen knots controlbridge said peace report immediately you evaluate contact range twelve thousand yards closing bridgecontrolsonar reports probably a submarine the radarman said contact closing rapidly course now threefivezero degrees sonar reports contact evaluated as submarine shes up exclaimed peters he became formal bridgecontrolsubmarine range eight thousand yards and steady contact now bears twotwozero true droned the radarman a long black shape came into sight round the reef riding low her sail half awash and the identification numbers painted out the bridge speaker said message coming in sir send it up ordered peace he glanced at it brickbat zero one thats willowtrack all right he turned the slip over and scrawled a combination of code letters for transmission the sub rounded the point and then as if reassured she shook the sea clear of her casing and came swiftly across the anchorage a churn of white at her stern and she anchored within minutes the rubber dinghy was in the water and peace and i were being rowed across to willowtrack halfway i looked back never had the bay of the two capitaines seen such an array of naval power the two lean black shapes offset the fairy colours of the breaking spray a capless figure in faded seagoing khaki looked down from willowtracks paintscuffed bridge despite the cigar clamped in the corner of his mouth it was easy to see in those strong features where the command lay there was about him that inherent air of anticipation of intuition which stamps a great sub skipper this was the famous revs tyler you devastation the question was rhetorical but a menace underlay it had we not been aye called peace no reception committee i see tyler leaned over and grinned lopsidedly the cigar in his teeth i could see the ripple of muscle at the base of his neck we got everything pointed at you he said there was no laughter in the longdrawn vowels it was the sort of fingeron the trigger attitude which peace respected it was reflected in his voice as he called back i was all ready to pull the plug if you didnt add up revs tugged the cigar from his mouth and gestured widely round the bay right on the nose with the navigation weve split this dump in two now come on in tyler had a new cigar in his mouth when we reached the bridge his handshake was like iron glad to have you aboard he said glad to get a breath of fresh air too thirtysix days submerged nearest we got to the surface was periscope depth for the white house messages and he indicated the cigar whatever the general dynamics guys say they cant make a cigar taste the same below as in the open air he took a large breath of the fresh cool air boy if anyone sleeps better than me tonight hes drunk i wondered after what we had to tell him still i knew how he felt submarine air is like drinking stilled water aseptic safe even the cook aboard a nuclear sub falls under the whip of pure air restrictions and cannot use lard for instance because it gives off acrolein which is an eye irritant no aerosol sprays eitherbecause of the gas they contain im peacecommander geoffrey peace peace said this is john garland the american looked at me penetratingly it was a strong face tough without the cruel lines round peaces mouth if he had every weapon pointed at you it flashed across my mind he wasnt the man to jib at using them if he thought it necessary tyler inclined his head slightly hi geoff hi john but he still stared at me the mornings pretty well shot he added lets get below much as i hate to but we cant talk up here mkgs waiting peace nodded perfunctorily and tyler led us below if i had been uneasy before i was more so now after meeting tyler his integrity and loyalty to the vicepresident were obvious peace too was tense as we entered willowtracks control centre it was airier and lighter than devastations but that seemed about all the steelwalled compartment the instrument consoles the divingstand the soft whirr of machinery were all the same but the tight groups of men taut alert were not peace nodded towards them action stations relax fellahs said tyler informally its okay break it up he turned to a stocky officer you have the deck and the conn lou im going aft well take time out to let these guys get some fresh air topsides call me if theres anything with this sub skippers timehonoured injunction on handing over we threaded our way through to tylers cabin for the first time in my life i felt a shutin feeling in a sub the steel walls did not seem big enough to contain our anxieties and our secret tyler remained distant he kicked the cabin door closed turned his back on us picked up a phone and spoke in to it mkg the limeys are here as the instrument crackled he turned and looked hard at peace sure sure he says his name is peace no i dunno the guy but the code reply was in orderbrickbat zero one he put down the phone the way mkg feels about commander geoffrey peace hed give him a command in the united states navy itself his voice had a curious edge to it and his use of the third person instead of speaking directly to peace left me wondering was the famous skipper jealous of the vicepresidents regard for the bright star of another navy i am commander peace said peace evenly yeah oh yeah said tyler in the same tone he paused for a moment but neither of us spoke then as if to cover up his unfriendliness he said quickly i dont as a rule hold with vips in my ship but mkg is different he shrugged as if he realized he was just talking anyhow you guys dont want me to give my own vicepresident the soft sell but mkg sure has a way with him my navigators chuck wilson mkg shares a cabin with him wouldnt hear of taking over mine thats the kind of guy he is chucks a whiz when it comes to figures but mkg has him beat somehowdont ask me howwe began to get some drift in the gyros of the analogue computer who fixes itmkg he gave me an acute glance sensing my confusion you familiar with these ships no i said again the tight scrutiny i see well theres seventeen thousand transistors thirtynine thousand diodes and forty thousand circuits in the system a dockyard job said peace tylers pride was touched i guess there are at least thirtyfive american nuclear subs on station in all oceans of the world at this moment he said with a thin smile the us navy doesnt care for dockyards when they can do the job at sea peace and i exchanged glances tyler was certainly not making it any easier for us but in this case he went on id say willowtrack needed the whole goddam massachusetts institute of technology but mkg fixed it and we hit st brandon right on the barrelhead he gave a short laugh the first touch of warmth that had come into his conversation he and chuck wilson talk but what in hell they say dont ask me i said well hes one of the great scientists somehow the remark seemed offkey sure sure replied tyler briefly just that our voices fell dead in the silence we could hear the chatter of the offduty men on the casing above tyler pushed across a box of phillies bonanzas and peace took one willow tracks poison he remarked glancing towards the door as if anxious that mkg should not come in on us sitting silent i tried putting out the crews smoking lamp for a week oncemedical experiment it lowered everyones morale so much that i stopped it after three days i must say though i wouldnt mind a jack daniels at this moment but the urge goes once you cant get it american ships still dry asked peace noncommittally tyler frowned as if wanting to take exception to any remark sure always have been always will be keeps the crew fit and the fittest of all is mkgpunchball medicine ball relaxicizorthe lot youd think he was training for the world series well hes an astronaut i began but the words froze as peace glanced at me id forgottentyler knew nothing of the spaceflight to sante fe all he knew was that mkg was to test a secret weapon the look was not lost on tyler then the american skipper said casually whats the news topsides i saw peaces momentary hesitationhe had been in the headlines for daysand then he replied usual nothing youd want to look up for reference tyler seemed to relax a little fine you know this past week ive been lying awake nights and thinking what if some sonofabitch had mashed the tit and started a shooting war and here i am cruising five hundred feet under the sea not knowing a word about it i felt the sweat on my palms but peace said levelly you were in touch with the white house every day twentyfour hours between signals answered tyler the whole usa could be in ruins before i knew i said gravely then youd be the only fighting unit left in the world youd carry the decisive factor in your sherwood forest uhhuh tyler replied noncommittally looking again towards the door mkg seemed a long time in coming no news eh well thats good because if theres anything my crew likes its news news they must have it normally on a deepwater mission i put up a radio antenna and tape it up then we play it back in the mess hall when the crew comes off watch but on this mission he swung his bulk aggressively to and fro no dice strict orders white house signal at sunset only not even a news flash nothing to fill the ships newspaper except the same old corn and you get pretty tired of that after a while after all he seemed to be talking just to study us and our reactions im editorinchief i get sick of my own corn just about as sick as the boys do with the same old movies we play em over and over they speak the parts they know them so wellrun em into the ground funning around there was a light tap at the door come in called tyler peace and i swung round as the door opened a thrill passed through me i can still smell the acrid aroma of tylers cigar and see the tiny pastelgreen cabin in sharp focus the gyro repeater speed indicator and depth gauge at the foot of the bunk four telephones a brace of speakers the greenishmoon reflection off the bottom of the snickedup pullman washbasin the grey metal lockers the utilitarian desk mkg stood in the entrance he wore the same seagoing washedout khaki as tyler he was much the same build and had to stoop to enter the face was long the jaw badly shaven squarer than tylers it lacked the captains rangy weatherbeaten look but there was no mistaking its power its determination its command black hair submarinecut receded slightly at the temples as he came forward he screwed up his eyes like a sailor viewing a far horizon the regular line of his teeth showed as he went forward and gripped peaces hand his look was questioning though when he shook me strongly by the hand as if to try and place me in the little bear project john garland explained peace one of the finest navigators afloat hes coming with us we dont need a navigator said tyler curtly with this ships instruments i can find anything anywhere my instrumentations better than any limey subs mkg said quietly the inertial navigationits one hundred per cent now revs he too seemed to be seeking neutral ground i checked it over the gyros and accelerometers are just dandy now he hadnt revss long drawl but a quicker shorter accent reminding me of president kennedys when i had heard him broadcast tyler tried to soothe the unease in the cabin coffee its the one thing we never run short of navy nectar he picked up the intercom mkgs eyes were on peace waiting for him to make the opening tyler went on theyre always trying out new shapes of coffee makers to see which gives the bestweve had cylinder shapes round square even a triangular one with a shot of cream from a gadget in the side it was mkg himself however who started the ball rolling he looked penetratingly at peace is semittante safe commander are we to start talking shop right from first base before the coffee comes asked tyler the rapport between mkg and peace was clear to see i felt like a supernumerary especially in the light of tylers antagonism towards me semittante refuelled in mauritius and left on schedule peace replied we should pick her up according to plan the platitudes were not lost on tyler he frowned see here i got personal orders from the secretary for the navy himself the vicepresident of the united states is entrusted to my special care that cargo of mine is more explosive than a salvo of polaris missiles i mean to keep it that way i dont go for cryptograms like that it happens to be my responsibility to testfire little bear revs said mkg levelly i dont have to remind you that you are under my orders tyler looked truculent i know my orders i have to rendezvous with the british submarine devastation at st brandon indian ocean if she answers the code signal brickbat zero one shes okay if not his smile was icy she did all i know is that i am to receive a new briefing from this point onwards the prickly american skipper went on as if he had been waiting to have his say i cant make out why the limeys have to come in on this mission at all its an american missile a united states project and goddam it weve shown ourselves quite capable of looking after ourselves in two wars over seven seas mkg remained unruffled at his outburst little bear is a joint americanbritish effort revs the motor the key to the whole thing is britishsnap its good or else i wouldnt be sitting here halfway across the world from the united states to prove the missile davis and acton began tyler mkgs voice took on a strange resonance im glad you mentioned them its just the sort of tragedy that snap can prevent in future davis and acton could have homed okay if they hadnt lost their power at the critical moment here is something you and the rest of the world havent yet heard revs as you know davis and acton went into a shaliow orbit round the earth on their return from the moon when the power from their solar cells started to fail there was no chance of a spaceliaise with santa fe and they knew it was only a matter of time before they were cremated in the earths atmosphere i spoke to davis before his radio finally packed up know what he said its not the thought that we are going to die so soonits pretty beautiful up here but that we nearly made home base we would have done except for the power i tried to get him again but the radio was dead dead revs for want of the sort of power snap can give the next generation of missiles he added slowly davis and acton were dead too a steward tapped and came in carrying coffee in the traditional united states navy bluetrimmed crockery the wait while he set out the cups seemed endless how would peace break the news to tyler that the operation from st brandon onwards would exclude him the steward went and tyler poured coffee he said impatiently i dont want to gripe about security arrangements but this whole thing seems a bit lopsided to me first we send little bear out in a french freighter the us navy is quite capable of flying it out and looking after it en route or i could have brought it out myself in one of willowtracks polaris silos that would have meant too many others being brought into the know on the project said mkg no the fewer people who are aware of little bear the better this was very carefully thought out semittante was the best and most unobtrusive way to transport little bear tyler rode the rebuke i get a new briefing from st brandon onwards from whom where do we go for the testfire mkg id like a word with you alone said peace tyler reddened this is my ship and im in sole command anything you have to say can be said in front of me nothing behind my back peace checked his anger very well the plan has been changed because there has been a security leak there is a new schedule from st brandon onwards mkg comes with me in devastation the hell he does snapped tyler just like that you give me the orders the vicepresident comes with me he glared at us and thumped the table with his fist i take my orders from the united states navy on this mission i take em only from the secretary for the navy i dont aliow the vicepresident to go off with two limeys who come aboard my ship and say the plan is changed the vicepresident comes with us nor do i like the look of a submarine with her identification numbers painted out and her sail damaged we ran into a devilfish in the saya de malha said peace fish snorted tyler dont give me that bull you can check began peace but tyler would not listen what happens to willowtrack you go home said peace roughly your jobs done mkg stood up between the two tough skippers sit down both of you he said there was steel beneath his quiet tones order some more coffee revs he went on we all need it tyler picked up an intercom dan come heredamn quick i told you to order coffee dans the radio operator intervened mkg tyler picked up one of the plastic coffee spoons which had fallen on the table he jabbed it down on the surface the snap of its shaft sounded like a pistol shot he swept his hand towards the intercoms i got four telephones and two speakers he said tightly i can pick up anyone i can signal anyone anywhere in the world i can start a nuclear war with that one see i am the captain a navy captain entrusted with the responsibility of the person of the vicepresident of the united states and i dont buck my duty and i dont simply hand over the vicepresident to two guys who come aboard without credentials from a suspicious ship willowtracks crew certainly knew how to jump when they heard that note in tylers voice for before mkg could reply dan had arrived the boy looked scared dan ordered tyler send this signal mkg stopped him revs i am the vicepresident sure sure replied revs its a responsibility i take seriously no signals whatsoever are to be sent until i authorize them said mkg get that dan the boy glanced uncertainly from mkg to tyler yes sir i mean mister vicepresident get out snapped tyler get the hell outa here dan fled i admired the superb command mkg had over himself it was he who had taken over the situation now coffee he ordered tyler picked up a phone never taking his eyes from mkg in a moment it seemed fresh coffee was on the table tyler kicked the door shut now said mkg turning to peace the cia got wind of our plan somehow they put a man on to tag me i nodded confirmation of this cryptic account so the dni decided it was safer to change the plans i picked john up at sea left no trail i cant accept a statement like that said tyler stubbornly i dont know either of you from a wave in the ocean gods truth exploded peace at this stage i cant go into a roundbyround explanation you have my word for it thats why i wanted to consult alone with mkg hell vouch for me i only take orders from the united states navy repeated tyler the cigar clamped in his teeth i want proof and documentation before i aliow mkg to leave my ship mkg glanced quickly at peace whose anger at tyler had begun to flare revs he said little bear is more than a mere missile project it is the ultimate weapon which will put usthe united states and britainway out ahead of any other nation for a decade at least its so good that i am going for a spaceride in little bear this mission is not a simple testfire i am blasting off to santa fe in little bear the colour drained from tylers face he rose sat down heavily again and started to spoon sugar into his coffee staring into the strong liquid the ultimate weapon revs peace gave a slight shudder perhaps the scar of the dnis briefing in the bloodandoil days of war would never heal for him tyler did not seem to hear he stirred his coffee unseeingly this thing has bucked me he said at last i wont say it hasnt he looked up at mkg i gotta mark one eyeball check im speaking to the vicepresident a top scientist of our age or else id think some boot seaman was razzing me with a phoney news item in the ships newspaper he says im blasting off into space to santa fe in little bear experimental missile untested the tough skipper stood up mechanically and sat down automatically dumping more sugar into his coffee mkg went over to him and put a hand on his shoulder tyler jerked up brushing aside mkgs hand and facing him the vicepresident testfire an experimental missile and go to santa fe we know you got the spellout mkg anacostia naval research lab and a great guy but no vicepresident of mine goes on a spaceride in an experimental missile not while revs tyler is around the safety of the vicepresident of the united states is my responsibility and i wont duck it his hand went out to the intercom revs the power in the controlled tones stopped tyler i ordered you not to touch that phone tylers hand wavered uncertainly and then fell back the four of us were so close round the tiny table that i could smell the detergent from their seakhaki blended with the aftermath of the pungent pinnies it did not seem incongruous that mkg in direct line for the presidency should wear drab khakiin all the long line of presidents there had been men in the garb of lawyers doctor businessmen farmer soldier clergyman artisan and at that moment mkg symbolized our age the space age his was the ascetic raiment of science the technocrat risen to the highest political rank and now seeking to set a seal on the new hierarchy by a voyage into the farflung spaces of the heavens there was a curious luminous light in the vicepresidents eyes little bear is not only a question of justifying a supreme missile he told tyler it is also a question of justifying the spirit of the agemy age the age of science im not with you muttered tyler i am the supreme representative of the new american technocratic society replied mkg in the age of science sciences top representative and the american people have chosen me as that science must be at the helm therefore i have to make the flight to santa fe in an experimental missile burst out tyler mkg went on quickly von braun the father of american rocketry had the same basic idea way back in the fifties namely a seabased missile von brauns was roughandreadypontoons in the water the missiles to be sown like mines round the enemys shores but the seedidea was there and it ripened he swung on peace in the brain of that remarkable old man the dni little bear is the ultimate weapon there was a pause so intense that again i could hear the cheerful voices of the crew on the casing above as they rejoiced in the sunlight tyler stood up his eyes hard i dont buy it he said curtly nor would the american people the office of presidentand you are part of itis one of the three bastions on which the constitution rests see revs tyler shooting off part of his heritage into space we are only as great as we are to our inward vision said mkg remember that revs tyler raked the coal of his cigar across the ashtray and then threw it into the trash basket under the desk he lit another as automatically peace sat like a coiled spring from the casing came the shout of a swimmer and the thump of his body against willowtracks hull tyler looked from peace to myself two limeyswhy bring them into it two limeys i dont even know the motor is britishsnap mkg repeated his voice tinged with asperity i dont have to explain it all again tyler wheeled on peace and me his face livid thats what burns me uptwo limeys he shouted its not your goddam vicepresident what do you care if hes burnt to hell in a testmissile sit down shut up retorted peace he turned to mkg my dinghys waiting lets get aboard devastation dont forget to bring your code so that we can signal the white house at sunset tyler grabbed peace by the shoulder who are you to order me and mkg around fellah peace shook himself free and mkg interjected you know the setup with commander peace revs you say you know this guy but who in hell is this he indicated me you didnt know him did you until now mkg was on his feet too an angry light in those strange eyes i know commander peace and anyone he vouches for i trust but i dont came back tyler see here this whole thing stinks to me and when this guy says bring along the white house code it stinks more mkg looked dangerous revs as vicepresident i order y o u im signalling the president direct replied tyler i dunno the original plan you talk about i dunno the changes i dunno this sonofabitch freighters course even i thought all along there was something crook about a french ship carrying an american classified weapon i dont like the look of that sub across the bay i dont like taking orders from anyone but the secretary for the navy leastways this guy he picked up the empty coffeepot tried to pour from it and with an oath tossed it away consoling himself with yet another cigar and glaring at us the essence of this mission is secrecy said mkg if you signal you destroy it tyler paused and then reached across for an intercom before mkg could intercept him bridgecaptain clear the casing clear the bridge rig for diving mkg wrenched tyler round to face him i ordered y ou the alarmklaxon brayed its mournful note a double blast through the ship the thudding of feet overhead and the slam of steel doors foliowed tyler put down the phone he was in full command you saidsure but who are these guys im taking no chances i m a navy captain and i know my duty and that duty is to the person of the vicepresident and the office of president of the united states santa fe it needs no speliout what it would mean when the world heard what a sucker revs tyler had been you are an american officer i order you to put me aboard devastation there was no wavering or hesitation about tyler his voice was hard his face strained with the weight of the decision he had taken my duty is to protect the vicepresident with every means at my disposaland that means i d even set the birds flying to start a shooting war he wrenched a key similar to peaces from around his neck if the vicepresident is going to santa fe he is going in an allamerican missile with american scientists under the eyes of the american people if thats as maybe depending on a lot of things which aint my concern but it aint gonna be this way youve talked a lot about your responsibility now listen to mine said mkg the condition on which i came on this mission was that during the outward leg of the voyage to st brandon i would be in radio touch every day at sunset with the president at the white house anything could happen during such a long voyage from st brandon on wards things will be different ill be in friendly waters close to the british base at mahe the arrangement from now on is that ill signal regularly to the president through the dni it wont be the tight daily schedule because if there is anything i should know the president will inform the dni and he can be in immediate touch with me its safer too at this distance from home to use the british landbased communications facilities than a subs radio this is a united states sub and were quite capable of looking after the vicepresident tyler broke in angrily mkg ignored the interruption if anythinganythingwere to arise during my absence from the united states which in the opinion of the president necessitated my abandoning the santa fe space shot i would drop it here and now he said forcefully he underlined each word his eyes going from tyler to peace in turn that is a basic condition of little bear i know my duty to my office and to the american people as well if not better than you revs so far nothing has cropped up to reverse the original plan but if it did i assure you i would call it off the president and i both believe in this ultimate new weapon and i intend to prove its worth we have had to resort to these unorthodox ways but we feel them justifiable because of the supreme value of little bear to the free world tyler looked more rangy than ever im taking this ship down he said doggedly ill use your sunset time to signal the presidentdirect you wont said mkg only two people know the code the white house and myself tyler shrugged ill send a signal en clair then i want this whole thing straight in my mindfrom the president before i aliow you to go walking off with these twotwo he glared at us in unconcealed hostility as soon as this ship is readythis is a crack gold crew and it takes less than three minutesi intend to submerge to periscope depth as a start ill signal submarine headquarters in new london the loudspeaker blared metallically all dear topside the ship is rigged for dive and compensated captain admiration chased the anger for a moment from peaces face by any standards it was some going an intercom buzzed tyler answered in monosyllables but his face darkened bring it through dandamn quick he turned on peace his face livid so youre on the level are you mister goddam commander peace lwhile your sub tried to jam my radio it was peaces turn to look astonished he swung on mkg tyler picked up an intercom stand by to dive periscope depth ill come through and take the conn dan came and retreated quickly at the sight of our faces tyler read the signal looked round at us unspeaking reread it his mouth was like iron he addressed mkg you say you know this guy re jerked his head at peace who is he mkg looked pluzzled of course i know him revs commander geoffrey peace royal navy tyler spun on peace that so peace nodded then listen to this he replied grimly its a general signal from comsubind submarine headquarters of the seventh fleet in the seychelles incomplete because it was jammed towards the end but enough he quoted to all subs admiral thornton commanding us seventh fleet has received the foliowing message from the british prime ministeron behalf of the minister of defence and myself i wish to thank you and the officers and men of the seventh united states fleet and especially units of the nuclear submarine force based on mahe for their generous gesture in according the last honours at the funeral of the distinguished british submarine ace commander geoffrey peace blow and go the two skippers stared at one another peace said nothing his face was bleak withdrawn tyler watched him as narrowly as a boxer coming out of his corner he backed away to the intercom facing peace all the time felt for the instrument dialled hold it lou im coming through his vowels grew more pronounced with tension dan keep the radio antenna up when we submerge see well be at sixty feeti gotta lot of signalling to do whatagain he moved forward towards peace to the length of the intercom cord his voice was menacing so youre on the level are you the late commander geoffrey peace every signal of mine is being jammed at this moment nonsense peace retorted i was glad that tyler had to use his hands to hold the intercom otherwise he might have been at peaces throat he listened again goddam it here in the bay he rammed it down his face was livid he said slowly peaceor whatever your name isif that goddam sub of yours doesnt stop jamming me illillsink her revs mkg interposed pull yourself together i recog nize commander peacei know him personally why would a british sub jam you anyway british tyler flared does a friendly sub jam another on a topsecret mission like this youll all stay here until i ve sorted this one out he pushed past to the door revs called mkg the tough skipper paused if you go on like this youll live to regret it there was a moments uncertainty about tyler then he said curtly if this guy had been who he said he was i might no i wasnt sure even then now its the other way im signalling new london then im going after semittante will you take it upon yourself to act in direct opposition to the orders of the president you have your orders obey them the cabin did not seem big enough to hold three such towering personalities revs shook his head as if trying to clear it my orders mkgs voice was resonant hard i order you to go ahead with the mission as planned tyler jerked round so that his face was away from mkg he picked up the intercom dan get that other sub signal her skipper is coming on a trial evolution with willow track yeah thats what i said trial evolution say hell be away a day or two and if you can get past that jamming say commander peaces orders are that the sub must remain here in the bay of the two capitaines untiluntil further orders got that peace moved towards tyler the big american put down the intercom his hands hanging ready at his sides t y l e r keep back he replied keep away from me peace youre a prisoner and you and garland will stay so you cant get away like on a plane you cant step outside peace turned with a gesture of his hand towards mkg tyler spoke into another phone lou tell that other subs dinghy to stand clear pull the plug sixty feet handsomely use the pumps the speaker clicked on captaincontrol ship rigged for dive and compensated i could see the impact of his decision upon tyler the tall rangy figure seemed to sag slightly at the door he half reached out his hand towards mkg but as if ashamed of the gesture hastily plunged it into the cigar box youre already smoking revs mkgs voice struck like a sjambok tyler ground out the cigar savagely i am goddammit listen for the last time revs said mkg i have a date to keep with little bear i mean to keep it not this way repeated tyler doggedly ill go after the freighter first little bear mkgs voice sharpened one of the very few prototypes of little bear aye retorted the big american thats the kicker he glared at peace and myself id say this whole story is a frameup to get a classified weapon to the reds and to kidnap the vicepresident of the united states gods truth began peace but tyler was gone the door slamming behind him within seconds came the familiar whirr of the pumps and the rush of water as willowtrack started to submerge it is a delicate manceuvre to take a nuclear sub down without engines but tyler rightly boasted he had a gold crew she went down smooth as a lift mkg and peace stood silent there was nothing we could do we were completely in tylers hands mica took one of tylers cigars and lit it staring at the burning tip its the way we planned it or nothing he said at length i said tyler sees his duty to the office of the vicepresident as overruling all other considerations he didnt give me time even to explain about the cia man the leak and all the rest of it added peace revs is the low man on the totempole mkg answered wryly strange having someone else try and teach one ones duty as vicepresident i thought his loyalty to me i dont understand the jamming of willowtracks radio by devastation said peace i dont like it either i gave no orders the thought struck me like a bodyblow suppose it wasnt devastation what if theres another sub in the bay i asked swiftly what if the cia had another united states nuclear sub shadow us no replied peace the us navys too deep in this isn t it mkg the vicepresident nodded but what if its a red sub peace continued my god exclaimed mkg as we stared at him maybe i ll need revss protection after all what makes you say that commander peace glanced at me the girl adele what if she has homed a red sub on to us the thought left me sick well find outsoon snapped peace mkg what have you aboard this sub that you need for the little bear launch mkg rose slowly to his feet dropping the cigar unheedingly on the table i dont get you spacesuitinstruments anything like that no boz blairs got the spacesuit and other gear he stared puzzled at peace ive got a few countdown details a few of the final stable table settings but boz has duplicates of them all the white house code of course nothing heavy you need what have you got in mind commander tyler said you cant simply step outside a submarine but you can you know blow and go blow and go we must hurry while tyler is in the control centre every nuclear sub has three escape hatches peaces daring plan broke upon me when i remembered the escape tube bob peters had shown me when conducting me round devastation he had told me of the three escape routes the usual one via the bridge and sail and two others one forard and one aft i had seen the forward escape trunk myself the hatches leading from these escape trunks were the only ones in the ship which were independent of the main ballastcontrol panel the men escaping operated them mkg stood transfixed at peaces rapid explanation but when they see us with escape gear no no no apparatus is needed thats why its called blow and go all you have to do once youre inside the hatch is to equalize the air pressure inside the escape tube with that of the ocean outside you allow water into the trunk until pressure is equal then you just open a side hatch and step out into the water you heard tyler say well only be sixty feet down its a piece of cake at that depth but our lungs will burst mkg hesitated there isnt time to explain it all nowyoull have to take my word for it its a welltried and tested methodbuoyant ascent its called you get compressed air in your lungs in the escape tube as you rise to the surface the compressed air expands and blows itself out no masks no there is no equipment at all it takes only about six seconds to rise to the surface from sixty feet can you swim mkg grinned lets go fellahs devastations dinghy wont be far i added it was unbelievably easy mkg led we made our way down the short passageway to the cabin which mkg shared with the sins expert who was at his general quarters station in the controlroom mkg flung open a suitcase took out some documents tied them into a plastic bag which previously had held a shirt and thrust the parcel into his seakhakis pocket he scrabbled deeper and pulled out a flat wooden case you wont want a pistol peace said this isnt an ordinary handgun he snapped it open there with shells banked round was the finest weapon i had ever seen it looked like a pistol but it had a bolt action remington xp mkg said tersely fire ball shells highest velocity ever fired by a handgun sort of holster rifle peace found another plastic shirtcover in which he wrapped the gun while mkg did the same to some other papers in the passageway i felt naked i wanted to rush mkg sauntered casually talking to peace as if he were showing him the ship we reached the main forward bulkhead which separates the torpedo compartment from the rest of the shipone of the five main watertight compartments into which the hull is divided my stomach dropped as we stepped over the high lintel fear of discovery vied with fear of the unknown plunge into the sea which peace had outlined i shut the bulkhead door behind us the narrow passageway ahead was lined with lightalloy bunks their pullmantype curtains drawn the footlong mk torpedoes loaded with lbs of tnt in the head and driven by over a ton of mixed water alcohol and hydrogen peroxide seemed as outmoded as a spear compared to a carbine in the deadly complexity of willowtracks main armament two torpedomen were checking the tubes one of them paused his hand on a big clamp the news obviously hadnt reached them yet hi mkg he called cheerfully we fixed the homing gear in tother sonofabitch you were right on the picklebarrel about the trouble the other crewman grinned and mica acting magnificently replied well thats sure good fellahsthe thing wont run and hit us in the ass now they all laughed mkg said you guys i want you to meet commander peace from the british sub hes coming for a ride with us wants to see willowtracks escape gear cant leave this right now replied the other torpedoman but jeez mkghelp yourself close thatch willyatheres going to be some hammering in a moment added the first man sure boys ill do that we edged through a low steel door peace slammed it in front of us was the trunk a heavy bronze tube running out of sight into the bulkhead hung round it from the steel beams were sacks of onions for the galley it struck a homely note peace flung his weight against the big locking dogs and snapped open the hatch into the tube arent there any lights i asked peaces voice came from inside somewhere here is a selfilluminating dial quick mkg gave a quick glance about and edged in i followed peace clamped the hatch shut behind us i felt the smooth polish of the coffinlike interior it is one thing to be shown an escape apparatus as an interested bystander another to stake ones life on it i wished i had listened more carefully to bob peters heres the ladder to the upper hatch said peaces disembodied voice wait heres a toggle by the clock i heard the click of the switch and a faint light came on from the selfcontained waterproof of batteries the depth needle steadied as willowtrack took up her periscope depth the bronze glowed evilly in the poor light strip ordered peace mkg unzipped his khaki and i tugged at buttons then mkg stood in his underpants the remington in one hand and his two plasticwrapped packets of documents in the other the gurgling of the forward trim tank echoed through the confined space peace put his foot on the first rung of the ladder right remember ballastcontrol will sense it as soon as i flood he indicated two valves at chest level when the pressure equalizes open those and step out john peace swung himself up a locking wheel creaked a stream of seawater cascaded in however hardened a submariner is this is still the awful moment he fears above all elsewhen water comes rushing in in a moment it was up to our knees pressurewatch it called peace my eyes went to the big dial the needle was swinging upwards god it seemed loaded with lead the water rose to my thighs suddenly there was a new note the diving officer had detected the inrush of water he was pumping water from the forard trim tank our discarded clothes as if unwilling to be separated from us clung soggily around our bodies peace spun the valve to its maximum the water shot up to our armpits pressure my ears roared as the air compressed in the upper area of the trunk i began to feel dizzy breathing was difficult blow and go commanded peace i nodded to mkg and inadvertently took a deep breath it was like a hot iron shoved into my chest i started to cry out but i knew i had to save every breath of air for the ascent i plunged under tugged hard at the wheel valve it seemed to come away in my handit was in perfect order dont hold your breath warned peace i ducked under and spun the second locking valve with quite unnecessary force i tugged at the escape door it opened as if it had been counterbalanced i paused a faint sunlight glow of green came from above as i stood poised on the metal step then i lurched forward an iron band clamped round my chest the pain was acute i let go my breath and shot upwards bubbles boiled from my mouth uncontrollably the pain vanished it was like stepping into an everlightening room deep green changed to light to turquoise to bluei was blinking in bright sunshine i was on the surface devastations black hull was close and our dinghy was stroking for it there was a splash near memkg he screwed up his eyes grinned and swam awkwardly to me keeping the remington and his papers clear before he could speak peace broke surface he laughed blow and go you need a tranquillizer beforehand commander peace cupped his hands devastation boat ahoy here in reaction i found myself laughing out loud at the stunned surprise of the four ratings they gazed unbelievingly as our clothes appeared one garment by one in slow motion from the depths the men dug their paddles in the petty officer in charge burst out strike a bleeding light its commander peace jesus exclaimed a rating the third poised his paddle in midstroke the skippere s become a flaming merman slap it about retorted peace goodhumouredly just testing willowtracks escape gear here haul us aboard the petty officer looked uncertainly at mkg im too sir peace grinned im too nowdevastation smartly lads the boat sped across the water there was a burst of chatter from the men on the deck casing peace naked except for his underpants stood up peters on the flying bridge stood thunderstruck sir l this is an exercise yelled peace clear the casing clear the bridge stand by to dive we hustled unceremoniously through the forward hatch the diving alarm sounded as we reached the controlroom peace dripping water went to the divingstand peterss agitated voice came through the bridge speaker controlbridge all clear topside officers automatically carrying out the drill did not take their eyes off peace theyand the crewwould talk about this until it became a legend jettison the anchor snapped peace jettison the anchoraye aye sir repeated a startled junior officer and spoke rapidly to the torpedoroom no time to rig the ship to dive and compensate her peace was taking her down like a train relying on his own skill and the diving officers shut the induction bob he ordered the toggle on the bcp went over the hatch clanged to open the vents said peace take her down periscope depth left full rudder ahead flank course twosevenzero smartly the diving officers hands raced across the panel engineroom annunciators flicked to maximum speed i felt the propeller bite and devastation badly out of trim but diving hard swung in a halfcircle to take her westwards out of the bay peace called sounding forty feet there were less than thirty under us if a coral finger projected from this uncharted bottom follow the bottom down to the thirtyfathom mark i want continuous soundings peace beckoned to me its thirty fathoms for about a mile westwards of the point after that it falls away to a couple of thousand im taking her deep you dont think tyler hasnt heard all this fuss of our getaway i asked sombrely willowtrack is goodbloody good geoffrey tyler will come after us you can be sure of that he replied tersely sonar confused echoes bearing oneeightzero degrees range two thousand yards cant make anything of it yet sir two thousand yards that meant we had a flying start over willowtrack sonar is not accurate under yards willowtrack would be having our own listening problems exaggerated by the racing propeller and st brandons broken agglomeration of coralheads islets and reefs on our present course however we would soon be in deep water peace knew that the hot sun must have created a thermal layer in the water offshore anything up to feet deep sound even the sound of our fullahead engineswould be distorted reflected deflected by this layer i guessed he would play the layer to the full but he would lose it pretty soon if he headed deep and far from the land as apparently he was doing for the moment however we were safe by virtue of our hightailing start it was a respite no more peters came across and said formally to peace outlined against the unreal glow of green and red from the instruments wish to report sir radio out of action how the dark shadows masked peaces eyes and the strange light emphasized his cheekbones so that he looked like some avenging angel at the controls while you were aboard willowtrack sir williams was on duty maybe he didnt hear her coming her i gasped peters became agitated mamzelle adele sir she broke into the radioroom with a pistol a colt with a hocked hammer ill bet said peace grimly williams didnt hear sirmaybe he was dozing from the effects of the long shifts hes worked before he knew where he was shed hit him over the head with the butt and dragged him out here he jerked his head towards the steel door of the radioroom and before we could do anything she had locked the door shes been there ever since my god exclaimed peace his glance went across to me and then to the remington case in mkgs hands better stay out of this john no i shouted no you cant peters said levelly ive tried to reason with her sir she merely says that if anyone breaks in shell shoot peace took the pistol case from mkg eyes left their instruments as he dropped a heavy fire ball shell on to the breech platform tilted the barrel down and snicked the bolt shut i grabbed at the heavy weapon geoffrey you cant his eyes were blank as he turned on me there are a hundred men whose safety depends on he inclined his head towards the locked door you are only one so is she stand by peters and mkg grabbed me by the arms he strode over to the radioroom and raised the reinington open he called openor i fire i found myself struggling and shouting as a voice answered from inside in the deadly quiet of the control centre then the door flew open and adele stood there the colt in her hand drop it i yelled adele drop it or hell shoot she smiled and threw the colt at peaces feet ah commander she said quietly i wrenched free and darted across peace swung the remingtons short barrel so that it arched over both of us stand back she said matteroffactly to peace you saw the signal about yourselfthe funeral yes there was no inflexion in his voice as soon as i read it i guessed tyler would think you a fakewhatever you said she went on she looked across at mkg is that the vicepresident yes im glad you got him out suddenly peace dropped the barrel of the wickedlooking weapon and with his free hand grabbed her shoulder and pulled her close he burst out laughing by all the devilfish in limuria he exclaimed so it was you you jammed willowtrack to give me time she laughed too glancing a little uncertainly at me i knew after what you had said that the exec wouldnt allow me near the radio extreme measures were called for so i took the pistol williamsis he hurt no just stunned he looked at her in amazement and admiration and i thought he clunked back the bolt of the remington and spat on the tip of the shell she grinned epitaph for a spy thanks to you weve got a start on tyler peace went on quickly and itll need all our brains to outsmart him suddenly he seemed to become aware of his naked torso he grinned at her clothescaptains cabin come on mkg bob adeledont just stand there john pick up that darned gun of hers and come she smiled and hooked her arm in mine we all went through to peachs cabin peace talked from the shower cubicle as he pulled on fresh clothes handing some to mkg also he outlined to peters what had happened aboard willowtrack he reentered the cabin with mkg who was silent thoughtful weve got to fight this like a man with one hand tied behind his back peace observed mkg interrupted gravely commander there is to be no shooting tyler is acting from the best of motivesi know that replied peace his first duty as he sees it is to protect the vicepresident now hes on our tail but thanks to adele he hasnt had the opportunity to get off a message its a question of trying to outthink and outguess him until i can get a message to the president began mkg tyler must be reassured from the highest level hell take a lot of reassurance said peace grimly you saw that for yourself not even your word mkg was good enough for him our escape wont make it easier he is convinced we are a couple of spies who have shanghaied the vicepresident i found my voice at last adele still kept her arm in mine tyler wontcantshoot for fear of injuring you peters said quietly devastation has taken aboard an awful responsibility sir the decision is mine bob replied mkg the responsibility likewise is mine remember that peters glowed under the strange magnetism of the man aye aye sir once tylers news gets around well have a power of people against us mkg smiled and turned and turned to peace whats in your mindwillowtrackwise commander peace found a chart from his desk and smoothed out the parchment northeastwards st brandon stretched for about miles shaped like a primitive bludgeon narrow one end thick the other from raphael one of the few inhabited islands peace and i had explored the great barrier reef from an island pirogue a wild jumble of coralheads racing seas and small passages amid bursting spray a plume of foam held fifty feet aloft by the trade wind streamed perpetually across the eastern side of the reefthundering booming drenching old andre the only fisherman peace could induce to take us because of local superstition about the reef had commended his soul to god at the wild sight but we had discoveredand partially chartedan unknown inlet in the coral about five miles long and one broad it had a seaward entrance there was however nothing on ordinary charts to show it existed when he had recovered himself old andre assured us with a grin that this knowledge of the reef passage was as good as a pensiona fish pension he called itfor now he knew rich fishinggrounds where no other islander dared venture mkg read out an annotation on the side of peaces chart no vessel dare approach this seaward face of the reef his eyes held the question peters was uneasy peace replied obliquely our first task is to try and shake off willowtrack easy to say i interjected tylers the best i could see by the set line of peaces jaw how worried he was he replied quietly if tyler catches either devastation with the vicepresident or semitiante with little bear our game is up semitiantes course is west of st brandonwere heading east if tyler he shrugged off the thought our immediate task is to lay a trail away from semitiante and at the same time give tyler the slip go for deep water suggested peters peace shook his head in deep sea willowtrack is certain to pick us up we must stick to st brandon our best bet already were starting to get clear of ground echoes and the mush of sound which comes from the reef which means that tyler can hear us willowtrack is faster than devastation all tyler needs to do if we head deep is to sit on our tail he wont lose us once were a firm contact you can lay any money even if devastation flees right across the indian ocean at maximum depth tyler will stick if i try and make a break hes got the heels of me if i surface hell surface he will stop at nothing to get the vicepresident safely back in his hands everything weve done has served to confirm that weve kidnapped him i ran a fingernail up the chart showing the jagged miles of st brandons reef so youre going to lose him among this lot geoffrey ill try he replied mkg screwed up his eyes in that farhorizon way of his and spoke to adele your jamming was a fine bit of work you see i cannot signal the white house in my special code before a fixed time at sunset every evening weve still about six hours to wait once the president knows what the situation is he can instruct the navy to call off tyler why not simply radio the president now i asked mkg shook his head when i left the president and i arranged that the sunset time only would be used he gestured towards the documents in his plastic bag not even the navy knows the code the president and i have a special preamble just to make sure that if anyone got hold of that it would still be recognized as bogus adele said let me signal the white house in plain language now look at it from the other point of viewfrom tylers a signal reaches new london submarine hq from tyler saying the vicepresident has been snatched by he grinned at us by a couple of red agents meantime should a plain signal without my special code also come in that would smell to high heaven if i were the president in such circumstances that plus tylers statements would certainly add up to a kidnapping as we spoke peace was becoming more restive he said sharply mkg i dont think the others know just how much little bear and the snap project mean to us youre still going along with it arent you mkg nodded provided all is aboveboard with the white house im willing to keep the secret tight before tyler shoots off his mouth and ruins everything good exclaimed peace but therell be no signalling while i dodge tyler one radio emissioin will give tyler a fix which will enable him to pinpoint us within a couple of miles today is february th on february th we will launch little bear as scheduled mkg seemed taken aback at peaces tone there is one exception to what youre saying commander my signal to the white house goes out each day at sunset irrespective i now recalled peaces attitude when the dni had insisted on the one reservation in the mission as far as mkg was concerned namely that he had the right at any time to call it off if he felt it was prejudicing his high office or the nation we seemed to be stumbling over the same obstacle again well get it off somehow he replied so perfunctorily that all my doubts remained would he dare not even peace i told myself for all his faith and devotion to little bear and its enormous implications for the future of two great navies would dare run counter to mkgs express wishes bob john went on peace changing the subject abruptly look at this chart peters broke in if youre trying to evade willowtrack why are you going full ahead now and kicking up such a racket that shes bound to hear it if she hasnt done so already the old thrill of the chase was upon me peters was vibrating with interest mkg became excited controlled as peace outlined his escape plan it was i believe the point at which he failed to appreciate peaces deadly singlemindedness about little bear and snap at the moment im manufacturing a knuckle of sound he said ill lead willowtrack on i too was carried away ive sailed with this foxy bastard i grinned across at peace hes laying a false trail right now id say that willowtrack at this moment is picking up on her sonar a confused but distinguishable echoon a steady line heading deep that echo however wont be clear enough peace nodded confirmation of my outline of his tactics for her to be sure that its devastation but its strong enough to give tyler a pretty fair hunch then suddenly devastation will go full astern hard astern after full ahead makes a sort of solid sound willowtrack will come right up against a wall of sound while we go ultraquietevery blasted thing off which makes a noise the men without their shoes evenand we sneak away up the coastline we stay close to the barrier reef so that the seas breaking against it mask our getaway are breaking seas enough asked mkg these waves on st brandon reef will sound like all hell on sonar peace added heavy as a force six sea whats the weather up to i asked peters smiled at adele when i last had access to the radioroom met at chagos reported a big cyclone buildup beginning mkgs eyes again screwed up little bear is an act of faith with me he said tersely the rest of us stared under the spell of the man i have to take that spaceride its not only the weapon science is the faith which put me where i am today and little bear is its supreme justification my eyes were on peace the hard mouth softened a little and his eyes glowed peace would stop at nothing to launch little bear if you give revs the slip commander what then asked mkg semittante exclaimed peace i must have semitiante mkg held up his hand the moment tyler misses you dont you think he wont go for exactly the same target semitiante shes as important as i am in this hunt perhaps even more so for if he can locate semittante he can put paid to the mission without crossing swords with me tyler will sanitize the ocean between here and loveapple crossing dont underestimate tyler tyleryou heard him say it himselfhasnt any forward briefing on the mission beyond the st brandon rendezvous peace replied that was his main cause for suspicion he is unaware of two vital points of information where semitiante is or where the launch is to take place hes got a hell of a lot of ocean to sift either way at thirty knots plus all her search equipment willow track will pick up semitiante before we do mkg said revs knowsyou told himthat semitiante had cleared mauritius a few days ago let me send semittante a bogus radio message in french and arrange a rendezvous between ourselves and her adele suggested no replied peace one radio emission he drew his hand across his throat and weve had it another thing i know that tyler doesnt since the days of my piratical ancestor sir john peace and the corsair surcouf the seas round st brandon have had a bad name especially the eastern coastline where were now headed im certain that semitiante will avoid the east and take the western side of st brandon its more likely still seeing the weather is deteriorating peace rounded on peters bob once weve shaken off willowtrack devastation will become a liability to the launch from then on you take over command from me peters looked disappointed puzzled aye aye sir but what about you he asked mkg id like to be there to see you safely launched sir wemyself mkg john adelewill transship from devastation to my yacht bellatrix i gave trevordavis his orders and i know exactly where to intercept her i pored over the chart adele with me as i see it i said we are at the moment about three hundred miles from the original rendezvouspoint with semitiante correct said peace that rendezvous was a hundred miles south of loveapple crossing peace pulled out another smallerscale chart and i did a quick calculation i stabbed at a point north of loveapple crossing bellatrixs route lies between loveapple crossing and agalega the two islands are about fifty miles apart bellatrixs course is a constant factor in our plans the intercom broke in imperatively peace listened slapped it down willowtracks closing weve work to do peace mkg and peters hurried out i waited behind for a moment i smoothed adeles sunbleached hair she raised her face to mine peace cant win she said softly i dont believe mkg will go through with it remember what the dni saidif mkgs secret were known tyler would call in the whole of the seventh fleet i halfopened my mouth to tell her my fears about peace but stopped ive sailed with him before i replied slowly and when i thought he was dead i still said to the petty officer in the dnis garden peace is a brave dangerous ruthless bastard who has killed more men than he can remember coral polynya peace was at the divingstand when we went through to the control centre the eerie light enhancing his black clothes adele pressed my hand and went to make her peace with williams the radio operator the ballastcontrol petty officer had his hands out like a pianist waiting for the conductors baton as he watched peace one planesman was in charge which meant that peace intended to change depth and course rapidly and suddenlyit is easier to manoeuvre fast with one man instead of two he glanced nervously at the gyro compass repeater and rudderangle indicator above his head and ran his tongue round his lips the diving officer instead of sitting in his normal languid position behind the divingstand was swinging on his toes feeling the ship peace was balancing devastationtaking advantage of the layer of denser water which had masked our getawayby sitting on it as she hung he ordered a slight intake into the auxiliary tanks it told me we had entered a layer of cold water peace would play that to the utmost i glanced at the bug of light under the glasstopped chart table we were about a mile off the southern extremity of st brandon as i came close peace turned to the deadreckoning tracerthe instrument which shows a goblins movements and increased the volume of the sonar soundreproducer he nodded at me tightlipped it was not for nothing that the dni had filched willowtracks sound signature from the us navys antisubmarine warfare library a cloudy clutter of sound came through then jumjum jumsqueak circ pump willowtrack i said the sonarman intoned possible contact bears zerosevenfive degrees could she hear us at our speed the propeller could only be pinwheeling peaces finger whitened on the activatingr button of the control microphone rig for silent running a paralysing quiet fell on the control centre we awaited peaces next move would he try to fox the crafty tyler with a sound knuckle or try to slip away depth speed oneeighty feet sir four knots we crept along into rapidlydeepening water as the volcanic shelf on which st brandon lies fell away into the ocean depths peace rapped out all stop left full rudder devastation eased round the extremity of st brandon the way off her back full rudder amidships a shudder pulsed through devastation as peace dived backwards into his own echo a long minute passed we were racing sternon towards willowtrack ahead onethird take her down smartly three hundred feet course oneeighty degrees true up went the planesmans hand to the engine annunciator pointer he said without inflexion answers ahead onethird sir mkg stood like a statue among the confusing agglomeration of dials pipes cables and eerilylit instrument consoles devastation crept away for half an hour it seemed no one in the controlroom drew breath peace altered course until i sawthe sonarmans face whiten at the thunder of the seas against the barrier reef peace went deep feetand inched up and as close to the menacing seafacing coastline of st brandon as he dared an hour passed tension eased the combination of our sound knuckle and the echo effects of the reef must have baffled tyler then the sonarman keyedup exclaimed possible goblin contact sir peace looked thunderstruck shesshes parallel with us he grabbed his microphone rig for ultraquiet all stop hold her steady with the pumps bob nothing that is not necessary devastation coasted to a standstill all turbines generators and pumps not needed for the essential running of the ship were silent men kicked off their shoes no one spoke peace turned on the sound reproducer through the woolly beat of surfthere it wasjumjumjumsqueak the sonar operator intoned softly contact evaluated as submarine sir range course speed range four thousand five hundred yards approximate course zerothreefive degrees true approximate speed he paused tensely slowing sirslowing now slowing she had a bead on devastation all right wil lowtrack slowed as we slowed flood her down bob seven hundred feet smartly as the way dropped off her devastation started to sink slowly at first then more rapidly then in a moment it seemed she was starting to race for the bottom christ snapped peace that bloody salinity layer pump auxiliaries to the sea the noise of the pumps seemed to fill the whole ship and willowtrack lay less than two miles away ears glued to us a chant came from the rating at the rateofflow meterit shows the gallonage going overboard six thousand out seven thousand outten thousand outsixteen thousand o u t i glanced at the fathometer feet peace would never hold her in trying to outsmart tyler he had been caught by the density of the water which a short while before had been devastations friend there was only one thing to do tyler or no tyler blow the tanks ordered peace as it thundered into the main ballast tanks the highpressure air seemed to shout our position to willowtrack it ceased devastation hung uncertainly the sonar was silent willowtrack had the edge the warm smell of polythene caught at my throat then the sonarman said goblin contact a look of astonishment came over his face shes making off sir ten knots peace swung on me what the devil is tyler playing at here he had us nailed then he simply pushes off maybe he didnt hear us at allsomething to do with the underwater topography i suggested the sound could be distorting peace shook his head there it was however on the sonarscope the retreating sound of willowtrack peace was uneasy its a double bluff he muttered wants me to run for deep waterdoes tyler know the cyclone forecast mkg kept his voice low if you run semittante is wide open the alternative is the simplestwillowtrack didnt hear us i said after all theres a hell of a racket the sea on the reef true peace reflected contact goblinshes speeding up sir what the hell snapped peace ahead onethird we started to shadow our pursuer the sonarman chanted contact fading nineteen thousand yards peaces order for flank speed came too late as mysteriously as she had halted willowtrack disappeared secure from ultraquiet ordered peace there was no need now to keep the men tensed up we had lost heror had we the charts moving needlepoint of light now placed us off the southern end of seahorse sound inletwhere the seahorses tail started to curve as adele fancifully pointed out the inlet itself stretching for five miles parallel with our present course terminated at a seaward entrance with a coral headland st brandons widest sector stealthily devasta tion inched on i glanced up at the big clock and mkgs glance followed mine six oclock the whole afternoon had passed peace turned to us jubilant it was the sort of exercise his iron nerves rejoiced in lost her certain asked mkg pretty well he replied whats on your mind mica shall we go through to your quarters he asked john and adele too peaces excitement gave way to caution of course wil lowtrack may be lying doggo we went through to the cabin mkg said without preamble see here commander now youve shaken willowtrack off our necks i must let the president know whats happening let the president know echoed peace incredulously you want me to signalto give our position away after all i ve done to evade willowtrack mkg reddened slightly but he remained adamant i said once before commander that my first duty is to the office of vicepresident anything might have happened since the white house signal to me yesterday its almost sunset now and the routine time my messages are scheduled to go off adele can send itid prefer her to your regular operator peace swung backwards and forwards on his heels you seriously propose that i should go to periscope depth put up an antenna which is detectable by willowtracks radar and send off a signal which will enable tyler to get a fix on my position have you also considered the timefactor involved in sending such a signal how long do you think ill have to stay up its not a matter of a few minutes its a signal halfway across the world reception may be bad it usually is in a westeast or eastwest direction in these latitudes devastation will be a sitting duck in willowtrack i had seen the clash of three wills now i was witnessing that of two i dont like to say this commander replied mkg but unless you agree you will surface and return me to willow track the little bear missioin will be off either you signal or its over with devastation scarcely made a sound crawling along the cabin creaked youd call off a mission of such magnitude to send a signal which may kill it anyway demanded peace you commander are devoted to this mission mkg said quietly and his personality seemed to flood the cabin if tyler had been equally so we wouldnt be in a spot now but he saw his duty to the american nation and the office of the vicepresident as the greater my first duty is to my office as vicepresident if the mission runs counter to that the mission will be sacrificed the signal epitomizes my duty it must go but willowtrack will locate us argued peace i broke in you said aboard willowtrack that the daily signal at sunset to the white house applied only during willowtracks outward journey to st brandon after that you said you would keep in touch through the dni we could come now to periscope depth get off a brief message to the dni that you are in fact in good hands he smiled slightly and suggest a return signal at a given time a couple of hours later peace shook his head it would give devastations position away he repeated let me send iteven williams says im the quickest operator he knows urged adele very briefhalf a dozen words willowtrack would never get a bearing on us for so short a while we all faced peace whose face remained bleak its an old royal navy adage he said when in battle never break radio silence the dnis only eight hundred miles away the white house is eight thousand adele urged i can raise mahe in a couple of minutes a couple of minutes is all willowtrack needs retorted peace will you agree i asked mkg ill agree if the commander will agree one brief message to the dni and a return to be fixed for the presidents okay otherwise he shrugged peace stood silent and then without speaking he went to an intercom bob any sign of willowtrack not a thing sir very well im coming through well go to periscope depth he said to mkg with halfgrudging admiration i dont like this mkg but if you keep it brief maybe we can get away with it adele and i will draft it replied mkg peace and i returned to the control centre our instruments still showed no sign of willowtrack periscope depth ordered peace ease her up mkg and adele joined us within minutes and peace sent them through to the radioroom williams grinning ruefully came out and closed the door behind him peace brought devastation up to feet with a series of orders he raised the radio antenna i watched the clock one minute two minutes three minutes then mkg came out gave the thumbsup sign peace shot off orders in rapid fire take her downtwo hundred feet handsomely full ahead the big sub picked up speed we came opposite the entrance to seahorse sound the surf drummed on the sonar peaces continuing unease communicated itself to the group poring over the chart table a new ripple of sound what is it peace jerked out big school of fish replied the sonarman evenly could be opposite the inlet entrance muttered peace staring at the chart i hope to god that signal the sonarmans voice cracked through the silent weirdlylit controlroom contact bearing zerofourzero degrees range three thousand yards course zero speed zero my god exclaimed peace jumping for the control stand willowtrack stopped right across our bows and we send off a bloody signal into the bargain to tell her exactly where we are he swung on mkg who stood therepale for a moment i thought he would reproach him then he turned back to his instruments tylerthe foxy bastard he made an offset to ambush us and then we go and tell him were on our way into his ambush jesus that bloody signal he snatched up his microphone and stabbed the button rig for steep angles right full rudder ahead flank five hundred feet smartly the planesmen snapped on their safetybelts for the hydrobatics mkg adele and i grabbed the overhead trolleystraps tyler had been very shrewd he had read his opponents mind in a way which the navys training schools at nuky poo and dam neck never taught peace too had been right about mkgs signal and his uneasiness had been on the same instinctive nonrational basis as tylersthe supraconscious decisions of the hunter and the hunted tyler had first shown a masterly intuitive reading of the signs and then we had handed him the rest on a plate by virtue of mkgs signal had this been war i told myself grimly the first we would have heard of willowtrack would have been the swift rush of her torpedoes it remained now to see how tyler would push home his advantage i clung to my trolleystrap as the deck went down thirty degrees and the reduction gears of the giant nuclear turbines took on their fullthroated whine call out the depths ordered peace three hundredthreefiftyfour hundred peace raised his right hand with two fingers curved in a tight circle to the diving officer the man nodded and gave a volley of orders but the depthindicator had hit feet before he caught her left full rudder three hundred feet smartly commanded peace my stomach gave a sickening lurch as devastation turned on a sixpence and spiralled upwards peace held her to the first half of a tight s rolled her off the top and went deep twisting likes a harpooned whale sonar said contact bears twosixzero degrees five thousand yards speed approximately thirtyfive knots tyler was clinging like a leechhe had lost less than a mile as we shot off into a series of tailchasing gyrations peace reached the glass tabletop hanging on as devastation peeled off in the equivalent of a steep aeroplane bank she headed towards the entrance to seahorse sound tearing towards its jagged jaws at knots he grabbed my strap to steady himself there were rings of sweat below his eyes john he asked you didnt get any soundings in that entrance did you the fear and the thrill of what he was about to do hit me no adele said at st brandon there are stories of a deep mysterious passage somewhere into the reef mkg broke in commander rather peace shook his head no periscope depth devastation was under full power up attack periscope the long tube much thinner than the main periscope so as to leave no feather of spray on the surface slid up at the periscope jockeys touch of a lever peace clipped down the handles and threw his left arm over one in the almost affectionate way i had seen so many times he took a quick sweep round he beckoned me over i glanced into the eyepiece i gasped we were rushing straight at two big coral cliffs through a gauzy curtain of spray the red sun sank balefully masking the streaming cliffs and daggerlike coralheads in the strange light the corals soft pinks reds and yellows were blurred to leprous monochromes on which stood out in startling juxtaposition jagged striated black barnacles sea creatures and weed they seemed right on top of us but in fact the entrance was nearly half a mile wide i flicked the singlelens scope asternno willowtrack only a wild following sea exploding against the cliffs we were in the entrance speed onethird peace ordered adele saw my face what is it she whispered i whispered back if she strikesi love you peace at the scope gave a quick glance roundand astern all stop the engine annunciators swung rig for ultraquiet speed zero called the plotter softly all stop sonar would willowtrack come crashing into us at full speed just as we had stormed the wild passage unable to detect us in her path because of the breaking surf would tyler take the risk goblin contact slowing of course tyler had no way of knowing there was a gap in the barrier reef ease her down to one hundred feet the auxiliary pump clattered softly and seawater crunched into the trimming tanks would willowtrack hearand come on goblin contactspeed zero tyler had funked it but devastation was in mortal danger the swift race of the current had swung her stern towards the coral cliffs peace was on the ball periscope depth pump from auxiliaries to the sea the diving officers handling was masterly a ton submarine is not meant to ride up and down like a lift especially when a current is snatching and spinning her towards destruction every eye was on peace slowly deliberately he made a degree sweep with the main periscope down periscope ahead onethird course twotwozero straight into the inlet goblin contact lost chanted the soneroperator cant willowtrack hear us any more adele asked me anxiously no i replied tylers outside the barrier reef he could try and follow us in if he heard us enter mkg said tersely hes outside maybe he guesses were inside peace altered course and headed down the inlet parallel to the way we had come up the coastline but inside the shelter of the reef now he joined us his face was set there are half a dozen tiny coral atolls in the inlet he said im making for them theyre about the size of devastation mkg said quietly tylers sure got you commander but peace spoke to adele you spoke about an umbrellashaped piece of coral in the grand carreaux when we were headed round st brandonwhat was it like likewhy an umbrella or a mushroom there was a stem of coral in the middle and was there an overhang he cupped his hands a sort of roof not a roof she replied the coral wasnt strong enough for that he leaned forward eagerly not strong enough not at the rim of the overhang anyway it was a favourite with the fishermen as the fish concentrate under the shelf shelf he queried yesits so thin near the edge that if youre spearfishing you have to be careful not to fall through mkg said commander theres no way out of thisand willowtracks waiting outside peace swung on his toes there is a way outthrough the coral we looked at him in astonishment he gestured upwards upthrough ill take devastation uplike they do through the ice american nuclear subs pioneered the technique of breaking through polar icethey smashed up from below its standard practice now all these subs are equipped with polynya delineatorsa special type of sonar which traces the outline of a hole in the ice the polynya or gap in the ice is often covered with a thinner layer of ice a couple of feet thick a skylight they call em if a sub can penetrate thin ice like that it can smash through a coral skylight just as easily thats why adeles information is invaluable to me at the moment i intend smashing through the coral umbrella of one of these little atolls and making devastation seem to be part of the atoll itselfundetectable by willowtracks radar he turned and went back to the divingstand adeles hand was clenched on my arm at what he was about to attempt devastation approached the first jagged coral atoll depth asked peace fiftyfive feet devastation edged closer barely under way flood her down bob vents opened water poured in three hundred feet down she went secure flooding devastation coasted to a standstill switch on the icedetector i eyes turned in amazement to the black figure merged against the shadows of the periscope stand a switch was thrown and a new instrument face came to life in the control centrean upward beam fathometer to detect the thin patch of skylight if it existed a metal stylus began to oscillate against a papercovered cylinder a pattern appeared smashthrough technique worked in icewould it do so in coral speed zero all stop clear water overhead we had found a polynya in the coral the polynya delineator traced the outline of its edges i stood by the instrument my hands were wet with sweat icecoralsolidoverhead devastation had drifted clear of the skylight i recalled the current sweeping into the inlet peace raised the periscope and beckoned to me at first i saw nothing i directed the prism upwards i saw then a blurred greenblue a school of dark turquoise surgeonfish blended against the jagged splendour of coral on one side a pale shellpink fish drifted into view above and then coasted down curiously towards the scope i could see his pink sides and silveryblue back he was so close i swung the periscope round against the pressure of the seaits tip was still nearly feet below the surfaceand winced within touching distance it seemed a coral mass towered from the deeps it flowered cantileverlike surfacewards this was what peace intended to break through ease her up to one hundred feet he ordered i stood with him not trusting my knees to take me across to the icedetector call out the depths as she comes up oneeighty onesixty onetwenty one hundred the growing light showed up peaces face in the periscope eyepiece its top was now only feet from the coral thin icecoraloverhead offset skylight intoned the man at the icedetector i saw the muscles tauten round peaces parted lips he held a hundred lives in his hand down periscope stand by to hit the coral bring her up aye aye sir the only sound was the thrum of the pumps devastation rose there was a sickening shock i grabbed the stand the sub caromed off the coral hurtled downwards i saw peace check his order to blow all the main ballastif he had done that to hold her mad career she would have raced headlong up into the coral above without nicety of control pumps the diving officer caught her we hung at feet again ordered peace harder this time bob i felt the strong bite of the pumps and the upward rise of hunter killer the ship then from overhead came a violent rending and crunching eyes went automatically upwards for the telltale inrush of water from devastations crushed sail it did not come fore and aft were a series of heavy thumps sweat ran down peaces throat thenquiet were through mkg exclaimed in disbelief the long barrel of the periscope slid up with its customary hiss peace put his eyes to the instruments rubber cushions then drew back they were wetwith his own sweat of fear he ran his sleeve across the eyepiece the tension was unbearable he turned the scope a full circle slowly he drew back his voice slack with reaction blow the main ballast i swallowed hard as the highpressure air volted into the tanks upsetting the pressure in the control centre we had broken throughnow peace was securing his handhold on the coral he was bringing the entire buoyancy of the ton craft to bear on the underside of the coral to clamp the sub therepart and parcel of the atoll itself devastation creaked and groaned a film of apprehension spread momentarily over peaces eyes as a highpitched squeal of tortured metal followed by a heavy crunch came from somewhere up for ard stand by to surface the crew were dazed automatons intricate routine checks reports flowed in peace remained motionless at the periscope stand ready to surface with infinite caution peace blew the remaining tanks the coral held we were fastpart of the atoll safe from underwater detection safe from eyes afloat open the hatch the petty officer spun the locking dogs peace foot on the ladder did not notice the dollop of water as he threw it open he went up alone into the darkening night into the wild plumage of spray blowing in from where the cyclones are born h u n t e r k i l l e r g r o u p nine days to go mkg spoke our thoughts as he and i sat in peaces cabin waiting for him to return from his lonely vigil on the bridge he had been away for nearly an hour adele had left us to go to the radioroom where apparently she was on the best of terms with williams the operator i felt weary frustrated every drop of emotion had drained out of me the strain of the past hours was plain in mkgs face we were caught in a trapand we knew it the prospect of my being launched only nine days from now is dim mkg went on adele opened the door she did not seem to share our depression she was almost gay her first glance was for me she overheard mkgs remark here itr the islands we say the creole spun softly off her tongue god will plant new coconuts after the cyclone mkgs warm smile for her chased away his abstraction ill have no second chance with little bear he said now that the secret is about to come out from tyler and devastation is trapped it looks as if little bear is finished washed up imagine the hoopdeedah therell be adele said tyler hasnt started transmitting yet you seem to have become williamss no i commented she smiled hes welshemotional celtic temperament no hard feelings about my hammering him on the head ill want that navy codebook for willowtracks messages better decode anything in here replied mkg williams can take em down and you can do the rest here he indicated the desk all the crew knows we have the vicepresident on board she said how do they feel about it mkg asked williams says theyre all on their toes to get you safely away his eyes clouded then they also know about little bear no certainly not she replied they know youre trying to escape from tylera lot of speculation in addition but no facts theyre on your sidebit of a lark says williams if devastation can wipe willowtracks eye theres very little prospect of that now mkg rejoined p peace came in light shining on the spray on his shoulders and hair has tyler sent anything yet he asked adele no she replied ive been with williams when hes not admiring my radio skill hes muttering affectionate nothings in welsh i thought from the look on peaces face that he was about to say something about discipline aboard his ship but instead he shrugged and laughed shortly we owe our getaway to you in the first placehelp yourself to the radioroom she nodded at the navy codebook on the desk mkg thinks id better decode in hereokay yes fine she glanced at her watch the dnis reply should be here within an hour peace looked uneasy but mkg said until i hear from the president that things are fine at home i cant move and if you get the sayso from him then youre still prepared to go ahead peace insisted sure replied mkg but i think the question is only academic at this moment commander youre cornholed here and you know it you cant get out and you cant get in farther peace shook the spray off like a dog but i can get acrossl what peace went on quickly speaking first to adele my plans need your help with the islanders youll be the kingpin too on the radio to keep track of what tyler is up to well take a portabletheres a powerful allwave they use in the mess take echoed mkg take where this seahorse sound of ours is only about seven miles across the reef from raphael which has the only permanent population among all the st brandon islands you cant take a submarine through the worst coral reef in the world i objected who said i intended to he replied well use one of the subs rubber dinghies we four will make our way to raphael in one john and i have negotiated this reef before in a pirogue when we scouted the place on our way from mauritius to the seychelles it can be done its mighty tricky though you deserve to luck out commander said mkg slowly at raphael we can pick up a boat a cutter a pirogue anything that will sail peace went on rapidly trevordavis and mac in bellatrix wont be more than a hundred miles tc the north we know their exact course interception is a cinch bellatrix murmured mkg id forgotten about bellat rix i cant understand tylers silence i said i can replied peace first he didnt have time during our breakaway and second hes too wise he glanced sideways at mkg to send a signal during a hunt now ill bet hes blowing a gasket thinking what the hell youre assuming that he knows devastation is inside the reef how does he the chart simply shows a barrierno seahorse sound hes thinking and rethinking thats what hes doing and above all theres the brutal fact hes lost the vicepresident who i was entrusted to his care he didnt hear any breakingup noises over his instruments as he would have done had we struck the reef he cant locate us by radar or sonar since devastation became almost joined to a chunk of coral about the size of the white house itself ive cancelled all our own radio radar and sonar transmissions tylers not going to make a firstclass ass of himself by signalling before he is sure of something into the bargain the weathers building up maybe tomorrowor the next dayhell take the risk of trying to probe into seahorse sound in willowtrack by that time the birds he gestured to the four of us will have flown what is tylers reaction going to be when he finds devastation and discovers that she is indeed a british sub and not one belonging to some hostile power tylers got the bit right between his teeth replied mkg hes a tough hombre that guy and a nitpicking point like whether or not the sub is british wont stop him until hes got me safely in his hands again but youve forgotten a big factor commander what is that your exec bob peters your crew adele tells me that already every mothers son of them is gossiping about having the vicepresident on board ill order peters to stay put here in seahorse sound said peace let willowtrack waste time trying to find her while we make a hightailing start its not good enough mkg objected youre throwing the entire responsibility on to peters tell him the whole truth i suggested hes one hundred per cent sound is bob peters then hell know how to handle the situation when tyler locates devastation the truthyes peace replied slowly but truth without times schedules the position of the launchingsite or anything about semittantes course peace picked up an intercom and asked peters to join us he glanced curiously round the group on arrival without preliminary peace said bob you must be wondering what in hell is going on peters grinned looking at mkg theyve started a book on you at the aceydeucey table sir ive taken a bet myself all i knowofficially that isis that there is to be a secret testfire of a new weapon how many believe that asked mkg they wouldnt be betting unless there were doubta lot of doubtabout it replied peters evenly bob said peace incisively the vicepresident here is notnever wassupervising such a test fire he was to test it out himselfby taking a spaceride to the santa fe station not even the boys with the bets thought of that one peters said you know devastation is in a trap here went on peace t o m o r r o w i m t a k i n g o n e o f t h e s u b s d i n g h i e s a n d t h e four of us are cutting through the reef to raphael why asked peters still staggered by what he had just heard mkg explained the situation and the reasons for tylers pursuit when he had finished peters said tylers got my sympathy think of his agony of mindwhether to signal that his own vicepresident intends to fly into space and h o l d h i m s e l f u p t o r i d i c u l e i n f r o n t o f t h e n a v y a n d t o p b r a s s o r w h e t h e r t o k e e p h i s m o u t h s h u t i n t h e h o p e o f locating the kidnappers before more harm is done i wouldnt have signalled either its a decision i wouldnt like to have thrust upon me peace went on bob you are to stay here with devastation just keep quiet no transmissions of any kind string tyler along for a couple of days in order to give us a start s t a y s i r p e t e r s l o o k e d d i s a p p o i n t e d h e t u r n e d t o mkg wed all like to help you sir into orbit supplied mkg fraid not bob after tyler has located me i could double back and pick you up at sea suggested peters eagerly we could arrange a rendezvous west of st brandon i could get you to the launch point in devastation no bob said peace i dont want to bring the whole united states seventh fleet on to your neck no weve got a plan peters looked appealingly again at mkg but peace remained adamant ill want one of the rubber dinghies ready by morning complete with food water charts compass navigational instruments peters turned to go then he stopped and said to mkg good luck sir for a moment his habitual command reserve faltered i and a lot of other peopleyour own people will want you to make it sir he saluted formally and went mkg stared after him i wonder peace shook his head no a nuclear sub is a big craft itll be difficult to hunt the small ship well have and it wont be in a pockethandkerchief inlet but in an ocean one thousand miles one way and six hundred the other see if i cant hide a ship in that bellatrix is small and fast admitted mkg i wasnt talking of bellatrix replied peace i mean semittante ill intercept bellatrix and then i shall go after semittante in her i intend to cut her out i want little bear even if i have to shoot the whole crew he inclined his head towards the remington i mean to have little bear cut her out mkg echoed i tll be easyweve help aboard in the shape of dr boz blair and the team who are assisting at the launch i wonder what theyll think when we swing alongside flying the jolly roger i exclaimed peace did not respond listen he said sharply after tyler has located devastationand find her he willdont you think his first objective will be the one thing that matters since he hasnt got the person of mkg semittanteand little bear peters will play dumb and he may find himself being courtmartialled for his part in all this dont forget when tyler therefore cant extract anything from peters hell go right after semittante we have only nine days mkg reflected how long will all this take commander a day maybe two to reach bellatrix depending on what sort of boat we raise at raphael ill steal one if necessary he went on roughly give me the same time again to find semittante that should be easy enough we know her course and his eyes warmed and he spoke to adele this hk man john is a magician when it comes to navigation another couple of days after that to loveapple crossing that should leave us fourfive days once were there considered mkg i dont like schedules replied peace there are too many imponderables when youre dealing with the sea the launch deadline is immovable began mkg when there was a rap at the door it was williams the radio operator he held out some signals code sir all three of em one of ems ours and they could be important thats why i brought them myself cant make out the other two but his dark eyes were on adele maybe the lady can peace broke the formality im damn sure she can liams this is willowtrack then williams relaxed its that yankee sub true enough sir closeloud and clear the others from our people in the seychelles want any feminine assistance williams peace asked grinning argh man he replied and heres ted williams thinking hes the finest operator in the royal navy and there comes a slip of a girlany time you can spare her sir shes welcome now ill be getting back and watching that yankee bastardbegging your pardon mister vicepresident he grinned and went adele glanced at the three signals the one from the seychelles is very short shall i do it first aye said peace mkg was very still adele sat down at peaces desk and worked on the letter groupings its one word only she said handing it to peace washington ah exclaimed mkg and the tension seemed to ebb out of him fine fine peace raised his eyebrows thats the presidents code word that everything is okay he said expansively lincoln means the mission is off i must return at once why lincoln i asked he smiled i suppose i shouldnt be letting you into this secret code but the president and i thought that by using the names of former presidents it would be very nearly unbreakable washington set everything to rights in the states so the situations fine lincoln was assassinatedthings are bad simple as that peace had a curious look on his face washington lincoln that all thats all replied mkg no inbetweens either the little bear mission is on or its off i rely solely on the presidents reading of the signs at home what he says goes peace said nothing but turned to adele i want to know what willowtrack is saying adele took the us navy code and worked on the groups of complicated letters it took her much longer than the dnis return call to the vicepresident there was no sound in the tiny cabin except the creak of the casing against the coral then adele read out willowtrack x opimmed x chief of naval operations x inform white house x marvin k green kidnapped from aboard usn willowtrack x taken abroad submarine stated to be british devastation x shadowed devastation to posi tion long s lat e in st brandon group x lost contact with devastation same position approx gmt x devastations last heading degrees taking her directly on to st brandon outer barrier reef x heavy surf x no breakup noises x no further radar or sonar contact x am lying in above position surfaced x heavy broken water and reefs x will recommence visual search daylight x no breakup noises no contacts exclaimed peace jubilantly tylers starting his search at daylight mkg pointed out visual search means nothing under the blanket of spray peace said we can be clear away at first light adele straightened up at the desk heres the other signal its also from willowtrack request immediate airsea search for french freighter semittante position not known x she carries american classified test missile little bear x adele pointed to the superscription to the signalcom sublnd limuria command exclaimed peace tylers called in the seventh fleet i knew hed go after semittante mkg said anxiously hes asking to vector the whole seventh fleet to search for us no replied peace who seemed eager to placate mkg youre reading the two signals together but in fact theyre in watertight compartments the seventh fleet wouldnt have access to his secret signal to the chief of naval operations would it no conceded mkg reluctantly i suppose not tyler hasnt said a word about you to comsubind peace went on quickly hes merely asked for assistance in trying to locate a ship carrying a classified missile he asks the chief of naval operations to inform the white house mkg said sombrely frankly i dont like it commander i dont like it at all but peace argued youve already informed the president that everything is in order and youve got his okay back again hell naturally discount the tyler story in the light of your prior message we waited as mkg remained silent thoughtful at last he said i suppose i can be grateful that tyler hasnt put it on the air that im going for a spaceride if ever that got out he shrugged the papers certainly wouldnt put that story on the back burner these messages are all topsecret and only for the persons they are directed to peace went on persuasively their contents are not likely to become public property i hope to god not replied mkg the spaceride story out of its true context especially since the project has been officially axed could do me irretrievable harm politically he smiled grimly there are a lot of people who would like to make capital out of it against me back home not only back home i added what about the kremlinpeace was anxious to guide the conversation away from this channel this is all speculation about things which are not likely to come to pass he said look at the facts youve reassured the president only a couple of hours ago mkg he can read the times on tylers signal and make the correct conclusion that youre safe aboard devastation and all is well the kidnapping he will discount in advance therefore tylers acting unilaterally without knowing what lies behind the whole little bear saga the president will call off the dogs and silence tyler it is our duty to the mission to go ahead mkg looked keenly at peace youre pretty set on n it arent you commander yes replied peace i am we can still carry it through in secrecy if we follow my plan and escape through the reef mkg seemed to hesitate between peaces reassurances and his own inward doubts he said commander is it not possible for me to signal the white house via the dni again and give our position away after all weve been through to dodge willowtrack mkg looked thoughtful im not happy about it commander but i see your point will you give me a categorical assurance that whatever the circumstances you will signal the white house as soon as we intercept bellatrix i saw the relief flood into peaces face yes but by that time in any event i think all this he waved the signals will have been called off and well be on our way unhampered to loveapple crossing maybe tyler is taking a lot upon himself without explaining much mkg said were on the inside which makes it easy to understand i wonder what admiral thorntons reaction will be when he receives a message like that out of the blue i said he doesnt even know that willowtrack is in waters under his command peace seemed unwilling now that he had gained his point to go on discussing it ill check over the dinghy myself for our trip in the morning ill put in lifejackets too i felt weary after the long strain of the chase and the mounting tension which the signals brought with them i said to peace mind if i go up on to the bridge for a breather looked over at adele who smiled peace was abstracted dont go up on to the flying bridge or move around topsides i dont want willowtracks radar picking up a moving object to make her suspicious take oilskins the bridge shield isnt enough to keep off the spray adele and i made our way through the silent control centre it had the air of a stage after the players have gone the watch was on duty but there was nothing of the previous bustle i undogged the hatch and we stepped out into another world the world of st brandon the world of the two of us the spray was salt on her lips as i kissed her it looped high into the air above our headslike standing under a shower the tall black sail projected through the hole it had made in the coral but the hull itself was out of sight landwardsor rather towards the west where the coral thickened into innumerable swashways in the reefi could see the glint of breaking seas sparkling against coral in the starlight through the gauzy curtain seawards i spotted orions belt the wind blew hard into the inlet from the northeast the direction of the entrancebut inside it was strangely calm seahorse sound seemed to have the spurious reality of a film setwater cascading spray blowing yet there was no bite to it adele swept back the yellow oilskin hood the spray turned to stars in her hair she drew in a deep breath st brandonoh the smell of it i smell the grands carreaux you cant imagine what it is like on a london winters night to yearn for this islandsmell i kissed her again lets come back when this is all over she drew back only far enough for me to see her eyes seabright we cant you knowst brandon is a mans world the jouissance stipulates no women theyre hellcats troublemakers i kissed her silent but she drew away and was grave thisthis thing of mkgsit seems to be unleashing forces that he or we never dreamed of it makes me frightened hes in advance of his tithes i replied pushing back her hair its not only the justification of a weapon which this mission stands for its the justification of everything he himself stands for the age of science there is no one else in the world in the same position as he is top scientist top leader top nation i see it yet i fear she said the seventh fleet the most powerful naval task force on the high seas and its coming against four people in a rubber dinghy suddenly she shrank back under the perspex sprayshield she pointed landwards a light someone is coming i raised my head cautiously above the streaming shield a vast arc of heaven met a vast arc of sea somewhere over africa i could distinguish a yellow star or twonothing else her voice was low imperative whiteits a white light in the direction of the main reefthere then its not willowtrack who else but willowtrack knows were here she gripped my arm so hard that i winced a pinpoint of white light rose and dunked itself a boat i exclaimed heavens how it slews she watched for a moment there again hes coming through the reef proper i picked up the intercom and pressed the energizing button controlbridgegarland here i want commander peace bridgecontrol replied an unfamiliar voice hold it there was a pause and then peaces voice came through sharp john what are you playing at do you wart willow track theres a lighta boat i thinkcoming towards us there was an electric silence ill be right up i heard the quick clump of his boots inside the sail as he raced up the steel ladder in a moment he and mkg were beside us where away northwest i replied a shade north we peered into the blackness there was nothing but the steady drumming of the sea and a speckle of spray there exclaimed adele peace was at her side following her pointing finger the light zigzagged shone disappeared shone again and stood out steadily hes at the nose of the seahorse said peace where it faces deepest into the reef seehes steadyhes out of the millrace of the reef im trying to jell my ideas on this mko said slowly s u r e l y i t c a n t b e t y l e r h e w o u l d n t s h o w a l i g h t he s coming this way adele said peace snapped get me the remington john i dived below and decided that rather than take a naked weapon through the control centre i would carry it in its case i hurried through all eyes upon me peace flipped open the top of the box he slid back the remingtons bolt it didnt have a deep clunk like a rifle but a light clicklike a terriers bark alongside a bloodhounds peace loaded the light was coming closer quiet peace ordered the light startlingly bright by contrast with the general wateriness drifted slowly towards the dark shape of the submarine merged against the coral there was a sudden crack p e a c e c r o u c h e d f o r w a r d w i t h t h e g u n a d e l e p u t o u t h e r h a n d t o h i m i t s t h e f l a p o f a s a i l s h e w h i s p e r e d s h e looked hard into the night and murmured something in the soft creole to herself she turned and her eyes were alight its a st brandon man look thats a cutters sailsyou can tell old andres style of sailmaking anywherethat odd snip in the luff andre exclaimed peace by god john mkg this is our big break andre andre was the fisherman who brought us through the reef when we charted it i explained to mkg quiet warned peace hes coming on he still doesnt see us exclaimed adele peace reminded her that we were part of the coral there was another slap of the sail and we saw the boats stern under the white light it was the same sort of contrivance fishermen use throughout the mediterraneanbright acetylene mounted aft to attract the fish the cutter drifted closer unaware of devastation andre slipped a pair of oars into the rowlocks across the water halfobliterated by the noise of wind and spray came the sound of singing adeles eyes were as bright as the acetylene its a sort of songprayerhe sings to the devilfish of the inlet to leave him in peace because hes only catching small fish fish too small for the devilfish to enjoy she cocked an ear its snappers and varravarra and rouget hes after tonight andre unshipped his oars and started to cast his net hail him adele said peace adele cupped her hands and called in creole the old man faced away from us his back jerked at her words and he swung round his squat powerful frame silhouetted against the white light he called to us in reply adele gave a ripple of laughter what does he say i demanded he says goodevening nixie i know i am a wicked old man but it is dominoes and not women which are my downfall he thinks i am a seaspiritdominoes are the great gambling game at raphael adele was like a girl she called again bubbling with laughter he says nixie you see i am an old mani cannot make love to you like the young ones at st brandon let me go besides as you know the jouissance forbids women at st brandon and a man gets out of practice let me go back to raphael and tomorrow night i will bring you a young man he doesnt sound scared observed mkg oh no he isnt adele replied they believe in nixies and devilfish at st brandon its a question of talking smart so that the nixie will let him go hell never come near seahorse sound again though andre peered trying to locate adeles voice peace called andre andre you old sonofabitch in slow motion the old man sank down on the thwart his hands clasped as if in prayer adele shouted something but his reply was halflost he says shame on you nixie for changing yourself into my man of the sea who was my friend and a very brave man i know now that i am dead for he and i and the other were the only men ever to come into seahorse sound andre its mejohn garland the bowed head did not rise adele called again and again at length he rose she translated h e k n o w s h e is d e a d s h e s m i l e d h e h a s h e a r d t h e voices of the two men he guided to seahorse sound m k g b r o k e i n a n d r e y o u s a y k n o w s a l l t h e p a s s a g e s through the reefwe wont need the subs dinghy now peace banged his fist excitedly on the bridge shield this is our moment we gonowjust as we arewith andre the gear in the subs dinghy can be shifted into andres boat dont forget the transistor radio and the navy code mkg and i stumbled down the steep ladder into the subs interior it was a moments work to explain the situation to peters the dinghys gearsextant charts compass oilskins f o o d w a t e r h a d b e e n n e a t l y l a i d o u t i n t h e m e s s t w o ratings helped us carry it to the bridge as we went up we felt the thump of andres boat alongside peters dismissed the two helpers from the bridge andre stood in his boat gazing in wonderment at the black sail rising out of the coral toss a line ordered peace here andre like a man in a dream but not lacking in seamanship andre spun a rope and cast it high peace knotted it securely to the base of the radar antenna and swung a leg over shes all yours bob he told peters peters gripped him firmly by the hand are you sure i w i s h i t w a s m e s i r peace said quietly im afraid for you its a case of they also serve bob hang on as long as you can to give us the best chance john help adele help she smiled ive climbed ropes since i was five mkg gave a brief glance round the minute bridgea strange look of farewell good luck sir said peters his hand went instinctively t o h i s f o r e h e a d t o s a l u t e b u t h e d r e w i t b a c k w h e n h e realized he stood capless in the blowing spray mkg simply leaned out and touched him on the shoulder i think peters would have gone to the ends of the earth for h i m t h e n m k g w e n t d o w n h a n d o v e r h a n d i n t o a n d r e s boat i dropped down next to the old fisherman and peace tears streamed unashamedly down the old mans face and he hugged us adele translated he says he does not know what strange ghost of a ship it is which stands part of the coralhe has n e v e r s e e n o n e l i k e i t b e f o r e y e t h e i s g l a d f o r t o h o w many is it given to meet a nixie and live peace clapped him on the shoulder ask will he take us to raphaeltonight adele translated not to raphaelhe is willing only to take you near raphael peace hardened whats all this about the gay rippling note was back in adeles voice if he returns to raphael by morning and says i have a nixie and men who appeared out of the high spray as if from nowhere aboard my boat the other fishermen will say there is a new wreck on the reef and andre has found her for look he is drunk with bacca stronger than the red wine of mauritius it isis she laughed he calls it the wine that looks like stirredup sand in a coral pass and is as dangerouswhisky no from poulailler to puitsa eau the fishermen will watch him and follow his life will not be worth living they will find seahorse sound he will then lose his pension of fish which is unknown to anyone else no he will not take you to raphael i saw the stern clamp of peaces jaw and i said quickly will he take us beyond raphael andre made an expressive gesture which embraced the w h o l e a r c o f t h e s e a a n y w h e r e b u t n o t r a p h a e l i glanced at peace and he nodded bellatrix say our yachtthe one he admired sois at sea maybe a hundred miles north of raphael that is where we wish to go andre in reply snatched up a bright red fish from the bottomboardsone of the veielles which haunt the sheltered lagoons and coral overhangsand snapped it with a curious deft movement across his knee handing one half to peace and retaining the other its a deal translated adele andre shoved the hardy little cutter clear she was about feet long with a broad beam and flared bowthe sort of boat which claims kinship with the new bedford whalers the longboats of tristan and the flatbooms of the skeleton coast all are built to ride and fight wicked seas she was halfdecked with a peculiar lateen sailheritage of some deadandgone dhow plying from zanzibar to calicut and blown far off course to limuria the first chop of the short s e a s h i t u s a s a n d r e h o i s t e d i t i m a d e f o r t h e t i l l e r b u t mkg said this isnt going to be such a cinchi know boats we headed for the reef a n d r e g e s t u r e d t o p e a c e a n d m e t o c o n n t h e b o a t t h e driving spray seemed thicker the stern light was out and i c o u l d n o t s e e a h a n d b r e a d t h a h e a d b u t a n d r e t a c k e d t o windward turning now and again with a peculiar gesture of his left handhis thumb like the tillerhead and the palm and fingers the tiller itselfto guide mkg the vicepresi dent sat bareheaded eyes screwed up in that peculiar mannerism of his andre let the sail go with a clatter he gesturedhard sport the cutter swung wildly on a stern roller for a moment before mkg caught her andre whipped up the sail again and the boat rushed into white water the stern corkscrewed violently the tiller kicking loose momentarily from mkgs hands until he snatched at it again this was the place where the indian ocean roiled its guts on the first land for miles the seas boiled foamed thundered caromed dragged volted a mass of coral loomed i yelled in fear to andre he gave her half a reef and we snaked by a plume of foam within a hands touch we broke into the main pass in a series of rapid turns andre using the sail to keep us ahead of the thrust and rush of the sea there were kaleidoscopic closeup glimpses of yellow red pink and blue coral barnacleblack rocks and white savage water time and again peace and i crashed the heavy wooden oars against the coral to fend us off our oilskins were waterlogged my first guess that we were well inside the barrier was due not to the lessening of the spray but to a peculiar silveriness which came over the boat and reef we swept apparently out of control round a foothigh buttress of yellow coral and for the first time the lash of the spray was out of my face i turned the stars were hard defined white in the west towards raphael the sail was silverblue the wild magic of the barrier reef was upon the boat it deepened the grave abstraction of mkgs eyes it laid beauty on beauty in adeles face it blurred the cruel line of peaces mouth and overlaid andres mahogany with a patina of st brandons glory andre dropped the sail oars passed on adele there was an engine peace had found in good working order but there was no petrol peace and i clunked the oars home into homemade rowlocks after a few dozen strokes we stripped off our oilskins which began to steam from our sweat on the horizon behind mkg appeared a long thin line of pearl i cried out it was so exquisite adele crouched on a thwart looked towards me and said something softly in creole the spray was gone now and the sea at our backs grumbled on every hand lay wet coralyellow red pink blue stretching as far as our limited horizon would allow and between were seathreads of aquamarine turquoise and blue to starboard a dark illdefined green mass rose out of the searaphael we were safe mkg stretched himself stiffly eight days to go redeyed from the spray peace spoke to andre through adele the weatherthey say theres a cyclone coming the old fisherman shook his head and pointed at the red coral not yet not yet when it is near that turns dull p e a c e u n r o l l e d t h e d a m p c h a r t h e p o i n t e d t o a s p o t northnorthwest of st brandon andre my yacht is somewhere here the old man stared in blank incomprehension and rattled off a volley at adele he says he doesnt know what you are talking about or what that thing is she indicated the chart i found the compass i had brought from the subi didnt like the look of the cutters old compass any more than mkg did it hasnt been boxed since old king cole ordered the bowl he remarked adele leaned over the chart may i see the islanders have their own names for places peace pointed bellatrix will be a hundred miles northnorthwest of raphael adele stared at the map and clapped her hands there was a rapidfire of creole and andre shrugged and laughed too what does he say thank you sweet jesus that i am unable to read and write when all they mean is pursefish bank what is a pursefish asked mkg she shot the question at andre who grinned and sketched a caricature with his expressive handsa grotesque thing with mean eyes and a roman nose andandre took in the whole compass of yellow coralas garish as that tell him to strike south of raphael to start with said peace now weve got a boat i dont want the islanders to see us any more than andre himself wants to be spotted t h e r e e f l o s t i t s v i o l e n c e w e r o d e e a s i l y t h r o u g h t h e channels peace and i in the bows our course remained south of raphael till the white guano fang of siren island lifted out of the waves then we swung northnorthwest to intercept bellatrixi had drawn a straight line on the chart showing her course after i had left her to trevordaviss charge under the steady bite of the trades on our beam we snored along while mkg and i shared yachtsmens appreciation of the cutters sailing qualities despite the balminess of the morning our enjoyment was underlaid with unease had tyler broken the news of the spaceshot was the news of mkgs disappearance public m k g f i d d l e d w i t h t h e r a d i o t o g e t a v o i c e o f a m e r i c a newscast while peace waited a little impatiently for adele to see what tyler and the seventh fleet were up to the newscast blared through nothing beyond daytoday events m k g b r e a t h e d a s i g h o f r e l i e f b u t h i s a n x i e t y w a s n o t allayed for when adele switched to the navy wavelength and the quick groupings started to come in he muttered now for the kicker it wasnt long in coming peace read out the decoded signal adele passed to him willowtrack to command intelligence center carrier rio grande x top secret x opimmed x repeat my request immediate assistance search vicepresident x admiral thorntons reply was terse cic to willowtrack repeat to chief naval operations x top secret x opimmed x entire seventh fleet on its way x deployed under my personal command as hunterkiller group x proceeding all speed st brandon area x willowtrack to cic x last contact with vicepresident aboard british submarine devastation x no further con tacts x cic to willowtrack x keep station x hunterkiller group exclaimed peace mkg was withdrawn thoughtful i cant make it out he said at length the president had my signal last night why has he allowed this operation to be mounted because i told myself secretly he believes tyler he is under the impression that mkg has been kidnapped tylers dramatic news came after mkgs signal and the president himself had given the okay before learning it b u t p e a c e p o i n t e d t o t h e s u p e r s c r i p t i o n t o t h e s i g n a l these are internavy signals and i expect from my knowledge of official channels that the white house hadnt had time to step in before thornton acted on his own initiative in the light of the seriousness of willowtracks appeal after all it is less than twelve hours since you let the president know you were safe auto didnt seem convinced i too wondered whether peace wasnt trying overhard to rationalize every adverse fact in order to keep the mission going perhaps mkg felt so also because he gave peace a long appraising look before he said there would be a redhot line from naval operations to the white house on news like this the operation could have been called off within an hour this is top priority by any standards there was a long silence broken only by the crunch of the seas under the cutters planks then mkg said youre sure the president got my signal via the dni commander peace met his gaze squarely i give you my word of honour until you yourself revealed what washington meant in your secret code none of us had the slightest idea it could have been the recall for all we knew yes admitted the vicepresident that is correct but you cant have the whole of the seventh fleet racing out of base on an unexplained mission and expecting no one to ask why and once they ask why the story of the kidnapping and the spaceshot must come out peace broke in as if to steer his thought away from these graver implications there was no mention of the spaceshot no mention of semittante tyler is not going to put that on the air before hes seen thornton personally replied mkg its too big coming hard on the heels of his other news there was another pause broken only by a sputter of static from the radio commander said mkg your heart is in this mission and so is mine or else i wouldnt be sitting in an open boat in the middle of the ocean but the mere fact of the seventh fleet being brought into this may be enough for me to decide that the time has come to call off little bear the decision was to rest at all times with the president and myself this whole thing may well be construed as endangering my office and my responsibility to the presidency i cannot decide this alone i must signal the president for full assurance i must have his approval peace motioned towards the radio set we havent a transmitter only that mkg nodded i want your word that as soon as we pick up bellatrix you will send a signal peaces jaw tightened and give our position away again you may choose your own time said mkg but it must be soon after we reach bellatrix and meanwhile the vicepresident gave a wry smile ill be a very interested spectator of the commander dodging a hunterkiller force in a small boatif he can he glanced into the lightening sky as the cutter hurried through the long seas tyler has sure goosed them into action and thishis eyes were sombre now has become an aseptic area as far as the united states navy is concerned his reserve brought a restrained air to breakfast andre fried some fish on a paraffin stove under the forward decking he also produced a gunnysack of salted seabirdshe gave them a creole name but adele told us they were glossy ibis adele herself sat with a headphone over one ear listening in case either thornton or tyler should break silence we munched the salted ibis and drank hot steaming coffee peace threw the dregs of his cup overside i must know what the hunterkiller force is up to not a chirp replied adele what will they throw at us i asked the standard mk force in the us navy consists of carriers destroyers and a couple of nuclear subs explained mkg as if glad to talk the carriers operate dunking helos and search aircraft blimps toobut in this sort of weather theyre not a proposition subs are really best for tracking subs but only in cooperation with cowboys and helos adele looked up from her radio dials its like the soundtrack of a western mkg laughed for the first time that morning thats what they call themdestroyers are cowboys subs are goblins a dunking helo is a helicopter which hovers and lowers a sonar ball into the water he stretched himself with a day and a boat like this its a shame that the worlds trying to get on my back his easy charm relieved the earlier tension and brought almost a holiday excursion air to the boat peace s thoughts however were obviously on the massive buildup over the horizon theyll use a grid pattern search they must have a datum point for a grid search replied mkg seahorse sound i said despite his reservations i think mkg was infected with the thrill of the chase only after the huk force has located devastation that wont take the seventh fleet long peace said half to himself eight days from nowalmost to the hourthe little bear launch is scheduled mkg touched peace on the shoulder i wish this thing hadnt gotten snarled up commander all i need is the president to say its okay peace said i wish the eight days were past he glanced a t t h e h o r i z o n a s i f h e h a l f e x p e c t e d t o s e e h i s v i c t i m semittante i must have semittante mkg smiled the navy has a word for a ship like her an enemy surface shipwe call it a skunk our skunk will be in everybodys mind after tylers call i said thornton doesnt know her significance in relation to the vicepresidentyet replied peace tyler isnt going lo foul his own doorstep by sending off what would appear to be a fantastic message my bet is that hell wait to meet thornton to tell him i rather agree with you commander and that gives me hope still for the mission tylers a regular guy a tough guy but he knows the form some of his earlier mood returned guessings fine commander but wait until the squeal comes in when thornton and tyler meet tyler wont play this so cosy once he knows thornton believes him p e a c e g l a n c e d a g a i n a t t h e s k y n o r w i l l t h e s e v e n t h fleet a d o l l o p o f s e a m a d e p e a c e g r a b a t a s t a y t o k e e p h i s f e e t h e n o d d e d o v e r s i d e b u t w e r e g e t t i n g a b i g a l l y soon the sea chagos has issued a gale warning possible cyclone replied peace we can find bellatrix under cover of it without the seventh fleet being able to spot us chagos is eight hundred miles away i said peace turned to mkg john knows the cyclone pattern as w e l l a s i d o t h i s o n e c o u l d b e p e r f e c t c o v e r f o r u s cyclones originate round chagos and then shoot across the o c e a n i n a s o u t h w e s t e r l y d i r e c t i o n u n t i l t h e y h i t t h e s t brandon area they either blow themselves out there or race for madagascar and the mozambique channel assuming that it does just that asked mkg how long will a cyclone take to reach us threefour days answered peace id say that already the seventh fleet navy aviators are casting anxious glances eastwards the morning remained brilliantly clear but on the eastern horizon there was a curious opaqueness peace said to adele who sat hugging her knees on the thwart next to me ask andre what he thinks of it andre had been fussing with the lateenlike sail trimming it to the wind which had now changed its steady thrust to intermittent heavier gusts he says the great cyclone of when st brandon was completely submerged began on a clear day like this what was the windvelocity adele smiled he wouldnt know what you meant put like that she spoke rapidly circumlocuting the radio station on agalega reported onetwenty knots mkg gave a low whistle andre went on indicating mkg he says it is better to be out in a small boat like this in a cyclone than a big ship translated adele the waves can break a long ships back but this onenever andre took the radio and adele said andre says there are radio warning stations on st brandon and agalega agalega is operated by chepe who is a master shipbuilder and a sailor he uses his brains to see whether there is really a cyclone coming he does not merely pass on what some some she paused sonofabitch in chagos thinks the old fisherman shook the radio chepe chepe adeles eyes were on mine hes calling chepe he thinks because chepe can hear chagos there is no reason why he cannot hear andre who is much closer anyway the old man fiddled angrily with the dials but with adeles help we were rewarded by a singsong voice andre pointed in triumph and grinned chepe adele was puzzled even i do not know what chepe is saying he repeats the frigate birds are coming in from loveapple crossing and the agalega lagoon is full of noddies andre looked grave adele spoke for him big cyclone chepe is telling the fishermen in the sort of terms they understand a stylized voice came through after a flood of creole it was still chepe but he was repeating by rota agalegaagalega met calling general gale warning from the northeast chagos met station reports force five wind and sea building up there was another volley of creole andre shook his head at the eastern horizon adele translated this morning i saw a giant ray a mile south of taillevent head andre pursed his mouth it is bad very bad a ray going southwest from taillevent means he is running from the coming cyclone this could wreck the launch schedule apart from any other considerations said mkg no replied peace a cyclone generally lasts no more than fourfive days we still have eight thorntons men will never find us in a fullscale blow m k g s m i l e d w r y l y i g r a n t i t s g o o d c o v e r b u t w h a t about the restopen sea tiny boat ill pick up bellatrix either tonight or tomorrow before the full force of it hits us asserted peace and once i have bellatrix semittante is ours in short you choose a cyclone rather than the seventh f l e e t t h e r e w a s a n u n d e r t o n e o f a d m i r a t i o n i n mk g s voice any day replied peace the sea is on my side it always has been i added he looked at me for a long moment yesbut like now i am never sure adele said before we find semittante wont the seventh fleet fliers come looking for this cutter so what asked peace spread over the sea of limuria are hundreds of island cutters pirogues and fishing craft even if a navy plane comesyou cant distinguish us from the others y e s y o u c a n

seized the material of her pants and hacked round the leg reducing them to shorts and fishermen wear hats she spoke again to andre who pointed to the forward decking adele came back with four enormous latanierleaf hats which she crammed down amid laughter on our heads no fisherman wears a jersey like yours she told peace i t m u s t c o m e o f f y o u r s t o o j o h n a n d s h e w e n t o n

laugh at this adele translated he is my cousin and a man to laugh maybe you will drive the cyclone away looking like that mkg checked his watch and asked adele to switch on the radio limuria is nine hours ahead of washington although s t a t i c m a s k e d t h e v o i c e o f a m e r i c a a n d o t h e r a m e r i c a n stations there was no mention of the seventh fleets mission peace

afternoon the lateen sail was snugged down to two reefs it was blowing hard from the northeast and the seas had a nasty lop to them adele kept radio watch on the navy wavelength only once peace

point in camouflaging ourselves as fishermen in the deteriorating visibility peace began to grow anxious lest we should miss bellatrix the sun was hidden by overcast and according to my dead reckoning we were on a collision course with the yacht it would however be possible not to spot her at a couple of miles in the threatening seas after hours of silence a clatter of morse came through adele

attached to the news of the disappearance of the vicepresident tylers seamanship must have been magnificent to have rescued the first helicopters crew mkgs face was grim another two men were risking their lives for him the cutter drove on adele took the radio and wrapped herself in an old blanket under the forard decking out of the spray the cutter was making a good nine knotsbetter than peace had counted on somewhere ahead in the waste of waters was bellatrix merged with the grey gloom peace took the sail from andre and sent him into the bows to try and spot the yacht mkg and i took turns at the tiller but i decided to join andre water burst along the planking blinding me in contrast to the grey east the horizon in the west was still unnaturally bright then i saw it the sea seemed to be fashioned from a solid not fluid medium the wall of it rose up square about half a mile to windward unlike an ordinary wave its top was not spumewhite and boiling this was calm squaredoff confident of its mighty power icy fear gripped me i recognized it although i had never seen one i tried to find the three words but fear strangled my voice raz de marees only andre a foot away heard my terrordeadened cry all i knew was that i was pointing frantically at the awesome thing rushing down on the cutter raz de marees yelled andre peace turned in disbelief but mkg saw and the tiller went hard over so that the bowour only slight chance pointed at the advancing wall of sea peace cleated home the sheet and whipped a bight of it round the mast and his chest i stood staring stupidly at the living grey death bearing down until andres hard hand jerked me under the bow decking adele emerged and stared wideeyed raz de marees i croaked brace your feethangonfor gods sake anythingits almost here it seemed as if our backs rose vertically the cutters bow went up and up i heard the low moan of the giant wave before i felt the hammerblow of the water against the hull if the boats head fell off now but mkg had her holding the tiller amidships with both hands up up she yawed faltered mkgs hands worked the rough tiller she came backreluctantly with awful lethargy she was making out then peace shouted pointing away to port were the lights of a ship bellatrix the dni had chosen his man well trevordavis had put on all the yachts lights including the masthead ones before it was fully dark in anticipation of being interceptedas peace had told himbefore bellatrix reached st brandon we watched awestruck the graceful yacht canted steeply under the huge wave shuddered rose broke free peace lit the cutters acetylene light and fired a flare my admiration for the quiet trevordavis increased still more as bellatrix swung round towards usalone in the wheelhouse he was keeping an eagleseye watch all round the compass within half an hour we were drinking glenfiddich in bellatrixs sycamorepanelled lounge the cutter towing safely behind the yacht mac had come through on peaces invitat ion and met mkg he seemed much better pleased to see peace than the american leader i was reminded again of his guttergang loyalties his unquestioning devotion to the submarine ace peace took over from the exhausted trevordavisexcept for a few catnaps while steering on the sperry auto he had been almost continuously in the wheelhouse he told us the only sign of the long shifts on mac was his moroseness as he downed a halftumbler of straight scotch bellatrix drove north into the wild nightfor semittante for loveapple crossing the cutting out of little bear a hard hand was on my shoulder i was awake and sitting up my reflexes ahead of my senses for a moment i saw only a man in paintstreaked overalls it was mac skippers orders he said briefly in his harsh glasgow accent its after midnight he wants you in the wheelhouse i rubbed the sleep out of my eyes the tough scots engineer seemed as tireless as peaceor was it his devotion to him that would not allow him to let up while the submarine ace still remained on his feet the only outward sign was his moroseness and hangoverlike shadows under his eyes what the hell are you doing painting at this time of night i asked airsea searchhunterkiller groupive heard it a till i m sick so the skipper decided to camouflage bellatrix he spat uninhibitedly on the carpet paint the bluidy ship in a flippin cyclone aye so i painted her my watch said a couple of minutes after midnight a new day had been born february thseven days to go theyd spot the old white for miles mac went on so now shes greymixed with seawater he gave a grunt and went adele mkg trevordavis and i had all gone to bed immediately after a lashup dinner but peace tireless took command mkg had insisted on drawing up a message to be signalled to the president via the dni peace had objected to its lengthit was only a few sentencesand i felt the undercurrents as mkg was obliged to cut it down mkg had wanted adele to send it off right away but again peace had intervened he had reminded mkg that although he had agreed to send a message the time was his to choose silently mkg had agreed but it was clear that peace was hanging on to the mission whatever it might cost i had taken a liking to trevordavis and peace putting him in the picture about mkg had congratulated him on his insight for without bellatrix our plan would have been hamstrung how exhausted trevordavis had been was apparent over drinksonce or twice his head had fallen forward on his chest and it was only his willpower which had jerked him awake again mkg reserved because of peaces attitude went off to the luxurious guest suite in the stern which peace had allocated him i was next door and adele in the adjoining big cabin i pulled on fresh clothes from among those i had left behind whenit seemed years agodevastation had intercepted the yacht the deck vibrated under my feet as the waves jounced her peace was pushing her very hard i was thrown against the lintel as i opened my door holding a grabrail i started along the passageway adeles door was swinging with the yachts motion i reached for it jamming myself in the opening in order to secure it her cabin like mine was panelled in sycamore but the colour scheme was pale green and gold a bed was near the door over its foot the blankets had been thrust back so that only the sheet remained a pair of red silk pyjamas lay carelessly on the pile adele slept on the white pillow the sunbleach of her hair making an undefined shadow in the darkened room her eyes were closed she was completely naked the lift of the ship moved her breasts gently her knees were drawn up and her hands palm to palm were clasped between them i shut the door and went to her darkness blurring the sleeping form i bent over her the warmth of sleep and fragrance of her perfume brought the blood drumming in my ears i kissed one eyelid and then the other she stirred a little and said something in creole for a long moment i stood looking at the lovely naked body then i secured the door behind me and ran quickly forard to the wheelhouse peace was steering the yachts motion seemed wilder and all three revolving viewers were on to try and keep the screen clear the wheelhouse was dark except for the concealed compass light the gyro compass radar and radio were off peace wore his favourite black turtlenecked sweater and black dacron pants stubble emphasized the hard line of his lips he said without preliminary theyve got devastation he jerked his head at some signals clipped together thats us navy stuff take the wheel will youmind shes a bit dicey i took the spokes kicking and bucking under the crosssea from the northeast steer threefourfive degrees magnetic said peace what about the gyro ive got all unnecessary electrics off i darent risk any transmissions being picked up same goes for radar so you havent sent mkgs message then i decide when he snapped the opportune moment hasnt arrived yet i dont intend to give away bellatrixs position as i did devastations you can bet that every directionfinding aerial in the seventh fleet is working overtime youre riding him pretty hard i went on mkg can call off his mission any time remember his eyes blazed in the dark wheelhouse its my mission as much as his remember that too i shrugged and checked the log thirteen knotsnot bad in this sea if shell hold together ill drive the bitch right under he retorted how did tyler locate devastationradar sonar neither peters simply broadcast here i amloud and clear right into tylers ear who was waiting outside the reef he made the excuse that devastations radio had been damaged during myerlittle escapade in breaking through the coral peters might have given us more time no he replied bob played it rightkept his yardarm clear he gave us the maximum opportunity to get away he knew that once the helos and search aircraft were over head he didnt stand a chance by breaking silence this way he stopped anyone putting the screw on him what did peters tell tyler about mkg bobs playing dumb being very formal and proper yes he said there was aboard devastation a man who corresponded to the description of marvin k green but since hed never seen the vicepresident he could not say did peters radio all this he had to in order to communicate with tylerthey havent been in physical touch think of what st brandon reef is like with this sea and wind peters by having announced himself also puts the dni in the clear and the british part in the missionpeters maintains that he acted under orders to pick up an american vip name unknown for secret missile tests in the seychelles he knows nothing else he states then at the first opportunity when his radio has been fixed he reveals his position and comes clean no bobs been very clever how did he account for our disappearance peace laughed this is how bob put it the american vip purporting to be an expert on inertial navigation came aboard devastation in unusual circumstances this man together with a naval officer who went by the name peace disappeared with another man called garland and a woman named adele whose surname he does not know that asserts bob flatly is all he knows about the whole thing hes playing awful dumb hes even offered devastation to assist the seventh fleet is tyler still aboard willowtrack yes its impossible to get him off in this weather for all thorntons wishesthe second helo thornton sent also crashed but tyler picked up the crew one of them is badly smashed up after that even thornton decided to play it more gently but hell be up with willowtrack by morning thats a respite its not thornton wouldnt waste a whole night what do you mean hes taken devastation as his datum point fanning out from her hes launched a carrier taskforce grid search my god but how do you know all thisthe signals are i n c o d e he smiled grimly i dragged adele out of bed shes been decoding for hours i sent her back when she couldnt keep her eyes open any more he slapped the clip signals its all there thornton has split the seventh fleet into three hunterkiller groups each with one carrier three nuc lear subs and six destroyers and you ask me why i havent sent off mkgs signal thank god for that us navy codebook and thank god for adele at least i can keep track of the oppositions moves geoffrey i said slowly do you really think its worthwhile trying to play this kind of hideandseek this massive force will catch up with us as soon as its light enough to see he came across and stood by me while i have one card left i go on playing the gameto the finish you should know that john its because the odds started to mount up early that i called in your help in the first place at that moment i remembered the still face in the coffin and the host of thoughts it had aroused in me not least among them had been peaces unswerving loyaltyto the dni to the sea he was invoking that now he had always been at his best when the odds were stacked against him he was terse edgy i wonder if mac can get more out of these engines he knew the answer as well as i did its not the engines it s the hull theres a general cyclone warning the centre is moving rapidly from chagos towards us we have a week still to the launch id rather it was less give the cyclone threefour days to blow itself out no cover after that dont forget geoffrey the two big unknowns in tylers search are first where is the launch from second where is semittante the signals indicate that thornton has called his three huk forces red force blue force and green force peace went on they fan out from seahorse sound green will cover the southern quadrant mauritiusrodriguezreunion and along a line to the eastern coast of madagascar greens no worryhes way outside our area blue has been assigned everything between st brandon and chagos east of the th parallel that mean saya de malha and a lot of devasta tions first route to st brandon theres an outside chance that one of blues search aircraft might pick us up but blue force is steaming and flying right into the heart of the cyclone i gestured beyond the spinning screens no one can fly in this thorntons men do he rejoined christ imagine a carrier takeoff on a night like this theyre in the air tonight all right two aircraft have been lost already but they rescued the crews thorntons flying them off regardless god pity them i exclaimed involuntarily the best place would be a sub a subs sonar would be ineffective in these seastheyd damp out the sound of a ships engines besides a sub is not the most useful huk weapon alone but teamed with helos or aircraft its deadly bellatrix yawed heavily and i found myself sweating at the effort to bring her back on course peace went on i hadnt the heart to cut old andres cutter loose its his everything besides he turned away so that i would not see his feelings i like that bloody old boat the third huk force i prompted red he replied slowly red force is our danger theyve been assigned the biggest bloc but it includes usst brandon westwards to madagascar and north to the seychelles loveapple crossing i exclaimed semittante he nodded thornton has put tyler in command of red force operating from willowtrack tyler thinks like you do geoffrey he damn near cornered me in seahorse sound if tylers red force picks us up the game is over in some ways bellatrix is a liability he looked at me sharply and then said slowly a liability yes shes made of steel which makes her easy to pick up by radar so is semittante he remained thoughtful when do you expect to sight semittante i asked midafternoon today ill have to risk using our radar a little then its almost certain she wont hold her course in this weather he broke off suddenly im going aft to make sure the tow to the cutter is secure maybe ill doublelash it even when he returned he seemed pleased about something then he glanced at his watch adeles slept long enough something important may be going on he jerked his head at the radio i think its your privilege to call her john let her sleep i answered shes deadbeat no he rejoined the dni sent her to do a job and this is the time for her to do it at this stage of things shes worth any two of us put together i went i paused at her door wondering whether i should knock until she awoke theni pushed it open and went in she lay almost exactly as i had left her i stood in the darkness looking down on the slim person who had come in such a short time to mean so much in my life the quiet serenity above the high cheekbones was as calm as the rest of her was disturbing worth any two of us put together peaces words held a new context for me she was worth any two other women i had ever known in that certainty i pulled the blanket up to her shoulders and clicked on the bedside light she must have been sleeping on a hair trigger for she woke instantly alarm in her eyes john she glanced at her pyjamas and laughed how long have you been here i sat down on the bed next to her and put off the light for a short moment it seemedthen the telephone bell shrilled it was peace adelecome quickly thorntons on the air she threw on some clothes and together we raced up to the wheelhouse peace had the radio on adele pushed the hair out of her eyes and under a shaded light decoded the complicated groups cic seventh fleet to all ships and aircraft x return to base x stand by for further orders daylight x thorntons called off the search for tonight peace exclaimed with satisfaction it was a bonus of six hours i made a quick calculation long enough for us to cover almost a third of the way to semittant peace remained without speaking so that both adele and i looked at him in surprise mkgs message he said slowly now would be the time the air will be full of routine signals and the boys will be relaxing with the prospect of some sleep he pulled it from his pocket and read aloud request your personal and categorical affirmation that it is in order for me to continue with little bear mission in light of developmentsmkg group it up in royal navy code he told adele and then send it to the umquick as hell try and send it at a moment when thorntons fliers are making their landing approachesthe carriers will be using their df equipment on them then adele took the paper and hesitated theres no mention here of a return signal or a fixed time for it peaces reaction astonished me send it he snarled youre here to take ordersfrom me adele recoiled at his vehemence glanced at me and then sat down without speaking at the angled light she coded the message and then listened on the us navy waveband if williams had been there he would have admired adeles t r a n s m i t t i n g e v e n m o r e t h a n h e h a d d o n e b e f o r e t h e morse chattered off her deft fingers like machinegun fire she stopped looked up at peace who seemed to watch her every movement and then wrote down an incoming signal the seventh fleet has picked up a series of radar contacts round raphael the fishing fleet answered peace one very firm one among them she added in an impers o n a l v o i c e m e t a l a c o u p l e o f h u n d r e d t o n s o f f s i r e n island tyler thinks it may be important island steamer replied peace the thought struck me does tyler know about bellatrix n o r e p l i e d p e a c e h o w c o u l d h e b u t w h e n h e a n d thornton meet and the name john garland is mentioned as having sailed the yacht of the late commander peace from the seychelles theyll put two and two togetherand bellatrix will be their target how far has the search ranged so far i asked red forceand were principally concerned with red doesnt seem to have got beyond a limited number of sorties over st brandon itself answered peace in this weather it must be hell trying to identify anything impossible visually i should say adele did not join in the conversation but she yawned and tried to keep her heavy eyes from closing with an odd warmth after his earlier attitude peace said to her you go and get some more sleep adele it looks as though things will be pretty quiet now until morning seeing the search is off she smiled her thanks as she went to me her eyes said everything peace switched off her anglelight leaving the wheelhouse b l a c k e d o u t o n c e m o r e h e c a m e a n d s t o o d b y m e a t t h e wheel his face shadowed by the compasslight i was about to take him to task about adele when he said tylers force will have to waste time during daylight by first following up the radar contacts they made tonightmaybe half a day by that time well almost be up with semittante and almost out of range of carrierbased aircraft assuming that the carrier itself stays in the vicinity of st brandon the thought hit me with the force of one of the seas against bellatrixs hull geoffreysemittante what if the signal has to report her position h e w a s u n e a s y a l m o s t a s u n e a s y a s h e h a d b e e n o v e r mkgs signal adele picked up a signal about just that while you were asleepits amongst that lot there safer not to put the light on ill tell you thornton and the chief of naval operations have had an exchange over the point thornton says that to signal her will scare her away he believes that she is part of the kidnapping plot that her skipper is one of the gang who kidnapped mkg thornton doesnt know yet that shes important beyond carrying an american classified weapon of course he doesnt know about the spaceshot yet so for the moment thorntons view has prevailed and theyre not signalling semittante for the moment that is i wonder how long that moment will last aye he reflected maybe only until thornton talks personally to tyler but behind it all lay the one unanswerable questioinwhy had the president not informed the seventh fleet he knew semittantes part in the little bear mission hasnt semittante sent out any routine signals i asked nowhy should she an ad tramp like that is lazy probably listens to the weather reports every so often thats all from our area ive had cyclone warnings from the met stations all roundst brandon tromelin agalegaold chepe againand madagascar i thought adele was the radio operator i said these were en clair anyway he replied but i can manage the odd bit of morse myself you know not the highpowered american stuff of course but royal navy yes i gestured beyond the screen its getting worse it is getting worse he answered with satisfaction the worse the better so far as we are concerned theyve pulled the southafricaaustralia jets into mauritius on the strength of a pomar report peace went on if it were only a question of dodging shortrange carrierbased aircraft id rate our chances pretty high since theyll be out of the picture once the cyclone reaches full strength but you havent heard thisthe signal came through while you were asleepthe americans are flying out a squadron of big ws from greenland to the seychelles to assist in the search for mkg theyre the planes for the longrange atlantic patrols at a guess id say a vp can stay in the air the best part of twenty hours and cover thousands of miles and instrumentsthey have everything that opens and shuts i concentrated on holding bellatrix on course so that peace should not sense the tumult of my thoughts what he had just said confirmed my fearsthe president himself believed that mkg had been kidnapped why i questioned had he allowed the massive airsea search to proceed if he were satisfied in his own mind that mkg was safe why fly out the deadliest patrol bombers halfway across the world to look for someone he knew was proceeding according to a secret plan or hadi had almost rejected the thought as unworthy when i remembered peaces bulldozing attitude towards the mission that at all costs he would put snap into space and prove little bear had peace faked the messages to the president my mind went over each point in turn no they could not have been faked i argued because adele herself had decoded the presidents okay the singleletter word washington butwilliams had brought it through to the cabin could williams be part of an elaborate hoax i rejected the t h o u g h t i m y s e l f h a d s e e n a d e l e s e n d o f f t h e v i c e p r e sidents own signal we were now awaiting a reply which could come through at any time strangepeace had sent adele off to bed i deliberately broke the silence to still my doubts not even vps could operate in a cyclone the radio crackled and peacecocked an ear our call sign he exclaimed ill fetch adele i said he listened no its royal navy stuff ill manage he sat down at the table behind me and switched on the s m a l l l i g h t i n a m i n u t e o r t w o t h e m o r s e s t o p p e d i glanced back at peace over my shoulder he was sitting staring silently at the code groups in front of him for the next ten minutes my whole attention was occupied with keeping bellatrix on course it seemed as if we were running into the outer fringes of the cyclone judging by the violence of some of the gusts and the mounting sea in a calmer patch i turned to speak to peace but the words died he sat staring still at the signal which he seemed to have decoded his e x p r e s s i o n s o w i t h d r a w n a n d h a r d t h a t i k n e w w h a t h i s anger would be at disturbing him another ten minutes went by i risked another look now he was writing something on a signal pad laboriously consulting his codebooks half an hour must have passed before he spoke this should satisfy mkg he waved the signal what does it say washington x you have my personal authorization to con tinue with little bear mission as planned x his voice was without inflexion i glanced keenly at him you dont seem very thrilled about it he shrugged i dont like being strung on to the end of a radio line for every little action i wish to take this is not a little action i pointed out mkgs whole future depends on it he grunted staring at the racing seas shall i take it through and wake mkg what the hell for itll keep till morning it doesnt alter anything anything at all he went to the table and gathered up the signals better let adele check them over i said for a moment before he clicked out the light his eyes were full upon me they were not pale like the dnis but the cold deadliness was the same i told you i am quite capable of handling royal navy signals he said levelly he brushed past me and stood staring out into the wild night its semittante im worried about he mutteredand by breakfast it was all semittante as the vast drama of the vicepresident cracked open after thornton had interviewed tyler mkg shaved and dressed in some of my clothes looked grave as he stood with peace trevordavis adele and myself in the wheelhouse trevordavis rested pursed his lips at the sea which had worked up during the night into long swells on the heels of the fresh northeasterly gale the driving overcast ceiling seemed no more than a couple of hundred feet as bellatrix shouldered her way through the greyness adele brought us coffee in the dim light which passed for daybreak her eyes were on me sharing our secret of the night andre would not be refused the privilege of steering bellatrix it did not need adele to translate that he was in his seventh heaven mkg read the presidents message with satisfaction when peace first handed it to him but when thornton came on the air within half an hour he was silent thornton signalled the chief of naval operations tyler interrogated by me personally x endorse his view marvin k green kidnapped x one of the kidnappers using name geoffrey peace bracket presume fake since peace is dead unbracket french freighter semittante carry ing deck cargo purporting to be coconut oil processing plant x it is in fact united states classified experimental missile little bear x semittante cleared mauritius feb ruary present whereabouts unknown x tyler also asserts that vicepresident intends to be launched to santa fe moon station one in little bear from unspecified point sea of limuria on unspecified date but presumed within n e x t f e w d a y s x r e p e a t v i c e p r e s i d e n t i n t e n d s t o b e launched to santa fe moon station one in little bear missile x commander british submarine devastation says he unaware all this x have deployed seventh fleet into three huk groups for grid search entire sea of limuria x search impeded general cyclone warning x number radar contacts st brandon reef and neighbouring islets under investigation eyeball check x mkg said after that i feel i need a hooker of rye if it had not been for this message of the presidents to me id call it a day so far as little bear is concerned in the light of it we must go on but it sure looks as though were up the creek peaces face was bleak up the creek certainly but with two paddlessemittante and bellatrix he nodded beyond the streaming windows i have a cyclone i have a wide wide sea the sea has always been my friend up to now weve gotten along just jimdandy mkg mused but now i wonder peace said briskly perhaps the recall signal has already gone out to the seventh fleet from the president mkg shrugged then where is it peace said adele was dead on her feet last night there was no regular radio watch he looked keenly at peace then what about the presidents signal to me i took it peace replied it was royal navy code i recognized bellatrixs callsign perhaps in view of its importance adele could check i checked it myself he retorted theres no need in the middle of this adele handed peace a decoded signal cic seventh fleet to cinc british limuria command x top secret x where is yacht bellatrix x is peace alive or dead x where is garland before he had finished reading it out to us the reply had come in cinc british limuria command to cic seventh fleet x top secret x bellatrix sailed february ex mahe gar land in command x believed destination south africa via madagascar x peace is dead x you were there x peace read it out triumphantly to mkg yoh see little bear is still very much on in the dms view and that means he must also have been in touch with the president he said otherwise he wouldnt have replied in these terms the dnis certainly playing it cool was mkgs rejoinder bellatrix drove on by early afternoon there was more encouragement for us thornton commanding blue force called in his terriers in the face of impossible weather between st brandon and chagos looking at our driving overcastwe were miles from blue forcei marvelled at the intrepidity of the american fliers in staying in the air for as long as they had tyler began recalling his dogs too as the cyclone marched inexorably towards him they did not stand a chance of getting within real striking distance of bellatrix green force far away to the south reported ship contacts south and southwest of mauritius but one after another they were getting clearance what worried mkg however was that news of the massive american search was starting to become public mauritius radio usually at the fagend of world news did not realize yet that it would soon be the focal point of world attention the midday bulletin put across with amateur fervour said powerful forces of american carrierbased aircraft swept across the harbour of port louis at intervals this morning in a south and southwesterly direction vessels entering the harbour report that they have been investigated and interrogated by the aircraft the united states consul in mauritius denies all knowlege of the operation it is however presumed that these squadrons are part of the american seventh fleet which is nomally based on the seychelles and listeners may well ask themselves for what purpose is this task force so far from its base the radio cut as bellatrix leaned heavily to leeward she came back quickly and rolled her starboard side under for a moment the screen wipers churned green sea above the growl of the wavepunch came the sound of tearing splintering peace and i reached the wheelhouse door together the luxury wooden gangplank lashed to the side cartwheeled and vanished overboard the starboard boat torn from its davits bumped along the deck until it hit the rail aft poised for a moment and then disappeared too metal stanchions were left twisted and snapped in its wake and the cyclone hasnt hit us yet remarked peace he glanced at the clock two hours still before we can really start looking for semittante two hoursit seemed like two years peace trevordavis and i rigged relieving tackles on the streamlined mast and repaired the radio aerial the lack of operational messages seemed to create a silence in which all listened for semittante waiting waiting the hull seemed to develop a whiplash tendency as peace drove the yacht often bows under with andre fighting the wheel into the increasing sea he would hk not slow down clydebuilt was all he said shell take ittill she dives under the wheelhouse gratings were awash we hung on to anything we could find adele jammed herself on a tiny stool by the diminutive charttable to operate the radio shortly after oclock adele held up her hand and turned up the volume on the merchant shipping band it was the message which we had dreaded it said in plain language this is the commander of the united states seventh fleet in the st brandon area i am calling the french freighter semittanth semittanth semittanth report your position immediately please on this wavelength we crowded round the set gripping one anothers shoulders like a rugby scrum to keep steady in the heavy pitching any ship or aircraft knowing the whereabouts of the french freighter semittante must report immediately we could pass semittanth at a couple of miles and not see her in this weather said peace grimfaced he turned to adele tell andretheres an old ship hereabouts we must find hersoon she spoke rapidly in creole and translated his reply shell be that way she pointed to leeward i said ive been making a rough offset allowance taking wind force and run of the sea into consideration but my calculations are purely hit and miss peace switched on the yachts radar the cathode screen glowed he worked slowly round the compass nothing whats the radars range asked mkg ten maybe twelve could be anything in this sea the way were lifting the radio blared semittante calling the french freighter semittante report your position immediately the rain drilled against the wheelhouse peace said irritably john make a sweep round will youround and bloody round the green light circled the screen remained blank i looked up as the wheelhouse grew momentarily brighter the rain eased there was a break in the driving wrack andre called and pointed excitedly adele wideeyed crouched at the radio repeated a ship a shipto port to leeward peace was at the old fishermans side in a flash i fixed the radar on the quadrant he had indicated it was empty the greyness stretched away into a gauzemurk horizon of a mile or less andre gestured at the controls he says youre going too fastyoure passing her supplied adele peace yanked back the engineroom telegraph mkgs eyes went from the radar screen to the old fisherman if i were a horseplayer my money would be on the radar andre spoke quickly to adele theres a ship out there he feels ithe caught a glimpse of her in that clear patch tell him the radar shows nothing said peace she translated and grinned he says that thing has no soul fishermen and ships share the sea between them there for a moment something that wasnt the grey heave of the sea showed broad on the beam a line of deeper grey and breaking water by god i exclaimed i saw her andre gave the helm a spoke or two bellatrix highkicked it was only a whitecapyou can kid yourself so easily said peace he fiddled with the radar wait though something herenot at all firm andre and i shouted together westwards in a stray patch of sunlight was a ship rolling and pitching in the heavy swell whiteness under her single screw put that thing off i called to peace weve got her no need to endanger our position adeles radio said semittante calling french freighter semittante report your position on this wavelength if she does so now its the giveaway for both semittante and bellatrix commented mkg one fix and thornton will dispatch half a dozen subs weather doesnt worry them five hundred feet down no response from her yet peace demanded anxiously of adele not yet john he said harshly go and get me the remington take the special for mac find yourself an axe he turned on trevordavis you conn the yachtandres a magnificent helsman but youll have to say it with signs he quickly outlined the handsigns which had brought us through the reef he turned back to me ill take the bridge mac the engineroom yours is target no john smash the radio before she can get off a message as he spoke the colour drained from adeles face john she began i stopped her its got to be done peace said boz blair and his team canbe a big help if we can get it over to them what this is all about ill call em up on the loudhailer mkg suggested tell them its metheres time before we go aboard peace stopped him youre staying right here mkg i m fitfitter than any of you he protested peace said it isnt funny jumping in a sea like this at the end of a rope from one ship to another we cant afford to let you smash a rib or a leg trevordavis offered ill lay alongside in the lee the going will be easier for you there peace nodded what what will you do to the crew adele asked in an anguished voice peace laughed were not piratesyet odds are that theyll be so surprised they wont offer any resistance particularly if we can get word to boz blair theres boz and four others mkg reminded us adele said ill try and jam anything semittante tries to send peace looked at her appreciatively good girl if youre as successful as you were with willowtrack we should be okay john get the guns will you in peaces cabin i took the sinister remington from its case it sat easily on my hand and the big stock which looked cumbersome was in fact beautifully balanced i shoved a box of shells into my pocket and grabbed the colt i had taken from the unknown intruder macs engineroom was cleaner even than a nuclear subs which itself looks like an operating theatre the crash of seas seemed louder below mac eyed my pistols thinking of murder i explained quickly and a sinister grin spread over macs face he took the colt and spat into the muzzle aye he said its like i said when we thought he was lying deid in tcoffinwed be a power poorer without our bluidy bastard skipper he grinned again and slipped a monkeywrench into the back of his overalls together we went back to the wheelhouse we found peace bending over the compass housing he had unscrewed the glass with his flickknife what on earth his face was flushed with excitement at the prospect of the coming action listenin this weather we cant very well turn the french crew adrift in their boats unless we really want to murder them well give them bellatrix i couldnt believe my ears but theyll simply radio thorntonshadow us in semittante just that he grinned once weve cleaned up the crew well come back aboard here and smash up bellatrixs radio radar and the gyros well have to come back anyway for my diving suit radio codebook the french will have to rely on the magnetic compassthis one well set our course into the heart of the storm skipper du plessis righteously mad will follow uswhile he can see as soon as its dark hell shadow our daylight course by compass what he wont know is that theres a knifeblade in here which will throw him ten degrees out sooner or later either red force or blue force will pick him uphell run right into their arms trevordavis shook his head sadly to regard a lovely craft like this as expendable you gave me the idea john said peace you said bellatrix was a liability now with the frenchman shes become an asset to usthe perfect decoy andre said something and we followed his pointing hand he says semittante is turning away anything on the radio adele nothing from her plenty of report your position from thornton perhaps shes spotted us suggested mkg she doesnt know about bellatrix rejoined peace id say she was merely easing off the wind the oldfashioned stern of the tramp which must have been built about the time red raborn confounded the critics with the first polaris rose and fell in the trough look i exclaimed little bear mkg gasped there it was lashed on the deck askew from the starboard railing towards the stern on the other side a long wooden crate about eight feet square and sixty long looking like a number of automobile shipment crates fixed together ill call her first on the loudhailer said peace if shell let the pirates aboard peaceably so much the better andre under trevordaviss guidance closed in a heavy sea broke over the tramps rusty bows and creamed over winches and hatches an oilskinned figure appeared on the bridge wing semittante report your position the voice was obliterated by a clatter of morse adele whispered united states seventh fleet this is semittante jam him for christs sake snarled peace he grabbed andre by the shoulder alongside quick andre understood he read the meaning of the guns in our hands he spun the wheel and opened the throttle bellatrix was back on the auto gear mkg switched on the loudhailer he deliberately made his vowels longer boz he called imperatively bozits marvin green heremkg do you hear a couple of limeys are coming aboard with handgunshelp em willya all i saw was the rusty redleaded side of the plunging old tramp looming like a skyscraper andre shaved round the stern and banging screw into the quieter water in her lee trevordavis looked enquiringly at us waiting for the right moment peace jacked a shell into the remington snapped home the bolt come on mac and i raced with him to the twisted starboard decking semittante lurched towards us the redpainted patches grinning like bloodied lips as the high side sought to crush the slender yacht then the sea spurted and the hulls drew apart like an outwardfacing v peace shouted an oath at trevordavis and andre but his voice was lost in the cavern of boiling seas down went bellatrix until we looked into the foul bilge vents of the old tramp and then skyrocketed on the next wave peace swung a jacobs ladder of thin nylon rope in his hand a shot crashed out a man with a gun in yellow oilskins stood at the head of the bridge ladder the strike of the bullet was lost in the noise even under the whip of excitement i admired trevordaviss handling of the yacht she rose past a scumshrouded porthole to deck level and he held her there jump yelled peace we leaped as one man peace landed agilely on the ships rail and dropped to her deck but the wet wood slipped from under my feet and i crashed down bellatrix fell away like a lift i saw the deathengulfing water i toppled overside and snatched with the axehead at the rail it bit in a flash peace hauled me clear gasping on to the deck i didnt hear the second report but only saw the splinter of the bullet a foot from my head i looked upwards and saw the ugly muzzle pointing straight at me the man on the bridge steadied for the shot i cringed away peace started at a crouching run for him but i knew he would never make it then a figure raised an arm over the mans head and struck him down with a length of piping he sagged and fell ten feet to the deck below peace almost ran down my rescuer thanksboz it is boz sure sure exclaimed the stocky scientist i heard mkgs voicewas him wasnt it yes replied peace no time now to explainthe bridge come on boz they tore up the ladder and i paused only for a second to trace the course of the radio aerial from the masthead down to a peeling deckhouse at the door a heavy sea threw me fulllength semittante calling chattered the morse i prayed for adeles jamming skill i kicked up the door the operator an acned youth in a sweaty towel shirt gave a terrified glance as it burst open i cannoned into him as he jumped to his feet i smashed the axe down once twice across the morse key and the aerial wire there was a small puff of blue smoke and a smell of burning rubber the youth gave a high scream i lifted the axe shut up the inhuman sound ended in a gurgle i jerked my head out get out he edged past me terror in his eyes i found the key and locked the shack i gestured forard and saw him down the main deck companionway i swung the axe as a heavy figure sprinted along the deck at me hold it buddy the texan voice was unmistakable look after him thanks i made for the bridge the quartermaster lay on the gratings with a weal across his forehead peace was trying to quiet the kicking wheel boz blair had exchanged the length of piping for the remington and was standing at a halfcrouch trying to cover two men in a corner peace said before he saw me just mash the tit if they move buz dont let em come at us then he saw me and grinned okay okayhe was still transmitting though i wonder if he got past adeles jamming these bums look like wanting to jam us all any moment said boz here youre better with this than me i swapped my axe for his remington peace said good work john now give your french an airing that bastard he indicated the unconscious man came at me with a fireextinguisher the engineroom boz asked quickly we told him he whistled one manill round up a couple of my boys d help mac he darted off peace picked up the engine room voicepipe his eyes clouded when there was no reply which of you is captain du plessis i asked the flow of invective from the smaller of the two was impressive peace and i let him finish before grinning at each other thats him tell him were taking his ship ill give him and his crew five minutes theyre going aboard bellatrix i hope macs all right pirate murderer thief abductor screamed the little manhe knows all the words i said the skipper came forward shaking his fist the other officer looked ready to jump me i raised the remington he stopped he says piracy on the high seas is a hanging offence he will see you hanged if it takes him all his life tell him an exchange of vessels isnt piracy in fact he should be pleased hes getting a luxury yacht in exchange for a clappingout lump of floating ironmongery i couldnt give full value to the french but none the less the little skipper turned purple peace went on tell him to line the crew up on deck anyone who stays behind is liable to get hurt the voicepipe gave a whistle peace picked it up and there was a rattle of unmistakable glasgow gutter oaths he gave me the thumbsup sign pirate thief the big texan whom i had met came clattering up the bridge ladder with what looked like a stokers iron in his hand aw put a sock in it he told the frenchman come on join the other suckers bewildered men in a disreputable array of dirty garments began to emerge on deck guarded by three americans two of them with guns the crew looked more resentful about being lined up in the rain than about losing their ship the texan shoved the french skipper and the other officer down the ladder i gave him the remington he stopped for a moment at the head of the steps mkg okay the airs been full okay replied peace little bears still on fine the long vowel made it sound the most wonderful adventure in the world he stomped down the ladder peace took an electric loudhailer megaphone bellatrix mkgs voice came back metallic anxious are you okay we heard shots okay replied peace ships ours im heaving her to ill stream oil to give you a smooth patch trevordavis tell andre i want his cutter hoisted aboard semittante well cut one of the lifeboats adrift and haul his boat up in the davits in its place the americans guarding the crew all grinned as passed i hacked at a lifeboats falls with my axe until it fell with a splash bellatrix held off until at peaces orders mac had blown hundreds of gallons of oil overboard from the old tramps tanks and made a tolerably smooth patch under the stern then with a display of fine seamanship andre laid her alongside i dropped on to bellatrixs deck at the end of a rope weve got to move fastthat message of semittantes i told mkg and adele i dont know how successful my jamming was she replied i switched off the current in the wheelhouse and raised my axe trevordaviss eyes held a mute appeal but he said nothing as the blade splintered the radar screen another blow was enough for the radio for the gyros i reversed the blade and the sensitive instruments were soon a tangle of metal i unlocked the automatic pilot and smashed its controls we gathered up peaces diving suit the codebook and portable radio boz blair came to the rail and looked down into mkgs face then the vicepresident swung up the rope to be grabbed by eager welcoming hands from the american team through adele i explained to andre about the cutter he looked up at peace on semittantes bridge and said gently he truly understands how a man can love his boat was it simply that i knew the answer after we had hoisted the cutter inboard and bozs men had hustled the spitting skipper and his motley crew aboard bellatrix which now lay wallowing half a mile astern of us well use the cutter peace told the group of us gathered on the tramps bridge i am going to scuttle semittante at loveapple crossing the home of twenty five lashes scuttle burst out mkg scuttle our only chancelittle bear there was a murmur from boz blairs team and the genial face of the stocky scientist became grave mkg had given them an outline of the hunt like devastations crew they took it in a holiday spirit the tall texans name i learned was pete allingham and the other three missile expertslooking curiously disreputable in a variety of sailors rigswere john palmer nat reece and lofty reilly trevordavis our expert seemed completely at home in his silent way with his american opposite numbers every moment now is important replied peace obliquely he picked up the engineroom voicepipe macgive her everything shes got his eyes fell on adele who stood next to me i had better not repeat what mac thinks of the engineroom from the sound of it he at least will be pleased to see this crate scuttled said boz blair the screw began to thump peace brought her head round towards the storm and then handed over the wheel to andre we waited bellatrix was a liability now shes an asset peace explained looking round the silent launch team you must see it like this semittante is a bigger liability still we simply have to get rid of her were being squeezed between weather position and the launch deadline mkg explained but to scuttle little bear after all weve been through to get here and god knows there have been times in the past couple of days when i have doubted if my decision little bear goes down with semittante peace cut in boz blair gave a gasp and stepped forward but peace went on quickly before he could protest in a few hours time it will be six days to the launch not so boz merely nodded the suggestion that his missile should be sent to the bottom of the sea had left him speechless mkg started to speak but peace silenced him with a gesture im not sanguine enough to think i can evade tyler for six days you know and i know that tyler and red force will track down anything that floats they may already have a fix on semittantes position adeles not sure once the vps are in the air allingham whistled they got vps out on our tail too peace nodded with them around i dont rate our chances very high he explained that they would use the new mad gearan abbreviation for magnetic anomaly detection it was an electronic marvel used by the vps it picked up variations in the earths magnetic field and showed up objects like wrecks or other undersea metal objects they had he stressed to be metal bozs team warmed towards peace he was talking the sort of technical language they appreciated even semittante sunk at loveapple crossing wont be safe from the vps he added then whats in your mind commander asked boz this sure is some wind too cyclone corrected peace its our big hope it could last between four and five days but its good only to stop tylers search aircraftit wont worry the nuclear subs well take a leaf out of their book by sinking semittante tyler in willowtrack could pass by loveapple crossing with the heat full on andinside the coral barrierhe couldnt detect semittante sunk hes looking for a ship afloatso are the vps fine and dandy if all youre about is escaping tyler remarked the tall texan dryly but not us what about little bear well lash little bear securely to semittantes deck thatll be your job boz the water in loveapple crossing lagoon isnt deepfifty maybe even forty feet little bears operational depth is six hundred feet so it wont harm her the day before the launch ill go down in my skindiving suit and cut the missile free its buoyant itll float up then its over to boz and you fellows to see shes all set for the launch then well tow her out to the launchpoint i heard bozs indrawn breath of admiration but mkgs eyes were on peace youre not snowing me commander he screwed up his eyes in his characteristic way its the only way left the vicepresidents face was expressionless then he said the dni said you were quite a guy commander i believe it me too grinned boz why its a cinchwe can get out the datico gear and spacesuit beforehand whats datico i asked digital automatic tape indicated checkout enthused boz its like a small taperecorder for the final moments of the countdown when mkg mashes the firingbutton for little bear six hundred feet down datico goes into action one minute later little bear emergesshe dont even wet her ass as we say in the navy the other scientists started to grin at bozs enthusiasm all the instrumentation is packed with little bear he went on did it myself know where every damn thing is exactly from the vlf set to the spacesuit i was already lost among bozs technicalities but he rushed to fill the gaps in my missile ignorance very low frequency radio he explained grinning wethe navyfound years ago that you can send very low frequency signalsbetween five and fifteen kilocyclesalmost anywhere in the world over an ocean surface so we built the biggest vu station in the world at cutler maine aw boz dont give the guy a lecture said the texan goodnaturedly all he wants to know is will the goddam thing work boz cut short his technicalities sure sure ill operate the vlf transmitter to mkgs marker buoylittle bears markerand at t minus sixty a red light comes on on his instrument panel but a crated little bear is not exactly a little bear ready to blast off i ventured boz interrupted the top which is in fact the capsule is covered by a plastic membrane which will withstand water pressure up to seven hundred feet but it ruptures at the thrust of compressed air from the firingflaskjust like the ordinary polaris the inertial navigationsinsholds the missile continuously vectored on a point in space in this instance the santa fe staging station which reminds me i must check the calibration of the spacedocking computer aw gee boz quit it willya exclaimed the texan the guys drunk with words cant you see how in hell youre going to live without this damn missile once shes on her way i dunno mkg said commander its easy to say tow little bear to the launchpoint but what with the cutter replied peace thats why i wanted her safe i ve had a look at the auxiliary engine it works although andre wont use it if he can help it you cant tow a twentyton missile out to sea with a cutters engine i objected you can said peace ask boz here little bear is the finest hydrodynamic and aerodynamic machine man has yet evolvedeh boz sure replied boz you have some damn original ideas about missiles commander peace grinned back at him little bear is designed to travelthrough water air and space she offers the minimum resistance to water only a few horsepower is enough to pull that pencilslim shape through the sea in fact i think the cutter could do it with all of you at the oars but ill spare you that blastoff point is not more than a couple of miles offshore he looked enquiringly round the team trevordavis said i would have liked a couple of days not just one to check her over we preset the inertial navigation back homeshes continuously vectored on santa fe replied boz the accelerometers thoughits been a long voyage began trevordavis we set em alsothe gyros and the accelerometers of the stable table said boz im anxious about the correct tossoff point trevordavis seemed to find his voice in talking about the abstruse technicalities of the missile new jetavators with a simple thrustreversal systemblowout points explode along the leading edge of the second stage and then thrust backwards but the capsule flies on trevordavis let out a sigh of relief that takes a load off my mind i wasnt too happy about the old ones peace said its my turn to break up this fascinating conversation boys weve got a lot of work to do john go and fix the radio aerial you choppedi must know if tyler heard semittantes call and adele ask andre before you go if hed like the job of being permanent helmsman of semit she translated and he nodded pleased adele kept close to me she was pale and quiet i put it down to the strain of the cuttingout operation tell him to steer zerosevenzero degrees ordered peace zerosevenzero i exclaimed youre steering right into the arms of thorntons blue force mkg boz and the team looked startled peaces answer was again evasive see if bellatrix is following us i stepped out on to the bridge wing the wind ripped at my clothing a mile or so behind bellatrix was in our wake i went back thoughtful bellatrix can sail rings round this old basket i told the waiting group she has only to stay where she is precisely replied peace at this moment her doctored compass reads zeroeightzeroten degrees out when blue or red force catches up with her shell report that when last seen semittante was steering that courseclean away from loveapple crossing tonight when its dark well give the yacht the slip the admiration in mkgs face was overlaid with doubt but tyler commander tyler is smart bloody smart im doing with semittante what would be a classic manoeuvre for a sub im breaking away upwind into a heavy sea which will mask the sound of my engines once tyler or thornton pick up bellatrix which is only a matter of time on the course shes steering theyll bring every red and blue sub destroyer and search plane into that area which is on the edge of the saya de malha i want tyler to think ive run for the shoals and banks to use the shallow seas and breaking water to damp the sound of this old tramps engines i want them to concentrate the search there but in fact ill be hundreds of miles away in the opposite direction at loveapple crossing arent you playing this game a little too cosy commander asked mkg sure sure guessings fine tyler will do this tyler will do that but what if he doesnt what if tyler outthinks you smells the doublecross we sit at loveapple crossing waiting what a bunch of fishermen with an island girleveryday islanders all of us well have lines over the side of the cutter and big hats on our heads adele or andre will answer any questions in incomprehensible creole under our keel will be little bear also waiting mkg assumed a remote faraway look which was to become more and more frequent in the coming days he clapped peace gently on the shoulder adele said with a peculiar inflexion john shall we get the radio going we left the group and went to the radio shack as we entered i started towards the cut aerial but adele closed the door sharply i turned to face her she was standing with her back to the door her face dealthy white she started to pull a scrap of paper from her blouse but her hands trembled so violently that she could not manage it it was a fake she choked i suspected him before but heres proof a deadly fear spread over me peace she nodded and handed me the scrap of paper it was simply a jumble of letters i shook my head at it he forgot this among the others he faked you see the signals pad is carbonbackedone copy for filing the other for the captain this is the copy she took the slip and read out the code president of the united states to marvin k green via seychelles x unless you reply personally to this via same channel within six hours i shall assume the kid napping report of willowtrack to be correct and that you are no longer a free agent x whatever the circumstances the little bear project is to be called off now x there was a long silence i said the version peace passed on to mkg read something like this you have my personal authorization to continue with the little bear mission as planned adele sat down in the operators chair taking a grip on herself she nodded at the severed wire fix that first anything may be happening it was only a matter of minutes to fix the wire adele checked the set my thoughts were in turmoil do we tell mkg she asked her eyes on me perhaps she wondered whether my own loyalty to peace would prevail the implications are too colossal to contemplate i said no wonder thornton and tyler were throwing everything into the search far from the president recalling the seventh fleet he must be urging them on she said fiddling with the dials she held up her hand wait it was mauritius radio an announcement of major importance the president of the united states announces that an incident has taken place which is without parallel in american history the vicepresident markin k green has been kidnapped by foreign agents the white house states that although the circumstances of the abduction are not clear it appears that the vicepresident was on his way to superintend the testfiring of a secret new american missile in the indian ocean when the kidnapping took place the vicepresident was seized aboard the nuclear submarine willowtrack and conveyed aboard another submarine which was then shadowed to a remote atoll barrier reef named st brandon although this submarine has since been located the vicepresident has disappeared in view of grave fears being ex pressed for the safety of marvin k green the united states seventh fleet in limuria waters has been deployed under command of admiral thornton and is now searching the area the search is however being impeded by a cyclone the white house announcement adds that the situation is aggravated by the fact that the secret missile which was to have been testfired by the vicepresident has also disappeared it was being transported in a french freighter named semittante captain revs tyler the famous american submarine ace who was decorated for his epochmaking dash under the icecap of antarctica is in command of willow track and is leading the search peace must know he cant get away with it exclaimed adele how could he have faked that signal from the president because said a menacing voice from the doorway nothing can justify little bear except mkg we spun round it was peace he stood swinging with the motion of the ship spray on his turtlenecked sweater and black trousers he held the remington lightly by the triggerguard and in his other hand was the hocked colt the lightness of his movements lent him the air of a predator about to spring i jerked my head at the loudspeaker you heard that aye he said i heard he watched us both for a moment and then closed the door behind him still with that air of coiled power about to strike he spoke to adele jenkins geoffrey hunter killer how did you find outdid i muff the code its of no consequence how we know i retorted angrily it is he replied i want to know how many people i have to deal with the signals pad had a carbon backing said adele you overlooked it i wondered whether i could jump peace adele sensed it john dont so its only you two then said peace he put the weapons on the table but he stayed close geoffrey i said your devotion to little bear has gone beyond the point of sanity sanity does not enter into this he answered every mile an hour the gale puts on every foot the sea rises puts the odds more on my side areyougoingtotellhim i walked deliberately past the pistols and confronted him weve sailed before on tough missions geoffrey but we won through because right was on our side who are you to set yourselves up as a judge of my actions he blazed back right what is right in this instance is it wrong to have ones heart in a weapon whose lethal efficacy is obscured by petty rivalries between services and a bunch of politicians who dont know polaris from a pumphandle this thing is bigbigger than we dream of it is power power unlimited in the hands of the nation who owns it now its to be sold down the river because some bloody fool thinks weve kidnapped the vicepresident thats not the way of it and you know it i snapped back mkg risked himself and his standing in the first place by consenting to the testfire that is the measure of his faith in little bear but then it was secret and he was safeguarded now the whole world knows his position is endangered the president has called it off you cant go on with it the seventh fleet plus the whole world versus us he said i looked at him and marvelled inwardly he wanted the odds as high as that are you going to tell him he repeated if we dont someone else will i said theres boz blair pete allingham no this is the only radio aboard semittante ive told mac to keep the transistor under guard we did not reply and he went on by tomorrow we should be at loveapple crossing i shall sink semittante the spaceshot will still go on mkg is undertaking it voluntarily said adele you force him to take a spaceride if he doesnt know he will go through with it he replied he swung on us his voice harsh think if you break the news to him you will sacrifice the wests nuclear weapon lead for the next decade at least can you reconcile that with your consciences the consequences of your discreet silence are immeasurable in the field of future peace has either of you the right without express permission from the dni to back down on the mission have you youll be launching mkg under false pretences i said put that way yes but it does not invalidate the weapon or the need to show the world how mighty a thing little bear is i looked deep into adeles eyes and saw the conflict raging in them too give me just one day until i can scuttle this bag of bones peace went on vigorously leave it to me after that all i ask is your silence and if not peace picked up the telephone dialled the engineroom maccome to the radioroom drop whatever you are doing the sea beat like drumfire against the old hull it seemed like hours until mac came peace picked up the remington handed it to mac he took the colt himself adele was pale mac he said the president has blown the gaff on the little bear mission mkg doesnt know john and adele heard the broadcast the others dont know either if mkg has an inkling the mission is off i faked a signal so that he would carry on now he waved at us its in danger mac eyed us with his bloodshot eyes im an old shipmate of number one sir and i wouldnt like to hurt him there are plenty of spare places in the engineroom where i could look after him the girls easy it means as much as that to you geoffrey he didnt look me in the face but nodded id rather you came along john but nothing will stop medo you hear nothing and if tyler and thornton catch up with you ill see you right he replied ill take the whole rap ill say what you did you did under duress try and see it as a hunt without the other implications which arent your concern anywaytheyre mkgs he turned to adele i need you too the end will justify the means what if mkg comes and listens to the radio here she asked soon every radio station in the world will carry the story the seas will be breaking right across the deck shortly said peace ill put the radio shack out of bounds to everyone except john on the grounds of limbs or ribs being broken ill tell em we cant afford injuries to the launch team or to mkg i made up my mind you deserve to luck out geoffrey i said im not with you in the way i was before but for old times sake im not against you i cant speak for adele she hesitated and then said its too big a decision for me to take alone i would like to signal the dni thats out of the question answered peace you are still under his orders remember as far as i am concerned they stand he didnt offer you any loopholes if this happened then that he ordered you go ahead like john i am not for or against she said unhappily you have my word for my silence too peace nodded to mac who left morose as ever throwing down the pistol peace opened his mouth as if to say something as he left but changed his mind and said formally thank you both this is the only way left id rather it had been otherwise when he had gone adele concentrated on the radio and i rigged a lifeline from the radio shack along the upper deck the barometer was alarmingly low and squalls burst at intervals from the northeast although it was barely five oclock the sky was dark and grey scud streamed across the heavens i didnt care for the way the old ship was behaving either she was putting her bows under and the seas were sweeping right back to the winches on the foredeck it was the beginning of a wild night somewhere in the northeast was the centre of the cyclonea wildlashed convulsion of sea which had sent better ships than semittante to the bottom as i put the last knots into the lifeline i saw boz blair and his men struggling to secure the long crate containing little bear i went aft and helped them doublelash the crate to the deck with a twoinch manila we then ran a heavy wire through one of the deck winches and drew it tight for additional security shouting above the howl of the wind i reminded boz to cut it free when we scuttled the ship astern throwing her bows high in the air and much closer now was bellatrix boz indicated the end of the case lend me your axe he shouted gotta get the loose gear out and stow it in the cutter i handed him the axe and he chopped open the crate under heavy plastic waterproofing we found three small cases one marked spacesuit the second datico and the third vu radio in clear stencilling boz yanked one towards him freeing the lashing of tarred paper and plastic beyond and a thrill of awe passed through me as boz gestured little bears nosecone reflected the dull light the interior of the crate smelt like a new cartarry plastic sterile boz and i crawled in farther behind the thick plastic protective membrane of the casing was the capsule its rubbercushioned seat and safety straps facing us from behind the perspex there was an array of instruments and fixed in the transparent canopy on a stay was some sort of gyro or altimeter a thick rubber cable heavily waterproofed was sealed into the side of the casing attached to one end was a metal ball which looked like a dunking helos sonar buoy that was all we would see on the surface once mkg was submerged in the missile a telescopic radio antenna was attached to the hull the sight of the sleek metal cylinder seemed to mitigate somehow the burden of the secret inside me hearing a sound i spun round my nerves sandpapered by the sight of the sinister weapon and the crisis it had caused it was the texan the dame wants you in the radio shack he said seems its off limits to all of us nowand i must admit its goddam rough going up there he explained peaces ban to boz commander doesnt want any broken limbs amongst us like boz though his interest seemed entirely focused on little bear at the radio shack adele said geoffrey wants you to black out this place he doesnt want a light showing anywhere tonight she smiled gravely at me every radio station in the world is interrupting its programmes with monotonous regularity to give the latest on the mkg crisis i thought the voice of america announcer would have kittens the first time he came on the air with the news i stayed and listened with her stunned reaction incredulity disbeliefthe ether could not hold them all space experts discounted the attempt but the national space administration seemed to give credence to it by saying the earth would be in the most favourable position for a spaceshot a week hence experts within the bounds of security and supposition tried to assess little bears chances of reaching santa fe the president remained silent the one thing the listening world did not seem to take into account however was the cyclone armchair strategists and geographical experts all had their say about how easy it would be to locate any ship anywhere any time in the sea of limuria tyler and thornton were ominously silent i thought of those deepdiving subs feet down closing relentlessly towards us patiently searching searching i had finished the improvized blackout when adele raised her hand here it camethe close morse grouping the expert rapid sending of the seventh fleet adeles hand danced over the paper blue force to red force x semittante transmission too short for reliable fix x on basis of fixes from blue and red forces evaluate her position as northwest st brandon and west of saya de mal ha x subs on their way x weather deteriorating x how is it with you tyler was brief damage and casualties all surface ships x cowboys hove to x search birds roosting x willowtrack making all available speed with two other subs to general area in dicated by semittante fix x i took it to peace on the bridge theyll be here by morning he said mkg stood silent by the wheel his thoughts beyond the streaming windows across thestormswept sea semittante plunged into the night two hours later after mac had reported that semittante was taking in water through cracked bow plates peace altered course in complete darkness towards loveapple crossing as she swung round to take the sea astern semittante gave us a breathstopping moment a heavy sea broke aboard carrying away the starboard boats and tearing the forard hatchway from its roaming tons of water poured in semittante lay over like a heeled cur i thought she would never come up macs voice in the voicepipe was fluent with profanity he wasnt sure if the pumps could cope he said bozs men and i tried to lash a tarpaulin over the shattered coamings but it was torn from our hands and whirled away into the night bruised with fingernails bleeding we fought our way back to the bridge chagos mauritius st brandon tromelin and chepe on agalega broadcast continuous cyclone warnings it seemed that the eye of the storm still lay well to the east adele at my insistence tried to snatch some sleep on a rough couch i arranged in the radio shack peace mkg andre and i kept the old ship alive while the launch team dozed fitfully in the chartroom with the run of the sea and the wind astern she made for her last restingplace when it was light enough to see at about eight oclock the next morning boz brought us all hot cocoa and bullybeef sandwiches we ate the rough fare hungrily there was no sun only a transparency in the grey but the sea seemed somewhat easier there was no sign of bellatrix i took adeles breakfast to her and she reported silence from the searchers but the news bulletins were anything but silent moscow offered soviet planes and tracking stations n the interests of world peace the bbc said that if the kidnappers were british they were unscrupulous adventurers who had assumed the name of one of britains most illustrious naval officers who was buried recently with full honours ain the sea of limuria when peace joined us he saw in this an official disavowal of himself but shrugged his shoulders and said it had happened to him before behindthescenes pressure must have been intense for this disavowal was reinforced by an offer of the british missiletracking cruisers loch vennachar and loch rannoch but it was addedand peace saw in this the dnis hand as a means of keeping the mission alivethese ships were at present stormbound in the seychelles speculation ran riot about the massive operation which the seventh fleet had mounted thorntons silence was attributed to security not to the cyclone i felt uneasy in mkgs presence when we returned to the bridge and i was glad when peace called me to the chartroom what do you make of it john i studied our line of deadreckoning pencillings on the chart which we had made during the night we could be thirty miles any way if you are remotely right we should sight loveapple crossing about four or five hours from now sight i laughed ironically loveapple crossing is maybe half a mile long and a quarter broad its ten feet above sea level with the exception of the northern end near vingtcinq coups on a calm day you wouldnt sight it at ten miles today not at ten cables true he reflected nothing but a sandbank with some piddling little palms but if we miss loveapple crossing today we could beat about for days looking for it we have six days left to blastoff providing this old crate holds together and shes leaking like a sieve he said macs worried and if macs worried the situation is critical he turned back to the chart so you think this is a lot of bull john frankly yes you really havent a clue where we are i said so what is the alternative andre he has some peculiar builtin seasense which tells him things which even tylers radio sextants and inertial navigation wonders dont the triumph of spirit over science peace said quietly could be ask him anyway we stumbled on to the bridge as semittante staggered over another wave i fetched adele from the radio shack the news bulletins were ceaseless on the vicepresidential crisis it seemed unreal that the man at the centre of the storm should be standing unaware of the quickfire of news within yards of it peace i noted had been careful always to be with me when i spoke to mkg when adele who was constrained with peace passed on our message to andre the old fisherman grey with fatigue from his long trick shared with mkg at the wheel gestured for me to take the spokes he went to the starboard bridge window he says loveapple crossing is out there he thought you were bound for agalega previously could he find it for the first time i saw andre rattled of course he knows exactly where the ship is this is yellow tunny sea the japs fish them off the saya de malha but this is their main route cut the fishing stuff retorted peace the strain of the night had told more on him than he showed outwardly tell him were lost will he take semittanth to loveapple crossing if so hes in command adele translated surprise and delight passed across the old mans face and he went forward and kissed adeles hand with a gesture which i think must have been a survival of eighteenthcentury french manners in mauritius he bowed to peace and put his hand on mkgs shoulder he spoke long and eloquently to adele she smiled and it lighted up her strange lovely face at agalega he says the children from la fourche play on the beach with the rose and blue and carmine shellsshells which are found nowhere else in all limuria chepes wife is from the amirante isles and everyone knows that amirante women are are how do you say they see things fey i supplied she smiled her thanks chepes wife is fey she reads fortunes in the shells she told andre that one day he would be the captain of a great ship greater than any he had known now he thanks you because you have made it come true great ship sniffed peace but he smiled affectionately at the old fisherman there is more went on adele he would never forgive me if i cut it short this is a womans fortune he says which may or may not be true but she hesitated he feels that the real captain of our spirits here is she nodded at mkg the strain of the long night showed on mkgs face too there was a rim of salt and dried sweat on his hairline and his eyes were bloodshot mkg said tell him adele tell him my mission peace said wait mkg said shaking his head i want him to know adele explained stumbling over the words you see there is no word for rocket or missile in creole i must try and explain it simply in other terms andre still had his hand on mkgs sleeve does he know we are being hunted asked mkg adele replied yes we are running like a school of frightened tunny with devilfish after them the old man bowed ceremoniously again to peace and me and took the wheel he swung semittantes head about five degrees to starboard how soon does he think he will be at loveapple crossing asked peace early afternoon were back in the ranks john peace said with a faint glimmer of humour lets see whats on the air adele let me know if theres anything began mkg but boz blair broke in with some technicalities about little bear and i was glad to escape from the bridge in the radio shack adele searched the air for signals from the seventh fleet again nothing but menacing stillness peace listened expressionless to the newscasts about the crisis adele tried the navy wavelength again she stiffened at the callsign its tyler peace and i read over her shoulder as she decoded willowtrack to cic x intercepted yacht bellatrix position long e lat s the radio spluttered its reply and adele went through the agonizing slow business of decoding cic blue force to willowtrack x is vicepresident in yacht x willowtrack to cic x no radio contact with bellatrix x seas make boat contact impossible x yacht seems full of men x cic to willowtrack x stick by that yacht fellah x willowtrack to cic x you bet x closer than his shirt x no answer to my light signals x cic to willowtrack x concentrate all forces bellatrix area x where is semittante x willowtrack to cic x bellatrix flag signal flies word semittante x cic to willowtrack x what hells he playing at x willowtrack to cic x closed yacht in heavy seas x trying to get a man across x at least men aboard bellatrix x no sign vicepresident x i could picture the scene tyler frantic for information jockeying the big sub awash to her casings to give her maximum stability in the swells as close as he dared to the strangely silent yacht despite everything the thrill of the chase raced through my veins i was halfglad halfashamed that i had given my undertaking to peace about mkg here it was willowtrack to cic x fired line from willowtrack bridge x chief quartermaster volunteered to go across x difficult evolution but achieved it x with loudhailer says no sign of vicepresident x men all foreigners x unable to under stand what they say except they repeat semittante point ing to themselves x cic to willowtrack x what language x willowtrack to cic x leader repeats du plessis x cic to willowtrack x du plessis captain semitumte x try french x i want that man x detach shenandoah ex red force and bring him to me x peace whistled but he became less tense one less sub to hunt us its going to take the best part of today for shenandoah to reach blue force and get du plessis aboard thorntons flagship i observed he glanced keenly at me still talking about the hunt in positive terms adele said are you intending to show those messages to mkg peace gathered them up of course these are operational theres nothing in them aboutthe other side of the picture all operational messages she insisted the smile didnt reach his eyes subject to my approval i feel pretty cheap standing next to the man with the knowledge i have i began peaces tone hardened immediately theres no point in discussing it further doesnt he want to signal the president again asked adele after all its days still until the launch he mentioned it but he realizes as well as we do what the consequences would be of a signal while theyre hunting us hunt peace and i had risked death together in the past both as the hunter and the hunted despite myself the thought surged up in my mind what if peace after all was right and the outcome of a successful mission would be worth the immediate risks involved to the vicepresident peace had been right before when the whole world believed him w r o n g ill take these to the bridge he said picking up the signals adele listened gravely to me after he had gone when i told her of our past missions of my mixture of feelings about little bear and mkg before she could reply a stream of signals started to go out to red force allocating them new dispositions shenandoah grumbled at being taken from the hunt to taxi captain du plessis thornton and blue force abandoned their previous search area and turned on a heading towards bellatrix tyler ordered all his ships into the same area peace had bought another day with his ruse by early afternoon the squalls started to increase in violence and frequency from the northeast semittante took a fearful beating the gusts catching the old ship under the bow laid her under with a peculiar sickening corkscrew motion it was impossible to stand on the bridge without holding on the hazard of the lifelines to the radio shack was more than real boz and his men risked their lives to check little bears lashings semittantes deck was continuously awash in the violent crosssea which jounced and jerked pummelled and hammered her three of the lifeboats hung smashed but the cutter with its precious load was secure i had demanded some jerrycans of petrol for its auxiliary engine from macthe tank i found was empty tyler and thornton were on the air without a break both huk forces were taking a tremendous hammering they reported andre and mkg were fighting the wheel when i felt the tempo of semittantes motion changefrom the long swooping dives with water pouring off the rusty bows to a quick shuddering action the bottom seemed to be dropping out of the barometer which stood at of mercury we had run into a fearful crosssea on peaces orders i brought adele to the bridgewe were afraid that the radio shack might be swept overboard andre shouted above the din loveapple crossing beyond the bridge visibility was down to about fify yards the sea was shrouded in spray the summits of the waves were carried aloft bodily in a white shower of salt as high as a carriers deck it was a formidable aweinspiring sight adele translated we are coming in from the east straight towards the lagoon where is it demanded peace andre pointed but we could see nothing then slightly to port i caught a glimpse of a coconut tree bent like a whip on a low point of land there i yelled thats itlook l adele said vingtcinq coups the flogging said mkg quietly is coming to old semit tante trevordavis gave a thumbsdown sign to pete the texan peace swallowed hard can andre take her through the reef into the lagoonin this andres reply was grave it is a very big ship and the pass is narrow peace slowed the engines it doesnt matter if she strikes so long as we get her inside without warning the wind cut semittante lay in a vacuum of silence adele grabbed me john darling what cyclone centre replied peace were dead in the heart of it were in the middle of the whirlpool everything spins around creating a small patch in the very centre which is absolutely without movement ive never seen it myself though until now our voices were loud unnatural we waitedhours it seemed though it could not have been more than five minutes then adele said andre thinks he can take her in now the narrow spit of land was a dirty grey compared to the fanged whiteness of the water the reef was a horseshoe of wild surf at vingtcinq coups was a small roofless hut and a strange square trellis of iron peace said that axe john we may have to cut the cutter clear if we strike boz slack off that wire cable round little bear ill be here at the wheel with andre as soon as we get inside the lagoon get up forard with pete allingham and knock the shackle out of the anchor cable i want everyone else in the cutter ready then get below and open the seacocks with mac adele i want you with me she hesitated and looked deep into my eyes hers told me all i wanted to know i went forard with the big texan the unnatural quiet persisted twice i was thrown to the deck as the crosssea dealt the old tramp a quick leftright to the jaw and water swept across the deck the bows swung high i looked down into the entrance race i saw the coralhead too late andres course was slightly off centre in the reef passage i yelled frantically gesturing the bow pausedplunged downon to the dagger of coral the crash and scream of metal threw me hard against the deck up she came to impale herself again but the bow swung away and the second strike was only glancing she limped clear tired to death her head starting to droop then the sea quietenedwe were through pete and i clouted the inchthick anchor shackle once twice it gave and the anchor fell in a shower of sparks i ran for the engineroom while pete made for the cutter mac it was as quiet as a cathedral except for the ominous sound of water flooding in mac here i dropped into the shaft up to my knees in seawater mac fought to open the rusty seacock we threw our combined weight on the heavy wrench and it gave water spurting over us we raced on deck making for the boat andre was speaking rapidly pointing seawards semittante was settling at an awkward angle making the launching of the cutter difficult she could not be cut clear nowshe would simply smash herself against the steel side i jumped into the boat an icy spear of fear went through me adele was missing i clutched the fall and swung myself back on deck for christs sake yelled peace shes going down like a stone semittante gave a lurch adele i screamed above the din i sprinted up the sloping planks hauled myself bodily up a steel ladder and propelled myself to the radio shack by hauling myself along the ropes of the lifeline i had rigged i kicked once twice at the shacks door which had jammed from the angle of the sinking ship adele she sat at the radio headphones on and stared unseeingly for a moment i thought she was dead the ships sinkingany momentcome for gods sake she seemed to come back from a great distance silently she pushed across the transcript of a newscast it was headed voice of america it read flash the white house announces that the pre sident has suffered a severe stroke his condition gives rise to the gravest anxiety g r i d e a violent lurch accompanied by an ominous rumble from below jerked me out of my stunned reaction i crammed the transcript into my pocket tore the headphones off adeles head picked her up and staggered out the wild motion of the dying ship ripped the flesh from my hand as i hung on to the lifeline rope then as she steadied i made a halfsprint down the ladder and deck to the boat peace had already eased it down about ten feet but shouted to the others to stop when he saw me semittante lurched again keeping adele over my shoulder i grabbed a loose fall with one hand and wound my knees and ankles round it faces in the boat so small below were turned towards me underneath lay a maelstrom of death the rope burned hot on my torn palm eager hands reached up and pulled us into the cutter semittante gave another wild lurch forward bulkhead gone shouted peace pay off those fallshandsomely we dont want to go down with her andre gestured seawards i saw the cause of his alarm half a mile away loomed a threatening bank of grey there was a steady roaring like an express train sweating and cursing we lowered the cutter fending her off the rusty side while the angle steepened as semittante went to her grave we clawed and shoved now the boat hung a foot or two above the sea i grabbed an oar and swung round i felt i had been struck in the face by a grey fist the cyclone hit us anew throwing the cutter against the steel side above its scream was another noisethe frightening snap of planking ragged rivets ripped the oilskin at my shoulder semittante rolled towered above our stricken craft i reversed my oar it slipped helplessly and then lodged against a buckled plate peace knelt in the bows with another oar i saw his muscles bulge simultaneously i threw all my weight against the rough wood we were clear the wind snatched the cutter away like a feather water poured through her broken planking i whipped off my souwester and baled the others did the same andre snatched peaces oar and used it to steerthe tiller was useless she lay so far over on her beam ends it was impossible to breathe facing the wind and speech was out of the question we all baled frantically despite our efforts the water rose then suddenly the cutter slewed stayed in midcourse bumped crashedand we were thrown in a heap on to sand peace picked himself up and gestured get her clear of the breakers his mouth formed the words but i heard nothing in the gale adele raced forward and looped the bow painter over her shoulder she too realized the danger of another sea hurling the boat on to the iron sand peace and mkg andre mac boz blairs men trevordavis and i all threw our weight against the cutter a long splinter ripped my torn hand but i was unaware of the pain mkg stumbled and fell but he was up in a moment with petes help hanging on to a rowlock the cutter slid forward andre shouted pointing up a shallow gradient i saw the stone structure i had spotted from the sea dragging heaving our backs breaking while the wind thundered and tore at our clothes and the sea at our feet we inched the boat out of the breakers towards the hut it seemed to be made of heavy squared coral blocks we headed for a ruined doorway the cyclones howl took on a new note and i saw outside the hut a twisted metal grille capped by two handcuffs like rowlocks the lattice made the cyclone scream like the slaves who were lashed to death on it this was the flogginggrating which gave the place its name vingtcinq coupstwentyfive lashes we manhandled the boat through the doorway into shelter away from the mad wind as we upended the shattered hull and crept in under it i pressed the crumpled voice of america paper into peaces hand for four days the cyclone turned the sea to frenetic fermentation and the wind to a maniac which screamed its torment through the flogginggrating surf boiled like thunder against the reef the high recurring note of the wind reminded me of the uninhibited keen which breaks into a shanty to cry the sailors deathfear of the sea it made speech impossible and sleep exhausted though we all were a nightmare my dozing moments were punctuated by jerks into dazed wakefulness as though i were goaded by the thought of the message i had given peace it seemed scarcely possible that the man who lay as if dead under the boat with us might by now be president of the greatest nation in the world and he did not know i salved my conscience by telling myself that it was impossible to communicate at all in the din of the cyclone and that the whole question would have to be solved when it was over four days what was happening constitutionally during those four critical days in the united states where the highest office of the nation might by now be left unfilled the searchers like us would be stormbound i simply could not face up to it peace had taken up a position on one side of adele and me and mac on the other i sensed though conversation was impossible that we were under guard our misery was made worse by the spray salt and rain which percolated through the cutters smashed planking over our heads boz carefully moved the datico gear the vu firing radio and spacesuits to the driest spots mac buried the jerrycans of petrol in the sand to deaden the smell of fumes since the tank of the cutters auxiliary had been empty when we left semittantethe reason why i had obtained the jerrycans from macthere was no need for us to worry about its standing upside down we tried unavailingly to stanch the planking on the inside with our oilskins our mouths were raw with blown sand the hut adele had told me aboard semittante had been built by an eighteenthcentury freebooter who had eloped with his mistress from mauritius and been wrecked on loveapple crossing they had waited fifteen years for a ship it never came she died her grave lay outside previous cyclones had reduced the outlying parts to rubble but the centre remained made of substantial blocks of fourfoot coral we could not stand up against the force of the wind we could only crawl behind the shelter of the ruined walls whenever i did so either mac or peace accompanied me while the other watched adele we were evidently to be allowed no opportunity of telling what we knew the rest of the island except the highlying point where we were was completely submerged on the second night adele lay in my arms in terror as the seas started to break into the shelter mkg his face caked with salt and stubble and his eyes red with sand watched as the ocean reached out sought our deaths but could not quite touch us a deep gloom fell over the launch team we had eluded our pursuers but the cost was plain the stovein cutter would never float again i consoled myself with that thought in making bearable the secret inside the which seemed to burn like fire whenever i looked across at the finedrawn tired features of the vicepresident radio reception was impossible with the storm and the blanketing effect of the walls and the boat we could not have heard it anyway two days were left till the launch one afternoon after i had lost count of time something awoke me adele her thin sweater stained with driedout seawater and her pants shrunk above her ankles lay against my shoulder the softness all gone from her fine bleached hair andres back was instinctively to the storm peace his face gaunt stubbled and dirty sat propped up watching the top of his black turtlenecked sweater caked with white salt mac lay sleeping on our other side mkg encased in an oilskin to try and keep out the file of the sand slept under the decking aft with boz trevordavis and the other scientists the sand began its attrition the moment i opened my eyes on the grey sleepdrugged wet groupalive but little more we had eked out an existence on andres sack of salted seabirds although i wanted to gag every time i smelt one fire was out of the question even the acetylene lamp would not stay alight so we gave it up and lay in a twilight uncaring state now something touched my sailors sense something somewhere was amiss the grating had stopped screaming i heardheardadeles breathing against my neck i lifted my head to speak to her but the sand locked my tongue unceremoniously i spat the winds dropped my voice sounded like the crash of a shot in the confined space peaces eyes were alight mkg and boz started up boz letting out an oath as his head hit the planking above by god exclaimed peace the salt caked the muscles of his face heremac mkg andre the others blinked unbelievingly and adele pushed herself upright to a sitting position peace crawled across to mkg and clapped him on the shoulder lets get out of here weve still got today and tomorrow before the launch mkg grinned back uncertainly lets get this damn thing off our backs still acting like automatons we threw our shoulders under the cutter and tipped her over we got shakily to our feet staring over the low wall which had saved us loveapple crossing had been sandpapered clean except for a few snappedoff palmtree trunks acres of white spume coated the lagoon and the shore a sodden seabird lay snarled in the flogginggrating pulped and smashed the sun broke through as we stood in silent awe at the spectacle of devastation peace said if the cyclone is over at loveapple crossing it s been finished in tylers area since last night mkg said the radio the batteries are failing he said curtly it will be used for operational messages only there will be no time to listen to newscasts when we might miss a vital signal from either tyler or thornton only adele operates the radio aw gee objected pete allingham goodnaturedly i was looking forward to a little chachacha to brighten this tropical isle of beauty therell be enough music of another kind to face said peace cryptically adele anxious to steer the conversation away from the subject of the radio said look all the bois manioc has been washed away andre spoke andre says she translated it is like the great cyclone of the landmarks are all gone that may make it tougher for tylers men i added from a thousand feet up loveapple crossing now probably looks more like a reef than an island peace reflected except remarked adele indicating the grating and the hut for this that coat of spume will hide little bear if they come over the lagoon said mkg screwing up his eyes unless the boat is fixed we can forget about the whole thing boz blair said gloomily mkg turned to peace why dont we see if we can fix that cutter you and andre go take a look and the rest of us will scout for wood peace nodded reluctantly ill need john as well and i want mac to check the engine and adele to see what the hunterkillers are up to once again we were to be segregated from mkg if theres any news of significance began mkg but peace cut in quickly of course adele will note it down and well let you know but im not going to waste precious power on hearing what russia is up to or whether mrs jones from cardiff has murdered her six children mkg looked unhappy weve been completely out of touch for four days now commander the sooner we can find some timber the better for little bears chances he replied i said adele can make a note of any significant news come on fellers pete allingham gave a whoop and jumped over the wall the others followed grinning like schoolboys their carefree air seemed to drive away mkgs dark thoughts he put his hand on the coral wall to vault over it then he too grinned and said think the astronaut of the day after tomorrow had better get back into training ill trot round the beach a couple of times he followed the others at an easy lope peace went back into the hut and fetched the radio this was the small set we had used in the cutter before the vlf set was purely for firing little bear and could not be used for normal reception as peace put it down i asked how long are you going to continue with this lie his voice was controlled but the emotion behind it was tightpacked for as long as i think necessary he replied dont you see how this enhances the value of the spaceshot mkg may be the first president of the united states to step into space youre perpetuating the biggest fraud in history adele protested it was bad enough when the president was fully in control of the situation but now i looked at the hard eyes alive with dedication to little bear i knew in my heart that peace would stop at nothing i had noticed his kinship with the dni before it was ablaze in his face now what you are doing is not only madness but criminal i said heatedly for four days now the president of the united states has been critically ill suppose he dies he may be dead already you know as well as i do that quick continuity is vital in the presidential succession when john f kennedy was shot lyndon johnson was sworn in within an hour and a half im glad you mention president johnson peace replied he was sworn in in a plane there is no reason why mkg cannot be sworn in at space station one if need be where the foot of the american president treads that is american soil i turned helplessly to adele and looked into her troubled eyes mac peace said crisply i want you to fetch the remington and the colt and get the sand out of them get em in good working ordersoon as hell he spoke to us if the president dies the speaker of the house can act until the new president is sworn in this is no argument i began but he waved me quiet im not interested in arguments if tyler and thornton dont catch up with us i intend mkg to be shot to sante fe i also intend to have your silenceat any cost mac had reappeared with the two weapons andre was engrossed in examining the boat there was a long pause i mean at any cost peace repeated this is madness i said are you prepared to keep quiet he demanded two daysthats all i ask i shrugged and turned to adele who made a hopeless gesture good said peace mac or i will be watching you all the time now get the radio going mauritius radio came through the white house announces that the seventh fleet in the sea of limuria has resumed its intensive search for the person of marvin k green vicepresident of the united states and the missing french freighter semittante admiral thorntons heet has been strengthened by two more carriers from the united states eastern fleet longrange vr maritime reconnaissance aircraft will fly southwards from the seychelles tomorrow in cooperation with the seventh fleet fears for the safety of semittante have been expressed in view of the violence of the cyclone which was the worst recorded this century at the meteorological stations at chagos and st brandon the cyclone is however now moving eastwards out of the search area captain du plessis the shanghaied master of the semittante is rendering all possible assistance in the search and is at present aboard admiral thorntons flagship meanwhile as anxiety about the presidents condition deepens the united states is torn with the biggest constitutional crisis in its history as listeners already know the speaker of the house mr donald langley was sworn in as pro forma president until some clarification has been received regarding the whereabouts of marvin k green speaker langley has appealed publicly to the kidnappers to hand over the popular vicepresident with the promise of a full pardon there has been no response to this appeal there was a violent scene in congress last night when a group of southern senators sought to bring in a motion applying the disability clause to marvin k green whose popularity with the maninthestreet now appears to be higher than it ever was the congress reaction is stated by observers to be a reflection of the nations state of nerves commerce has reported a serious decline in trade and wall street has fallen to its lowest level in twenty years speaker langley has appealed to the nation to remain calm in this time of crisis peace had been scribbling while the broadcast progressed what are you doing asked adele im faking a broadcast for mkgs benefit he said brutally itll be quite harmless routine sort of thing none of this we remained silent try the seventh fleet he ordered the waveband was crowded with traffic grid position e negative said an american voice will commence search grid position e over one of the carrier search planes muttered peace i wish i knew where grid position e was weather clearing rapidly from east and north reported another plane then came a code signal which adele deciphered gig to combined red and blue force x carrier aircraft and helots to search area between saya de malha and agalega according to predetermined grid pattern x vps ex seychelles will carry out similar grid search south and southeast from seychelles to st brandon x all surface ships to take part x report contacts immediately x the heat is on said peace theyre coming at us from the east and the north as he spoke mkg boz and the other scientists came up the slope towards us adele peace commanded ask andre what hope there is of his fixing the cutter he says it is badly damaged she replied two bottom planks must be completely replaced before she will float he has an axe but as you can see for yourself there is no timber if there were but one tatamaka tree or one bois mangue to be found we could do something what about those coconut stumps peace demanded we use coconut for making oars replied adele the cutter is of best tatamaka which is hard the stumps will be useless he says the general gloom on the faces of the scientists indicated that their hunt for timber had been unsuccessful peace handed mica the faked newscast he read it without interest why not simply rip off some of the cutters decking and patch the planks i asked when adele had passed it on andre went and fetched the axe he stood with his feet apart and went through the gestures of chopping shaping fitting he shook his head the deck is bois mangue not tatamaka like the hull she explained he is very proud of his boat even chepe who is a master shipbuilder admires it he explains that he shaped every piece of decking with an adze so that they all fiteach one has its own particular place and will be useless elsewhere becides the decking is much too short for the hull even if he reshaped it axe corrected mkg he shaped the planks with an axe no replied adele r is an adze a shipbuilders tool it looks likea garden hoe they stand on a log and chop towards their toes the adze is as sharp as a razor but andre says that the axe will do for a patchif we had some timber andre gestured towards the spit of sand now looming whiter as the sky cleared and the wind dropped he wants to walk over to the western side of the island where there used to be a small pocket of bois mangue but he warns you it is most likely to have disappeared in the storm the radio began with morse and adele decoded while the rest of us waited around peace looked anxious she handed him the signal first and he read it out interrogation captain du plessis of french freighter semittante now complete x helos to search grid pattern east and west of semittantes last estimated position in grid e x estimates place semittante west of this position following cyclone x as the signal had come in i noticed mac move up unobtrusively with the remington pretending to clean it with a scrap of cloth the move was not lost on adele either as peace explained the earlier search messages to mkg and the others andre adele and i set off we stumbled through the sand piled high in drifts at the base of vingtcinq coups farther away the gale had stripped away the topsoil down to the coral bedrock of the pocket of timber nothing remained but a few untidy sockets in the earth andre gestured hopelessly and then indicated the low northern slope of the island adele and i walked hand in hand adele said i thought geoffrey peace was your friend were virtually prisoners and that awful engineer she shuddered i think mac would do anything for peace i said slowly even to shooting us she asked little bear meanswell i dont have to say it i said peace has sidestepped what is the main issue as far as we and the world are concerned namely mkgs position as vicepresident his singlemindedness is something frightening and deadly she said if mkg had the slightest suspicion hed call the spaceshot off all we can hope is that one of tylers planes finds usquickly i feel ashamed every time i look at mkg it may solve itself i said we cant tow little bear without a boat even if we could the searchers instinctively i looked seawards even now tyler and his hunters might be lying off loveapple crossing andre let out an exclamation adele wheeled on him he was pointing to the lagoon there in the lagoon maybe a hundred yards away was a long dark object there was a rapidfire of creole from andre who started towards vingtcinq coups at a shambling run i turned to adele and stopped in amazement she was stripping off her clothes in a moment the whole loveliness of her suntanned body stood in sharp relief against the pure white sand come on she called quick help me she raced into the surf breasted it paused and signalled me on with her upraised arm i too pulled off my clothes in bewilderment and followed her beyond the breakers adele hung on to something in a few strokes i was at her side she clung to a dark log whose top branches only remained bois mangue its a whole tree of it andres eyesight is uncanny she squirmed on to the floating log like a seal and sat astride laughing for that moment the massive search the great presidential drama the whole outside world seemed to recede her joy and her laughter werefor me dont look so serious my darling her naked loveliness caught me by the throat as she sat there her eyes dancing i trod water and looked up at the firm curve of her breasts and the wild loveliness of her wet hair i said when were married we shall come back to loveapple crossing she leaned down and kissed me sweet and salt together loveapplecrossing she murmured yes back to vingtcing coupsour happiness will make up for all the unhappiness of those old lovers adele i began but she kissed me again and pushed me away she slid off the log come we must get the log ashore before the others arrive and see me like this together we floated the log to the beach pulling it well clear of the surf above the highwater mark adele barely had time to drag on her clothes before the others led by peace and mkg at a run reached us andre panted out a flood of creole boz gave a whoop of joy when he saw the log and seized the big texan together they did an impromptu wardance on the sand andre grabbed mkgs hand and even trevordavis was moved to clap his american counterpart on the shoulder only mac had not bothered to come andre put a foot on the log like a trophy hunter and burst into creole while the rest of the scientists stood round grinning like kids adele and i alone did not share in the general rejoicing she translated andre he says bring the axe right away and hell have the cutter ready by midday tomorrow boz looked concerned that leaves the afternoon only to check her over sorry boz replied peace that missile is staying down until the last momentand that means until only a few hours before the launch itself boz turned in protest to mkg i gotta check mkg said quietly commanders right boz i know youd like to go over every rivet but the risk is too big boz drew his fellowscientists in with him see here mkg i know we checked and rechecked everything before she was stowed but that is nearly six weeks ago now she was fine then and theres no reason to think she isnt fine now replied mkg you set the stable table yourself the same goes for snap added peace she also should be fine we havent pulled rods since she went aboard boz remained dubious sure sure we went over everything with a toothcomb before everything jimdandy but what if how long does it take to start the nuclear power plant i asked boz smiled despite his preoccupation pullrods he corrected thats what its called till shes fully activated two hours youve also got to spin up her gyros and stabilize the stable table youre making a lab job out of it instead of a field test mkg chided him gently you know thats part of the countdown routine boz data and compensations boz started to say but mkg waved a hand you know it can be done without all the trappings boz lets stick to the essentials especially since tyler will be just over the horizon boz and the scientists looked unhappy i think they would have liked to strip down the entire missile mkgs remark about tyler was with me still cant the seventh fleet interfere with you once little bears in flight boz and mkg exchanged amused glances no little bear has no radio or radar acquisition once boz presses that fire button nothing can stop me peace nodded at the log the sooner we get this up to vingtcinq coups the sooner andre can start mkg said i feel i want that next to me even when i sleep tonight will be a lovely night after the cyclone said adele clear with stars and a moon mkg caught the strange note in her voice but peace said quickly searchers moon id prefer it pitchblack half an hour later gasping and stumbling we brought the log to vingtcinq coups andre barely gave himself time to recover his breath before he took the axe and barefooted his toes gripped the rough timber he started a long slow rhythmical chopping stroke peace ordered adele to check the navy waveband immediately she asked for a pencil she decoded the signal and handed it to him listen to this mkg john he said loveapple crossing is grid position e fifty miles to the immediate east is grid and to the west is northwards and southwards e they would first search a band only miles south of us it seemed impossible that we could escape detection i told myself perhaps in mitigation of my surrendering to peaces threats hear that boz exclaimed mkg when they dont find anything there theyll turn northhere its one hell of a risk said boz were being squeezed between the risks and the deadline replied mkg he turned to peace by heavens commander i wish i knew the reason why the president hasnt called off the seventh fleets search maybe its even a giant cover on his part because the secret was outing anyway i dont know i ve thought and thought it over but with only two days to go this thing has really gotten into me and itll take a hell of a lot more than tyler and thornton to make me turn back now i saw the elation in peaces face as he turned to meet my eyes what we need is some real liquor for a celebration to night the big texan said laughing celebrate when im on the way in little bear replied mkg and dont toast me onlytoast the commander here the secret hammered in my mind until i wanted to shout it out to the whole of limuria adele must have felt the same as i did for she went over to andres log and came back with one of the shavings she held it out to me smell theres no smell like bois mangue in the world it was pungently aromaticperhaps it owed something to a common ancestor with camphor in the east indieswith a hint of cinnamon which lingered until it was too dark to see andre swung his axe refusing assistance peace declined to switch on the radio mac grunted over the cutters engine but i noted that the remington was close in the stern locker near his hand the wind dropped and the sea merely grumbled now against the reef we lit a fire of bois mangue chips and grilled fish which trevordavis had speared in the lagoon the tiny fire etched the sinister black grating above us with scarlet the moon rose under its softness the sea resumed its long languid limurian lope a sigh instead of a snarl limuria returned to her gentleness we sat with our backs to the coral wall smoking looking across the lagoon mkg was in the middlescruffy unshaven and nondescript but we were drawn to his personality like moths to a flame he seemed to have put his questionings behind him and his eyes were bright we all had too much to say for words mkg turned to adele and pointed with the glowing tip of his cigarette to a bright constellation in the south pity loveapple crossing is so far south i would have liked to show you little bear in his own place in the firmament why cant we see him asked adele in a small voice perhaps the thought was eating her toowhat if little bear did not go according to expectation there was a lightness in the vicepresidents voice by contrast you cant spot little bear in the southern hemisphere he told her nor polaris which is in little bears tail orions belt was a jewel above our heads on the right the southern cross hung over the limitless ocean the silence was immense in my heart i knew that if ever mkg came back he would bring with him something of the incalculable horizons which lay before our eyes to add to a personality so full and strong that i for one had never encountered anything like it before could the end justify the means in this fantastic spacejourney i hastily stopped my thoughts i was beginning to think like peace without considering the vast consequences of the act i said breaking the spell how long will your flight to santa fe take mkg a few hours he replied ill orbit a couple of times to get the automatic docking computer lined up on its target which is the space station we know santa fes orbital position exactly at any time its a relatively easy thing since we developed the locking beam which acton and davis used so successfully boz came and squatted on his haunches in front of mkg cant we float up little bear as soon as the cutter is ready mkg that check mkg flicked away the glowing end of his cigarette sorry boz the longer shes out of sight the safer itll louse up the whole project if shes spotted at the very last moment and its getting that way timewise tylers fliers will be over loveapple crossing tomorrow said peace flatly guessings fine objected boz im not guessing boz answered peace the helos and carrier planes will have sanitized grid e east of us by tomorrow thenloveapple crossing grid e thats the way it goes one grid finished the next grid begun mkg said its as relentless as as a countdown said peace i gotta have more time insisted boz i cant risk a failure peace said quickly can you work in the dark on little bear boz no seetheres one hell of a moon went on peace what if i go down at sunset cut little bear free boz swung excitedly on peace youre sure an ideas man commander it will leave little bear completely vulnerable for the two hours it takes to pull rods and fully activate the snap motor said peace maybe not completely for itll be dark and therell be enough moon for boz and his team to work by theres andres acetylene lamp until they can draw their own power from the missiles power plant jeez i exclaimed the texan thatll give us a whole night to test her boz when peace spoke i detected the real reason for his concession youll want to help the boys for a while wont you mkg dont get short on sleep thoughyou and boz and the others can rest up here tomorrow afternoon in other words peace would keep the radio well out of the way until it was too late to retract boz and the scientists were enthusiastic see here commander said boz as soon as the power starts coming through from the reactor well submerge her up to the capsule well have power then to operate the ballast pumps the americans and trevordavis crowded round mkg squatting like boz on their heels boz turned to trevordavis can do fellah that snap is your pigeon the thought of getting back to mechanics seemed to animate the silent englishman can do he replied ill want light though from the acetylene well have to risk it said peace its not such a big risk said adele all the fishing boats in limuria will be out now that the storms overi expect everyone is as hungry as we are tylers men will see hundreds of fishermens acetylene lights at sea tonight and tomorrow good breathed peace adele jerked up and pointed south look at that light what a meteor a distant stain of red followed by brilliant white blotted out the southern cross for a moment it isnt a meteor said peace grimly thats a flare dropped from a plane adele gave a shiver and a silence fell upon us would tyler discover little bearwith a flare like that tomorrow as the missile lay immobile on the surface of the lagoon peace broke the silence tylers driving his men into the ground anything that floats theyll find his voice became hard tomorrow wethat is mac andre john and adele and iwill play at island fishermen in the lagoon boz you and your boys will need all the sleep you can get if youre going to work right through the night well bury the datico gear the vlf radio and the spacesuit here in the sand of the hut in case we have some nosey helo overhead the dunking helos will come first then the vps it sure looks as if were on the hook remarked the big texan on the hook but not landed peace replied everyone will play absolutely dumb if a helo comes overin the boat we dont speak except adele if she wishes in creole if a helo comes over the hut act like sleeping fishermen andres safe anyway none of us look too zazzy in our present rig well pass for islanders mkg laughed and assumed a southern drawl for them kind words commander i thank you from the bottom of mah cottonpickn heart his easy confidence broke the tension peace went on while were playing round in the lagoon tomorrow ill put a marker over little bear so that we know exactly where to look after dark what if the fliers spot semittante i asked the water will be as clear as glass added adele they will said peace they will but until a vp can get here with mad gear they wont know whether the wreck is new or old the sea of limuria hasnt only got one wreck he went on look at em all on the st brandon reef i think its unlikely that theyll divert a vp specially to investigate yet one more wreck most likely it will be logged for routine investigation when a vp comes to case grid e we can only watch and pray boz carried away with enthusiasm asked how long do you reckon itll take to get little bear into her firing position commander twothree hours maybe he replied ill have mac check over the engine again tomorrow it hasnt been used in ages but it looks okay id like to start out of the lagoon before daybreak i asked once little bear is submerged at the firing point theres one hour to go t minus sixtyyeah boz corrected me sure you got it the countdown routines pretty simplemkg gets my messages via the radio buoy on the surface he gives us a count every few minutest minus fiftynine t minus fifty and so on down to zero at t minus one i start the datico checkout but forget it fellahthats what me and pete and trev are all here for you got yourself a ringside seatno work peace added quietly and as you count every helo every plane every surfaced sub in grid e will hear you sure when little bear is on the surface a helo a sub a plane anything with search radar or sonarcould pick her up yeah and when her generators get going any nuclear sub within sonar range will hear them suretwenty thousand yards nearly twelve miles so from tomorrow evening until mkg is launched little bear is wide open wide open as the prairie commander if tyler and his merry men pal around grid n then boz shrugged the mounting tension and the burden of our secret overlaid any satisfaction there might have been when we dragged the repaired cutter to the waters edge next afternoon mkg and the american team slept peace on the grounds that the radio batteries were failing had kept it assiduously out of the way during the morning mac hovered like an evil presence i had a restless night i fancied i heard a helicopters rotors and i started upright it was noise but not of rotors at dawn i saw the shoreline was thick with grey noddies blackandwhite terns and little loveterns which had returned to their home after the cyclone a squadron not of tylers men but of steeleyed frigatebirds hung over the lagoon divebombing shoals of fish adele hitched the painter over her shoulder and paddled into the wavelets but andre stood back muttering peace said sharply slap it about andrethe sooner we see whether shes seaworthy the better mac also wants to try the engine andre says every ship must have a life she cannot go into the water like this an echelon of frigatebirds circled low eyeing us say the cutter has served us wonderfully and so has he answered peace adele translated but andre gestured defiantly in the islands we have strange gods perhaps you will not approve but without it the cutter cannot go into the water for gods sake what does he want began peace but adele cocked her head to the radio and turned it up a voice said red force reporting to cic x grid e e negative x am commencing search grid e and e x the reply came back cic to red force x report likely contact and vector in vps for mad investigation x peace stiffened you hear that theyll be here any moment now what the hell is wrong with andre adele tell him the birds will be here soon the old man looked sullen he says the birds are here thats what hes talking about the radio said red force helo fx reporting now entering grid posi tion e x helos fx fx and fx at intervals miles north x will coordinate reports from fx marilyns dream x the carrier was brief keep that dream going fellah x andre gestured at the circling birds spoke to adele and then pointed at the new planks in the hull peaces mouth tightened and he went to the sternsheets where the remington was kept no geoffrey no not andre i burst out adele said helplessly the boat must have a life the new planking must have a life one must die in order that the ship may live without it there is no life for his boat there was a volley of creole from andre in my fathers day he says the islanders used to make a human chain of rollers to the sea and a new or a repaired boat was launched over them it took life for only the strong survived now there are not enough strong young men any more but there must be a life for a long moment peace paused then he grabbed the remington he slid back the bolt geoffrey for gods sake i rushed forward before i could reach him peace fired one of the circling mass of frigatebirds fell flopping into the water at our feet delight and astonishment spread over old andres face he crashed his rough fist between peaces shoulders grabbed the axe and splashed after the wounded bird in a moment he was back holding the bucking thing clear as it struck at him he gestured to us the boatget it on its sidethe bird must not die before peace mkg and i heaved the cutter over andre yanked the kicking bird to his new planks and shoved its neck against them with a deft stroke he severed the birds neck and as the blood gushed he made the sign of the cross against the boards he went to peace and took his forearm in a curious grip adele said he says only a man of the sea would know i recovered my wits geoffrey in the name of all thats not holy its as old as timeor the sea he explained when he spoke of a life for a life i remembered ancient mediterranean shipwrights used to demand a human sacrifice at the time of launching the customs mutated somewhat but it still survives among these backblocks of the sea come on now he glanced at the sky there was nothing we eased the cutter into the water the new planks held smiling and gesticulating andre hoisted the sail we headed for semit tan tes grave quick yelled peace for gods sakequick get those hats on here they are there was no mistaking the roar of rotors the helicopter flew towards the lagoon entrance from the open sea switch off that radio hissed peace under the decking quick he threw the remington after it and pulled on a big hat the helo came at us wavetop level no english breathed peace mkgs face was drawn under its stubble adele was wideeyed andres astonishment was genuinehe had never seen a plane before the helo swung low and hovered over us with a downrush of air look up look up at her play it ordered peace we stood up shouting incoherently and waving the observer looked into our faces from thirty feet up a loudhailer clicked on so that we overheard his conversation with the pilot hell pete this looks a pretty beatup bunch so would you be if youd been out in a cyclone in that boat replied the other jeez it was bad enough in the flat top i aint no horseplayer but id lay money none of these guys is vicepresident of the united states said the observer the harsh metallic laughter echoed over the lagoon the helo swung and i caught a glimpse of a pinup girl with the legend marilyns dream near the horsecollar winch that goddam ole ship is at the bottom of the sea said the pilot were wasting our time i say this business sure gripes ole revss ass the other said laughing jesus this is the first land i seen commented the pilot nothing but sea sea sea rejoined the other there aint a thing for us here brother say he peered down theres a dame in that boat listen fellah if you want a dame you can get one nice and cosy back in the seychelles without flying a thousand miles to some goddam spit of land sure sure replied the observer i just sort of like the idea of a dame out heredancing girls soft music tropical lagoon you sound like you got a couple of sheets to the wind right now said the pilot call em up fellah ask what we re supposed to ask okay okay replied the observer i got it written down there was a pause then he called bateau i shuddered at his french shipbateau naunaufragewreck andre spoke to adele they laughed and pointed upwards aw cut it outcant you see theyre just a bunch of dumb islanders lets get the hell outa here i guess so first lets mosey around the lagoon report back willya sure fx marilyns dream reporting x loveapple crossing sounds like a firstrun moviehouse titlenegative x sighted boat with islanders x called em upnegative x l a g o o n negative added the other well bye from marilyns dream folks the loudhailer cut and the helo whirled upwards sweat stood out under peaces eyes adele was very still my knees were weak put on that radio adele ordered peace look the helo came to a hovering stop above the place where semittante lay the observers voice was recognizable on the set as adele held the navy wavelength helo fx to red force x grid position e x love apple crossing investigated x negative x island boat in inner lagoon x negative x wreck in lagoon x refer for routine investigation vp mad x wreck probably old x lies inside reef x i saw a ball with a cable attached fall from the helos winch into the sea to mark the wreck we waited breathless the observers voice went on routine dunking check x negative no contact x peace gave a great sigh of relief in less than a minute the helo swung the sonar ball back into position with the winch and following the reef disappeared westwards peace said quietly at least we know exactly where semittante lies we glided across the lagoon silent with our own thoughts andre with his uncanny sense of place brought the cutter to rest over the wreck her outline was clear little bears long crate lay on deck without speaking we dropped the cutter s anchor cable attached to a length of line and a chunk of bois mangue then we stole back across the lagoon through the lengthening shadows waiting for the night waiting for the morning love applecrossing fifteen hours to launch at six oclock that evening they had not found little bear in the gathering dusk the cutter lay over semittante peace stood ready in his rubber divingsuit to go down and cut the missile adrift the tension triggered off by the sweep of the helicopter was now enhanced by the nearness of the blastoff it was clear in the faces of boz blair trevordavis and the three other americans who waited for the missile to check it mkg alone seemed calm almost detached the stream of operational messages from red and blue forces did nothing to lessen the air of tension although the helo search had moved westwards from loveapple crossing towards agalega miles away the surface forces of carriers destroyers and nuclear subs had not yet entered grid e nor had the vps which peace dreaded most they might come tonight since our arrival back in the cutter the conversation had been exclusively technical centering round the launch for which peace was i think grateful for mkg did not renew his request to listen to newscasts mac chainsmoked and watched us from the background of the tight launch team circle peace gave the thumbsup sign and slipped into the calm water of the lagoon axe in hand we waited boz gave a sharp intake of breath there was a flurry of water and the missile broke surface close by shedding its tail of wooden crating the long silverwhite thing fiftyfive feet long six round the nose and thickening at the tail like a sailors bellbottomed pants pitched easily in the slight swell the capsule nosecone was behind the waterproof membrane beyond the reef the sea grumbled lets get alongside her boz exclaimed this is where we take over the men started to grin easing the tension they had a job to do which would occupy all their thoughts and effort during the night mkg was to assist for the first few hours and then return to vingtcinq coups for us the long night of waiting lay ahead adele shivered it looks so small mkg smiled at her saying nothing but bozs exuberance was starting to return at the sight of little bear best in a small lucky packet they say why that goddam great sirius rocket pete the texan laughed aw come off it boz if this guy gets talking about sirius hell blow a gasket peace surfaced and stripped off his scuba mask we hauled him into the boat and eased alongside little bear boz made fast to the capsules side hatch andre gazed in speechless wonderment boz held a checklist its a complex business he said me and the boys will go over everything during the night how long are you staying mkg till about ten replied mm well come out in the cutter and fetch you back said peace boz had the pleased air of a showman he gestured towards a small pistol switch in the capsules cockpit it projected prominently in front of the heavilypadded seat around whose back were draped safety straps see that that controls the movements of the power plant rods trev heres the expert on thatsnap i wondered what was going on in peaces mind the sight of the missile seemed to disquiet him boz went on before trev pulls rods which starts the reactoror as we space boys say it goes criticalwe have to check the instrument panels the monitoring circuits valves and emergency alarms theyre energized by a small battery unit until the main power starts coming through from the reactor each of us has his own department lets get going boz said the big texan you wouldnt think to look at this bum that hes an expert on missile valves boz remarked goodhumouredly it looks very dark in there adele murmured i knowhave to knowthe position of every switch every lever even in total darkness replied mkg he does too added boz right fellahs now well want a couple of hours before the instruments start to wake up under main power it also takes some time after shes gone critical to mount full power for the pumps and so on you cant do anything further here for the moment commander powernoise replied peace electric lightpinpoint for search planes pumpstarget for sonar sorry commander but thats the way it is well try and black out the perspex canopy from inside but we gotta have a good light to check we cant shorten the drill same with the countdown once we start the sequencer count whatever happens in that last hour before the blastoff were committed even if tyler should show up i asked mkg replied slowly once im submerged and counting for gods sake dont let tyler do anything rash this little honey will smash anything on her way up i dont want the lives of tyler and his crew on my conscience but its boz on the surface who presses the firingbutton i said this is all theorizing said peace shortly well meet the situation as it arises mkg eyed him speculatively for a long moment then boz took a key and unlocked the side hatchway through the casing into the cockpit he signed to trevordavis come on fellah shes all yours to start with trevordavis lowered himself on to the cushioned chair and looked at us through the perspex he raised his right hand forefinger and thumb circled together then he dropped his hand to the pistolgrip switch we waited then on his left a dial glowed and a needle quivered during the next hour as boz and his team went to work the instruments came alive one by onethe first had been the powerlevel reading of the reactor boz told us at intervals of coming and going into the cockpit that the others were pressures velocity of steam flow monitoring checks then suddenly the cockpit was flooded with the bright glow of electric light trevordavis who had taken over again from one of the americans smiled up at us little bear began to vibrate as the steam built up to full pressure in the reactor i think well leave you to it peace told mkg and the team he glanced uneasily at the east and at the moon were wide wide open mac at peaces order used the engine to take us back quickly to the shore he seemed to have it in perfect running order the american team had to accompany us since the cockpit could only accommodate one man at a time peace adele mac and i jumped out on to the sand mkg and boz nodded goodbye all their thoughts were on little bear we walked slowly up to vingtcinq coups twelve hours to blastoff we sat against the coral wall of the hut waiting for the news from mauritius peaces eyes wandered frequently across the lagoon to the muted patch of light where little bear lay mauritius radio came through up to a few hours ago neither the person of marvin k green vicepresident of the united states nor the french freighter semittante had been located by the massive search conducted by the american seventh fleet tonight the eyes of the world are on the sea of limuria the focus of the search is now in the vicinity of the neighbouring isles of agalega and loveapple crossing american fliers report that both these places have been heavily hit by the recent cyclone peace stirred as the announcer went on in the wake of the air search are deployed no fewer than five carriers eighteen destroyers and nine nuclear submarines american longrange vp aircraft flying from british bases today combed a large area south of the seychelles group with negative results these aircraft are using secret equipment to detect submerged wrecks meanwhile in the united states the national space administration states that tomorrow is the most favourable day for a spaceshot in view of this carrierbased aircraft are flying roundtheclock missions in an attempt to stay what political observers in washington consider the most extraordinary episode in the long history of the united states presidency the bearing of the american people at this time of crisis is no less extraordinary since the news broke churches have been thronged special prayers have been said for the presidents recovery and the vicepresidents safety and normal activities in all major cities have almost ceased many shops are closed and only essential services are operating people have withdrawn indoors to the sanctuary of their homes except in washington where crowds have gathered outside the white house in silent vigil while the battle for the presidents life goes on a curious silence has fallen on the nation in new york peace leaned forward and clicked off the set for a long time there was no sound but the wash of the sea in the soft tropical night you have all this to account for if things go wrong i said peace jumped to his feet they must not find little bear seven hours later they had not located little bear mkg had returned in the cutter within an hour after a broken night andre had fetched us as a thin line started to show pearlygrey in the east now we were back at the mis sile peace had stood up in the cutter as we crossed the lagoon trying to probe the lightening skies they were empty boz and his team were weary but triumphant shes fine every damn thing just jimdandy he told mkg shes hot to trot by contrast with his previous mood mkg was lighthearted boyish almost now that the spaceshot was at hand he glanced down into the softly vibrating cockpit lets get her to the launchpoint shall wegot it fixed john just one more starsight i said holding my sextant he doesnt need a sextant peace said he could do it blindfold i took my sight and was satisfied there was nothing to keep us in the lagoon longer mkg looked thoughtfully at the long missile just pray that at the jesus moment she hasnt got a hot bottom boz stiffened hot bottom adele looked startled mkg gestured with one hand shes never been flight testedtoo much heat causes the tail to fall apart if that happens shell wriggle across the sky like a bellydancer goodbye mr vicepresident she shivered and he put an arm round her boz said quickly doesnt often happen any more the cermets boys have seen to that just an outside chance andre brought the cutter close to the nosecone while i fended her off with a rough oar boz hitched a rope into the nosetowing wire and mac eased open the throttle andre gestured to me and we slipped our oars into the crude rowlocks we heaved little bear moved gathered way in the smooth water as peace gunned the engine little bear followed as easily and tamely as a welltrained dog i could feel the pulse of her machinery along the towrope five oclock we cleared the lagoon entrance and i gave peace a course into the eye of the soft morning fivethirty boz brought the silver spacesuit which he had unpacked during the night and helped mkg into it as we moved along he laid the silver helmet on the thwartstark futuristic against the weatherstained wood the dawn light glowed on its goldplated visor which would guard mkgs face against the sun the cutter chugged on six oclock three hours to launch try the radio peace told adele the navy wavelength said loveapple crossing involuntarily peace jerked the throttle there was nothing more he glanced skywards and said harshly keep it going adele the minute dragged the engine throbbed loveapple crossing had almost submerged its low length into the sea barely two short miles behind we had about half a mile to go to the launchingpoint the radio said willowtrack to all red and blue huk subs x report your positions to me x sixthirty the voice went on my position grid e approximately miles due south of loveapple crossing x course zerozerofive true x speed knots rigged for utraquiet x my god exclaimed peace i explained to the tense team tyler was miles away making straight at us coasting along with all his listening apparatus and radar going at knots he would be on us in three hours if he received an inkling of where we were he could reach us in an hour at maximum speed if he chose i gave peace an alteration of course boz and the team screwed up their eyes against the sun scanning the horizon to the south not speaking the light reflected off mkgs spacesuit seven oclock stop i ordered we were in position ill flood her down at once boz said mkg theres no point in staying up in one hour i shall start the sequencer shall we synchronize watches the simple action had all the excitement of a war mission little bear with its tapered stern lay like a giant ray in the water boz picked up the helmet pacg stopped him for a moment and surveyed the soft scene the sea the low isle in the distance he looked from one to another of us my secret thundered like st brandon surf against my braini had to tell him i glanced round mac alone of us was sitting cigarette in mouth his hand half under the stern thwart where he kept the remington he looked like a snake about to strike i felt peaces hand grip my elbow like steel mkg waved at little bear and the sky this will bring out that great untested source of power in the american people which lincoln saw over a century ago he said it has been given to me to be the bearer of that sacred mission lincoln whispered adele president lincoln mkg did not seem to hear the strange timbre laced his words there are no goodbyes in this adele say also to andre he paused then impulsively took the old fishermans arm in andres own peculiar grip and shook it tears ran down the mahogany cheeks and he said something brokenly to adele adele her voice thick with emotion said god be with you come back to limuria boz held out the helmet to mkg mkg looked quickly in a pocket and brought out a small bible as if to reassure himself the scene had a curious unreal airlike a condemned cell where all normal activity goes on around in a highly abnormal context once the helmet was on we knew mkgs voice would become a metallic counterfeit mkg moved forward to boz and ducked a little boz lifted on the helmet and gave it a halfturn boz and the texan helped him ungainly now through the missiles hatchway he eased himself in and dogged it closed mkg was utterly alone there was a burp of water at the stern as the ballast pumps started the missile tilted its nose at an angle then it sank upright to about twothirds of its length boz and the scientists nodded approval mkg sat in his capsule about feet above us i think it must have been the bright flash of sunlight on the perspex which brought the frigatebird down to investigate i heard the swift rush of wings like lightning peace snatched an oar and struck the magnificent bird it fell stunned into the water little bear on hand signals from boz to mkg sank lower until it was the height of a man out of the water with a quick glance at andre peace grabbed the bird little bear was headhigh mkg looked out at usgrave a slight smile in the deepset eyes peace snatched the axe from the bottomboards and struck off the great birds head boz and his team gaped in astonishment peace leaned out holding the twitching stump steadying himself against the smooth whiteness of the missile casing with the bloodied neck peace made the sign of the cross on it adele gave a gasp there was a startled outburst from andre boz gave a quick signal to mkg i heard the rapid whirr of the ballast pumps mkg raised a gloved hand and gave the thumbsup sign his eyes fixed on us all the capsuleshield sank to gunwalelevel adele translated andre automatically the strange ship has a life now another signal the pumps whirred i looked down into mkgs strong face was he already president of the united states the eyes went for the last time slowly from peace to me to boz to each member of the team to adele momentarily to mac and finally to adele boz raised his clenched fist as a signal mkg reached out for a switch the capsule vanished i do not know how long we all stood numbed trying to follow the missile into the depths adele wept peace held the headless bird the sea was empty except for the tiny cutter only at firingdepth would mkg send up the marker buoy with its radio antenna boz said at last commander we must get at least half a mile awayprobably a bit farther is better seventhirty lets wait for the buoy i said no time replied boz we must get clear rather than create sound by using the engine peace had andre raise the lateen sail and we glided across the still sea the sole marker off little bear was a group of frigatebirds tearing at their dead companion andre dropped the sail at peaces command the buoy where was the buoy adele explained to andre whose seasight was keenest we waited suddenly andre exclaimed the bright orange marker with its radio antenna plopped out of the sea boz slipped on one of the double rubberpadded headphones of the vu set and fiddled with the dials the other scientists busied themselves with the datico gear ill repeat everything mkg says said boz peace turned to adele his voice strained keep the radio going all the time check tyler his words were drowned the big vp swept over us at wavetop height the thunder of its four great engines momentarily blanked out the radio it came so low that i could see the massive search radar dome the pilot and the copilot in their seats it was still in arctic paint broad orange stripes against the black hull the voice on the radio was vibrant with excitement vp

was like iron he knelt next to boz and said into his chest microphone speaker mkg for christs sake theres a vp overhead theyve picked up this transmission tylers comingcant you cut it short boz pushed him away as the headphone crackled dice commander the countdown routine is fixed one hour no less ill start mkg in a couple of minutes tyler repeated peace his words were drowned as the big plane thundered overhead again banking slowly over little bears marker baker charley sugar to willowtrack x strong radio emis sions x reports countdown will begin in a few minutes x willowtrack came back all red and blue force aircraft helos cowboys and subs vectored to your area x what duration is countdown the fact that willowtrack was replying meant she was either on the surface or running partially submerged with her radio mast up which would make her slower than full speed deep down the thought of that streamlined hull tearing through the water towards us forced my eyes to the south the horizon was empty boz said sharply sequencer start i repeat sequencer start the headphone crackled t minus sixty and counting mkg had begun the countdown one whole hour until boz pressed the firing button baker charley sugar to willowtrack x countdown has begun x voice says t minus x after what seemed hours boz repeated mkg in a f at voice t minus fifty all systems go willowtrack to baker

of his rubber divingsuit boz and the americans sat like statues peace glanced across at me without speaking i read his thought yards nearly miles when tyler started to echorange we would know exactly how close he was t minus forty willowtrack to baker charley sugar x who is in the boat the big plane swung round inspected us the minutes were agonizing baker charley sugar to willowtrack x eyeball check shows nine men and one woman x radio apparatus and two antennalike portables x t minus thirty half an hour to go my palms were clammy adele spoke softly in creole as if to herself i think she was praying andre said something and she turned to me her eyes tearbright andre says the ship down in the sea has its life from the frigatebird it will fly how close was willowtrack i did a rapid mental calculation being partially instead of fully submerged tyler would not be getting willowtracks full knots say nowover miles an hour if i were correct he would start echoranging in roughly another minutes willowtrack would then be miles from her target minus twentyfive willowtrack to baker charley sugar x drop following message to boat by streamer x tyler to commander peace x request with all fervour at my command you call off launch x please convey this to the president of the united states x president boz spun on peace staring incredulously with the speed of a cobra striking peace leaned forward and plucked the headphones from bozs ears the colt with the hocked hammer was in his hand as he did so he jerked his head to mac he was so quick with the remington that i did not see him reach under the sternsheets for it he stood balancing himself with one foot on the thwart the wicked muzzle covering the boat peace held the speaker against him so that mkg could not hear yes he said slowly including all the americans with boz in his reply the president had a severe stroke shortly before we ditched semittante he wasnt expected to live you knew and you let mkg carry on with this boz looked stunned pete allingham his face livid with anger started to get to his feet but mac waved him down yes said peace little bear goes not while im here to stop it snapped pete mac raised the remington and pointed it square at the texans chest i wouldnt try to allingham peace said grimly hes been itching for days to try it out on john and adele jesus christ burst out boz you knew too they knew but they werent with me replied peace i want you to remember that boz if you have to turn me in to tyler before the blastoff blastoff echoed pete youre gonna let mkg go without knowing yes peace nodded grimly what sort of effect would it have on him to tell him now no yelled boz wildly you cant commander its too bigsit down snarled peace waving the colt the headphone crackled and peace put it on drawing to one side to give mac a clean line of fire t minus twenty the vp engines thundered over us a streamer with a weight attached fell into the sea a few yards from the cutter andre fished it out and handed it to peace peace repeated mkg t minus eighteen and counting all systems go his eyes never left boz and allingham the message began boz the headphone crackled and peace

foam at the base i saw the bite of red flame as little bears motor kicked in the missile jerked upright i turned to speak to adele but my voice was drowned in the earstunning thunder of the explosion
