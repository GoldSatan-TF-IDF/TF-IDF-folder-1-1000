carol oconnell dead famous aka the jury must die the seventh book in the kathleen mallory series this book is dedicated to the walking wounded in and out of uniform all around the town and to those who came from far away to help us though new york city is the prime character in my novels the event of september does not appear in these pages not even in passing no mention at all there will be readers who find that odd for it changed the very landscape but one does not have to draw a tragedy literally in order to draw from it some new yorkers still stop and raise their eyes to the sound of overhead planes but then they move on down the sidewalk life goes on its a very tough town unbreakable acknowledgments many thanks to dianne burke researcher extraordinaire for her wideranging technical support bill lambert arizona firearms aficionado richard hughes for valuable insight on a psychological disorder radio station personnel from coast to coast the chelsea hotel the fbi firearms tactical institute and special thanks to the federal bureau of investigation for being good sports they never sent me hate mail for things done to them in previous novels this time in an effort to be evenhanded i have also taken broad shots at the news media and the american civil liberties union as a cardcarrying member of the aclu i would be proud to receive their hate mail however i believe they are equally blase in the area of satirical pounding prologue johanna could hear cats paws madly thudding on the bathroom door and the animal was crying in a human way so frightened or was he merely hungry she had fed the poor beast but how long ago no matter the cats cries receded as though her front room had decamped from the hotel suite floating up and away with utter disregard for gravity and time what was that to her the whole day long johanna had not moved from her perch at the edge of a wooden chair she sat there wrapped in a bathrobe as the sun moved behind the window glass as shadows crawled about the room with a slow progress that only a paranoid eye could follow one of the shadows belonged to herself and the dark silhouette of her body was dragged across the wallpaper inch by inch extending her deformity to a cruel extreme inside her brain was the refrain of a rocknroll song from another era gimme shelter the rolling stones sang to her and she resisted this mantra as she always did for there were no safe places perhaps another hour had passed maybe three she could not say when night had fallen johanna unclenched her hands and looked down at a crumpled letter as if in absolute darkness she could read the words of a postscript only a monster can play this game chapter the black van had no helpful lettering on the side to tell the neighbors what business it was about on this november afternoon here and there along the street of tall brownstones drapes had parted and curious eyes were locked upon the vehicles driver even by new york city standards she was an odd one johanna apollos skin was very fair the gift of swedes on her mothers side and yet from any distance she might be taken for a large dark spider clad in denim as she climbed out of the van then dropped to the pavement in a crouch dark brown was the color of her leather gloves her work boots and the long strands of hair spread back across the unnatural curve of her spine her torso was bent forward her body forever fused into a subtle question mark as her face angled toward the ground hidden from the watchers at their windows they never saw the great dark eyes the beauty of the beast and now the neighbors heads turned in unison following her progress down the street dry yellow leaves cartwheeled and crackled alongside as she walked with a delicacy of slender spiderlong legs such deep grace for one so misshapen that was how the neighbors would recall this moment later in the day it was almost a dance they would say and none of them noticed the small tan car gliding into eightyfourth street quiet as a swimming shark it stopped near the corner where another vehicle had just taken the last available parking space the young driver of the tan sedan left her engine idling as she stepped out in the middle of the street nothing about her said civil servant the customtailored lines of her designer jeans and long black leather coat said money and the wildly expensive running shoes allowed her to move in silence as she padded toward a station wagon she leaned down and rapped on the drivers window the pudgy man behind the wheel gave her the grin of a lottery winner for she was that lovely that ilk of tall blondes who would never go out with him in a million years and he hurried to roll down the window oh happy day i want your parking place she said all business no smile of hello nothing the wagon drivers grin wobbled a bit was this a joke no man would give up a parking space on any street in manhattan not ever not even for a naked woman was she nuts he summoned up his new yorker attitude saying yeah lady over my dead body and she raised one eyebrow to indicate that this might be an option the long slants of her eyes were unnaturally green unnaturally cold a milkwhite hand rested on the door of his car long red fingernails tapping tapping ticking like a bomb and it occurred to him that those nails might be dangerous oh shit one hand had gone to her hip opening the blazer for just a tease a peek at what she had hidden in her shoulder holster a damn cannon that passed for a gun move she said and move he did kathy mallory had a detectives gold shield but she rarely used the badge to motivate civilians listening to angry tirades on abuse of police power was timeconsuming fear was more efficient and now she drove her tan car into the hastily vacated parking space after killing the engine she never even glanced at the black van it was her day off and this covert surveillance was the closest she could come to an idea of recreation the routine of the vans driver was predictable and mallory was settling in for a long wait when a large white lincoln with rental plates rounded the corner this motorist was less enterprising settling for doubleparking his car across the street from the vehicle that so interested mallory until now the driver of the rented car became her new target when he craned his neck to check the black vans plates his head was slowly turning eyes scanning the street until he located the deformed figure of johanna apollo walking down the sidewalk in the direction of columbus avenue mallory smiled for this man had just identified himself as another player in the mother of all games the company uniform was stowed in johanna apollos duffel bag along with the rest of her gear she never wore it when meeting the clients the moonsuit was far more unsettling than the sudden appearance of a hunchback at the door a man her own age late thirties awaited her on the front steps of a brownstone built in the nineteenth century he wore a flimsy robe over his pajamas and though his feet were bare he seemed not to mind the cold when johanna lifted her head to greet him his face was full of trepidation and then he nearly smiled she could read his mind he was thinking oh how normal so glad to see her conventional human face he adjusted his spectacles for a better look at her warm brown eyes and he took some comfort there even before she said ill be done in an hour and then you can have your life back that was all he wanted to hear relieved he sighed and nodded his understanding that there would be no small talk not one more chorus of im so sorry false notes in the mouth of a stranger johanna followed him into the house and through another door to his front room it was decorated with period furniture and smeared with the bloody handprints of an intruder she recognized the spots on the wall as a splatter pattern from the backstrike of a knife the chalk outline sketched on the rug was that of a small lean victim who had died quickly though her blood was spread thin all about the room giving the impression that the attack had gone on forever she wondered if anyone had told the husband that his wife had not suffered long johanna turned to the sorry man beside her it was her art to put disturbed people at ease she did it with tea you dont have to stay and watch why not wait in the kitchen she pulled a small packet of herbal tea from the pocket of her denim jacket this is very soothing the client took the packet and stared at it as though the printed instructions for steeping in hot water might be difficult to comprehend he waved one hand in apology to say that he was somewhat at sea today my wife usually handles these suddenly appalled he lowered his head his wife had usually handled the messes of their lives how could he have forgotten that she was dead his hands clenched tightly and johanna knew that he was silently berating himself for this bizarre breach of etiquette the murder was recent and she would have guessed that even without the paperwork to release the crime scene judging by the growth of stubble on the mans face only a few days had passed since his wifes death unshaven unwashed the widower walked about in a stale ether that the bereaved shared with the bedridden his head was still bowed as he edged away from her and ambled down a narrow passageway upon opening a door at the far end of this hall he raised his face in expectation perhaps believing that he would meet his dead wife in the kitchen and she would make him some tea johanna knelt on the floor and opened her duffel bag one hand passed over the hood and the respirator no need for them today she pulled out a protective suit and gloves for working with blood products in the age of aids even the blood of children nuns and other virgins her employer had given her the basic vocabulary of the job fluids and solids and hazardous waste though she had never seen the common debris of brains and shattered bone feces and urine as anything but human remains she had also been encouraged to remove photographs of the victim before she began and this was another trick to dehumanize the task but johanna never disturbed the wedding portrait on the wall and the bride with downcast eyes continued to shyly smile at the chalk outline of her own corpse johanna sponged the stains on the creamwhite wall and charted a thiefs progress around this room going from drawer to pulledout drawer she knew where he had been standing when a policeman had barreled through the door with a drawn gun the bullet had been pried out of the wall but the hole remained the thief must have had the knife in his hand and the officer must have been very young untried and nervous she filled the hole with a readymix plaster a small brush and a few deft strokes of tint made it blend into the paint below this patch were red drops of hazardous waste from a murderer he was wiped away with one wet rag and though no one would ever know she placed it in a separate bag so the blood of the innocent woman would not mingle with his next she replaced the contents spilled from the drawers then went on to the problem of a torn lampshade and resolved it with a bit of mending tape last she pulled out a hair dryer and moved it across the wet areas where she had spotcleaned the rug the couch and the drapes some of her services went beyond the job description but she wanted the widower to find no trace of murder no damp ghost of a stain that he might commit to memory no more than an hour had passed as promised and now the client inspected her work she watched his fearful eyes search the wall for the bullet hole but there was no sign of it anymore and by his wandering gaze she could tell that he had forgotten the exact location of that scar in the plaster and his wifes chalk silhouette on the floor the room seemed so normal as though no violence had ever taken place here and his wife had never died so said his brief smile as he wrote out a check four months ago in another city her first crime scene had required less work and she had been her own client on that unpaid job the armchair had absorbed most of the fbi agents blood and so it had been a simple matter of furniture disposal after mopping up the puddle on the floor and the red drops spattered on the wall in that room death had been a drawnout affair for timothy kidd had not struggled enough to spend all his blood at once and there had been ample time for him to be afraid however that event had occurred in a previous life lived by another version of herself though the dead man did remain with her as a constant presence a haunt and so it was neither odd nor coincidental to be thinking of timothy when she emerged from the building to find an unpleasant reminder of his death marvin argus was waiting for her on the sidewalk his trench coat flapped open in the wind exposing a dark gray suit with a sleptin look she guessed that he had taken the redeye flight from chicago to new york and there had been no time for a change of clothes after landing that or his fastidious grooming habits were deteriorating perhaps there had been some urgency in tracking her down today no that was not it argus had found time to carefully style his sparse brown hair so that no strand could escape the gelled fringe of bangs covering his receding hairline the effect was juvenile and so at odds with his fortyyearold face hello johanna he smiled to show her all of his perfect teeth acting as if this meeting might be a happy chance encounter and not an ambush not a defiance of the court order to keep him at a distance did he seem a little jittery just on the verge of a tic or a twitch she looked through him then passed him by on her way back to the black van he walked alongside her keeping his tone light fighting down all the high notes of runaway anxiety youre looking well still alive you mean and youre wondering why no seriously i think physical labor agrees with you he said but i suppose this new line of work is your idea of penance much could be read into that clumsy little barb perhaps some desperate situation coming to a head johannas bent posture had made her a student of footwear and now she gleaned more from his shoes than his words the black leather was as always fanatically shiny but both laces had been broken and repairs effected with knots the man was coming undone good she raised her face to his not bothering to hide her contempt you dont look well argus you seem a little shaky today under a lot of stress did that sound like a taunt like getting even she hoped so and youre losing weight he dismissed this with a wave of one hand saying long hours he drew back his shoulders in an effort to appear larger and less the nervous rabbit eyebrows arched he folded his arms to strike a condescending pose exuding an arrogance that invited every passerby to punch him in the face i met your boss today argus staged a pause we had a long talk about you really that was unlikely for riker was tight with his words and so she could surmise that this lie was an implied threat yes argus would want her to worry about what he might have shared with her employer she stared at him wondering how frightened are you that guy riker hes a heavy drinker isnt he yeah said argus couldnt help but notice you can tell by the eyes all those red veins he was still pressing what he believed was his advantage over her a few seconds of silence dragged by before he realized that she was not at all threatened and neither was she inclined to banal conversation the man looked up at the sky unwilling to meet her steady gaze anymore he tried to grill me on your background the old familiar pomposity was back in his voice i could tell riker was an excop by his interrogation style they never lose that do they on or off the job they can never have just a normal conversation i figure he doesnt know the first thing about you johanna that or you fed him some fairy tale and he knows it argus smiled awaiting praise for this insight failing in that he flicked imaginary lint from the sleeve of his coat of course i didnt tell him anything not who i was or what i so you lied to him you think riker didnt pick up on that she swung her body up into the drivers seat and slouched deep into worn upholstery that received the hump on her back like a cupped hand she faced the windshield marvin argus rushed his words does your boss know i told riker my history was none of his damn business she slammed the door and put the van in gear argus reached up and gripped the door handle as if that could prevent her from driving away he yelled to be heard through the rolledup window johanna about timothy did you believe him while he was still alive if the man had held on to the van another moment he would have lost his hand when she pulled into the street johanna pressed the accelerator pedal to the floor and sped toward the broad avenue at the end of the street she passed through a red light amid the screech and squeal of braking cars and a cabdrivers hollered obscenities marvin argus had grown smaller in her rearview mirror only insect high when she rounded the corner the young detective slouched down behind the wheel of her tan car and watched the black van speed away her eavesdropping device was picking up a clear conversation between the vans driver and the radio dispatcher for neds crime scene cleaners the vehicle was heading for the company parking lot in greenwich village mallory reached out for the small silver camera on her dashboard it contained a photographic record of the hunchbacks meeting with the driver of the white lincoln after downloading the new images into her laptop computer she admired the array on the glowing screen no public record had such clear likenesses of johanna apollo the blurry portrait on a chicago drivers license had been in mallorys view deliberately sabotaged by the subject who had moved in the moment the picture was taken a perusal of prep school and college yearbooks had been of no help either for the camerashy hunchback had always been absent on the days when school photographs were taken the last photograph was the best of the lot for the wind had swept the hair away from apollos body with one red fingernail mallory traced the outline of the hump that rode the womans back bending her spine and bowing her head this was the soft spot mallory smiled with a tap of keys her computer returned to another file and an official portrait of the man in the doubleparked lincoln not content with running the rental plate and billing for his car she had spent the past hour acquiring a dossier on the renter marvin argus from chicago who now smiled at her from the glowing screen his brow was fringed with ludicrous bangs but she did approve of the doublebreasted blazer and the tie argus was the solid connection that she had been waiting for living proof the detective closed her laptop and set it on the passenger seat where her partner used to ride riker had been a constant fixture in her life since she was ten years old but now he would not return her phone calls and he was never home to her when she came knocking on his door looking for a word with him alone but that would change when he read her report on the hunchback it mattered nothing to kathy mallory that this case belonged to federal investigators that it was well outside the purview of a new york city cop this was a national contest and anyone with the stomach for it could play the game on the radio five nights a week marvin argus slid behind the wheel of the white rental car and drove off detective mallorys vehicle eased up the street at a discreet distance then crept into the southbound stream of traffic on central park west following the man from the fbi rikers gray eyes were hooded always had been and his constant squint gave him the air of a man who was damn suspicious all the time mixed with this message was the attitude and posture of an easygoing soul and the total effect said to everyone i know youre lying but what the hell the man who ran neds crime scene cleaners was not named ned ned was his brother riker did have a first name and even a middle name detective sergeant though no one had called him by that moniker for the past six months not since acquiring the scars of four gunshot wounds he had spent most of his medical leave in charge of a glorified janitorial service his brother niece and sisterinlaw were away on an extended visit to the fatherland they had not intended to stay away so long but distant relations had held the small family hostage dragging them up and down the rhine in and out of german castles and other tourist traps poor ned riker had been placed in charge of the business and left to consider his brothers offer of a partnership he could not picture himself filling out the forms for his separation from nypd though this was common enough for cops at the age of fiftyfive his younger brother had left the force three years ago and maybe it was time to follow suit true or not he believed his hair had gone grayer since leaving the hospital and there was one more hint that the good years were gone his wounds hurt him each time it rained just like dads arthritis riker planted his elbows in the mess of papers that littered the desk causing the top layer to avalanche to the floor the office window gave him a view of gray bricks a sliver of sky and a parking lot enclosed by a chainlink fence a view of the future could he really do this job for a living at least he had been liberated from suits and ties that was something he wore the jeans and flannel shirt of a working man though he never traveled with the cleaning crews anymore his last time out with a new trainee he had nearly wrecked a van that was the day he had discovered his one remaining infirmity a sorry little secret that he had chosen not to share with his doctors most of his time was spent in the office where he was daily nibbled to death by forms federal state and local for the management of hazardous waste quarterly taxes payroll deductions and other mindnumbing bits of paper and all the while he listened to a police scanner on the pretext of noting addresses for sudden deaths and potential customers at midday he followed his brothers custom of buying lunch for homicide cops the real source of new business he had eaten two lunches today one in a brooklyn precinct and one in the bronx so he had missed the hunchback when she had reported for work and in another sense he simply missed jo when she was not around he walked to the front window called there by the sound of a dying muffler on the worst vehicle in the small fleet of three he leaned both hands on the sill and winced as the van limped into the parking lot on one soft tire more money out the window the woman he knew as josephine richards cut the engine and climbed out lady what long legs youve got those milelong gams were a subject of much discussion around the office on the day of her hire he had seen in her the makings of a vegas showgirl spliced with a carnival freak over the past four months he had become comfortable with her looks her face in particular it was saved from being ordinary by big brown eyes warm and velvety that held a mans attention oh and her mouth some might call it too wide too large he called it generous oddly enough of all the employees she was the easiest to look at and he would not be a complete man if he did not occasionally speculate about the legs beneath the blue jeans they strolled graceful and naked through his fantasy life at least once a day jo looked so tired as she crossed the lot bent forward eyes to the ground he could have made her workdays easier by giving her the lightest jobs but he never deferred to her handicap that would have ruined his new mythology of himself it was said that he was so mean only silver bullets could kill him conventional lead had failed every time and legend had it that during his seven hours of surgery the doctors had removed what passed for his heart a hard little knot of a thing mistaken for a wayward prune pit it was also rumored that he had once kicked jos cat clear across a room and he would have kicked the poor animal through a window but his aim was off that day riker had started these rumors himself and none had taken hold the employees insisted upon believing him to be a decent likeable sort a peg higher than a cat killer in truth he had only extended one hand to jos cat to stroke it he had taken no revenge for the savage mauling of claws that had followed this friendly overture and riker was a man of such sweet nature that he never failed to ask after the health of jos pet whenever the lady walked in the door as she did now he yelled is that fleabag shitforbrains cat of yours dead yet not yet jo called out from the reception room as she set off the buzzer beneath the floor mat a moment later she stood on the threshold of his private office saying mugs is just fine he shook his head to convey regret then settled into the chair behind his desk and hunted through the pile of papers i got a note here a name and a phone number some guy dropped by today a real flake and with only that description she said marvin argus i dont need the number she tossed a set of keys on the desk the van needs a new tire of course this was sarcasm they both knew that the van needed a whole new van she signed her name in the logbook then checked her watch before adding the time fivethirty and handed him two checks totaling an even thousand dollars not bad jo for less than half a day you can put in more time if you want dont start her eyes were fixed on a clipboard as she made note of all the supplies she had used and the containers of hazardous waste to be disposed of bent over her paperwork this way she seemed almost normal and he half expected her to straighten up at any moment hey jo just try it out for a week or so whats the harm she met his eyes and wordlessly told him im tired of discussing this okay aloud she said i dont need more hours the lady only worked on murder scenes she had no interest in cleaning up the debris of landlords whose tenants had died of natural causes leaving a stinking mess beyond the sensibilities of ordinary cleaning services early on he had wondered about this womans penchant for murder forays into her mindset had always proven fruitless and he could not shake the idea that jo had racked up many hours in interviews with other cops he also wondered why she paid extravagant rates to live in a hotel instead of finding some cheaper more permanent address it would have been an hours work to run a background check but where was the fun in that stay awhile he smiled and gestured toward the chair beside his desk whenever jo sat down with him at the end of a day he always had the sense of some ritual examination taking place he could swear that her brown eyes were looking deep inside of him visually probing his innards body and brain just checking to see that everything was where it ought to be and working well and now came her brief smile that pronounced him aokay he felt so safe in jos eyes when she was not scheduled to work the structure of his day collapsed she leaned forward in the chair arms braced on her thighs in this posture she seemed not at all deformed merely tired jos head tilted to one side suddenly wary of riker as he reached into a drawer and brought out the good stuff a bottle of cheap bourbon instead of the usual beer cans she also seemed suspicious of the clean coffee cups a rarity so late in the day for miss byrd the receptionist and dishwasher only worked mornings oh and now the piece de resistance goat cheese outside of work all they had in common was this weird cheese addiction inherited from nordic mothers and with these offerings he telegraphed a bribe in the making given any more thought to that radio show he handed her a cup and waited out the silence many times she had declined the offer to plug his brothers business on the hottest radio program in america riker had actually given up on this giftfromgod advertising but the request from the star of shock radio had raised some interesting questions i know this guy zacharys got a real smart mouth now i could probably never hold my own in an interview with him he widened his smile but youre smarter than me was she buying this flattery no she merely took this as an obvious statement of fact and it was he poured a shot of liquor into her cup all you gotta do is mention the name of the company three times then hit the road what could be easier he opened the package of cheese and pushed it across the desk all for her was there a more generous boss in the entire no johanna sliced off a hunk of cheese with the letter opener that passed for a paring knife after hours get someone else to do it i tried i told the producer i got five guys with more experience then ian zachary phones me himself says he only wants you i call that odd it could not be the novelty of a hunchback that so enticed the talkshow host this was radio not television the guy wants a woman crimescene cleaner but he hasnt tried any competitors yet and theyve got more broads than we do me i never heard the guys act you ever tune into his show every night she said it surprised him that she would admit to being a shockradio listener but then he had always suspected her of being dead honest at core even though he was ninetynine percent sure that she had lied on her job application but this only enhanced the ongoing mystery of jo it was a little taste of police work the job the only one that had ever mattered a chill breeze of outside air ruffled the papers on the desk every muscle in rikers body tensed and his hand went to that place where he had once carried a shoulder holster the feeling of cold panic was not unreasonable not this time for the intruder in the next room had nearly stepped over the doormat avoiding the concealed buzzer that loudly announced each exit and entry paranoia was a contagious thing jo was also staring at the office door kathy mallory appeared on the threshold the young detective wore a long black duster in the best tradition of the old west a gunslinger with a subscription to vogue magazine you spooky kid riker smiled always glad to see his partner on these rare occasions when she stopped by to discover that they had nothing to say to one another anymore he had missed her so much and he wished that she would never come back again poor jo was startled into spilling her drink stunning mallory straight and tall always had an adverse effect on her by luck or design his partner only visited when jo was in the office and that was a pity it was almost an assault to put mallory in the same room with her jo rose from the chair making exit apologies with her mouth full of goat cheese not wanting to spend one more second in the younger womans company perhaps it was the way mallory looked at her with the eye of a predator that had not fed recently when the office door had been softly shut mallory waited a beat until she heard the buzzer and then the close of the outer door she turned on riker hey kathy his greeting was met with a cold glare to remind him of the rules it was always mallory now and never kathy anymore not since she had joined nypd as if he could throw away all of her puppy days watching kathy grow though his old friends foster daughter had never been a real child not in terms of innocence after a little girl had lived on the streets awhile homeless and eating her dinner from trash cans childhood was over but riker had done his small part to make certain that she never went hungry again he had a favorite memory of taking kathy to a baseball game when she was eleven years old he had bought her enough hot dogs and soda to bring on projectile vomit food was love in that same spirit he pushed the remaining goat cheese in her direction it was all that he had to offer her these days mallory he said hungry she leaned over his desk to drop a computer spitout on top of his mountain of bills and forms time sheets and invoices without even glancing at her offering he guessed that she had made good on a threat and this was the background check on jo her name isnt josephine richards said mallory thats an alias yeah yeah big surprise riker picked up the sheet and without reading it he wadded it into a ball you mightve noticed he dropped it into a wastebasket i dont need any more paper today but thanks anyway she glared at the pile on his desk and the other pile that had slopped to the floor all the paperwork that was burying him alive he could see that she was longing to create order out of the chaos to align every sheet and envelope every paper clip and pencil at right angles mallory was freakish about neatness and that was her most benign personality trait with a slow shift of strategy she settled into a chair her head rolled to one side eyes closing to languid slits of green calm and drowsy riker had seen jos cat do this and he knew it was a trick to lull him into a false idea that he was safe from attack you havent been reading your personal mail she said i bet youre wondering how i know that riker did not like to repeat himself so this time he only waved one hand to say yeah yeah letters from one police plaza had been stacking up unopened in his new soho apartment for months he could guess that most of them required his immediate attention one clue was a slew of stamped messages on the outside of last months envelopes words in red ink and capital letters open immediately the heaviest one had been pushed under his door and it had borne a more expansive wording in mallorys machineperfect penmanship open this immediately you bastard well im not much of a reader he said havent touched a newspaper in six months riker preferred to spend his time cocooning in the company of a quiet bartender but i do open some of my mail he held up both hands see paper cuts this was what came of handling dangerous utility bills in the evening hours after the lights had been turned off for nonpayment due to apathy his partner was not amused and he could hardly blame her the young cop deserved a better explanation for her abandonment regardless of the circumstances she took every desertion so personally she had yet to forgive her foster parents for dying helen markowitz had been wheeled away into surgery then returned to her family as a corpse unfair and lou markowitz rikers oldest friend had died in the line of duty kathy mallory was not about to stand for any more defections your leave time expired her voice was a bit testy and this was akin to jos cat switching its tail you never showed up for the physical or the psych evaluation and that was an accusation they ran you out of the department on a medical discharge she leaned forward a prelude to a lunge if youd bothered to open your damn mail youd know that they pensioned you off she slammed her hand on the desk and sent papers flying to the floor is that what you wanted riker shrugged as if this meant nothing it meant the world to him she held up an envelope and by its thickness he guessed it was a twin to the one on his kitchen table at home this is the form to appeal your discharge ive got lieutenant coffeys signature now i need yours after pulling out the sheets and unfolding them she pointed to a red x solarge that he could find his signature line without the bifocals he never wore in public mallory had often pointed out to him that his refusal to wear eyeglasses was an absurd vanity in a man with a shabby wardrobe scruffy shoes and a bad haircut and she had also meant well on that occasion she handed the heavy document across the desk sign it she said to him ordered him then ill set up new dates for your exams he could not even touch it ill read the form tonight okay no that was obviously not okay but she let the bundle of sheets fall from her hand to the desk then leaned down to retrieve the crumpled ball he had tossed in the wastebasket now back to your hunchback johanna apollo so that was the ladys real name mallory tossed the wadded paper at him and he caught it in one hand was she testing his reflexes wondering if he could pass the police physical or had she guessed that he was most afraid of the psychiatric test are you listening to me yeah i hear you he said she rose from her chair braced both hands on the edge of the desk and stared him down settling for no less than his complete attention but you never listen to the radio do you riker chapter johanna apollos eyes were downcast as she crossed the avenue moving toward the italianate row houses along st lukes place she lacked a hunchbacks gooseneck aspect for she rarely raised her head to cope with the curious faces of strangers instead she studied their feet and based solely upon the science of shoes made personal judgments on her more upright fellowman a cab stopped up ahead and the trendy loafers of a soulless yuppie stepped out onto the pavement to cross paths with the dusty work boots of a bluecollar man who could not afford the rents in this greenwich village neighborhood in her previous life johanna had often mused that she should have cultivated foot fetishists for they would have had more to talk about behind her she heard the hesitation steps of clicking high heels some woman in a pedestrian dilemma of political correctness how to get past the cripple on a sidewalk made narrower by lines of garbage cans impatience won out and the shoes of an office girl walked abreast of her hurrying to pass the leisurely hunchback without raising her head johanna knew the girl would be young these were the dangerous spiked heels of an onthejob man hunter seeking fun or rescue in that other sex the shoe design was flirty and flimsy not made for the dead run at a moments notice like now two rats slithered out of a mound of trash bags torn open by sharp little teeth the office girls feet turned skittish skipping to the side followed by a sudden breathy surprise when she collided with a garbage pail and knocked it over turn at the corner said johanna raising her eyes to the younger womans face the vermin arent your worst problem she pointed toward the ragged man standing in the center of the sidewalk on the next block and now that the beggar had an audience his arms raised slowly then flapped up and down in the manner of demented pump handles bunny was what he called himself but johanna knew him by all his street names bum fool and you crazy son of a bitch he was waiting for his tribute money but first a little fun another fright night the office girl obediently turned at the corner to take another route to the subway station johanna did not as she closed the distance between herself and the homeless man she raised her face once more and sighed resigned to the trial ahead behind a fringe of matted hair was the pug nose of a boy and a grin that insisted on innocence bunnys face belied the adage that the homeless life aged people well beyond their years though he was in his thirties she always saw him as a child closer now johanna stared at one blackened ankle it was too late to save his foot soon the skin would slough away and he would die from massive infection ah but his shoes said more the cold wind leaking in life leaking out tired leather parting with the sole and showing a peek at sockless gangrenous toes by the shoes alone she knew that he had been defeated in two great themes of the ancient greeks man against nature and man against himself he stank of disease and soiled underwear bunnys hand struck out and batted the air an inch from her face she had dodged the first shot and neatly evaded the second yet she was falling her feet slipsliding on marbles that crashed to the sidewalk from bunnys outstretched hand she hit the ground and felt the searing pain of her elbow smashing into cement the agitated man stood over her waving his arms though this was hardly frightening his hands were arthritic claws after too many winters without the protection of gloves he could barely make a fist and any damage he might do unto others would hurt bunny more nevertheless she raised her hands in surrender ive got money she said and these ritual words appeased him as they always did she rose to her feet careful to avoid the other marbles around her work boots and now she must keep bunny still or he might fall and break a bone such an injury could mean death for a man in his shape and circumstance she handed him the same tendollar toll she paid each time they met well bunny you learned a new trick tonight the marbles that was very smart he had finally found a means to keep people from running away at the first sign of madness but she knew this trick was well beyond his reasoning ability it was also a bad joke the cliche of lost marbles lost mind and whose sick bit of humor was this had some neighborhood child taught him the new stunt it hardly mattered he would forget it in a few hours time shortterm memory also had a way of outrunning bunny youre quick thats what he says bunny tapped his head in a knowing way and made a sly face as he looked down at the fallen marbles he gave me those says i gotta play it smart to catch oh oh ooooh he laughed and shifted his weight from foot to foot in a bob and a weave so excited i got a message for you his eyes closed and his teeth clenched in fierce concentration and now he had it and his eyes opened wide its a message from timothy kidd he says its real cold in hell and aint that a surprise johannas mouth rounded in a silent no where did you hear that name was there a siren of alarm in her voice yes but it was well beyond the pitch of bunnys impaired perception he had no empathy with the fears of others tell me where did you hear that name bunny kept tapping his skull in here he lives with me it was useless to pursue this little horror impossible to distinguish between bunnys real and imagined people though she knew the messenger was a living human being someone who had spent a great deal of time with the homeless man only constant repetition over days and days would have made that sentence remain in his mind it was so crowded in bunnys head where so many people talked to him all the time johanna pulled a newspaper from one of the trash cans and used it to sweep the marbles off the sidewalk so he would not trip and hurt himself should she call the police and tell them what from nypds point of view it was the rest of the citizenry who needed protection from bunny she shook her head giving up on the idea of asking them to look after the homeless man from now on she would take a different route home from work and perhaps that would keep bunny from harm as the last marble rolled off the curb her injured elbow throbbed with pain and this was only the first leg of her gauntlet there was still the cat to deal with at the other end of her odyssey at the west fourth street station she boarded a subway car crammed with passengers who made space to accommodate her johanna was that rare straphanger who was offered a seat by men women and most humiliating children during the short ride home she observed the egalitarian meeting of the citys shoes real leather and faux sneakers and oxfords out of the subway tired and sore she made her way down twentythird street heading toward her hotel the chelsea was a bastard castle victorian and gothic striped with long rows of wroughtiron balconies and crowned on the twelfth floor with tall chimneys and dormer windows set into a pitched gray roof all told the redbrick giant had two hundred windows overlooking the street it was not the tallest building in this neighborhood of lesser architecture but certainly the grandest grandeur ended as johanna passed through the front door the lobby was rimmed with nineteensixties track lights surrounding the crystal chandelier of a more distant period and the statue of a fat pink girl perched upon a swing was also suspended from the high ceiling abstract pieces of sculpture sat on the marble floor beside contemporary and antique furniture and the walls were covered with the large canvases of an everchanging art show the eclecticism was so extreme that nothing not a live elephant nothing would seem out of place here and then there were the tenants permanent and transient the chelsea was a haven for certifiable creative types artists and the like and proudly advertised itself as haunted by a history of suicide and murder in the past four months of residence johanna had encountered no earthbound spirits other than the ghosts she had checked in with ten of them including timothy kidd she crossed the dark carpet eyes fixed on a parade of luggage on wheels and the outoftown shoes of visitors only one pair was familiar spitshine black and memorable for the broken laces and the knotty repairs they were ten steps in front of her when she raised her head to see the fbi agent marvin argus approach the front desk johanna waved at the clerk begging him in dumb show not to give her away as she rounded the corner and pushed the elevator button the door slid open and she slipped inside moving through the chelsea in any direction was like a trip through time and other places she rode upward in a small box with midcentury gas station decor its doors opened onto the seventhfloor foyer and an ornate staircase from her exchangestudent days in paris turning left she opened a fire door of wood and glass and passed into a silent corridor leading to her rear apartment and its tall windows with southern plantation shutters the last skirmish of the day lay before her as she fitted a key into her lock the moment she cracked the door open a white furry paw appeared claws extended and swatting air so anxious to get at all comers and rake them till they bled johanna lived with new york citys only attack cat she guessed that her apartment had been cleaned late in the day for mugs was still angry and up for a fight the formidable hotel maid always came armed with a water pistol to keep the cat at bay johanna had no such defenses only denim jeans to protect her legs from the needlesharp claws she edged past the animal mugs followed her down the short hallway to the spacious front room with an armchair in front of the fireplace so inviting but before she even removed her coat she quickly entered the kitchen the cat would be hungry and food would buy her a small respite from his attentions on the days when she was feeling fragile mugs was locked in a bathroom but most of the time he roamed free rubbing up against her legs purring then clawing her when he felt the agony of close association a nerve along the cats spine had been damaged long before she found him and any physical contact caused him excruciating pain yet mugs came looking for love each time she walked into a room while he was distracted by his bowl of gourmet cat food she inspected the doors to a maple armoire one of the few pieces of custommade furniture that she had brought with her from chicago the cat hair in the lock opening had not been disturbed in her absence she inserted the key and the paneled doors opened to rows of shelves cubbyholes and a desktop littered with newspaper clippings on the men and women who had died in fear and violence and those who were still in the game her journal lay open to a blank page and she penned a few lines about bunnys message from the late timothy kidd then she tidied up the desktop sorting papers for the jurors who had survived material on the dead was consigned to the drawers below the desktop and timothy had a drawer all to himself she was so in tune with him tonight almost paranoid enough johanna slowly revolved taking in the entire room everything was in neat order no objects added or taken away no obvious signs of trespass the only disturbance was a pile of mail knocked to the floor and she credited this to the cats revenge on the maid and her water pistol all was as it should be but she could never lose the sense of something tall and wobbly teetering on the verge of a crash even within the perfect silence of these thick walls peace was a rare thing she lived every day in a heightened state of readiness waiting mugs padded away from his empty bowl and paused to stretch on the way to his basket where he completed three turns on a red pillow never fewer never more then curled up for a postprandial nap his eyes closed on an expression of sweetness which lured strangers into the deception that he could be petted and stroked johanna lay back in a reclining chair drymouthing pain pills and watching the evening news on television all the major networks had developed the macabre murder spree into a miniseries format replete with original theme music for the reapers segment the serial killer not trusting his name and fame to the vagaries of tabloid reporters had christened himself with the crude sketch of a scythe drawn in blood on the walls of every crime scene it was also his habit to write the score in blood keeping the tally of murdered jurors current his last message had figured nine down and three to go said the smiling broadcaster on the screen his guest for the evening was a retired federal judge railing against the incompetence of the fbi to stop this assault on the american judicial system if we cannot guarantee the safety of every juror then the law becomes impotent the broadcaster listened with mock sympathy then broke in on the judges tirade to complain that its been nearly a month since the last murder and his story was getting stale tonights program gave johanna no new information it was rather like a tired rerun repeating old encounters with the bereaved friends and families of the dead some of these people had become inadvertent players giving up clues to the whereabouts of runaway jurors and others had taken money for this information several family members had settled for fame as payment becoming media personalities over the past six months always good for an interview on a slow news day johanna closed her tired eyes for a brief nap one of the most underrated luxuries of life soon she would be delivered from angst and pain her concept of heaven was not a place of eternal peace but a small window in time a few tranquil moments between consciousness and sleep blessed sleep mallorys present was tucked under one arm as riker strolled past the old mens social club a small gathering that convened in neds parking lot every night four old fellows with their folding chairs sat in a circle with a jug of wine to fortify them against the cold air they nodded to him in passing then turned up the volume of a portable radio and rocked their chair legs to a spanish rhythm rikers feet weighed less and less then nothing at all walking him back to a warmer season the summer of his seventeenth birthday he had left his fathers house and run two thousand miles he had made it all the way to mexico past the tourist traps of the borderland and farther south along roads that had no names or signposts only piles of sand to trap the rusty old volkswagen van he had bought the vehicle for next to nothing a necessary expense in those days he would go nowhere without the giant amplifiers for his electric guitar every ten miles he had climbed out of the van to dig his bald tires out of foreign sand every ten miles all the way to cholla bay he had found that place under a sky of a billion brilliant stars until that moment he had not known that they were up there for the stars of city skies had been stingy and few by the close of that summer the brooklyn boy barefoot and sun brown had learned some new words and another kind of music that went into his blood swimming backward to the heart and lying there in wait for a day like today he had spent the best part of his life trying to forget that place or was it a time when he had been happy riker walked on in dreams of mexico knowing that he would never get back to cholla bay happiness had not been on his wish list when he had decided to become a cop could he ever make his way back to the police force the latin beat of the old mens social club was blocks behind him when he stopped to look up at the sky no stars he turned left instead of right taking a different route home one that would lead him by a bar where he could run a tab drink all night and clear his head of music it seemed that only seconds had passed before johanna apollo started awake mugss front paws were kneading her chest as he licked her face with a sandpaper tongue she looked past the cat to the clock on the mantelpiece so much time had been lost hours and hours she rose from her chair to switch off the television set and mugs was dumped from her lap to the floor deeply offended and tail held high he returned to his basket pillow johanna reached out to the radio by her chair and tuned in to the familiar voice of ian zachary the game master was recapping the lifeanddeath plight of twelve human beings the surviving jurors had fled from chicago where their verdict had been so unpopular that three of them had been put to death within the city limits the rest had peeled away from their government bodyguards after a fourth juror had died while under the protection of the fbi the fifth kill had occurred on an isolated farm in kansas other jurors had gone to hide among family in small towns and now only three of them remained alive and at large one of the shockjocks callers had sighted a live one hiding in san francisco but no contest prize had been awarded for lack of photographic evidence the game had strict rules whos next asked ian zachary called zack by his fans the englishmans voice was deepthroated and the tenor was seductive come on all my idiot children retard bastards every one of you talk to me daddy loves you riker unlocked the door to his apartment flicked on the light switch and stepped over the notes pushed under his door by wellwishers who could never find him at home or in his favorite cop bar he spent his evening hours supporting a different saloon in a neighborhood where he would not encounter detectives from special crimes unit one of the notes on his floor was an invitation in charles butlers handwriting his old friend and new landlord had not yet grasped the fact that riker preferred to drink his dinner alone ungrateful as that might seem this soho apartment was bigger than anything he could afford and charles had insisted on chopping off more than half the rent riker knew it was a better place than he deserved and so he compensated for this by turning every surface into a trash magnet his dirty laundry had been scattered to four corners and the ashtrays filled to overflowing he entered the generously proportioned sitdown kitchen a collection dump for his unopened mail he had no other use for this room except as an additional storage area for the empty chinese takeout containers pizza cartons crushed beer cans and bottles with one hand he swiped a pile of envelopes from the table then set down his gift from mallory a radio she had accurately guessed that his own had worn out and that this damage had gone unnoticed for years the television had also been broken or he had assumed as much since the screen had been cracked by a bullet the tv set had been left behind in his old apartment in brooklyn where he had lain bleeding and shaking hearing the distant scream of sirens and believing that he would die he believed it still though all the bloody holes in his body had been neatly closed and stitched he walked through the rooms turning on all the lights it was not yet midnight and there was still time to catch the last twenty minutes of ian zacharys program he returned to the kitchen and set up the antenna per mallorys advice for the best reception she had already tuned in the station for him and then distrustful brat she had fixed the position of the dial with tape contrary to her style of complex electronics this was a very simple appliance only a few knobs to work he could tell that a good deal of thought had gone into mallorys selection of this model she had wanted something that a drunk could easily operate plugging it in was a problem his hand wavered back and forth always missing the wall socket finally he rammed the plug home turned on the radio and recognized the voice of a transplanted englishman dabbling in american slang this was the man who had telephoned him six times to request an interview with jo no you imbecileyelled the talkshow host the reaper is not an escaped mental patient he only kills on the weekends that means hes a working stiff with a regular job and a leisuretime avocation of justice you mean murder this second voice revealed a genuine bronx pedigree im tellin you the guys a nutcase so i figure the reapers not crazy said ian zachary hes a man on a mission to cull the brain dead from the judicial system and you dont win any prizes for your damn opinion fool i want hard information facts and proof zachary tapped a button to cut off the caller then lowered his voice to speak to the wider audience all right this is my fault too many big words well review the rules one more time people while i go to the next commercial break get out your damn crayons so you can take notes he looked up at the window separating his dark studio from the welllit booth of his sound engineer the young woman behind the glass gave him a cutthroat signal to say he was off the air his eyes darted to the next booth window the one where the light never shone though he doubted that it was always empty his producer an abject coward had yet to show his face but that was not to say that the man did not occasionally look in on the radio show zachary used the reflective dark glass as a mirror and his fingers combed back unruly strands of long black hair to expose a widows peak this was a sign of the black arts in his grandmothers lexicon and his ears tapered down to the skin no lobes another granny omen that he would turn out badly yet he had evolved into god or god the son the station manager told him so every day when the man answered each telephone call with the words oh god its you oh jesus freaking christ but women liked him his full lips and a badboy smile promised the ladies a rollercoaster ride of a real bad time women were also attracted to the hazel eyes that changed color depending upon ambient light or his mood dark as bullet holes if he was angry greenish brown when he was merely sardonic and sunshine brought out the bits of blue though he was only awake in the daylight for staff meetings and pretaped interviews ian zachary had a preference for vampire hours and his skin tone bordered on prison pallor slouching deep in his chair lean and languid he propped his cowboy boots on the console his black shirt and jeans had designer chic and the tightness of a second skin he was that new creature cool goth a polar opposite was that lump of girl in the control booth she obviously cut her own hair over the bathroom sink and her shapeless clothes were more appropriate to the prairie town she hailed from this homely youngster with thick ankles and prissy thin lips was his new sound engineer call screener personal assistant and whipping girl zachary had chosen her from a lineup of less ugly mutts with more experience he had found her fragile personality appealing his new pet sat in her cage of glass and steel electronics and blinking ruby call buttons each red light represented a fool who actually believed he had a chance of getting on the air though only one would make the cut in the final segment on his own side of the window best described as a cave darkness was alleviated only by the glow of his control panel and the screen on his laptop computer in the next room his engineer sat shellshocked beneath fluorescent lights that faded her freckles and leached the healthy farmgirl glow from her skin after hours of being ridiculed on the air her eyes were no longer bright and gone was that smile of eagerness to do good on the first day of her brandnew job zachary checked the digital clock on his panel as it counted down the seconds before live air the commercial break was almost done babe all employees of both sexes were called babe what was the point of remembering names when so many did not last an entire shift prep the next caller well take the moron with the lisp she looked down at her phone board suddenly frightened and then she shook her head to tell him that the lisping callers light had gone dark zachary left his chair and crossed the room walking toward her window saying no babe dont tell me you lost that one ah but she had this incompetence was the downside of hiring the tender mental cases he returned to his panel to check the screen for the most overt flaws of callin fans okay babe well take the next one that guy who squeaks like a girl and if the next caller did not squeak as promised he was going to fire the engineer as a finale to the show he sat back in his chair glaring at her until she cued him to pick up line six the commercial interlude was over he hit the button for the next caller saying so youre randy from soho hi said a small reedy voice almost lost in the dark im waiting to talk to zack youre talking to me now you fool when you hear my voice that means youre on the air my idiot engineer never mentioned that he heard a sudden intake of breath then dead silence from the stagestruck randy of soho dont be afraid said zachary to the caller daddy loves you you useless twit whatve you got for me it better be damn good if youre as lame as the last one ill have to fire the little girl who screened you he imagined the callers sweaty hands worming round a telephone receiver thats right you geek her job is hanging on you randy still there sport yes i hear you breathing and now for the listening pleasure of my audience ill describe my engineers reaction to her impending redundancy while we all do a slow countdown from ten if randy cant get his little dick up in time to save her shes history ten did i mention that she was young oh yes fresh off the farm just a little lost girl a thousand miles from home nine shes wearing shiny new shoes and an outfit she bought for her first trip to new york city she mustve thought we all dressed like catholic schoolgirls he swiveled around to face the plate glass shes just sitting there so pale and still so exposed can you see her every pimple every pucker of cellulite oh and that hairy patch on one knee a spot she missed with her razor this morning eight she seems quiet but you just know inside her head shes running round in circles flapping like a duck and screaming her shoulders slumped as she died a little they all did that she was probably wondering if she should risk a nervous laugh could she risk not laughing what if he was serious he could see all of this flashing through her mind well people so far this isnt much fun shes about as animated as a corpse stupid boring cow seven randy you think her parents are listening tonight of course they are six she wouldve told all her friends and relatives to tune in for her first big break in show business five seconds to go people will our hero on the phone make it in time four will the little girl lose her job and take the next bus back to the farm she snapped finally our girls not dead yet her chair is spinning round and round her eyes are glazing over as she stares at the ceiling looking for flights of angels babe her chair just came to a dead stop her head is slowly swiveling oh scary i swear to god people its like a scene from a horror movie her eyes are bulging going medieval on me shes raising a fist extending her middle finger a suggestion that i commit a physically impossible sexual act on myself wait theres more she couldve let it go at that a simple elegant gesture that pretty much said it all but she just mimed a wellknown slang word for the anal orifice im guessing thats my new name is that right babe she mouthed the words die you bastard he liked that he liked it a lot ah and now the angry tears she was shredding all the careful notes written at the start of the day making confetti of pages lined with her schoolgirl penmanship uh zack randy the timid caller had found his voice i got a photograph of a live juror right here in manhattan so what do i win chapter johanna apollo raised her face to the lowriding sun as she strolled toward bleecker street the morning air was cold but early risers got company vans with four good tires this would be the happy side effect of changing her hours and her route to avoid any more contact with bunny his habits were nocturnal and his home was a patch of sidewalk on another block every retail store in greenwich village was still locked behind burglar gates but the bagel shop in father demo square was open for business and she stopped to buy coffee she was unable to abide the swill at work believing that the coffee grounds were strained through rikers old socks to save money on filters exiting the shop with a steamy paper cup in hand she turned on bleecker and halfway down the block she saw the shoe by the curb bunnys shoe there was no mistaking this mangle of tortured leather for anyone elses another pedestrian passed her by a true new yorker ignoring the evidence of violence the blood in the shape of heel marks and red toe prints from one bare foot and more blood later on down the sidewalk the widely paced red tracks along the pavement were those of a loping man johanna followed the trail of lost blood running fast then faster fullout losing her paper cup somewhere along the way and then breathless and stunned she came to a stop before the open gate of a playground dead stop bunny was seated on the small wooden board of a childs swing and his back was turned to the gate from any distance he might pass for a man at rest johanna walked toward him her footsteps slowed by shock as she rounded the swing and saw his stark white face a loose link in one of the chains had snagged the shoulder of his coat and prevented his body from falling his throat was slashed open and blood drenched his breast how could he have traveled so far with that gaping wound it must have taken great will beyond anything she had imagined him capable of and focus and all the strength that he had buzzing flies lighted on the gross tear in his skin others walked across his closed eyes his hands were folded in his lap and fingers interlaced bunny did you pray what had drawn him here she knew that his illness had begun when he was painfully young a playground might be the last memory of joy some old association with a time when his mother still loved him during all of the telephone calls to bunnys mother johanna had listened to the voice of an automaton a woman sucked dry by the incredible labor of raising a child who had early lost his mind his most pitiable wound was the one bare foot blackened with disease and unprotected in other respects it was like revisiting timothy kidds murder there could be no doubt that this homeless man was killed because he had met the messenger the one who had taken such pains to imprint timothy kidds name on his poor cracked brain she brushed the matted hair from bunnys eyes and a score of fat black flies took wing johannas skin turned clammy as her breakfast marched back up her throat she fell to her knees this death was a personal message there could be no other point in slaughtering this poor lunatic bunny would have been so useless to a police lineup unable to differentiate between a suspect and a shopping cart the killer could not have guessed that she would be the one to find the body but after all the months of noisy street encounters it was predictable that the police with only the description of a hunchback would come knocking on her door johanna stared at the glint of metal near the dead mans feet this bloody knife honed to a razor edge had not been dropped by bunny his arthritic hands were no good at articulating small objects only in death would his fingers be pliant enough to press them to the metal so bunnys murderer must have come this far with him walked alongside him on the death march keeping a discreet distance to avoid the splatter of vagrant blood and saying what oh all the things that would terrify the homeless man as he struggled toward this place and what had kept him on his feet all the way to the playground perhaps he had come looking for a parent he had lost years ago the one who had called him her honey bunny had he believed that this woman would heal his gaping wound and calm his banging heart with motherlove how disappointed he must have been not to find her here bunny did you cry johanna looked up at his face and whispered im sorry she was sorry that his life had been hell on earth that he had died in pain and in such frightening company sorry that she had not protected him johanna lost all track of time as she knelt in the dust stuttering her apologies to a bloodied corpse and now she heard the march of little feet and larger mother shoes and the giggle of soft voices approaching the playground the children were coming riker never wanted to remember his dreams intuiting that scary country as best left alone this morning he had been tricked by a fake awakening a dream inside the dream wherein he had opened his eyes to see the scary boy astride his chest riding him like a bellyup horse pressing down on him with the heavy weight of crazy then came the sensation of lightness from great blood loss and trauma to the body and the brain he woke up dying and then came the real awakening the ringing telephone jangled his raw nerve endings though the sound had to travel down the hall from his front room the bedside phone had been broken long ago deliberately and violently he opened his eyes wondering if this was his wakeup call from miss byrd he was prepared to roll over and go back to sleep for the receptionist only rang twice he waited out the next ring then five more not miss byrd rikers most persistent caller was mallory she always rang exactly twenty times to punish him for his long silence he rolled the covers back his feet hit the floor wearing both of yesterdays socks but only one shoe shoelaces were sometimes difficult for him their knots asked too much of him when he was fallingdown drunk or hungover sometimes a week would go by when he was entirely shoeless for only the time it would take to shower and shave the phone was still ringing as he made his way to the kitchen where he prepared his fasterthaninstant coffee using hot water from the tap alternately inhaling black liquid and cigarette smoke he counted off the twentieth ring ah silence and waited for the rush of caffeine and nicotine to kick in and now his heart beat faster the pump was started the day had begun the phone rang again one fist sent it flying into the wall then crashing to the floor and a familiar voice but not mallorys was yelling with great alarm as if the caller had also been injured by the fall whats going on riker talk to me as he reached for the phone the caller asked are you okay no no he was not the most senior employee of neds crime scene cleaners was a retired teacher of the rulerwielding knucklesmashing authoritarian school everyone on the payroll called her miss byrd never frances none of them would cross that line of respect call it fear drawn in youth for each of them had been hostage to at least one imperious miss byrd during their formative years her gray eyebrows delicately arched as she glared at the front door it had been left unlocked well this was just one more sign of rikers dereliction of duty it never occurred to her that he might have come to work at this early hour for neds brother was not a morning person she had long suspected the man of drinking on the job and this was proof he had grown careless about locking up upon entering the reception area she counted up the office machines wall hangings and furnishings all was as it should be no signs of a thief no thanks to riker the door to the private office was ajar and in the habit of thoroughness she entered the room then froze midstride well this was outrageous seated behind the desk was rikers rude young friend from the police department the only visitor who had ever ignored miss byrds attempts to prevent her from entering the bosss office unannounced she was a lovely child to be sure but such uncivilized eyes so cold and showing no deference whatever for her elders it was miss byrds habit to put everyone in their place by the use of diminutive first names as though kindergarten had never ended of course riker foiled her in this regard only the first letter of his name appeared on the payroll roster however this young woman posed no such problem for she was much talked about by the crew kathy what are you doing the tone implied that the girl should cease and desist immediately kathy do you hear me its mallory the younger woman corrected her detective mallory she regarded miss byrd with grave suspicion then said youre overpaid frances miss byrd sucked in her breath as she grappled with the novel experience of hearing her christian name spoken aloud and then she roughly guessed what lay in store for her yesterdays mountain of papers was now arranged in neat stacks around the edges of the desk and an open account ledger had pride of place on the blotter mallory ran one long red fingernail along a column of payroll figures riker thinks you only work parttime thats what you told him isnt it frances before his brother left for europe you were working eighthour days every week but now you get the same paycheck for half a day interesting she gestured to a chair beside the desk sit down frances and miss byrd sat the young detective casually leafed through a few stacks of statements and tax forms bills and letters dragging out the moment while the senior woman held her breath riker has the strange idea that youre a receptionist said mallory nobody told him that you were the company office manager he thinks all this paperwork is his job she closed the heavy account book with a loud slam to make miss byrd jump though she never raised her voice when she said payroll fraud is a serious crime frances miss byrds mouth was suddenly dry she had never worried about the cleaning crew ratting out her fiddle of the hours for she knew all the secret vices of every employee however now she felt queasy her voice cracked when she said youre going to tell riker arent you well that depends on you frances his brother neds due back on monday thats not much time to fix all this damage i suggest you brown bag your lunch dinner too you wont be getting out much mallory moved a stack of papers to reveal the steel box that belonged in a locked drawer of miss byrds own desk and heres another odd thing riker didnt know about the petty cash fund hes been drumming up business buying lunch for homicide cops out of his own pocket youll want to correct that error on his final paycheck the older womans head wobbled in a lame version of a nod the detective pushed the account ledger across the desk youll be putting in an eightyhour week for free ill stop by to check up on you and when i do there shouldnt be any problem with these figures i want them to match the bank statements and i never stole money from the accounts i was dead honest with with his brother yes i know i looked at all theaccounts but rikers hopeless with paperwork so now youve got a huge backlog to deal with the bank statements dont agree with his deposits and debits and the payroll deductions are all wrong months of errors he botched every one of them thats more paperwork did i say eighty hours you might have to camp out here every night during the day youll be busy setting up the jobs and working as the dispatcher but thats rikers thats right frances youll be running the whole shop doing your own job rikers hes taking time off for a little police work you dont have a problem with that do you no good and get this place cleaned up its a mess after the detective had stalked out the door miss byrd let out a long sigh in a hoarse dry whistle as her body went limp in the next moment her heart lurched and fluttered like a goldfish when she felt a hand curl round her shoulder cold steely fingers not human mallorys the cop reached out with her free hand to run one finger down the dirty glass pane and through the painted name of the company do you do windows frances i do now said miss byrd a detective from the greenwich village copshop stood by the curb collecting notes from a patrolman flynn was his mothers son tall and darkskinned with features of africa only the ten freckles across his nose came down from his irish side he smiled as his erstwhile drinking buddy lumbered toward him hey youre lookin great man untrue riker had not shaved this morning nor had he taken the time to select the least dirty clothes from a wardrobe of flannel shirts and faded jeans and his leather jacket was unzipped exposing the worst of his stains hungover and dragging he stopped to thank flynn for the phone call to tell him that one of his employees might need a friend riker moved on toward the playground at the other end of the block though this was not his own precinct there was no trouble getting past the men in uniform posted at the entrance they stood aside for him all but saluting as he passed through the gate he was royalty now that he had been shot apparently these men had not heard the news of his separation from nypd via a stack of unopened mail even the medical examiners men paused to slap him on the back mumbling their greetings as they rolled a gurney toward the waiting meat wagon though the corpse was concealed in a zippered bag riker knew that flynn had revised his earlier call of suicide upgrading this case to murder no lesser offense would merit the attentions of crime scene unit he watched one csu investigator overturn a trash barrel and sift through the contents while others walked with their eyes to the ground stopping now and then to collect small objects and map their locations on a sketch pad jo was seated on a bench near a sandbox bent forward her long hair covering her face riker sat down beside her and gingerly encircled her with one arm the hump on her back was a mystery to him and it crossed his mind that he might hurt her if he held her tight she raised her face to show him her red and swollen eyes she had been crying but now she seemed oddly calm shock could do that the case detective was walking toward them flynn was a firstrate cop and a decent one riker trusted him to go light and easy with jo the detective sat down on the other side of the bench and leaned forward to catch her eye maam i understand you knew the victim pretty well everybody knew that freak said riker hes been a pest in this neighborhood for let the lady talk flynn turned back to his witness prompting her maam what can you tell me about this guy i know his mother lives in vermont said jo but she hasnt seen him in years riker was stunned to hear her rattle off the longdistance telephone number for a homeless bums next of kin and now she gave another number that she had memorized that of a local attorney who could supply more current information detective flynns pen hovered over the notebook a vagrant with a lawyer new york city versus bunnys foot she was quoting a tabloid headline that had been pinned to the bulletin board at neds crime scene cleaners as homage to a neighborhood celebrity flynn nodded i remember that case even riker knew this story though he never read newspapers anymore his only tie to the world was office gossip according to his crew an aclu lawyer had defended the homeless mans right to die rather than lose his diseased foot to a surgeons saw thus nicely defeating the citys criteria for hospitalizing a vagrant as a danger to himself the court weary of drawnout appeals by the american civil liberties union had decided that bunny was legally entitled to a slow painful death on the street though that initial plan had gone awry this morning detective flynn flipped through the pages of his notebook theres just a few things we need to clear up we canvassed the block where this man spent most of his time according to the neighbors you match the description of a woman who went round and round with this guy three nights a week so this freak attacks you on a regular basis but you dont even cross the street to avoid him can you explain that maam no apparently she could not jo closed her eyes flynn moved closer trying to connect with her so when this bastard used you for a human punching bag did he lead with his left or his right he was righthanded said jo and he never hit me i know he just threatened you said flynn he scared you and you gave him money thats what the neighbors say are you right or lefthanded hold it said riker i can give you at least twenty people who wanted this bum out of the neighborhood permanently just walk along that street and count the houses the tenants mustve filed a hundred complaints with you bastards hey flynn splayed one hand to say that the lady was not a serious suspect and would riker please shove his head up his butt so they could get on with this interview back off said riker her lawyers the same guy who defended the bum he was making this up as he went along and now that you know the lady has counsel that ends the interview shes a witness not a suspect said flynn i can question her all damn day long wrong she was a suspect the minute you asked her what hand she used to hold the murder weapon i think a judge is gonna see it that way too you like the idea of getting your ass reamed out in court no i guess not riker gently raised jo from the bench she was docile and made no resistance to going with him now if you dont plan to book her with squat for evidence im taking the lady home flynn had a bewildered look about him as his eyes turned skyward riker a fourthgeneration police had chosen the wrong side and though the sun was where it ought to be the world was definitely out of order this morning after clearing the playground gate riker turned back to see the detective hovering over a crimescene technician watching the man dust the bench for fingerprints jos prints long after riker had left her hotel suite johanna apollo sat in a patch of direct sunlight and never felt the warmth it was a spiders business that called her attention to the window hours ago the little spinner had begun a delicate web stretching across the sill the ambitious project was complete but horrific in light of the arachnids nature the webs pattern was flawed strange and twisty with ugly knots in the silk and gaping holes where a fine network of threads should be before the web was half done all attempt at weaving symmetry had been abandoned johanna flirted with the idea that the tiny creature had lost its mind she glanced at the cat curled on his red pillow as if he might be the cause of the spiders affliction but mugs was in a mood of rare calm and watching her through halfclosed eyes he was the sane one this morning or was it afternoon johanna turned back to the problem of the spider spinning chaos it was said by some that the observer influenced the outcome of the thing observed the telephone rang it was jarring frightening this ordinary thing this common sound her answering machine picked up the call she recognized the voice of a veterinary surgeon reminding her that mugss checkup had been rescheduled the cat padded toward her and sat down at her feet odd but he seemed unwilling to touch her was he sensing something unhealthy in the air something not quite sane johanna would not look at the spiderweb again half the day had been lost before she rose from her chair and felt the hundred needles of limbs gone to sleep she walked to the closet to fetch the plastic pet carrier even before she pulled it out the cat was backing into a corner baring his teeth and hissing the sentiment no no way you cant put me in there not again after a cab ride across town and uptown to sixtieth street johanna and the screaming mugs entered the animal hospital behind the front desk the teenage receptionist suddenly tensed every muscle in her young body bracing for a touch of hell in the afternoon the pet carrier in johannas hand was shaking with rage and the poor beasts last howl conveyed the message illkill you all chapter zacharys personal slave the most recent in a long line of disposable employees entered the room carrying a covered tray she wore a secretive smile as she set it down before him and there were other warning signs the girl had not combed her hair today but that was only mildly interesting it appeared that she had misplaced her shoes for she was walking barefoot through corporate america and were those the same clothes she had worn last night yes he smiled with genuine affection for her his best find in months it was a pity that she could not last much longer his genius lay in the ability to spot fracture lines in a damaged psyche he had known what she was on the day of her hire he had seen it in her eyes a bit too wide too bright the less astute personnel director had mistaken the girls manic chatter for enthusiasm her smile turned ghoulish as she lifted the silver tray cover to reveal a generous serving of steak tartare mr needleman said this was your favorite my producer you talked to him yeah he called me this morning she sat down at the table and lowered her head until her nose was only inches from his food then watched his plate with great concentration the bastard never calls me and now he also stared at his lunch so you pissed on it right when she raised her face to his he saw deep disappointment in her eyes sorry he pushed the tray away i spoiled your fun she rallied with a triumphant smile mr needleman gave me the callin figures for last night he said the listener response was over the moon evidently the producer had also told her that she was the inspiration for most of those calls the fans had wanted to know if she had been fired or not for the show had ended abruptly with the last callers find of a live juror in manhattan bless randy of soho whenever the juror death rate remained stagnant for too long zachary worried that the game would become stale that he would lose the high ratings of his shockradio audience sometimes he had to skate by on his talent for torturing the hired help the sound engineer had proved a huge success as his new whipping girl and she knew it so now you think youre bulletproof dont you babe he shook his head no way he could kill her with words any time he wanted to she would break and fold before tonights show was over or maybe not the girl picked up a fork and began to eat the red meat which obviously had not been pissed on jerkoff she said and his new term of endearment for her was you crazy bitch she looked up from the lunch plate responding to this name and grinned as another thought occurred to her that window in my booth is that bulletproof absolutely unbreakable zachary had insisted upon that specification before he would sign with the new york media giant thick glass on the booth windows was a necessary precaution a lesson learned the hard way when his show had been based in chicago one memorable night in his old studio the security door had held up through a pounding but the engineers window had not a crazed woman had broken the glass to get at him she had nearly bled to death clumsy fool after cutting herself on the shards and all the while he had taped a playbyplay account of the action to the rhythm of a security guard banging on his door the ambulance crew had provided the climax asking for zacharys autograph while strapping a bleeding woman to a gurney bound for a hospital psychiatric ward his most current crazy bitch was stuffing food in her mouth with her fingers the concept of silverware was quite beyond her now maybe ill take over the show she said when they take you off the air they who the fcc he shrugged they can try in fact lately he had wondered why they did not try harder he missed his daily visits from frustrated bureaucrats who had failed to shut him down perhaps they were afraid of more formidable attorneys or had they simply tired of losing every legal action to the american civil liberties union maybe the network will get rid of you she said sooner or later somebodys going to sue you for i get sued all the time he leaned back in his chair hands clasped behind his head warming to his favorite subject usually its the outraged relatives of dead jurors looking to make some fast cash the network accountants crunched the numbers given the current advertising revenues coast to coast its cheaper to pay off the families then the reaper will get you oh i doubt it he couldnt find the jurors without me and my fans hes probably my most loyal listener what if hes saving you for last he nodded as if considering this in reality he was wondering why her cognitive reasoning remained unimpaired and he made a mental note to work on that if you die she said i could be your replacement i could be bigger than you well you can dream zack smiled at his newest candidate for induced psychosis he had to admire her stamina she was the only one who had remained with him after that moment when her mind had gone elsewhere you crazy bitch johanna apollo almost dropped the pet carrier kathy mallory was a jarring sight on any occasion but this was such a gross invasion the uninvited visitor stood at the end of the narrow foyer somewhat annoyed by johannas intrusion into her own hotel suite riker appeared at the young womans side hey jo johanna entered the living room and set the pet carrier on the floor at her feet how did you two get in here same way we got into this thing riker stood before her open armoire and nodded to the tall blonde she has a way with locks mallory strode toward the front door causing johanna to move out of the way or be trod upon one foot in the outer hall the younger womans face was turned toward the glass door that gave a view of the elevator she called back over one shoulder hurry it up weve only got a few minutes get out now yelled riker ill call from the lobby mallory dropped a cell phone and kicked it to the end of the foyer and then the door closed behind her riker picked up the phone and pocketed it then resumed his chore of ransacking the armoire johanna stared at the empty shelves and cubbyholes her red suitcase lay open on the floor and it was filled with file holders and loose papers she was being robbed i didnt have time to wait for you jo im one jump ahead of the cops but mallorys a cop youre a cop not anymore they pensioned me off he pulled out a drawer and upended it sending the contents into the suitcase and mallory was never here remember that jo when flynn comes after replacing the drawer he hit the wood hard with the heel of his palm to bang it shut then moved on to the next one she could not tell if this was done in anger for as long as she had known him he had slammed every drawer and door though that quirk did not fit with his easygoing nature this was a man with a great deal of unresolved anger and he no doubt believed that he was hiding it well if youve got anything else thats incriminating he said go get it i have to take it out of here before incriminating you cant believe i jo if i was still a cop id lock you up right now he hunkered down to open the bottom drawer filled with wine bottles all the same vintner the same year this was timothy kidds drawer riker looked up at her is the hotel maid pilfering your bottles something like that it was nothing like that but only now did she see her error and it was too late to call the words back rikers eyes strayed to the wine rack on the other side of the room he had once commented on the high cost of her vintages for the price labels had never been removed and now he was checking the stickers on the bottles in the drawer a lesser wine trove than the one in plain sight and reach of the hotel staff gallant man he never called her on that lie he simply closed the drawer on the wine then dropped timothys file into the suitcase the cops got a warrant to search your rooms since when does an innocent bystander they upgraded you to a suspect he closed the suitcase and stood up the better to scrutinize her face perhaps looking there for tells of guilt this is what flynn told the judge who signed the warrant back in chicago you destroyed evidence before the cops could secure the scene of another homicide same cause of death same weapon he found this morning at the playground he was staring at the contents of her suitcase and now it looks like murder is a hobby with you riker leaned down and picked up a newspaper clipping for one of the reapers kills if flynn saw this hed put you in a lockup oh and he knows youre not on good terms with bunnys lawyer but that was my lie not yours so just say as little as possible dont give him a reason to arrest you he turned back to the gutted armoire get me some stuff to put in this closet she understood her rooms should not have the appearance of hastily removed evidence and now she helped him load in papers and items from other drawers in the kitchen and her bedroom when they were done the armoire had the messy look of a catchall closet that had not been recently disturbed is there anything else in this apartment anything flynn shouldnt see he stared at her and she wondered if he knew she was holding out on him it was so hard to tell with riker suspicion was built into the very shape of his eyes jo theres nothing you can hide from a police search the toilet tank the light fixture stuff taped behind a drawer they know every damn hiding place johanna glanced at the cats pillow basket a hiding place that would only be secure while the cat was loose no she lied theres nothing else he looked down at the growling pet carrier that was rocking in place on the floor keep mugs locked up flynn might get pissed off and shoot him the cell phone beeped in rikers pocket thats mallory theyre coming jo take a deep breath and try to act surprised okay he picked up the red suitcase and crossed over the threshold johanna put out one hand to prevent him from slamming the door riker why take the risk if you get caught with her words trailed off as he passed through the fire door leading to the staircase and the elevators he was taking her on faith and going against his old religion of a police riker disappeared down the stairs as the elevator opened johanna quickly closed the door to her suite then released mugs from the pet carrier she rushed to the cats basket and unzipped the pillowcase reaching toward the back of the pillow she retrieved a packet of letters and concealed them in her jacket pocket the knock at the door was a bang bang bang a mans voice yelled police open up mugs waited to greet them scratching the rug warming up to shed some blood the cat had had a bad day at the animal hospital and the next one to enter this room would pay for that johanna cracked the door by a few inches and the cats front paws slipped into that narrow opening to snag anything within reach detective flynn stared at the frenzied animal lets do something about the cat okay i have to get my gloves said johanna as mugs desperately tried to widen the crack in the door so he could maul his first pair of pant legs unless youd rather make it fast she held the door shut with one shoe as she donned a pair of gloves from her pocket she picked up the cat minding the place along his spine that caused him pain you can come in now flynn opened the door wide and mugs growled ill just put him in the pet carrier said johanna that can wait doctor flynn entered the room leading a parade of three men in suits and a woman in uniform the detective handed her a photograph and johanna looked down at the image of herself at the playground in the company of police bunnys social worker identified your picture said flynn she told us you were the psychiatrist who recommended bunnys hospitalization and surgery odd you never mentioned that when i questioned you i was upset i didnt the social worker says you used the same alias you gave us josephine richards but we couldnt find any shrinks by that name so we pulled your prints from the playground bench thats how we tracked you down to chicago those cops remember you very well doctor you and that dead fbi agent but they call you johanna apollo and now for his finale there was a flourish of folded papers as flynn handed her a search warrant she stared at this document all too familiar from past experience with the chicago police can i put the cat away before you start not yet flynn nodded to another man check that thing out the younger man walked over to the pet carrier and turned it upside down to shake it after a look inside he pronounced it clean no false bottom mugs leaped out of johannas arms but he did not attack perhaps the cat was overwhelmed by this embarrassment of riches so many potential victims in one place he stood beside her eyeing the company of police as they spread across the room pulling out drawers and sofa cushions his ears flattened back and he showed every sharp tooth in his mouth when he hissed mugs its all right she said then read the warrant with some relief it included no search of her person no discovery of the letters in her jacket mugs said the female officer thats his name yes johanna turned to look at the other womans sensible black shoes tightly laced and double knotted beneath the cuffs of uniform trousers its short for huggermugger and now she looked up to the young face beneath the tricornered cap the police officer hunkered down for a closer look at the animal not minding the warning of the arched back and bristling fur this woman was definitely a cat person for she engaged the animals eyes then imitated his slow blink mugs began to purr as he walked toward her huggermugger cute name more like a warning dont its all right cats like me mugs rubbed up against the womans thigh then turned on her biting her hand and drawing blood johanna gathered up the cat before it could make another strike sorry so sorry what the hells wrong with him the policewoman was staring at the holes in her flesh as they pooled up with blood old nerve damage johanna pushed the cat inside the plastic pet carrier using both gloved hands to corral the whirlwind of fur and flying claws that tried to prevent the door from closing the cats small face appeared at the wire window of his jail mugs growled as loud as any dog johanna glanced at the womans injured hand i can fix that for you she led the wounded officer into the bathroom this wont take long as she opened a cupboard below the sink johanna listened to the activity in the next room sounds of drawers opening objects hitting the floor the cat alternately growling hissing and screaming she pulled out her first aid kit and found the bottle of antiseptic this might sting she took the officers hand in hers and irrigated the tiny holes these tooth marks arent deep there wont be any scars when she was done with the bandaging she reached into the back of the closet where she kept a physicians gladstone bag inside it she found a block of paper each page bearing the medical icon of a caduceus beneath her name im prescribing a topical antibiotic and another one in pill form animal bites are easily infected done writing she tore off the two sheets and handed them to the officer i thought you were a shrink the young woman stared at the prescriptions dubious now maybe wondering if this was illegal i was a psychiatrist said johanna so i also have a medical degree im sorry about the cat i did try to warn you about the cant you do anything for him an operation or something there was an operation a veterinary surgeon severed the damaged nerve so mugs wouldnt feel the pain anymore but hed lived with it for too long before i found him now he only feels the phantom nerve but the pain is very real to mugs the cats quite insane perfect pet for a shrink wouldnt you say and you still keep him johanna suspected that this cat lovers approval was genuine yes i keep him no one else would have him she turned to leave the bathroom not yet dr apollo the policewoman handed her a second warrant this one for a personal search sorry she said as she pulled on a pair of plastic gloves so this would be a very personal search johanna could even guess the order of violation first oral then vaginal then anal youll have to remove all your clothes the officer touched the collar or the denim jacket i remember this she looked down at johannas legs and those are the same jeans you wore this morning right johanna nodded as she removed her jacket then pulled her sweatshirt over her head catching sight of herself in the bathroom mirror the deformity was more grotesque in the fleshy knotted muscles curving into a hump the younger woman turned away not enjoying this moment johanna removed her jeans eyes fixed on the floor she felt the heat rising in her face the deep red flush of humiliation as she unhooked her bra you can keep the underwear on the policewoman removed her gloves in a giveaway act of compassion there would be no cavity search today thank you said johanna the officer gave her a curt nod but if anyone asks understood ill tell them you were very thorough i dont know why that detective even ordered it flynn says were only looking for documents letters records johanna nodded these were the sort of things she had destroyed on the day when timothy kidd was murdered the policewoman searched a pocket of johannas jacket where the bundle of letters had recently rested all she found was spare change a subway token and some folding money all of which she handed to johanna were taking your clothes with us youll get a receipt for everything she nodded toward the robe hanging from a hook on the bathroom door why dont you put that on johanna wrapped the robe about her and watched her work boots and socks disappear into a plastic bag barefoot she followed the policewoman into the front room where mugs was in the hissing mode and men were testing couch cushions for suspicious lumps drawers had been pulled out and emptied on the floor one man had climbed on top of a table scratching the finish with his shoes as he reached up to unscrew the overhead light fixture detective flynn stood by the armoire desk where financial records had been piled to cure its recently raided appearance his low whistle gave away the discovery of her stock portfolio and an income in the highest tax bracket now there would be questions about her most recent employment and the unhealthy interest in crime scenes she was a woman of means no need to work for her living and she lived in a hotel suite while these people rented small cramped apartments on the wages of civil servants yes she would have a great deal to answer for the policewoman guided her to a kitchen chair that had been dragged into the front room for no other purpose than to deny her comfort johanna sat down on the hard wood wrapping the robe closer about her person the searchers circled around her in their travels never making eye contact treating her as a floor lamp or an incidental table in their way detective flynn pulled up another straightback chair though his was padded with embroidered upholstery he turned it around to straddle it and rest his arms on the back he seemed so relaxed while johanna shifted in her own chair she understood why he had requested a full cavity search a probe of every orifice in her body that kind of trauma was most efficient in tearing down a suspects ego she also realized that it was nothing personal this time it would be different from her interview with the chicago police this new york detective would not invite her to visit his station house the hotel room was an excellent choice for an interrogation no lawyers around to prevent them from stripping her to a flimsy bathrobe and rattling her with ongoing violations of her life her personal letters and the uniformed officer stood in the narrow hallway that led to the bedroom she sought out johannas eyes to beg some explanation for the childsize pair of dancing shoes black patent leather with metal cleats at toe and heel the concept of a tapdancing hunchback was too difficult for this young woman johanna only shrugged to say old dreams i guess you had them too she had been eleven years old when thoracic kyphosis had become so apparent that it could no longer be put off to bad posture dancing classes had been cancelled for the remainder of childhood it was too hard to tap dance in a heavy brace that could not fly with her across the long mirrored classroom and no one could do the buffalo shuffle in body armor the policewoman put the lid on the old shoebox dream and returned to the bedroom to continue the search johanna faced detective flynn everything about this man his posture and his eyes informed her that his power was unlimited all but saying to her give up youre lost youre mine she shrank in size she had no substance in this room it belonged to them now the searchers she was the visitor here a man with plastic gloves was examining the drawer of wine bottles and she ceased to breathe for a moment through the open bathroom door she could hear the sounds of the medicine cabinet being ransacked they would find all the pain medication the pills to help her sleep and others to keep her awake what would they make of the large store of pet tranquilizers they would note her brand of toothpaste examine the underwear in her hamper attracted by spots of blood and follow the scent of menstruation to the tampon in the trash basket would the searcher be delighted with this find this perfect sample of dna would he fold this treasure away in an evidence bag and what would the tag say lady on the rag her toes curled as her bare feet drew back under the chair what do you want flynn was looking past her as if the pictures on the wall were more interesting to him most people go their whole lives and never stumble on a murder victim he turned his eyes to hers and his voice doubled in volume you found two dead bodies lady an fbi agent back in chicago and that poor homeless bum this morning he leaned far forward startling her and she recoiled that wouldve been enough to get my attention but both of em had their throats slit the chicago cops tell me you made a little bonfire in your office wastebasket before you called you destroyed all your patient records and all the while theres a man bleeding to death in your waiting room he was dead when i found him youre pretty cool under pressure doctor no she was more vulnerable now so dr apollo you wanna cut the crap and sir a man in uniform waited for the detective to acknowledge him before he said you have to stop the interview theres a guy downstairs in the lobby he says hold it flynn put up one hand in the manner of a traffic cop and the other man fell silent the detective turned on johanna you called a damn lawyer didnt you you knew we were coming who tipped you off doctor was it riker not waiting for an answer he fired his next question at the man in uniform chase down that bastard riker and drag him in now wait said johanna about that man in the lobby she dipped one hand into the pocket of her robe where she had put the money taken from her blue jeans ive got at least fifty dollars here im betting hes not an attorney put up or shut up detective but flynn was already satisfied that no one had tipped her off to the search warrant for the anticipated visitor was standing in the open doorway and flashing his fbi credentials for all to see hello johanna special agent marvin argus made a slow turn to acknowledge the others in her company and deigned to grace them all with his most condescending smile one nights sleep and he was back in arrogant form with all the old confidence that so annoyed her johannas politics were pacifist and yet she wanted to smack this man each time they met everyone did he was from the chicago bureau and all the people in this room would be strangers to him yet there was overt hostility in every face that turned his way and a bit of confusion as well argus might be their first encounter with a maleheterosexual princess so which one of you is flynn he grinned at the angriest man in the room the detective who sat with johanna you well this is my case now check with your lieutenant if you like i wont be offended but this interview is definitely over and all the evidence your guys collected thats mine no one paid any attention to johanna as she rose from her chair and walked toward the pet carrier this was where she had hidden the packet or dangerous letters in a sleight of hand while locking the cat inside with no sane regard for the possible discovery of this evidence she opened the carriers door and mugs flew out no he shot out of that small opening all but flying across the room as if she had deliberately aimed him at special agent marvin argus only a few more minutes passed before she had her life back again her possessions and her peace she closed the door on the departing invaders then turned to the cat who delicately sniffed the abandoned bags of papers and clothing mugs had won the hearts of all the police and the bleeding fbi agent had not been offered any first aid for his wounds oddly enough it had been a profitable afternoon reassuring and informative the new york detective might have been a formidable opponent but now flynn was officially off the case and the chicago police had been miserly in sharing information with him he had tied her to only two murders a very modest body count chapter riker was one unhappy man as he entered the greenwich village restaurant he was responding to a summons from a revered icon of nypd a retired captain who continued to police his children keeping track of all their transgressions brother ned was the good son who so seldom required this personal attention all the blackest marks belonged to riker dad still harbored grudges from a teenagerunaway episode also known as the mexican rebellion after a summerlong flight from the old mans tyranny riker had returned home to brooklyn covered in road dirt and ragged he had sported long hair and a boys first beard a defiant combination that had guaranteed him some fireworks but the old man had met him at the door in cold silence and never said a word to him all that day years later riker had chanced upon an open drawer in his fathers desk it was usually locked for this was where the old man had kept his only valuables the badge and the gun and there riker had also found a third object the single postcard mailed home from mexico the only shred of proof that his father had missed him worried over him and possibly loved him the retired captain was seated in a corner booth the bartender hovered over the table and personally poured out the singlemalt whiskey not trusting this special customer to a waitress into his late seventies dad had retained his ramrod posture and all his hair thick and white the old man did look sharp in his dark suit and tie so like the silk threads he had worn as a police detective drawing closer riker saw his fathers lips move probably rehearsing a lecture that would amount to only a few spoken words the central point would be driven home by the famous glare of disappointment riker knew he would not be forgiven for the clumsy error of getting shot nor for the greater mistake of not fighting a medical discharge and there was one more possibility for this meeting had dad discovered that one of his sons had been busy committing criminal acts today the old mans information network was uncanny already planning lies of protection to cover mallorys part in foiling a search warrant riker rounded a pillar and now he could see that the old man was not alone his drinking companion was also dressed in a suit and one of the strangers pant legs was torn mugs oh yeah riker owned a pair of jeans with those same distinctive claw marks a bandaged hand was more evidence that this man probably a detective had paid a recent visit to the chelsea hotel damn johanna he had warned her to play nicely with the police the mans face was shielded by a potted fern but riker could assume he was a cop from flynns greenwich village precinct sir this was all riker said by way of a greeting to his father a man with no use for long sentences a grunt of acknowledgment would have been more to dads liking he was introduced to his fathers guest by name rank and no wasted words special agent marvin argus fbi this was the same man who had come looking for jo yesterday afternoon at the time riker had not taken argus for a federal agent he had never met a fed with a girly fringe of bangs plastered to his forehead the fbi man shifted his seat in the booth making room for riker to sit beside him so youre the hero cop i heard you left the force thats not final said rikers father hoping to put an end to this interminable babble dad leaned forward glaring at the agent with a silent suggestion to just get on with it the old mans tense body language put his son on notice that he was here under duress that everything about this meeting stank and just as clear was dads dislike for this agent from the federal bureau of investigation riker wondered how many old favors had been called in to get his own father to act as a lure for this meeting id like to talk about your employee johanna apollo said agent argus oh sorry you know her as josephine richards hey i never got your first name ignoring this question and declining the space the agent had made for him riker elected to sit with his father on the other side of the table and now that the lines were clearly drawn he could see the agent backing up in his mind and rethinking his tactics dad almost smiled almost arguss grin was forced you probably think im here about that homicide at the playground well youd be wrong he toyed with his cufflinks while waiting in vain for some show of interest rikers father rapped one knuckle on the table and the agent all but snapped to attention saying im investigating the murder of an fbi agent timothy kidd johannas also connected to that one but you already knew that youre guessing riker shook his head in denial i dont know squat the ladys a very private person in a lighter tone he said so she killed a fed huh he turned to his father to see if this also warranted a near smile sit up straight said dads cold gray eyes and not one more smartassremark and riker did sit up a bit straighter force of habit from correction sessions at the dinner table every damn night of his childhood over the years he had learned to decipher the words behind the old mans every glance in his direction with a more sober attitude he turned back to the fbi man asking what do you want a little of your time argus leaned back against the booths red leather cushion let me tell you about this dead agent a real sweet guy and just between us he paused to flash a quick smile still trying to curry intimacy timmy was always a little spooky toward the end he definitely had a few screws loose but i think you wouldve liked him one damn fine investigator as good as it gets and now riker learned that the deceased timothy kidd had possessed a heightened ability to ferret out nuances of guilt to translate volumes of words from nothing said finding patterns in chaos and in other peoples unspoken thoughts in the weeks before his death the exquisite brain of this acute paranoid was electrified and wired up to everything that moved and everything that did not ah timmy said agent argus crazy bastard he could read warning signs written on thin air and he was one smart son of a bitch smart enough to mask his symptoms for a long time he got past the bureaus psych test with no sweat but down the road a bit his reports started leaning toward fantasyland the chief of his field office didnt report it didnt want to lose a good man to the shrinks well we fired his chief for incompetence and then we tried to help timmy with his problem if wed only gotten to him sooner hed probably be alive today riker understood that this confession of bureau screwups was supposed to bring them closer together cop to cop but he was very fussy about his male bonding and marvin argus did not make the cut dad seemed at the verge of spitting on the fbi man finding arguss diatribe distasteful cops did not behave this way their messes were kept in the family well said the agent we found tim a psychiatrist with an iq higher than his that was so he couldnt put anything past her dr johanna apollo was the highestpaid shrink in chicago and now shes a crimescene janitor the man staged a smug pause yeah i thought youd find that interesting she called tim a gifted paranoid of course that was after he was murdered we think shes withholding information so you want me to spy on her said riker and now he waited for the pitch a job offer was predictable a carrot for the judas goat argus waved off this suggestion i need your help tim was brilliant but you werent such a bad cop yourself i know your record in special crimes unit you did good work damn shame to retire that kind of talent the bureau needs a guy like you on this case he flashed a smarmy grin man to man its not like im asking you to get in bed with a hunchback rikers hands balled into fists marvin argus dropped the smile and shut his mouth probably noting a sudden change in the atmosphere a threesecond warning that he had crossed a line that could get him decked the agents tone was more serious when he said i want to be very clear about this a maniac played a game that scared the hell out of timmy and this freak might want to play with you too you could wind up dead riker nodded his complete understanding the agent was setting him up to look like a coward in his fathers eyes if he dared to turn down the job argus clearly had no talent for sizing up other men dads hands were tensing fingers curling and uncurling riker and his father were in accord this time they both wanted to slap this man senseless now about that dead vagrant said argus the one the cops found this morning i understand johanna had confrontations with him all the time she only had to walk a block out of her way to avoid him but she never did yeah that made you curious didnt it thats why you dug up her history and found an identical murder timothy kidds was this more guesswork or would that background check track back to kathy mallory agent argus the mind reader said we had two standout hits on our data bank this morning from two different precincts one search was done by flynn the catching detective on the bums homicide and he got zilch but johannas alias raised a red flag at the bureau now the second search didnt use her alias and there was no password either the hacker bypassed the lockout and raided the store nice work riker im impressed i guess you were visiting your old station house in soho it was easy enough to sit down at an empty desk with a computer and now it was certain that marvin argus could trace nothing back to mallory who rarely left tracks she had not used a police computer for her early morning hacking and apparently argus had no idea how many times she raided federal databases in an average week riker a renowned computer illiterate shrugged yeah i was the hacker good catch argus he turned to his father checking for signs of trouble in the old mans face and discovered that dad actually sanctioned this illegal act this promising sign that his son was still thinking like a cop drumming the wood surface with two fingers argus called his attention back across the table figure it out yet riker three days a week johanna apollo goes round and round with this crazy bum shes dodging blows getting used to the idea of being attacked and why because shell never know the moment when our agents killer comes for her tim didnt and johanna screwed up last night that vagrant tripped her and she took a bad fall if jos fall had been mentioned in any of the witness statements detective flynn would have pressed that point during the brief playground interview riker knew the mans style rattle the suspect up front and never let up on the pressure so how would argus have this detail had he been shadowing jo using a living woman for bait to catch a serial killer and argus had yet to mention the reaper that was curious too so your suspect is one of the doctors patients said riker and you figure he wants to kill her before she can give up his name that was one obvious scenario for the fbi surveillance marvin arguss smile said now youre catching on and by that smile riker knew that he was being misled the fbi man lightly slapped the table with his palm so this is the deal we need a guy on the inside someone who has johannas confidence if youre really tight with her she might let something slip something useful a snitch is the lowest form of life on earth said the mere lift of dads head and now the old mans eyes were asking if his son could sink that low could he travel from the rank of detective first grade to a bottom feeder in the space of a day its for dr apollos own good said argus she left the witness protection program heres where youre messing up said riker this killer watches you watching her hes probably laughing his tail off every day all those hours of fbi manpower all for nothing youll never catch him that way there was no surveillance on johanna we didnt know where she was before that raid on our computer oh can it argus you as good as told me the feds were watching her the night before bunnys body was found riker hoped it would drive the agent crazy trying to figure out where the stumble had been made rising from the table he nodded farewell to his father rather than say goodbye for that would have been more familial affection than dad could stand next he turned to the fbi man saying keep the job im not your boy on his way out of the bar riker glanced back to see the trace of a smile on the old mans lips finally when the door had swung shut behind him and he stood on the sidewalk again an old sedan rolled by with the loud fart of a backfire though riker knew the difference between the bang of a car and the bang of a gun anxiety paralyzed him his feet would not carry him away and all his muscles constricted at once he felt a great pressure on his chest no air and he could not fight down the panic of suffocation people passed him by on the sidewalk and he could not call out to them nor even wave at them his arms were leaden and fallen to his sides the pedestrians saw nothing amiss just a man frozen in place sweating on a cool day only his eyes were in motion silently begging each passerby help me noone paused to see that his chest was not moving lungs not breathing in and out that he was dying the paralysis passed off his lungs filled with oxygen his feet obeyed him and he walked down the sidewalk with a surefootedness that belied his idea of himself as a cripple when he greeted riker at the door to the reception area charles butler wore the vest but not the jacket to his tailored suit and this was his idea of casual attire strands of light brown hair curled past his collar for though he possessed eidetic memory he never seemed to remember a barbers appointment but that was not his most outstanding characteristic the man had once described himself as the bastard child of cyrano and a popeyed frog though his eyes were heavylidded the whites overwhelmed the small blue irises giving him an air of constant astonishment as though every word said in his company was absolutely fascinating oh and that nose what a magnificent beak he sat behind an eighteenthcentury desk most of the furnishings at butler and company were antiques except for the couch that was custommade to accommodate very long legs charles stood six foot four in his socks but just now he slouched low in his chair for he thought it rude to hover over visitors of normal height even while sitting down among his other quirks was a monster iq and an equally staggering generosity riker had never believed the reason for the low rent on his own apartment one flight below his old friend and new landlord still maintained the fiction that he felt more secure with a police presence in his building even though charles had the size and strength to pound the average human right into the ground but that was not his nature he was the most pacific of giants also there was already one cop in residence the building superintendent was a retired patrolman and then there was his silent partner mallory and her expertise in electronic burglar alarms and stateoftheart locks this might be the most secure building in new york city so the cheap rent was a gift of charity disguised in a lie told by a man so hobbled by honesty that he could not run a bluff without blushing however riker had had nowhere else to go returning to his old apartment in brooklyn had never been an option the prospect of entering that place one more time had been the stuff of nightmares waking and sleeping and so upon his hospital bed he had handed his keys to the moving men with instructions to steal what they liked but to leave the rainyday stash of good bourbon intact that rainy day had come has mallory been by not today said charles shes been rather busy lately you mean with her crazy job well yes when she does come by its usually late in the evenings hence the term moonlighting kathy mallorys second source of income was unauthorized for cops were forbidden to use investigative skills in the private sector but riker well understood her interest in this place down the hall she kept a private office where she housed her favorite toys most of them required a judges warrant to operate or even to possess them fortunately charles butler was a committed luddite who would not recognize the electronic equivalents of lock picks and who no doubt believed that she used all her equipment to run the background checks on their odd clientele mallorys boss at special crimes unit was equally deluded lieutenant coffey was still pretending that she had followed his direct order to sever all ties with butler and company instead she had submerged her financial interest in the small firm of elite headhunters becoming an invisible partner and now this office was a warrantproof squirrel hole the perfect place to leave the suitcase of files and notes removed from jos hotel suite if detective flynn had discovered rikers interference he would have papered the city with warrants to find his missing evidence and he would have started with rikers apartment but this was no longer a problem as mallory had predicted the fbi had hijacked bunnys homicide and feds were less diligent than flynn i suppose youll want your property back charles stood before the open door of a closet and pulled the red suitcase down from a high shelf handling this heavy luggage as if it weighed nothing at all it would have been normal and natural to ask why riker had stashed it here instead of in his own apartment downstairs but charles had been hanging with mallory for too long and he had learned to regret asking questions instead he said mrs ortega will be sorry to have missed you she asks about you all the time that was odd and touching news for charless cleaning lady under normal circumstances would rather be shot dead than admit concern for riker he was her favorite target for caustic remarks tell her i said hello i will said charles it seems that we see less of you now that you live in the same building are you getting enough heat and hot water any problems i should be aware of naw everything works great riker was rising reaching for the suitcase more than ready to take his leave he had the sense that his friend was checking him for unplugged bullet holes and other signs that he was not quite mended but then he realized that he did have a use for a man with a phd in psychology you know there is one thing you could help me with if youve got a few minutes of course charles inadvertently smiled like a loon and he was all too aware of this unfortunate characteristic his skin was deeply flushed with every happy expression an apology of sorts for his foolish face my time is yours riker settled back into the armchair its about paranoia he noticed the sudden concern in his friends eyes then hastily added not me this is another guy you test people for oddball gifts what about paranoia were talkin wigged out fullblown to the nth degree could you see that as a useful talent charles bless him gave every stupid idea polite consideration a few moments passed and then he said well thats the sort of thing id try to fix with a psychiatric referral encouraging paranoia would be unethical and theres really no market for mentally ill employees he considered his own clients to be merely eccentric but riker had other ideas the job applicants of butler and company had rare talent and high intelligence prized by think tanks and government projects and they were frequently a hair away from crazy neatly explaining this mans vast expertise in abnormal psychology head tilted to one side charles was having second thoughts or perhaps he simply disliked disappointing a friend well i suppose it might have some applications if your man worked in a dangerous environment extreme paranoia could give him an edge in staying alive riker had anticipated that much new yorkers who were not the least bit neurotic were listed on police blotters as the dead and wounded a mild case of paranoia was considered a sign of good mental health for it made people wary of strangers and dangerous streets but agent timothy kidd had been the king of paranoia and he had not managed to stay alive in chicago a town with a lower homicide rate okay suppose my guy is an fbi agent tracking a serial killer would paranoia give him an edge in dealing with suspects bit of a stretch said charles but it might if it shows in his outward behavior and thats usually the case his overt suspicion would increase the pressure on the person he was interviewing the suspect might exhibit more enhanced reactions involuntary facial expressions and nervousness all the giveaway signs of a lie a fullblown paranoid could pick up on all of that consciously or unconsciously however heres another aspect to consider a paranoid is working with more perceptions than the average person taking in details and information that you or i would rightly deem irrelevant thats the downside to your theory they frequently detect patterns that simply arent there so flaming paranoia could never help him find a suspect i wouldnt think so everyone would seem suspicious to him i imagine his illness would only clutter up the landscape and make things more difficult then why had marvin argus gone to such trouble to spin the lie of a gifted paranoid riker rose from his chair and picked up jos red suitcase at least he had a satisfactory answer to the only question that had really mattered unlike agent argus charles butler would not could not lie to him and he had the mans assurance that mallory had not visited this office today that the contents of the suitcase were unrifled and still intact and this oversight of hers this failure to plunder jos papers behind his back had sealed his theory that mallory was playing him chapter so much for the worldclass security features of his new address when riker unlocked the door to his apartment he knew immediately that there had been a breakin his laundry was no longer scattered about the room but neatly gathered into a wicker basket his other clue was the small wiry woman cleaning his windowpanes whatre you doing as any fool can see said mrs ortega im robbin you blind she turned around to glare at him with dark spanish eyes that silently asked if he had any more stupid questions she also managed to convey that she was a woman on a mission and he was the intruder here did charles let you in or was it mallory i got the super to open the door said mrs ortega i told him i was your cleaning lady she looked down at her apron lined with pockets of plastic bottles rags brushes and other tools of the trade great disguise huh she dropped a wet rag on the windowsill and walked over to the wicker basket riker theres something i just gotta know i think ive figured out your system but tell me if im wrong you throw your socks into a different corner every night so you can rotate dirty laundry instead of washing it have i got that right she eyed the red suitcase he carried and now youre running away from home i understand the wave of her hand included the entire front room its litter and streaks of whatever that was on the walls overwhelming isnt it riker easier to pack up and leave he set the suitcase down by the door okay no more cleaning not today he wanted to read all of johannas papers and that left him no time to deal with mrs ortega well not much time i got cold beer in the fridge want one dont mind if i do she followed him into the kitchen where his unopened mail covered most of the floor tiles she swept a slew of envelopes from the seat of a chair and sat down at the table maybe i should just ream this place out with a blowtorch and start over from scratch she accepted a beer from his hand stared at it with grave suspicion then wiped the top of the can with a clean rag before opening it well this rooms not so bad he said oh yeah with the toe of one shoe she nudged an open pizza carton on the floor the remaining slice had grown enough mold to qualify as a houseplant you know why you dont have cockroaches riker those genius bugs they know its not safe to eat here so you noticed im probably not the type to hire a cleaning lady now why are you doing this to me i got a philosophy she said im gonna write a book zen and the art of a clean house thats my title you put a house in order and you put your life in order all this stuff is weighing you down riker you might as well drag it around on your back the dirt the mess the busted coffeemaker that probably hasnt worked in twenty years but that aint the worst of it he followed the point of her finger looking through the doorway to the room beyond where dust balls having acquired tenure roamed free and fearless across the open floor one windowpane she had cleaned all the rest were fogged with a yellow grime of nicotine and a layer of dust colored everything else in gray thats what the inside of your head looks like she said scary huh this tough little woman had a bad attitude a penchant for heavy sarcasm and she had touched him in all the soft places of the heart he understood that she wanted to fix him to make him better by cleaning him up but mrs o was not so talented she could not scour away the image of a skinny psychotic teenager sitting upon his bloodsoaked chest pressing the muzzle of a gun to an eyeball then pulling the trigger only to discover that he had spent all his bullets on rikers prone body even now with every loud noise he ceased to breathe and he relived his dying whats all this crap mrs ortega leaned down to sort through the pile of mail passing over advertisements and bills to examine the letters from the city of new york and nypd selecting one she held it up to the overhead light this ones got a check in it i can tell its a blackout envelope thats so you cant see whats inside riker shook his head youre wrong my paychecks were direct deposit and then one day the deposits had ceased and he had never even picked up a phone to ask why she slapped a worn fivedollar bill on the table i say its a check im never wrong he laid five singles alongside her money okay youre on mrs ortega slashed open the envelope then waved a slip of paper in his face its a disability check from the city now she looked through the rest of the mail at her feet and heres another one and another one jesus youre rich this is a mistake riker shook his head as she emptied the envelopes one by one and lined up the checks on the table the city screwed up these have to go back why because im not disabled oh yeah wanna bet when mrs ortega had pulled her rolling cart of cleaning supplies out onto the sidewalk she heard the rattle of money in a beggars ratty paper cup she had passed by this bum half an hour ago on her way to rikers apartment and now she could tell by the sound of coins that his proceeds had been slim and that alone was enough to arouse her curiosity considering the locals all damn liberal idiots in her opinion this youngster would have to work at driving off donations she might despise panhandling on principle but she was even less tolerant of incompetence since riker had sent her away before she could make inroads on his mess mrs ortega guessed she had a little time left over for charity work a man from the neighborhood stopped to give the beggar money then had a change of heart and moved on and now the cleaning woman knew how to fix the young man in the dark glasses and the red wig still here her eyes were on the paper cup and she counted up the paltry sum of two nickels and four pennies it aint goin so good is it kid well im not surprised she walked around him taking his measure ill tell you what youre doin wrong when that guy was gonna give you a dollar you smiled you looked at that bill and smiled thats why he got pissed off and stuck it back in his pocket in the future try to remember this mrs ortega tapped the cardboard sign hung round the beggars neck to label his affliction his need for alms she raised her voice as if he might also be hard of hearing youre supposed to be blind you moronl he cringed and pressed back against the wall then raised his white cane as if to ward off a blow and that puzzled mrs ortega this conversation had been conducted on the decibel level of a standard new york street confrontation and she had not even threatened him yet now he was reduced to a shivering geek show in a rare moment of weakness call it mercy she paid him a compliment that white cane is a good prop yeah thats a keeper she stepped back to reassess him he should definitely lose that stupid red wig it was too long for the boy even a weird boy it was a girls wig for christs sake where the hell did this pansy come from puffed up with great xenophobic pride she decided that he could not be a native of her new york and it was on her mind to tell the boy that he should change the sign on his neck to say that he was crazy as well as stupid but having already done her bit for community service she moved on down the sidewalk with her cart and never looked back she never saw him raise his eyes to stare at rikers secondfloor window papers covered every stained inch of the carpet and this created the illusion of an improvement in rikers front room his deli sandwich disappeared in absentminded nibbles as he read another page of dr johanna apollos neat handwriting among the personal notes was a journal logging every meeting with bunny the homeless homicide victim noting signs of physical and mental deterioration the last entry was bunnys message from the late timothy kidd and a note on the use of a hapless vagrant as a living telephone for a serial killer riker marked this final entry with a paper clip then put the journal to one side one day it might be used as evidence in a trial next he read the transcripts of several interviews with the chicago police all the details and conversation that jo could recall the case detective had hammered her so hard accusing her of withholding evidence another group of interviews had been conducted by fbi agents and would be better described as debriefings curiously the murder of their own man was never mentioned only the dead mans theories about a serial killer agent kidd had made contact with the reaper in jos words he saw the reaper in a liquor store following an interruption from her interrogator she admitted that yes paranoia was at the heart of timothys theory riker paused in his reading to digest the fact that the murdered agent was always timothy to jo only her fbi interrogators called the murder victim agent kidd he read the rest of her story timothy entered the liquor store as another customer was leaving with a bottle of wine this was a man hed never met yet the customer was obviously surprised to see him a total stranger timothy gave the man a few seconds head start then followed him back into the street but the man was gone there was no sound of a car starting its engine he must have run at top speed to get clear of that block so fast the fbi agent had returned to the store to interview the clerk all he learned was that the departed customer had been overjoyed to see one particular wine in stock in the clerks words he thought hed already bought the last bottle on the planet according to jos best recall of kidds conversation with her timothy said it was an oddball wine youd never see in a food critics column though it was surprisingly good and then jo reminded her interrogators that the body of a dead juror had been found in that area on the following day riker looked up from his reading if agent kidd knew the taste of that wine then he had gone to some trouble to track down another bottle of a scarce vintage though jos notes provided no such detail riker could name the wine and even the year the bottom drawer in johannas armoire was stocked with ten bottles all the same label same vintage but different store stickers and prices he reached into a pile of bills from distributors and liquor stores in distant states one reiterated the details of jos reward of a hundred dollars over retail cost she had also been collecting this particular vintage and the fbi only had her version of a man as the stranger in the liquor store he placed the receipts in another pile that he had mentally labeled with the query to burn or not to burn at the conclusion of her last interview the fbi had dismissed her with thanks then placed her in the federal witness protection program by jos account the feds had disregarded timothy kidds reaper sighting for who would believe an insane story like that one riker would no one was more paranoid than a cop with the scars of four bullet wounds he studied jos map of chicago red circles marked the sites of three homicides and one was four blocks away from the liquor store he raised his eyes to the ceiling and played out the murdered fbi mans scenario on that blank white screen agent timothy kidd walked into a liquor store and his mere presence startled another customer a man he had never met most chicagoans would be strangers to the washingtonbased agent why kidd wonders why does this customer appear to know him on sight according to jos interview the agent had visited only one crime scene in chicago and that one had belonged to the reapers second victim freaks sometimes returned to the sites of their murders to watch the ongoing show of cop cars and meat wagons lights and cameras who but a haunter of crime scenes would have recognized timothy kidd as the law and who but a guilty man would panic and run this was thin support for the identification of a prime suspect but if it had been the reaper in the liquor store that night the most serious mistake he made was that flicker of recognition for an fbi agent who was also a worldclass paranoid good job timothy score one for the neurotics riker had no conceit that the bureau had not arrived at the same conclusion so why was a serial killer still at large nowhere in jos files was there any mention of the suspects name nor even a description and he was not surprised by that it was the kind of thing that a smart cop even a fed would not confide in a civilian yet agent kidd had told her the name of the wine unaware of time passing crossing over from day into night riker did not recall turning on the lights so that he could continue to read every scrap of text every news clipping and note before his alarm clock sounded he was well versed on the reaper murders and it was time for ian zacharys show he turned on the radio the source of the game clues you crazy bitch the sound engineer looked up from her computer screen pick your words carefully jerkoff or ill wipe all your calls did she know they were still on the air yes she did somewhat impressed ian zachary lowered his voice as he spoke to his radio audience crazy bitch will take the next call after this word from our sponsor he pressed the button for the security lock at the sound of the buzzer a delivery boy entered the studio bearing a gift from a fan randy of soho after the messenger had left the room zack continued his involuntary habit of checking the dark window of the producers booth looking for signs of movement within might needleman be looking in on him tonight zachary considered the possibility that the producer was not shy but brilliant and playing a nervous game within the game however the more plausible theory was that his mysterious producer was a spy from the federal communications commission a federal court was still in the process of defining that fine line between entertainment and conspiracy to murder via public airways the issue had been further complicated by all the newspapers and major television networks following the lead of ian zachary and his fans reiterating every crackpot theory and juror sighting the defense attorneys had argued that the reaper had multiple sources for the same information thus clouding the issue of cause and effect upon ripping open the envelope from the local fan he discovered that last nights caller had indeed snapped the picture of a surviving juror zachary glanced at the clock then flipped the switch to open a line to the sound booth oh crazy bitch she extended her middle finger to confirm that he was back on the air well people he said to his listening audience we have an official winner in the photo contest randy from soho i assume youre listening tonight so crazy bitch will you tell our contestant what hes won zack hit the time delay button to cut off a stream of obscenities from the sound booth that girls really losing it so my friends i propose a new contest pick the hour and the minute that she cracks something dramatic maybe drool and speaking in tongues pulling out patches of hair mine or hers your option five hundred dollars crazy bitch will take the first ten callers we wont have time for more players i have a feeling that tonights the night oh shit couldnt you wait another hour he overrode her own controls and cut to a commercial break five minutes ahead of schedule the lights of her squirrel cage had gone out and now he faced two black windows she was taking a cue from needleman and hiding in the dark not for long babe it was time to sweep out her idiot remains the living body but not the mind that was already lost funs over he raised the lights of his studio for all the good that did the lighting had been designed to suit his love of dark cavelike environs with the slight increase of illumination he could barely make out her black silhouette in the booth he walked toward his own lean ghost reflected in the darkened glass enjoying this vision of himself for he appeared to be strolling on thin air neatly surpassing that tired old biblical trick of walking on the water at the top of her volume dial crazy bitch screamed showtime he ripped the earphones off his head the pain jesus are you crazy he yelled at her and how crazy was that are you trying to break my eardrums another silly question of course she wanted to hurt him and his eyes were the next target all the lights in her booth switched on at once the desk lamp and track lights had been redirected at him and he was blinded the pain was passing off but his vision was scorched with patches of hot white lights and the earphones were still clutched in his hands when he heard the tinny distant sound of her voice at a normal decibel level singing to him oh jerkoff he lifted the microphone element to his lips and whispered you incredible bitch she parried by extending her middle finger close to the glass her tone was actually sweet when she said we have a firsttime caller on line three he claims hes one of the surviving jurors good one said zack all injury and hatred forgotten what did it matter if this was a hoax he had an audience of feebleminded motivated believers he ran to his panel and tapped the third light on his phone board daddy loves you he said to the caller and he was sincere for this one had drama potential talk to me a mans angry voice responded youre an idiot the caller seems a bit confused said zack to recap for new listeners or anyone just tuning in this man was on the jury of celebrityblinded morons he was so starstruck he ignored all the evidence of guilt were talking blood and fingerprints people dna and eyewitnesses out of three hundred million americans only the twelve jurors thought the defendant might be innocent a verdict of sheer stupidity no wonder the reaper wants them all dead who doesnt so listeners does our serial killer have a point is it time to clean out the gene pool stop ill yelled the caller you cant or as our hero the reaper would say is this juror too stupid to go on living and now the most important question the one thats worth hard cash when will this one die zack looked down at the photograph in his hand it was a good likeness i didnt get your name who are you its macpherson and you know damn well who i am yes you fool the rules his lawyers had carefully laid out were tricky but now that the juror had identified himself on the air the man was fair game mcpherson still there yes he heard the sudden intake of breath there was no more doubt he had the genuine article on the line any last words how can you do this to me frustration made the callers voice crack better and better you and your fans said macpherson you did everything but draw that maniac a map to my damn house his voice was stronger getting louder what the hells wrong with you man i was one of the jurors who set you freel yes said ian zachary so whats your point chapter charles butler an avid collector of antiques entered the only visually chilly room on the premises of butler and company the furnishings of his business partners office were twentyfirstcentury cold steel it was a place of hard edges mechanical clicks and whirs and long shelves lined with electronics and technical manuals surrounding three computers on workstations the single charming aspect of eighteenthcentury arched windows had been neatly killed off with stark white metal blinds only one wall provided him with relief from severity it was covered with cork from baseboard to ceiling and served as a gigantic bulletin board this morning it added a rare human aspect to mallorys private domain it appeared as though riker had taken all the papers from johanna apollos suitcase and hurled them at the wall pages sticking there of their own accord and pushpins later added as an afterthought each crookedly hung sheet would be an affront to mallorys pathological neatness and so charles was unprepared for her response and it gave him pause she never smiled this way to convey any happiness the young police detective paced the length of her cork wall pausing sometimes to read a note or a newspaper article in its entirety her standard uniform of jeans tshirt and blazer only varied by color and material smoky silk and cashmere today charles had long ago recognized this as the sign of a highly efficient brain with no spare time to waste upon wardrobe decisions her long black coat was slung over one arm she had not yet committed to going or staying awhile please stay they needed to talk about what she had done to riker while she scrutinized her wall charles was busy censoring his comments on this subject culling the words outrageous dangerously irresponsible and the like but then he found himself altogether out of words he stared at his shoes and said nothing as her friend and foremost apologist he would always excuse her most questionable behavior by secondhand stories and deduction he knew the darkest things about mallorys childhood on the street and he had paid dearly for that knowledge on occasion it still cost him sleep and peace of mind she had lost everything that mattered to a little girl before she had even reached the age of reason and yet a remarkable creature had emerged from devastating trauma how prescient was the poet yeats for he had written his finest lines for kathy mallory long before she was made all changed changed utterly a terrible beauty is born so now it begins she said how he hated the sound of that charles faced the paper storm on her cork wall riker finished this about an hour ago i dont think hed been to bed yet good said mallory ive got him hooked on any other day charles would have done headstands for the pleasure of her smile however this morning he could only wish that she would stop drop it and not relish this mad game so much he walked up behind her in the role of conscience and softly said you know this isnt wise a psychotic shot riker and now you throw him in the path of a serial killer another lunatic thats what makes it so perfect another jury of idiots she stepped back to take in the entire sprawl of rikers mess on the cork wall this case looks a lot like the horse that threw him indeed there was a clear parallel of jury verdicts and violence if a teenage killer had not been found innocent despite a plethora of incriminating evidence then riker the prosecutions star witness would not have been ambushed in his own home and now another jury had come to an equally insane verdict in the zachary trial but this time the result had been a mass slaughter however said charles this murderer is a bit more organized more dangerous than the boy who shot riker he tapped the crimescene photograph of a dead fbi agent another parallel for the reaper also had a lawenforcement victim in this case it was an interesting departure from the juror killings what happens when this maniac recognizes riker as a player given any thought to that though he faced the wall he was aware of mallorys eyes on him perhaps calculating that her only mistake was bringing him into the game one hand went to her hip as a warning you have a better way to fix riker no sadly he did not though one of his phds was in psychology he only applied it to assessing the stability of gifted clients the better to find the right niches for them he had never treated anyone as a patient never even thought of opening that sort of practice but mallory with no such background was attempting shock therapy on a trauma victim in a very fragile state of mind charles made his own appraisal of the wall and pronounced it horrific you said you were going to feed him this case a piece at a time a teaspoon of murder as medicine that had been her stated intention this is too much i know that said mallory but i didnt know about dr apollos stash not until we tossed her hotel room so whats the damage is there anything in her papers that would give riker the whole picture well obviously he knows about the relationship with agent kidd but theres nothing here to tell him precisely how dr apollo fits into the game and i dont see that woman making any confessions mallory sat down at a workstation topped by a glowing monitor he watched as she downloaded photographs from a camera to a computer the array of images appeared on the screen sometimes he wondered why she made so many portraits of johanna apollo in most of them the womans deformity was covered by long tresses of dark hair and only mildly apparent in the forward curve of her upper body his favorite was a closeup of the doctors face a man could make friends with those warm brown eyes the most recent picture was a fullbody shot the wind had ripped aside the sheltering curtain of hair to reveal the hump somehow he knew that this would be mallorys last portrait of dr apollo she had finally achieved the full exposure of vulnerability and charles felt suddenly protective of this woman he had yet to meet you dont like her do you mallory please tell me shes not a suspect the only players i dont suspect are the dead ones you never did tell me how you got caught up in this business when did you first the day i met rikers hunchback she said i ran a background check on her alias and the documentation was just too perfect too neat thats always a good marker for the fbis witness protection program mallory was looking past him now and suddenly distracted she rose from her chair and stepped close to the cork wall honing in on the only sample of rikers messy handwriting she read this margin note aloud jos wine whats that about a more careful perusal of the board offered her no enlightenment damn riker hes holding out on me johanna apollo slung her duffel bag over one shoulder and this was mugss cue to cry there was a touch of betrayal about the cats eyes for she was obviously abandoning him she would not be there to defend him when the maid arrived with the water pistol johanna was in no position to complain about the hotel staff defending themselves from a mauling though she gave them hazardousduty pay in the form of lavish tips also mugs preferred open warfare to being confined to his pet carrier nothing could drive him quite as crazy as being locked up in that box she bent low to pat him where there were no memories of damaged nerves to make him scratch her he pressed his head into the cup of her palm and cried again in this moment he managed to communicate a desperation a message that he was already having a bad day and he would be lost if she left him behind upon entering the bathroom she opened a box from her store of pet tranquilizers she disliked drugging mugs though sometimes it was a mercy if the maid arrived and found him docile and drowsing it would not be necessary for the woman to shoot him with the water pistol in selfdefense after breaking open a capsule johanna poured half of it into his water bowl next lest marvin argus return with his own search warrant she unlocked the armoire retrieved a packet of letters and folded them into the pocket of her denim jacket and last she counted up her wine bottles a neurotic ritual worthy of timothy kidd mallory tidied up rikers careless pushpin style moving sheets of paper to hang at exact right angles to the architecture no on second glance charles decided that she had actually improved upon that for now he realized that the building had settled out of alignment over the past century he put more trust in mallorys internal plumb line that ran infallibly to the center of the earth so you spent some time with riker she said notice any changes anything odd no in most respects he seems his old self quite relaxed id say no tics or twitches that i was aware of he does have a tendency to slam doors a very unrikerlike thing to do but thats been going on ever since the hes angry no said charles he was rather affable hes angry at me and the slow shake of her head said that she had no idea why only that this was true he understood her rationale underlying anger could explain rikers monkish behavior since his release from the hospital perhaps its not you not something quite so personal and here he had the good sense to stop for she disliked being challenged her arms were folded against him and her eyes narrowed reminding him that true or untrue she was never wrong why dont i refer him to a psychiatrist said charles therapy is what he needs a talking cure i dont have time for that she amended this pronouncement adding riker doesnt have time his apartment is a pit mrs ortega says it should be condemned well thats because she never saw his old apartment in brooklyn im sure it cant be in worse shape ah he had made another error finding a logical explanation that disagreed with her own he turned his eyes away from hers hoping to avoid another ocular argument the mess is twice as bad she said so you havent been down there yet no he had not been invited but now he gathered that mallory had been visiting rikers apartment and not by invitation she passed through locked doors too easily so adept at breaking and entering invading he wondered how to broach the subject of rikers need for privacy and security now more than ever empathy would be the wrong approach she had none i dont see anything wrong with his reflexes she said you agree i didnt find any signs of physical disorder he rattled off the items noted in every covert examination of riker motor skills eye movement speech patterns reasoning ability everything spot on he knew it was frustrating her that there were no technical manuals on the subject of rebuilding riker then its the psych evaluation that has him freaked well that makes my case for getting him to a therapist the sooner we get him into treatment no time she said somewhat testy now for she disliked repeating herself its budgetcutting season and commissioner beale is cleaning house the little bastard has the soul of a cost accountant hed love to get rid of a senior detective with rikers pay grade she turned back to the board back to the game dr apollo was on two murder scenes she had insider information from agent kidd charles could see where this was going it might be a mistake to develop her as a suspect think about it you say riker hired her three months ago well thats when he started shaving again oh and his first haircut since the shooting same time frame granted thats not much to work with but suppose he genuinely cares for this woman oh mallory if a cat could smile what great satisfaction he saw in her eyes so he does have feelings for her and you knew that oh of course she did what was he thinking dr apollo was mallorys hostage so thats how you got riker to play the game tell me mallory how did you set him up did you whisper something scary in his ear what did you say no let me guess oh incidentally riker this woman this one bright spot in your otherwise miserable existence shes in deep trouble maybe shell die something like that suddenly very tired he leaned back against the cork wall i know you didnt tell him that dr apollo was your favorite suspect then hed have to choose up sides wouldnt he and it might not be your side annoyed she turned her back on him not liking his tone one bit well tough disregarding two facts that he loved his life and she carried a gun he reached out grabbed her by the shoulders and spun her around well that opened her eyes a bit wider so im right he said you planted a threat in that poor mans mind you might as well have put a gun to johanna apollos head what about the effect on riker did you give that any thought at all he was angry close to shouting oh what the hell he yelled at her clearly you dont know what youre doing though actually she did he could see that now her cats smile came stealing back forcing him to admit that he had also been sucked into the game and his own fears for riker hostage number two would bind him to mallory until it was played out his hands fell away from her shoulders his twominute experiment with insurrection was over hostilities forgotten as if she had ever taken him seriously she leaned down to tap the keyboard of the nearest computer saying if rikers afraid of the psych evaluation he can fake it she brought up a file with a questionnaire the test is in two parts written and oral charles recognized the screen image as the cover page of a personality profile many other pages would follow the lengthy test would repeat and reword questions as traps for false replies mallory split the screen to display another document with recommended responses all he has to do she said is memorize this one the citys too cheap to order new tests this is going to be so easy after a little coaching from you on the oral evaluation hell be back at work this wont help him mallory its not that simple he could read the look on her face this was desertion from the ranks getting his job back and getting him back on the job thats two separate problems hes already on the job said mallory he took this stuff out of apollos place so we wouldnt lose it to the feds no hes protecting his friend johanna charles lost his train of thought he was staring at the computer monitor and a dateline that corresponded to mallorys last psychiatric evaluation a mandatory test following the shooting of a suspect he had always wondered how she navigated these examinations missing all the traps set to catch her own peculiar bent of mind this electronic cheat sheet forever killed his idea of her as an innocent savage she knew exactly what she was and mallory was now twice wounded in his eyes for she must realize that she would never be quite do you ever listen to the radio charles if you mean zacharys program no he preferred newspapers to television and radio accounts of the reaper and he believed his view was less biased for that mallory had moved on to another computer in the row of three terminals she tapped the keyboard again and the speakers announced the ian zachary show i have them all in my audio file this is shock radio charles was left alone to listen to the archived programs and soon he had the gist of the game and the man who ran it another sociopath johanna had returned from her last stint at cleaning up crime scenes and mugs was still drowsy from his long nap he slowly followed her into the bathroom and sat down at her feet not having the energy to rub up against her legs for a fresh spate of agony love and slashes a proper hello the blood of the last job had never touched her skin yet she washed her hands it was a fight not to wash them a second and third time though the cat would be the only witness to her compulsive behavior she could not say when this urge had begun perhaps when she had opened her mind to timothys paranoia a second neurosis a hitchhiker sickness had also entered in she looked at herself in the mirror then looked beyond her image to the shower curtain surrounding the bathtub though there was not even the shadow of an interloper she pulled the curtain aside no one there of course not and no one in the closets she checked them all after changing into a suit she wrapped her shoulders in a stylish shawl then pulled it over her head to form a hood the bulk of material hid the line of her deformity quite well mugs was slow to react to this signal that she was going out again thanks to the drug there was no sign of panic in his eyes he padded alongside her as she walked to the door and he did not cry this time there was only mild curiosity in his eyes as he watched her leaving him once more chapter it would be generous to say that the dining area was eight feet wide and twelve deep there were four tables small as postage stamps and riker was the only patron who did not take his foilwrapped food and run he was hoping to avoid his meal for as long as possible the counterman was back in the kitchen having a protracted discussion with the cook the subject of their argument was the simulation of a cheeseburger from their store of strict vegetarian ingredients riker had no plans to eat their concoction he had ordered lunch for the sole purpose of renting a view of the hotel across the street having given up any hope of coffee he opened the beverage cabinet and passed over all the health food juices to select a bottle of water he kept one eye on the front wall all glass and neatly framing the chelsea hotel when jo had returned home from her last crimescene cleanup she had been followed by two men in suits federal shadows in plain sight this was not rikers idea of a covert surveillance detail neither would those two men fit the protocols for bodyguards for they had followed jo at the distance of half a block and now marvin argus stepped out on the sidewalk nervous little bastard his movements were jerky as his head snapped left and right finally the agents gaze settled on the restaurant window riker lifted his water bottle in a salute special agent argus crossed the street in an unseemly hurry and pushed through the glass door to greet riker with all the suspicion this encounter deserved taking the only vacant chair at the table the fbi man was forced to sit with his back to the window you just happened to be in the neighborhood i knew id find you here and this was only half a lie i figured youd stake out jos hotel argus smiled so willing to believe that this visit was on his own account so youve given my offer some more thought he splayed both hands to say he was waiting for the decision and riker had never been susceptible to prompting he drank his water dragging out the silence and listening to the fast nervous tap of arguss shoes under the table he set the plastic bottle down very slowly did timothy kidd ever give you a name for the reaper its not like i think youll tell me who the guy was all i wanna know is did kidd give you a solid suspect before he died did he get that close argus was startled his eyes shifted to one side a hint that he was preparing another fairy tale in this moment when riker was not being watched he glanced at the door to the chelsea hotel the fbi man held his silence as the counterman appeared with a fake cheeseburger riker gave it the sniff test and it failed try again pal this isnt even close the man walked away with his rejected offering and another backroom discussion with the cook ensued guaranteeing riker at least fifteen minutes of privacy he rapped his knuckles on the table to remind the fed that he was waiting for the next lie timmy had a suspect argus pretended interest in the beverage cabinet by the table but he named the wrong guy poor bastard he was really past it by then seeing things that werent there the agent turned back to riker watching his face in earnest now i could give you more details but first id need a little something from you just a little how did you rule out kidds prime suspect the alibi was me and my crew the next juror died at three in the morning we were watching timmys suspect round the clock covering all the exits of the apartment building how many men were on that detail what four agents all day all night im telling you the suspects alibi was solid riker did the math of twelvehour stints partners split between two exits and no one to keep each agent company and awake in the graveyard hours he recalled the drowsiness of that late shift the first night of a detail when no amount of coffee agent argus was turning round to look at the hotel as jo walked out the front door and down the sidewalk and riker said i know who the reaper is the window was forgotten and he had all of the agents attention im betting its the suspect kidd gave you one of your guys screwed up and went to sleep on the job riker rose from the table hoping to convey that he was suddenly fed up with this mans company and that was true you had the bastards name and address all this time he laid down the cash to cover his uneaten lunch and walked quickly to the door never glancing back to catch arguss reaction the slow hydraulic pump above the restaurant door prevented him from slamming it standing out on the sidewalk he watched jos gray shawl in the distance she was so changed in this disguise he had almost failed to recognize her but even without eyeglasses he knew that longlegged walk he knew it better than any man on the planet he had spent that much time speculating on the shape of the limbs beneath her jeans in the short skirt she wore today her legs more than lived up to the fantasy there was no need to close the distance as he followed her down seventh avenue then underground and onto a southbound train he already knew where she was going according to his source the woman was good at spotting and dodging her shadowers this of course was mallorys rationale for sometimes losing jos trail but no one had ever shaken off riker not once in all his years on the force it was a cold day yet victor patchock was perspiring profusely he blamed this on the cheap red wig and the press of the surrounding subway passengers he had no fear of getting caught by the cop in the brown leather jacket riker was so intent on following his own prey that he never looked back at his stalker a smaller man lost among the taller riders the train stopped at the franklin street station in tribeca victor had lost sight of the detective with swipes of both hands he wiped the sweat from his eyes and the white cane dropped from his slippery fingers he bent low to retrieve it and the dark glasses slid down his wet nose and fell to the floor where they were trampled by departing feet he snatched up cane and glasses holding each in a tight fist and now his vision was blurred not by sweat but tears he turned his crying face to another passenger and the man stepped backward slowly in that new york drill of no sudden movements while encountering a lunatic for the moment victor the faux blind man had truly lost his sight as he fought his way to the door of the train colliding with those who were boarding tears falling his mouth wide open in a silent scream he waved his cane in the air and the crowd magically backed away as he rushed off the train stepping onto the platform which might well have been a dark hole for all he knew he made his way toward what he hoped was the exit looked up and saw a bright patch of daylight victor scrambled up the stairs stumbling on every second step and out onto the sidewalk breathing deep and blinking like a mole he opened one fist to see the twisted frames of his sunglasses then put them on lopsided as they were he fancied himself to be all but invisible now and fearless and then he spotted riker and he was terrified riker walked the streets of tribeca craning his neck to look up at the buildings unabashed at playing the gawking tourist he loved this town terrible and wonderful each time he turned a corner he walked into another state of mind though he might flirt with mexico he could never leave this great grand bitch city it had him by the balls his immediate surroundings lacked the hustle of the financial district or any other distinctive marker tribeca was a shifty character among new york neighborhoods there was no quirky definition to the facades her face gave no clue to her intentions between the sprawling yuppie lofts and the holeinthewall bodegas anything might be going on riker glanced over one shoulder just checking his back he was vaguely unsettled by the blurred shape of a dark coat disappearing round a corner but this was beyond squinting distance for a man who would not wear eyeglasses in public he caught only the impression of a splash of bright red and a long slice of white on black was this another stalker one of the people who followed him day in and day out no this feeling was only nerves nothing more this was his mantra as he headed toward a renovated warehouse home to a slew of small commercial ventures the sign in one thirdfloor window advertised classes in selfdefense if the feds had ever followed jo this far that would have been their first guess for her business at this address after entering the building he followed mallorys instructions emerging from the elevator on the third floor there was a sign on the fire door at the end of the hall large block letters that even he could read told him that there was no access from the stairwell side clever jo had picked this location well no covert surveillance crew would have dared to use the elevator and risk a hallway encounter with her according to mallory the offices that did not advertise their businesses were rented on timeshares and paid for in cash always a good sign of criminal activity neither the tenants nor ataxevading landlord would readily share information with local police or government cops and any verbal inquiries by a tall blonde with memorable green eyes would have gotten back to jo and put her on guard mallory must have been so pissed off on his way down the hall he looked in on the karate class of women slamming one another to floor mats they were playing roles of victims and attackers and deeply bowing with entirely too much courtesy he wondered if these students understood that their training would only help them if a real rapist agreed to strike the classroom poses then the guy would have to wait for the women to kick him in the right place and maybe given a goodnatured pervert time would be allowed for a second shot if they missed the testicles on the first try he continued on down the hall and found a young man in conversation with an elderly janitor the pair stood in front of the room that was rikers own destination youre late theyve already started said the old man with his cluster of keys in hand he unlocked the door for the other visitor not wanting to disturb a meeting in progress by using the buzzer riker followed the other man through the door nodding his thanks to the janitor as if he had also come here by invitation in order to find out which of the many doors led to jos rented rooms he guessed that mallory poor kid had probably been forced to plant illegal eavesdropping equipment in every office on this floor he could never ask her about that but it was a safe bet upon entering the small reception area he could hear jos voice behind a closed door she was welcoming the new arrival instead of following the other man into the next room riker settled into a shabby chair with worn upholstery and pretended to read a magazine plucked from the only table more people entered this waiting room and now he knew that mallory had been right about the members of this select group for he recognized these two visitors the little girl tugged on her mothers hand wanting to stop awhile by rikers chair saying i remember you mr rikerr the childs mother was more enthusiastic with her own greeting fortunately her voice was too soft to carry above the conversation in the next room the woman reached for his hand and pumped it up and down grinning widely so happy to see him thank you thank you so much she caressed her childs curly dark hair not the same little girl you met the night the the night your husband cracked half the bones in your face the night you killed the bastard with a kitchen knife the damage was still visible in the broken planes of the mothers cheek and nose riker remembered her injuries well the catching detective had called him to this womans home while the blood was still wet on her kitchen floor and droplets streamed down the walls an assistant da had made the call of justifiable homicide and the confessed killer the victims own wife was not charged the crime scene had been released to the cleaners that same night for the mother and her child were poor they had nowhere else to go riker knew that feeling jo his new trainee had been his helper on that pro bono job and he well remembered this little girl the witness to an assault on her mother and the death of her father what a difference once she had been a painful reminder of kathy mallory at the same age same look about the eyes back in the days when he was still allowed to call his partner kathy the former street kid had been more determined to hold on to her own emotional wounds insisting that her history belonged to her alone and as a child she had dealt with it alone and so quietly without tears or complaint without recovery or repair but this little girl before him now was making a comeback a return to humanity her eyes were no longer adult and wary when she smiled for him jo had done a good job what a pity that there had been no talented dr apollo to heal young kathy and while he was admiring this less damaged child the mother expressed her thanks to neds crime scene cleaners for the generosity of providing a therapy group mallory had uncovered the function of these rented rooms weeks ago but riker had only learned of it today and now one mystery was solved jos work on homicides was her introduction to the survivors trauma victims all mallory must have been so disappointed to find no money motive here that far from working a fiddle on the side for profit dr apollo was applying her old trade free of charge but trust a cop to come up with a sinister reason for acts of charity the young detective had damned the doctor with the filthy crime of atonement and now he remembered the gist of mallorys final caustic remark for her next act johanna apollo would be washing the feet of lepers expiating what sin mother and child disappeared into the next room and riker listened to the healing balm of jos conversation on the other side of the door he closed his eyes to be alone with that voice that also spoke to him mallory slid her lock picks into the back pocket of her jeans then opened the door to rikers apartment as always her first impulse was to open a window but riker might notice the missing smell of stale smoke and the sweet rot of leftover food other emotions were in play revulsion and the almost unbearable desire to create order out of this unholy mess but intuition and distrust held sway and led her to the fireplace and there she found the evidence against him there were no signs of a burnt log in the grate only the flat ashes and remnants of papers a few of dr apollos notes one of these pages might have explained rikers cryptic line about the wine well this was not the plan not her plan riker was running a different game there could be no other explanation for this travesty of ashes it was like cheating at chess also rikers game or once upon a time it was there was no chess set in this apartment she had looked for it on previous expeditions recalling the set he had thrown away and wondering if he had bought a new one evidently he never played anymore and mallory sometimes wondered if she might be the cause of that as the foster child of helen and inspector louis markowitz most of her babysitters had been cops the markowitzes early experiments with civilians had all ended badly tender old ladies and teenage girls had proven no match for a tenyearold semireformed street thief out of all her cop wardens riker had had the most staying power he had taught her to sit still for hours he had taught her to play chess the child had loved the game but hated losing and she had devised schemes of distraction to cheat him one night his hand had been faster than hers he had captured her tiny fist which had barely concealed a stolen chessman the pawn that had previously blocked her hopes of bringing down rikers queen is this fun for you kid those had been his last words to her that night she had watched him pick up a letter opener and gouge the cheap plastic pawn with a a for kathy he set it on his mantelpiece then tossed the other chessmen into the trash can along with the board and never mentioned it again no punishment no lecture nothing but silence and he never ratted her out to her foster parents secrets had such power every night for a week that ruined pawn on rikers mantel was the last thing young kathy thought about before she went to sleep guilt was not in her vocabulary she was simply mystified this puzzle followed the little girl all through the days she bought a new chess set actually paid for it instead of stealing one every day after school she carted her chessmen and her board to special crimes unit and sat for long hours in the squads lunchroom waiting after three days riker finally came in to play she lost lost every game game after game for a week and then she won and then while riker was still at work she broke into his apartment and stole that defaced pawn from his mantelpiece she had it still it was in the back of her closet hidden in the small box of a childs treasures shoplifted items and baseball cards during her years as a cop what sometimes passed for conscience was an echo of riker asking is this fun for you kid yes yes it was she loved to win and she did not cheat the pieces of evidence that worked against her cases she won because she was good and because she was not above unlawful entry robbing data banks and lying like crazy but she never destroyed evidence mallory stared at the ashes in rikers fireplace well the man was not in his right mind and she blamed dr apollo for this yes it was the doctors fault mallory fixed this thought in her mind and pushed away the idea that she was cheating the pieces to hold riker harmless and blameless atthe end of the hour when the last of the patients had filed out riker entered the next room to catch the psychiatrist unawares amid a clutter of wet tissues ashtrays and paper coffee cups this was jo transformed earlier he had only glimpsed her from a distance and only the back of her shawl most of his observation time had been devoted to the long expanse of nylon stockings below the short skirt oh and the high heels stilettos his personal favorites but now he was staring at her winedark lipstick and it shocked him until this moment he had only seen her face naked hey jo she was folding metal chairs and leaning them against the wall when she turned to see him standing near the door guilt was there to read in her face and her body language her head lowered and her hands folded in prayer as if asking forgiveness for her crimes his partner would have loved this moment but riker was not enjoying his role this afternoon he was at war with himself always inexplicably happy to be in the same room with jo he was also unsettled by suspicion a symptom of mallorys poison aw lady what have you done he kept his silence waiting for jo to speak there was a rhythm to an interrogation and it came as naturally to him as breathing he was already predicting her opening gambit and laying plans to stun her and knock her sensibilities loose from their moorings so youve read everything she said and now you want an explanation she slowly settled down on a chair head bowed in the timehonored posture of the police interview how many times had she been through this before his face was somber as he walked toward her you know who the reaper is jo shook her head that wasnt a question lady agent kidd told you thats what brought you to new york the reapers here isnt he timothy never told me then you worked it out on your own youd have to be as paranoid as timothy to been there said riker the reaper was the guy he met in the liquor store i believe his story and now he saw shock in her eyes and something else fresh guilt yes and he nodded to say ican read your damnmind aloud he said but you didnt believe him did you jo not then not till he died and now you know all my secrets she smiled to pass this off as banter i failed him badly what about bunny that poor homeless bastard what was that all about did you use him for a sparring partner is that how it started just a little practice for the main event thats not fair yeah life sucks he stood before her not bending one bit forcing her to look up at him as he was looking out at her as if across a great gulf and what about mugs i think that cat keeps you in a constant state of alert hard to tell when hell go ballistic isnt it good practice for a scary situation or is mugs your burglar alarm wouldnt take much to set him off and sometimes a cat is just a cat i love mugs i do then dont take chances jo live a long life cause if you die you know whatll happen to that cat if youre not around to protect him hell get kicked in the teeth by the next cop he mauls nobodys gonna take him to the vet and put him down with a nice painless needle whoever finds him first is gonna stomp him into the rug or maybe mugs will get away with just a few missing teeth and some cracked ribs she rose from the chair then picked up a plastic bag and collected a fallen tissue from the floor clearly announcing the end of this conversation not so fast jo not quite yet i wont be coming back to work she avoided his eyes and her voice became more formal as if he were a stranger just one more cop to deal with i left my resignation with miss byrd yeah i heard so youll want your suitcase back yes she walked about the room bending low to pick up the cups and to empty the ashtrays into a plastic bag if you dont mind could you drop it off at my hotel no i dont think so his voice was flat giving away nothing as he pulled one of neds business cards from his wallet youll have to come and get it he scrawled his address on the back of the card then left it on the metal chair my place seven oclock ill cook you bring the wine jo walked everywhere in grace and so the stumble gave her away knowing his preference for cheap bourbon and beer she would probably bet her stock portfolio that he did not own a corkscrew and now her thoughts must go to the wine in the bottom drawer of her armoire riker ambled across the floor taking his own time he paused at the far end of the room and turned around to stare at her all the trappings of a cop fell away for a moment and he was only a man as easily killed as any other and she could kill him with words a look he wanted to say something to her something personal ducking his head a bare inch as if expecting a hail of laughter for this foolish unspoken idea he held her glance a moment longer before turning back to the door these days he left every room with a bang not so loud as a paralyzing gunshot just a satisfying slam that rattled every door in its frame chapter riker could not say how he happened to find himself so far uptown in the neighborhood of wealth from long habit his feet knew the route of subway stairs and sidewalks leading to this park avenue apartment building a liveried doorman greeted him with genuine affection and another fiver traveled from rikers pocket to his though there was nothing new to report even at this posh address betrayal was cheap and affordable riker stepped back to the curb and looked up at one lighted window a pale woman hovered there expectant this was the mother of the boy who had ambushed him her face was so much like her sons though she lacked that wildeyed look of crazy all the time her eyes were only fearful of him that much detail could not be seen on such a high floor he simply knew this to be true and the woman knew if her child came home again riker would kill him as if reading his thoughts the woman shrank back from the window and riker bowed his head in the manner of a shamed terrorist who has brought his bomb to the wrong door he carried himself away from this innocent woman and walked on down the broad avenue a man waiting to explode mallorys small tan car pulled up in front of the park avenue building the wealthy tenants a man and a woman withdrew to the safety of the lobby preferring to communicate via the doorman their conduit to the outside world over the past six months they had grown skittish and shy of being waylaid by reporters and they had come to fear police their faces were pale from infrequent forays into the sunlight as mallory left her car and approached the doorman she glanced at the couple on the other side of the glass entryway they were staring at her discussing her then they caught her eye and now they fled across the lobby toward the elevator she wondered if they knew about the doormans profits and how easily he sold their private lives mallory the doorman moved toward her edging sideways like a crab wanting no one from the buildings interior to see the folding money that he anticipated you told me riker wouldnt be back he feigned a sigh ah those poor people i dont think they can handle any more of this i said id take care of it she handed him a bill much larger than any of rikers shabby bribes instantly renewing this mans friendship and allegiance he pocketed his money then gave her a broad smile that said screw those poor people what can i do for you today what did riker want same old thing he asked if theyd left the building in the last few days oh yeah and did they have any new visitors and you said they dont go nowhere they dont see nobody he looked over one shoulder to be sure that the lobby was clear of prying eyes the missus she feels sorry for riker but the misters really steamed but no threats right they didnt call in a complaint naw they dont want any more trouble with the cops the truth mallory they were more afraid of their own kid than riker poor bastard i told em the guys a little nuts but not the dangerous kind of crazy not like that son of he stopped abruptly correctly intuiting that she would do him some damage if he continued with this line of prattle hes not crazy she said dont you put that idea in their heads one more time mallory felt no compassion for the parents of rikers shooter those poor people had spent a million dollars on lawyers so their son would be free to ambush a cop you tell them i dont want to hear about any harassment complaints make that real clear had that sounded sufficiently menacing yes the doorman was backstepping she wanted fear to be the strong point of his translation when he carried her message back to those millionaires with their psychotic genes and good lawyers they had always known what kind of monster they had raised yet they had not locked the boy away and now they had no right to whine about the damaged man who sometimes haunted park avenue in honor of johannas visit the dirty laundry had been stashed in his bedroom where yesterdays socks joined the pairs previously scattered about the front room while riker waited he began to see his apartment through mrs ortegas eyes he regretted tossing out the cleaning woman before she could do much more than leave her little footprints in the dust a man could lose a corpse beneath the mound of black plastic garbage bags piling near the door how much time had passed since he had last been inspired to carry out trash on collection night weeks a month he looked at his watch then dismissed the idea that mrs ortega might make an emergency house call after closing the doors to the kitchen and bathroom two problems were solved and now he rationalized away the rest of the mess in the front room the state of this litter pit would take the lady by surprise she would never see the first shot coming and the walls were thick if she screamed no one would hear it mallory passed through the stairwell door and entered the squad room of special crimes unit a large space with a haphazard arrangement of desks and one wall banked with tall grimy windows overlooking the narrow soho street six men were working overtime tonight filling in the gap left by rikers forced departure and her own unauthorized sabbatical the detectives sat amid the clutter and litter of their caseloads files and notes and coffee cups shouting questions at one another barking deli orders to a police aide and holding telephone conversations all noise and motion ceased the men lifted their heads in the unison of chorus girls with shoulder holsters their eyes were trained on the squads lone female as she crossed the room to her desk the only desk at perfect right angles to the wall three days ago this had been the most fanatically neat work space on the planet no more the locks on the drawers had been pried open leaving scratch marks on the metal the contents had been pawed over and jumbled some of it strewn across her blotter and the rest was on the floor case files and notebooks lay open and her penchant for compulsive neatness was exposed in the spill of a drawer stocked with cleaning supplies but mallory did not implode and hope died all around the room for the show was obviously over and hardly worth the wait the frozen tableau came back to life as talking and shouting resumed and papers shuffled mallory turned to detective janos a man with the large and solid build of a refrigerator that could talk and quote milton he had a brutal face that appealed to parents and parole officers alike one that could frighten their charges into good behavior and his was the most compassionate face in the squad room tonight but sympathy was not what mallory wanted he rose from his chair and slowly ambled toward her ruined desk shaking his head to convey the commiserations of aint it a shame and whats this world coming to his voice was incongruously soft when he said i know what it looks like kid but nothing was taken he hunkered down to retrieve a can of metal polish that had rolled under her chair this is coffeys work said mallory lieutenant coffey might as well have gouged his name into the metal alongside all the other scratches no one else would have dared to desecrate her personal space janos shot a glance at the window that ran the length of the lieutenants private office the blinds were drawn and the door was closed i wouldnt go in there right now if i were you the boss just got rid of two vultures from internal affairs they found out that riker was working fulltime for his brother ned he doesnt work there anymore i took care of that but he did work there janos the quintessential gentleman was on his knees picking up the case files and notes strewn at her feet and the whole time riker was working he collected checks for full disability he never cashed those checks mallory snatched the papers from his hands before he could put them into the wrong drawer and riker only took a job after the department stopped his payroll deposits oh the lieutenant knows that said janos gathering pens and paper clips into his large meaty hands and thats what he told ia then he told em riker was railroaded into a pension and showed em a copy of the appeal forms and then he says where do you bastards get off harassing a decorated cop a wounded cop so the boss holds up four fingers and im thinkin naw thats three too many but then he yells four bullet wounds count my fingers you morons i thought that was a real nice touch and then the bastards left real fast case closed mallory stared at her violated desk but thats got nothing to do with why coffey popped all these locks right im getting to that janos dumped his collection of small objects into her top drawer with no regard for the correct compartments of the plastic desk organizer mallory bit back a rebuke and quickly slotted the paper clips pens and pencils into the proper square and rectangular wells the district attorney sent one of his twits over here to hassle you said janos he wanted the package you promised the trials tomorrow and hes a little antsy about it and that would be all the evidence she had been asked to develop for a pending court case it had taken only a few hours to gather it and she had done that three days ago but never turned it in coffey tried to reach you the large detective rose to a stand holding her feather duster delicately between his thumb and forefinger but you dont answer your beeper anymore im on comp time she snatched the feather duster and dropped it into its proper place she planned to close this lower drawer quietly not wanting to give the other men the satisfaction of a slam but mallory you never actually did the paperwork for time off she slammed the drawer causing heads to turn and she never bothered to lower her voice if i put in for all the extra hours ive racked up since rikers been gone the city would go broke paying you off i know but the boss thinks you spent the last three days attached to the das office now he finds out theyve never seen your face not once so you sat there and watched him bust my desk open what could i do i already told him i hadnt heard from you this week how was i gonna explain all your evidence wrapped up nice and neat in my top drawer so i had a patrol cop run your package downtown record time sirens all the way the assistant da was still in the squad room when his office called to tell him they had everything they needed for court well now this jerk has to apologize to lieutenant coffey the boss loved that so thats one point on your side but its not the real reason he broke all my locks im guessing no janos waved one hand as if hoping to pluck just the right words from the air and now he frowned preparing her for the worst it was his style to break all bad news in a slow and maddeningly gentle fashion you see right before the das man showed up the boss got this phone call you know an excop named rawlins he works for highland security maybe the lieutenant thinks youre working a second job on the side he knows better said mallory jack coffey understood that her only illegal sideline was butler and company what else it has something to do with that shockjock ian zachary janos threw up his hands thats all i got he looked up at the ceiling well almost i know its tied to that private dick rawlins the guys phone call really irritated the boss the translation of that softsold comment was mallorys vision of jack coffey going ballistic with a crowbar she could see him ripping into her desk venting all his animosity with vandalism i got an idea this is serious trouble janos nodded toward the lieutenants private office so act real polite when you go in there dont say anything to get on his bad side okay yeah right riker parted his curtains to look down at the street jo was walking alone coming from the direction of the subway and there were no feds in sight mallory was right jo could lose her federal watchers at will that would also explain why she traveled on trains when she could afford cabs and limousines it was harder to track someone underground so many ways to lose a subject in a string of cars and all the station stops the intercom buzzed he pressed the talk button not waiting to hear her voice hey jo come on up he tapped the next button to admit her to the building then opened his front door by a crack and listened for the rising elevator he watched her step out into the hallway it was a cold evening and she wore a down jacket shaped like a dark blue hand grenade riding above her long bluejeaned legs in less than fifteen minutes he would look back on this moment and recognize it as a warning he opened the door a little wider then backed up to the wall she entered slowly head turning from side to side so suspicious of an unlocked apartment but she never looked behind her he stepped out from the wall and punched her arm so jo did that hurt what she whirled around stunned as one hand covered her upper arm where he had hit her with a closed fist you know it hurt why would good every civilian should take a body blow just once in their lives then they wouldnt freeze up always anticipating the first punch first pain he stepped toward her and educable jo stepped back let me take your jacket he said itll hurt more without all that padding you jerk oh all the women say that and this was actually true so what are your physical limitations jo my what if you take a punch to the back would that cause permanent damage he raised his fists and her eyes rounded but this time she did not back away from him all right jo use your hands to deflect the shots stay alert here comes another one his fist feinted toward her face missing it by a bare inch feel the air now imagine a bloody nose why riker she only stood there so exposed making no move to protect herself jo had disabled him with nothing more than large brown eyes full of absolute trust youve never hit a woman in your life have you this is not who you are and who are you jo youre a refugee from a witness protection program and you keep shaking off your bodyguards he had no more heart for this and she knew it his arms fell to his sides and his voice had lost its edge he was all but pleading now i only want you to have a sporting chance to stay alive who else would teach her how to break a mans nose with the palm of her hand without guidance how would she ever learn to pluck out the jelly of an eyeball with one finger his resolve returned this was the only way to keep her alive his hands were rising i wont do this riker not with you im not giving you a choice jo but ill make it easy he opened his arms wide to expose his chest as an easy target your turn take your best shot she walked toward him slow and deliberate smiling to tell him that all was forgiven and then lieutenant coffey was a man of average height and even his hair and eyes were in that middling range of brown he was young for a command position only thirtysix but he had compensated for that by prematurely aging to fit the job acquiring worry lines that gave his otherwise bland face more character he glanced at his watch it was just after seven oclock and he had no hope of escaping his office anytime soon two of his key people were missing how was he going to fill that hole without more budgetbreaking overtime in his desk drawer was a letter from the commissioner asking why he had not yet replaced detective sergeant riker how long could he ignore that instruction when would riker sign the appeal forms and was internal affairs planning another assault would highland security keep silent about the latest fiasco would the acid eventually eat through his stomach lining and when god when was this ugly day going to end jack coffeys eyes rolled up to the ceiling but no answers were written there the door was opening there had been no knock and that always irritated him but could his mood be worse ah and now he was graced with a visit from his only female detective if not for mallory he might look years younger if he fired her today he might keep the hair that was left around the bald spot at the back of his head and the tension headaches would go away she stood on the threshold arms folded glaring at him i want a new desk she said a brandnew desk the lieutenant smiled against his will this preemptive strike telegraphed that mallory knew she was in trouble he pointed to a chair sit he was hardly surprised that she remained standing she paused awhile to peruse his paperwork reading upside down in a violation of his personal space was this payback for her broken desk now she sat down mallory had only one basic strategy offensive in every sense of that word i got an interesting phone call today he tapped his pencil on the desktop and this was the only giveaway that he was angry for his voice was remarkably calm it was an excop who runs highland security the guys name is rawlins you know him ive talked to him she said how predictable that she would answer that question truthfully for what was the point of getting caught in a little lie mallory was a big believer in truth administered in small doses to improve upon a falsehood done with chitchat coffey dropped his pencil rawlins wanted to talk to our covert ops detective well i told him we didnt have one of those nothing that fancy in special crimes unit then rawlins says oh shitl jack coffey leaned forward now why should that make me think of you he paused a beat allowing this remark to register with her so i said you must mean mallory oh yeah now the guys more relaxed he thinks that stunt you pulled on him might actually be legal so then he tells me this radio celebrity sent his company a huge retainer now rawlins wants to know what theyre supposed to do with the guys check since thanks to you theyre not doing any work to earn it i said id get back to him ill tell him not to cash the check thats it if he waited for her to defend her actions he would wait forever but she had no idea that his best shot was still coming im really worried about you mallory youve never been this sloppy before such messy tracks did that get her attention well no but he pressed on anyway two days ago ian zachary calls highland security to set up an appointment five minutes later you call rawlins and tell him youre taking over and he should keep his mouth shut five minutes you shouldve waited longer mallory now i have to figure you intercepted zacharys phone call i dont remember asking any judges for warrants to tap a radio stations telephone so of course you have some other explanation i have a snitch at the station said mallory thats how i knew about the call to the security company nothing in her tone said that she expected him to believe this it was a lie but it would do in the event that internal affairs turned its eyes back to special crimes unit and now for his next leap of inspiration he said im guessing this all ties back to riker somehow he could see that she was not planning to elaborate on that but there was no other explanation she was good damn good even better than lou markowitz in the days when her old man had commanded this squad it was unlike her to mess up so badly some personal aspect was affecting her judgment and now he allowed it to affect his own mallory get out your damn notebook thats an order ive got a list for you and i want every item to be perfectly clear her expression said yeah right however she produced a small pad of paper from her back pocket as a token appeasement im on comp time this might have to wait a few thats the first item you dont get any more time off ive got at least fifty hours of no comp time he could see the next argument coming and he put up one hand to prevent her from mouthing off you used your badge to muscle highland security so now you cover your tracks open a case file for ian zachary im guessing he wants security because of the reaper those homicides belong to the feds so make out paperwork for a celebrity stalker throw in some anonymous tips and dont forget to backdate your file by two days he slammed the desk with one hand i want to see you writing this down mallory she bowed her head over the notebook and her pen began to move a small victory next item he said if theres an active phone tap at that radio station make it go away if that comes back on this squad ill fire your ass in a heartbeat and the last little detail zachary thinks he has paid security so you keep that son of a bitch alive officially thats your new job he thinks im his private investigator not his babysitter he better not die on your watch get out of my office for months riker had avoided saloons in the precinct of his old squad and now a local bartender flashed a broad smile long time no see the man said as he set down two drinks on cocktail napkins bourbon and water for riker rye for jo another woman one he had dated casually had broken up with him in this same soho bar there were many such landmarks in new york city over the past twenty years since his divorce no relationship had lasted longer than a few months some of the women had left him in restaurants and others had dumped him on street corners only now did he get around to wondering how he had erred in those brief encounters it worried him that jo might walk away before they even got started i promised you a meal he said theres a nice little place around the corner a woman named donna had dumped him there you like italian no thanks maybe some other night she glanced at her watch i should be leaving now its early he said it was late dont go his feet were tapping a rung of the bar stool and his hands were sweating neither of these symptoms had anything to do with the damage this woman had recently done to him jo rolled up her sweatshirt sleeve the better to see the bruise blooming on her right arm she glanced at his crotch does it still hurt naw dont worry about it i had it coming you mean you never saw it coming my fathers best advice kick a man in the soft parts and run like hell well im glad you stuck around jo that took guts most women wouldve been unnerved to see a man cry like that an hour ago she had kicked him in the testicles and then impressed by his suave fetal posture and groin clutching she had shared the contents of a pharmacy bottle with him pain pills strong ones evidently jo and agony were old acquaintances the lady had called it right he was a jerk but she was a good sport jo had suggested this pub crawl through soho for medicinal purposes your colors better she said not quite so pale youre a very good patient better than timothy kidd you were treating him right now she was taken by surprise if he had only thought of this earlier he could have mugged her with words and saved himself a world of hurt a few moments passed in uneasy silence did she regret coming out with him tonight there was time in this lull to notice that she was wearing perfume though they had lifted many a glass at the end of a workday he never had been so close to her almost touching shoulders he breathed deep and stared at the red stain on her glass her lipstick fascinated and flattered him believing as he did that she had tricked herself out on his account though she was otherwise her old jeansandsweatshirt self youve been talking to marvin argus she said he told you timothy was my patient well he lied he does that a lot she pulled the down jacket from the back of her stool preparing to end the evening wait jo so it was a different kind of relationship you and agent kidd you were close i figured out that much lovers would you find that hard to believe riker he shook his head and he must have done a fine job of communicating that he was not at all surprised that any man would want her that he wanted her for she seemed contrite sorry she smiled less anxious to leave him now timothy was my friend riker sometimes got lost in jos eyes foolishly dropping the threads of his thoughts he wanted to know if she had also worn lipstick for the murdered fbi man instead he asked how did you two meet he came by my office asking for help on a case the reaper case her head moved slightly from side to side more in wonder than denial perhaps like most civilians she assumed police omniscience and now she was surprised by his ignorance but how could he be wrong about this well the fed was killed by the reaper logical connection right and its like you said jo argus lies a lot so help me out here that fed was not the only liar riker was already laying plans to hunt down mallory to back her up against a wall and find out what else she had held out on him but for now he must wing it so thats not when you met agent kidd when the murders no i met him before the first juror died no one had even heard of the reaper yet and marvin argus met timothy after the second murder they didnt work together no timothy worked out of washington dc argus is based in chicago and he wasnt investigating the reaper case either argus was only responsible for rounding up jurors and witnesses for protective custody he probably thought timothy was in town to check up on him the second juror died in arguss custody so jo in your professional opinion which one of these agents was the most paranoid she smiled timothy no contest he cultivated paranoia thought it enhanced his insight and maybe it did after two minutes he could tell you your life story and how it would end or thats what he thought ill show you how he did it now remember this isnt my style my trade takes more time she nodded toward a lone patron between two vacant stools at the other end of the bar hes perfect for one of timothys stunts the young mans greasy hair was parted down the center and bluntly chopped off below his ears he was smiling at some lame joke he had told himself and one pudgy hand tapped out the rhythm of a tune that only he could hear his polyester shirtsleeves were buttoned down and his collar buttoned up riker noted the pocket protector lined with pens and mechanical pencils without looking underneath the bar he knew the pants would be black with shiny knees jo colored in the rest i saw him walk in hes wearing heavy correctional shoes but theres nothing wrong with his feet trust me id know by the walk hes probably been wearing them since childhood theres a whiff of smothering mother in that detail he lives with her thats why he still wears those shoes and no barber cuts his hair that way his mother does it and shes always picked out his clothes thats why he never fit in with the other kids at grammar school all his life shes destroyed any possibility of a friend his own age coming between them he wishes hed killed her while he was still in his formative years maybe nine or ten thats when the matricide fantasy started when he finally gets around to murdering mommy youll find him at the crime scene probably the kitchen knife in hand hell be very cooperative with the police and very proud riker was not impressed with what the fbi agent had taught her it was only a parlor game compared to the real carnage bloody and insane that was the daily work of special crimes unit the profiler tricks had never solved a single case never replaced solid police work and as jo had pointed out this was not her style either he picked his next words carefully i have to wonder why youre doing kidds old act good job though i bet youve been practicing since he died she met his eyes then looked down at her drink its only a game yeah and thats why your friend never wouldve made the cut for special crimes i was a better detective jos head lifted slightly and he could read her thoughts though she would never voice this aloud she clearly had a higher opinion of the murdered agents brains and talent i didnt say i was smarter jo but i was better no tricks no flimflam i was the genuine article a cop i dont need to look at your hair and your clothes to tell where youve been and where youre going i only had to read your notes on agent kidd and the liquor store and now those notes were ashes in his fireplace along with the paper trail for her wine she started to rise he put one hand on her arm to keep her with him you think you were close enough to that poor dead bastard to crawl inside his skin you collect the reapers favorite wine because thats what crazy timothy kidd wouldve done and thats why you only cleaned homicide crime scenes it made you feel closer to his job his life youre actually hunting the freak who killed him youre not a woman in hiding that hotel is a damn goldfish bowl it must drive the feds crazy trying to protect you covering foot traffic and all the exits and now youre really good at ditching those bodyguards whenever you like youve been practicing that too think you can actually finish kidds job for him am i close jo i think i am because you wont even look at me and here the conversation ended jo was done with him she slid off the bar stool and moved toward the door donning her jacket on the fly long legs carrying her out to the street and away his gut was tied in knots prior to meeting jo he had no idea that it could physically hurt him to lose a womans company this was not the way he had wanted the evening to end if he could have been any crazier about jo he would have shot her in the leg to prevent her from leaving him tonight and me without my gun once the door had closed on johanna apollo the bar became a desolate place and then he remembered that she had worn lipstick perfume too that fed him awhile as he followed her away from the bar and down the deserted street they went twenty yards between them heading toward the glowing green balls that lighted the way down to the underground station during the subway ride he kept her in sight through the window of a trailing train car and though he was right behind her as she made her way up the stairs to the chelsea sidewalk she had no clue that he was there and watching over her he stayed with her as far as the hotel where a nervous fbi agent was pacing before the front door and then sadly riker turned around and left for his job was done he had seen the lady home chapter ian zachary was thoroughly pleased with the young investigator from highland security the tall blonde was beyond cool sunglasses at night ah but were those armani shades a disguise or an affectation his lawyers had warned him that he trod a fine line between freedom of speech and felony entertainment the authorities would always be close by waiting for him to trip over fcc regulations and federal laws however this woman was not from any tribe of bureaucrats and hardly the type for undercover police work days ago her bad attitude had made an excellent first impression the expression of ennui her tone of voice and stance all said to him at their first encounter youre a cockroach you know it and i know it now that had attracted him to her but it was the fabulous black leather coat that had actually sold him on this criterion alone he placed her at the top of her profession the other investigators hired and fired in quick succession had been discount shoppers every one he also admired the more mundane aspects of his lovely private cop from the dangerous bulge in the tailored line of her cashmere blazer he knew that she carried a very large weapon and he had sexual fantasies about this woman in handcuffs but in all the most realistic scenarios he was the one who wore them the investigator entered his studio while he was racking up a pretaped interview for his audience not trusting his insane engineer to do this right he leaned into a stationary microphone saying crazy bitch take a break and now that they were guaranteed some privacy he turned to the blonde from highland security wasting no time on civility she handed him a fat manila envelope that bore the name of johanna apollos employer an exdetective from special crimes unit over the past few months her predecessors had failed to turn up anything in rikers habits or his history that was even mildly dishonest as zachary perused her paperwork he smiled liking what he saw the evidence of a man living beyond his means and that would explain why nypd had gotten rid of detective sergeant riker ive got another job for you can you stick around a few minutes just the barest inclination of her head passed for a nod he turned another page of the dossier my god this is what he pays for rent his apartment must be a palace and whats the deal with rikers first name he doesnt have one she said i checked his birth certificate just the initial p and it cost you five hundred dollars to have me wait in line for his records you want to waste more money on that no this is fine there was contempt in everything she said to him and he loved it she stared at the lighted screen of his laptop computer so this is your database even that sounded like an insult yes thats it he said couldnt play the game without it are you any good with computers without bothering to answer him she sat down at his console and tapped the laptop keyboard creating split screens to view two files at once he watched all these images quickly flicker and change as she scanned his entire repository of fan sightings and personal information on the twelve jurors living and dead all the easy ones have been murdered he said those were the idiots who gave television interviews so my fans had their names and photographs im sure your lawyers had all the background stats on your jury addresses too right so why didnt you give the fans i couldnt he paused wondering if he had just admitted to a crime legally he had not been entitled to any of that information my lawyers wont let me its a technicality he watched the file change to the related murder of agent timothy kidd next she scrolled the file on a national hunt for a major player the chelsea hotel was the only highlighted address out of hundreds on the screen the investigator glanced in his direction so your fans located dr apollo but you never mentioned her on the air she used to be in a witness protection program the fbi got a gag order from a federal judge if i just say her name on the air im toast and the station loses its license so i screen out all the hunchback calls thats why you want her to do an interview you think dr apollos going to expose herself on national radio unspoken were the words you fool you underestimate me he said her mouth dipped on one side to tell him that this was not possible next job he handed her a sheaf of papers with the name and last known address of a surviving juror as well as drawings of the mans face i bought those sketches from a courtroom artist i want you to find information on this man but dont tell anyone the sketches came from me your attorneys wouldnt like that would they cause and effect that ties back to you just a minor departure from the game format he said the fans are a bit slow in developing solid leads i want your report in the form of anonymous email and for gods sake dont use a computer from highland security his lawyers would go into cardiac arrest if they knew he was stepping outside the rules and gathering his own data she pocketed the papers never taking her eyes off the screen and the latest sightings for fresh victims how stupid are your fans you think they know what theyre doing well its pretty basic he said tracking down helpless people so they can get their throats slit but i dont think my fans give it that much thought they call in a sighting a juror drops dead they never connect those two events its only a game right now heres where i part company with the reaper he hates imbeciles but not me without all these morons id have no show but the games getting unwieldy way too much information on the players i cant tell good data from bogus youre not really into computers are you her head turned his way but the glasses were so dark he could never be certain that her eyes were on him i can open my email he said what more do i need more sophisticated software she closed his laptop if i crossindex the fan reports by geography date and time i might get a line on the juror but first i need to install my own programs and now she was leaving with his computer under her arm wait you can do the installation here her head slowly turned in his direction dark glasses giving away nothing as she patiently waited for him to realize that they were going to do this her way she was barefoot and her feet were dirty at first riker had mistaken the strange young woman for one of the homeless insane her clothes were soiled her hair was matted and the odor of unchanged underwear was pungent yet she had identified herself as the sound engineer and personal assistant of the hottest radio star in america as he trailed her through a maze of hallways she said everyone calls me crazy bitch this nationally known victim of verbal torture and humiliation was the first showbusiness celebrity he had ever met youre really mad arent you yeah she said zack told me youd be mad lady youve got a gift for understatement crazy bitch suddenly flattened against a wall giving riker a clear view of the tall blonde in sunglasses striding down the narrow corridor he followed the example of his guide and joined up with the wall for kathy mallory was not losing any momentum this was why civilians always moved aside for her she assumed they would want to save themselves before she could walk over them or through them riker had sometimes taken advantage of that wading through crowds in her wake now she passed him by never even glancing his way as if they had never met shes from highland security said crazy bitch they cater to celebrities the sound engineer continued down the hall then stood to one side and gestured toward a doorway this is my booth she nodded toward an adjacent door with a formidable lock and that one leads to the studio zacks just signing off hell buzz you in when the delivery guy leaves riker walked into her own domain a claustrophobic space of electronics and blinking telephone lights on the other side of a plateglass window ian zachary was seated before a desk of dials and levers and one clear space for his catered meal an apronclad delivery boy laid out a late supper that no steakandpotatoes man could identify slimy round things covered with white sauce and garnished with the leaves of alien vegetables bubbling designer water was poured into a wineglass for that alone riker would have disliked the man but he had larger issues tonight a message left on his answering machine in zacharys voice and the words so whats it like to screw a hunchback the radio host flashed a smile at the uninvited guest in the soundbooth window riker wondered if this man knew him on sight or was he simply anticipating a fast reaction to his telephone message zachary tapped a button on his console after the loud buzz riker entered the studio and slammed the door behind him that made the other man jump perhaps believing that his visitor was homicidally angry he had no way to know that riker slammed all the doors in the world all the time pull up a chair babe make yourself at home riker preferred to stand he hoped his clenched fists would impart a strong desire to break the englishman in half unfortunately zachary was smiling again and taking no offense have i got a deal for you a fortune in free advertising i dont give a shit about the advertising go fuck yourself if that was possible said crazy bitch he wouldve done it already thats his big dream ian zachary stared at the woman walking toward him from the far side of the room i didnt buzz you in how did you get past the lock feeling a little less secure she leaned over the dinner tray and picked up a knife that was only good for slicing butter after scrutinizing it she pronounced it too dull she picked up the fork and nodded her approval as she held it out to riker try this go for the throat i think i might be in love said riker are you married were pretty sure shes a lesbian said zachary riker shrugged i can work around that the woman bowed low over the dinner plate and deposited a glob of mucus on the food her boss merely glanced at his ruined supper then pushed it to one side well riker you might have some reservations about her table manners you cant take her anywhere he watched his assistant stalk out of the room her bare feet slapping the floor shes totally nuts how did she get past the lock does it matter riker had watched her jam the lock with a toothpick after the delivery man had departed but he elected not to share this information if she wants to hurt you she will just get used to the idea but im first i have a business deal for you if the hunchback wont come on the shes never coming on your show i think i guessed that now i want you riker you could work with me on the reaper murders keep the show from getting stale you probably wonder why id help that freak hunt down the people who set me free you think im an ungrateful bastard and youre right about that no im thinking youre a moron apparently zachary enjoyed being insulted grinning he held up a manila envelope with rikers name printed in mallorys neat block letters i know a lot about you he dropped the envelope on the desk and pushed it in rikers direction thats your dossier no ordinary detective i understand that special crimes unit is an elite squad and my fans just love hero cops with multiple gunshot wounds i think we can work together ill give you access to everything ive got on the reaper and babe ive got plenty my fans can get me anything i want your fans are squirrels said riker youve got nothing he was leafing through mallorys background report a pack of lies and it would be a big mistake to call me babe one more time mallorys dossier had given him massive debts and a heavy mortgage for a summer house on shelter island a place that he had never even visited on the next page she had jacked up his apartment rent to an amount that only a cop on the take could afford thus painting him as a shady moneyhungry man with great bribe potential he rolled the sheets into a paper truncheon ive got no idea why the feds dont shut you down they tried in fact the fcc did suspend me for a few nights then a pack of aclu lawyers beat up their lawyers on the issue of free speech oh and then youll love this part an idiot judge lifted my suspension before the matter even went to a hearing im betting the reaper kills the last juror before the government gets my case into court bless the morons and back to my job offer in addition to all that free advertising you get paid a bundle just for no deal not so fast riker i know what you do for a living these days you clean crime scenes thats a joke job and i know you need money he nodded to the dossier i have very good sources so do i the jury verdict was a farce the chicago cops say you committed murder no mistake hard evidence and eyewitnesses and it was real cold well this is what they didnt tell you because they didnt know zachary flipped a lever on his console listen this tape was never been played on the air and now the speakers carried the sound of breaking glass and a womans voice screaming obscenities i recorded this in my old chicago studio the first time she tried to kill me she broke the window on her sound booth to get at me riker listened to the recorded voice of the shockjock describing a woman who had gone mad crunching broken glass underfoot as she rushed toward him with a broken shard in her hand he even described a cut to his chest when she opened his skin zachary turned off the machine then unbuttoned his shirt to display a jagged scar it wasnt deep not as bad as it looks the station manager called in a doctor i gave him a lame story about an accident the woman was never charged so you cant say i never gave her a break they just took her off to a hospital ten days later she was released from the psycho ward thats when she started following me around have you ever been stalked riker nodded it was a rare day when he did not have someone following him around though sometimes it was only a feeling well she came after me again on the day she died i ran into that building to get away from her but she caught up to me on the roof it was a construction site lots of workmen standing around im guessing the sling blade belonged to one of them wickedlooking knife it was in her hand when she backed me up to the wall then she rushed me so yes i pushed her off that roof i stepped to one side and helped her right over the wall the knife dropped with her but the police never found it and the workmen didnt see it in her hand and none of this came out in your trial i wouldnt let my attorneys use the tape incidentally the prosecutor had her psychiatric history years of voluntary hospital stays she was always unstable but the district attorney neglected to share that with my defense team it wouldve ruined the case against me you see i wasnt the first man she tried to kill so i had more than enough grounds for a new trial if the verdict didnt go my way if all this is true and riker was skeptical why didnt you plead selfdefense zachary leaned forward smiling tell me riker whats more intriguing a radio personality who killed a woman to save his own sorry ass or a man who got away with coldblooded murder he smiled point taken good after my acquittal i was back on the air and my ratings were the highest in the history of chicago radio and then the major networks were calling me new york city every jocks dream and national syndication and now you help the reaper kill off your own jury youre getting away with murder again only in america i love this country if you want fame and you want it fast well then youve got to kill somebody thats the american way im out of here said riker wait just hear me out all right you could be the one to catch the reaper im not a cop anymore riker turned his back on the man and walked toward the door wait three minutes thats all im asking zachary raised his voice and i wont tell my audience about the hunchback the prime suspect for the murder of an fbi agent just three minutes thats the deal the man leaned far back in his chair hands clasped behind his head making himself an easy target for a beating riker walked back to him and zachary sat up straight perhaps believing that he was about to take a blow but riker only leaned over the console to push the lever that played the chicago tape he listened to the rest of the mad womans murder attempt her screams subsiding to soft weeping as she was strapped to a gurney and taken away and now she was dead you drove that poor woman crazy riker glanced back at the sound booth and the young girl behind the glass zacharys current victim i know your style youre a damn psychopath actually im not at my trial the prosecutors shrink testified that i was a sociopath not legally crazy im also the nations foremost expert on the reaper so work with me ill get you all the information you want would you like to see an autopsy picture one of the reapers kills he opened the console drawer pulled out a glossy photograph and handed it to riker i got that from a fan who works in the chicago morgue now this is what i have in mind one of the jurors is in new york city i heard your show last night said riker leave that poor bastard alone theres something you should know about this juror macpherson your three minutes are up dont go near jo not on or off the air he pointed to the crazy woman behind the window if she can get through that lock i can after leaving the studio he paused at the open door of the sound booth to speak with the young woman inside she had freckles and that broke his heart you should quit this job he said just walk away i cant her eyes had a hint of gratitude and mild surprise was also there kindness would be something rare to her these days she was like a child on the verge of tears though she was smiling when she said i want to be famous riker nodded silently responding with ian zacharys words in his head then youve got to kill somebody chapter on the sidewalk outside the radio station riker was greeted by a small band of excited people their outstretched hands held pens and autograph books disappointment set in as they quickly identified him as a nobody then turned their attentions back to the door waiting for someone more worthy somebody famous mallorys tan sedan was not among the vehicles along the curb riker focused on the one parked some distance away nothing about this automobile would set it apart from the rest but the suit and tie of the man behind the wheel was the standout feature of a security detail after the midnight hour this was no longer a neighborhood of suits riker approached the car at a blindside angle then ripped open the door and slid into the front seat beside a startled fbi agent i wanna see marvin argus right here right nowl while waiting for argus the time passed in easy conversation with the local fbi man whose military service was thirty years behind him though he still wore the crew cut and retained the hard body of his army days agent hennessey was not much of a drinker and liked the early morning hours best but the two men did find a common ground in their hatred of divorce lawyers from force of habit riker cultivated every contact with the new york bureau tonight establishing rapport had been easy almost instant thanks to all the old newspaper headlines on his ambush by a psychotic teenager so quite naturally the two men discussed the lighter side of getting shot in the line of duty agent hennessey had a bullet wound of his own he assured riker that come summer bathing suit weather the scars would be magnets for bikiniclad cop groupies more bonding occurred after discovering that they were both addicts two cigarette embers glowed in the dark of the car and riker learned that hennesseys bureau chief was not a happy man these days not since special agent marvin argus had blown into town from chicago with his own crew the man stopped short of making derogatory remarks about a fellow agent but then hennessey had never met argus youre in for a treat said riker when he smiles youll wanna deck him but you wont know why i keep my hands in my pockets when i talk to the guy finally marvin argus arrived in a large white sedan with rental plates he pulled over to the curb only two feet from the new york agents front bumper this earned him a slow shake of the head from hennessey for argus had just parked his white elephant in the middle of a covert detail the man from chicago was broadly smiling as he approached the other agents car then leaned down to the open window on the drivers side so riker spotted you huh well forget it hennessey youre not in any trouble many obscenities could be read into the grim tight line of hennesseys mouth for he was not actually in need of this magnanimous forgiveness from an outoftowner an interloper with no authority over him riker nodded his goodnight to the man beside him then opened the passenger door and stepped out onto the pavement argus follow me and because the chicago agent did not appear to understand a direct order he jacked up the volume shouting move now as they walked away from the car hennessey made a thumbsup gesture riker had just earned some currency with this local fed so said argus you got something for me keep it down riker glanced back at the gallery of fans clustered in front of the door to the radio station when they were beyond earshot he turned on the man saying you lied about agent kidd he was never jos patient is that what she said tim had regular appointments with the lady four times a week during office hours that sounds like a doctorpatient relationship to me that only tells me you were following kidd spying on one of your own guys he was unstable said argus everybody knew you think getting tailed by his own people mightve made him a little crazier argus averted his face signaling a lie in the making but then he shook his head and looked riker in the eye after timmy kidd was murdered i questioned that woman for hours and hours five six interviews and shed never tell me what they talked about on those visits she was keeping a doctorpatient confidentiality did she ever spell that out for you no but i still say she was treating tim riker put more faith in jos story agent kidd was always timothy to her his friend never tim or timmy marvin argus had hardly known the murdered man shrinks said the lying fed theyll never give you a straight answer about a patient not even a dead one what else did johanna say riker shook his head he was here to get information not give it away kidd was based in dc i think he couldve found a psychiatrist closer to home not one more lie you got that you still dont know why kidd was in chicago do you argus shrugged this off he didnt report to me not directly not at all and jo was never a suspect said riker wrong and the chicago cops will back me up on this she was the prime suspect for timmys murder if i hadnt taken her into the witness protection program shed still be in police custody even the damn cops knew that tim was nuts this is the way they figured it before they lost the homicide to us only his own doctor dr apollo could get that close to a flaming paranoid close enough to slit his throat and a little paranoia wouldnt hurt you right now either you couldnt play it quiet like i asked no you had to play cop well youre not on the force anymore so be real careful about who sidles up to you he tucked his business card into the pocket of rikers leather jacket and whatever johanna tells you bring it to me yeah like thats ever gonna happen a black limousine sailed past them then rolled to a stop in front of the radio station the street door opened and a lean figure in a hooded sweatshirt emerged from the building the fans converged on him and he signed their autograph books before climbing into the backseat of the limo the long black car pulled away from the curb followed at a discreet distance by agent hennessey marvin argus ran toward his own vehicle planning to join the parade and the fans quickly melted away leaving riker alone on the sidewalk well not entirely alone he stared at the pavement watching a stealthy shadow coming up behind his own without turning around he said mallory youre overpaid as she came abreast of him he held up a crumpled ball of papers her falsified dossier on his life i found a few mistakes in this so zachary made you an offer youre on his payroll no but nice try you mightve run that past me before you set me up he turned toward the street and the distant cavalcade of departing vehicles the fbi hates ian zachary so how does he rate a security surveillance i arranged that said mallory i sent a few death threats to the local feds so theyd keep an eye on him for me mallory you cant i cant be everywhere at once she said up till now ive been playing the game by myself this rebuke was another reminder that he had abandoned her and left her all alone in copland so if she had to bend the law a bit well that was clearly his fault her logic was flawed but consistent she always came out blameless and he had to smile because this policy of hers had not changed since she was ten years old here was his old kathy its your turn she said wait for zachary then follow him ill catch up with you at the bar on green street riker raised one hand to point the way zacharys limousine had gone his extended arm hung in the air for one foolish moment before dropping to his side he wasnt in that limo right said mallory he uses a double every night you see its all coming back to you once a cop always a cop she walked down the dark street traveling almost the length of the block before he fully grasped what had just happened she had sicced the feds on ian zachary then duped them by letting them chase a doppelganger before he could ask why mallory turned a corner and disappeared a truck with the logo of a janitorial service pulled up to the radio station five men in orange coveralls piled out and unloaded mops machines and cleaning supplies riker backed into the dark of a doorway and waited the length of one cigarette a man emerged from the building across the street and moved down the sidewalk at the pace of an elderly arthritic he wore orange coveralls like the janitors but none of those men had been stooped with age nor had any of them worn the slouch hat that hid this mans face in shadow following at a distance riker saw his target stand erect before descending a concrete slope to the lower level of a parking garage slowing his steps to give the man some lead time riker strolled down a ramp marked for oneway traffic he was heading toward the lighted window of an empty ticket booth at the bottom of the ramp in place of a human being an automated ticket machine extended its mechanical arm across the ramp to halt incoming vehicles with a bar of wood riker moved out of the way to allow a blue sedan to crawl past him at the bottom of the ramp the driver reached out the window and pulled a ticket from the mouth of the machine the mechanical arm raised to let the car pass beyond that wooden barrier all riker could see were patches of light and empty parking spaces a gunshot exploded in the cavern below quickly followed by the screech of the blue sedans brakes and echoes of the bang riker rocked on one foot caught midstride and off balance his body stiffened his chest seized up and he was dropping like a manikin in an act of pure reflex his hands shot out in front of him to soften his fall and save him from a broken nose but now his arms had turned useless he could not move them nor could he breathe this time he thought his lungs would burst the panic was ratcheting higher and higher heart racing the gunshot had also panicked the driver of the blue sedan the car was backing up hitting the guardrail in haste to get out riker heard the crack of the wooden barrier then footsteps and a tapping sound his face pressed to concrete all he could see was a dark coat and the white tip of a blind mans cane no help was coming from that quarter another gunshot sounded and another the blue sedan moved forward and riker knew what would happen next the frightened driver wanted distance before he reversed his gears and crashed backward into the wooden barrier that trapped him the driver would not be checking for bodies in his rearview mirror riker knew he was a dead man out of breath and flat out of time he heard the grinding of the gears reversing the car engine revving backing up crashing through the rail coming to smash his head like a melon a warm body covered his own and rolled with him back to the wall and safety as the blue sedan sped past him in reverse rikers eyes were closing as his deliverer eased her body off of him to kneel at his side but he was aware of jos hands on his chest his face and then her mouth was pressed to his as she breathed for him filling his lungs with air panic and fear yielded to a lightness of the head a floating sensation listen she said its like the day you almost wrecked the van you wont die if you lose consciousness all the muscles will relax and then she whispered dont be afraid and he was not the paralysis had passed off and what had begun as the kiss of life became a kiss for its own sake drunk on the euphoria of oxygen deprivation that part of his brain where the thinking was done excused itself and stepped off a cliff his hands were on the back of her neck pressing her closer his fingers tangling in her hair jo was life and breath and more she pulled back he tried to rise and she put one hand flat on his chest to restrain him stay here she said ill get help he had his breath back and his mind had also come back to him get out of here jo he pushed her hand aside go now i need backup get to a phone he was on his feet again and running down the ramp toward the thing that scared him more than anything else on earth and he could not have done otherwise this was a cops job running toward the sound of guns past the splintered guardrail and running on level ground he rounded a thick pillar and came upon two men in a pool of overhead light ian zachary had lost the slouch hat of his janitor disguise unarmed he squared off against the man who held the gun taunting him whats wrong with you macpherson a thirteenyearold girl couldve made that shot the other man small and rail thin raised his revolver and fired three shots at zacharys chest riker remained standing this time fighting down the panic as bone locked with bone and every muscle constricted he would not suffocate and die this would pass he knew it would because he believed in jo he was hyperaware of every detail to this scene his banging heart the sweat on his upper lip and he could see that the gunshots had no effect on zachary the shooter could not have missed but there were no holes in the targets orange coveralls and no ricochets off concrete walls blanks agape zachary stared at riker no doubt wondering why the frozen man simply stood there rooted to the cement the paralysis passed off faster this time and riker relaxed into a casual stance feigning mild interest in the stranger with the gun when he felt steady and able again he strode toward the shooter rolling his body with all the old authority of the badge he took the weapon from the mans trembling hand saying so casually so youre macpherson he opened the revolvers cylinder and checked the chambers youre out of bullets tough break pal riker glanced at ian zachary and the bulk beneath the orange coveralls was the man wearing a bulletproof vest of course he was all that bravado had come from a civilians lame idea that the vest would take the bullet with no harm done but getting shot in the chest was worth a ride to the hospital vest or no vest i have a carry permit macphersons voice was shaky and his eyes had the vacant look of a trauma victim he was assuming that riker was police for now he unfolded a paper and handed it over as if this might excuse him for this ambush of an unarmed man riker held the document at arms length to read the small print yes this was macpherson one of the last three living jurors and duly authorized to carry a pistol for the purpose of selfdefense he handed the permit back saying okay i guess youre licensed to shoot him not seeing any humor in this situation macpherson actually seemed relieved that he was not in any serious trouble riker pulled back the mans coat to expose a metal cylinder hanging from his belt he unhooked the speedloader and emptied its store of ammo into his hand the cartridges were capped with wax to hold the charge of gunpowder but no bullets more blanks riker was that rare person who did suffer fools gladly for the criminally misguided had always been his chief source of entertainment so you thought you might need to reload in a hurry with emergency blanks macpherson nodded then forced a smile because riker was smiling imbecile ian zachary shook his head slowly from side to side and leaned back against an old junker of a car the perfect complement to his disguise of workmans coveralls he was a portrait of new york elan so blase in the aftermath of his own attempted murder he turned to face riker saying youre going to arrest him now right hell no how many ways can i say this riker spoke slowly and carefully in the manner of talking down to a halfbright child i am not a cop anymore you could make a citizens arrest naw im gonna buy him a beer poor guy hes had a rough day riker clapped one hand on macphersons shoulder cmon youre with me i wanna know what the hell went on in that jury room there was no sound of sirens yet he knew they should be gone before the first police car arrived jo would have located a public phone by now however he had a feeling that she would not leave her name as the caller riker walked the incompetent shooter up the ramp in silence and there was time to wonder who the lady had been following tonight himself was jo taking the blame for bunnys death was she worried that another friend would be the next target or was it ian zachary she was tailing he glanced at the ashen face of macpherson and decided to include him on the short list of men who so interested johanna apollo from the bowels of the parking garage ian zachary called out can i come ill buy riker sat back and enjoyed his favorite brand of bourbon free booze as ian zachary laid out more cash for the cocktail waitress turning to the small thin man between them riker said youre perfectly safe this is a cop bar once again macpherson failed to get the joke he appeared not to understand that cops usually arrested people for waving guns around in a menacing way perhaps there was something to the reapers stupidjuror theory but then he decided that this man had simply lost the ability to think clearly he had spent too much time in seclusion hiding from a maniac who wanted him dead riker could empathize with that though he had never been a man in hiding that was not his way and he would never tremble so in public upon entering this old soho haunt he had made his usual scan of the crowd checking out young males for signs of psychosis and concealed weapons and now his gaze settled upon a blind mans white cane it leaned against a bar stool draped with a black coat squinting for clarity riker decided that this man in the silly wig was young but he could read no finer detail between the long red curls and the oversized dark glasses the blind man dipped one hand into his coat and riker froze waiting for a bullet the man withdrew a wallet set his money on the bar and riker began to breathe normally again it was unlikely that this was the same white cane that had tapped past him in the parking garage twenty blocks away but he wished he could see this blind mans eyes two drinks had gone by and he had learned nothing of the events that had led macpherson and his fellow jurors to a notguilty verdict but he knew that something shameful had happened in the jury room that much was in macphersons eyes as the man evaded every question well what is a juror anyway ian zachary was saying pontificating to no one for riker had ceased to listen and poor macpherson was sliding into shock a juror said zachary is someone too stupid to get out of jury duty now this man here he was one of the rocket scientists in that courtroom hes a math teacher macpherson corrected him saying in a small cracked voice was a math teacher i lost my job i still have a wife though he looked down at his bony hands tightly folded in his lap but she always cries when i call home he also seemed at the point of crying and his last drink had done nothing to calm his nerves the jurors werent stupid those poor people were only hey i was there too said zachary remember me the defendant when the prosecutor polled the jury in open court one by one they all voted not guilty and you you just tried to kill me with blanks you fool i only wanted you to know how it felt to be me you mean you didnt have the guts to kill me youre a coward no he isnt said riker he didnt run did he you and your fans set him up nailed him down to new york city even the building he lives in and the reapers probably camped out at his front door right now i say the man has guts however macpherson was an idiot riker scribbled a brief note on a cocktail napkin then pulled marvin arguss business card from his pocket its time to call for protection pal youre naked now under the cover of the table he pressed the napkin and the card into the mans hand it doesnt matter anymore said macpherson i just want it to be over he glanced down the note then rose from the table mumbling mens room he turned his back on them and walked toward the sign for the rest rooms at the rear of the bar hes one scared rabbit said zachary or maybe not he slid along the seat of the leather booth moving closer to riker wouldnt it be a kick if that was just an act what if he turned out to be the reaper yeah right rikers attention was divided between the blind man at the bar and macpherson who stood by the pay phone shaking his head and debating the wisdom of making a telephone call to the fbi the englishman prattled on oblivious to anything but the sound of his own voice no hes not smart enough to get away with slaughtering all those people and then theres the fbi agent in chicago did you know he was one of the reapers kills the newspapers never made the connection on that one the chicago cops wouldnt give reporters any details but you may recall that one of my fans works in the morgue the blind man turned his head toward riker then quickly looked away and counted up his change from the bartender not blind a fraudulent beggar a con artist in a cop bar looking past zachary to the window on the street riker drank steadily as he endured another ten minutes of crackpot theories on the reaper he was buying macpherson some getaway time now the shockjock noticed that their drinking companion was still absent from the table whats with him i wonder you think hes in the mens room slashing his wrists hes long gone said riker though only a minute had passed since arguss white car had pulled up to the curb and carried the juror away he slipped out you just let him go riker rolled his eyes up to the ceiling and said im not a cop any i know said zachary but if he dies tonight its on your head isnt it no macpherson would at least live through the night the feds could not afford one more screwup on the reaper case and riker could do nothing to save the man he could not even protect himself not with a gun not when the mere sound of the shot could render him breathless and useless he needed no more proof that his life as a cop was done maybe youre the one who needs protection riker ripped open the mans orange coveralls revealing a bulletproof vest of better quality than police issue dont put all your faith in body armor the next time that poor bastard comes after you he might use real bullets and he might make a head shot highly unlikely you saw him said zachary paying no mind to the broken zipper on his coveralls the mans harmless but i still think the reaper was one of the jurors my favorite candidate is the jury foreman the hunchback johanna apollo no this was not possible riker closed his eyes bad dream bad dream if jo had been on zacharys jury mallory would have you really didnt know when riker opened his sorry eyes zachary had moved closer and he was smiling fits though doesnt it she makes a great suspect think about it riker a unanimous verdict of not guilty was the jury really all that stupid or did someone influence them only a psychiatrist couldve run that jury room and turned all the ballots my way thats why i sent her longstemmed roses every day for a month i figured her for a groupie shut up you psycho what else had mallory failed to tell him just as he was wishing that she was within strangling distance he saw her seated at the end of the bar all her attention was trained on the fake blind man in the red wig and now mallory slid off her bar stool to follow the little man out the door leaving riker to the job of tucking ian zachary safely into bed chapter the faux blind man was accustomed to being followed mallory had guessed as much when he changed trains three times but she had remained with him riding one car behind though sometimes losing sight of the brightred wig among the other passengers he led her to grand central terminal almost deserted at this hour and she watched him enter the downstairs mens room a very suspicious act in itself that public facility was a documented pesthole only vagrants did not avoid it but he was not in that class she had costestimated the black coat at something beyond the purse of a beggar though his wig was cheap nylon hair and a very unnatural red he must want people to notice him but why she watched the rest room door and waited for him guessing that he would change his appearance before he emerged he would certainly lose the silly wig mallory waited and she waited twenty minutes had passed only one man exited the mens room but this was not the smoothskinned youth the fake blind man this man was elderly not aged with a white fright wig but authentically wrinkled and peppered with liver spots she entered the mens room to make her own inspection not yet willing to believe that she had been thrown off a surveillance detail by some rank amateur in a ridiculous disguise this could not happen not to her one by one she opened all the stalls kicking open the ones that were locked disturbing the slumbers of homeless men with authentic body odor and haggard faces and definitely not her fake blind man in disguise angry now she overturned the trash can on the floor but found no sign of a red wig or a white cane there was only one door no other way out a young man had walked into this room and vanished mallory decided not to share this humiliation with riker yes victor im quite sure that she was police said the elderly lawyer as he draped the black coat on a chair the white cane came loose and crashed to the floor startling his companion but then every little thing made victor patchock nervous the youngster was in one of his silent moods and so the old man carried on both sides of the conversation yes she followed me right to the rest room door well actually she was following the red wig commendable plan my boy he had finally come to appreciate the bizarre logic of a fugitive calling attention to his appearance the lawyer stood before the only unshuttered window and looked down at the quiet street below the upper east side was such a good neighborhood but what a dreary tiny room his last offer to move victor to some better accommodation had been declined the young man had even worsened his lot by removing the doors to the closet and bathroom then stripping the place of all bulky furnishings which might conceal an enemy from where the old man stood he could see a razor on the edge of the bathroom sink and the drain was clotted with hair from the younger mans cleanshaven head victor had always been boyish in appearance but now the bald pate made him seem downright babyish if a baby could sneer and go insane the old lawyer plucked his own camelhair coat from a hook on the wall its late and i need my rest he did love this fresh excitement of being followed by a pretty woman a touch of aftermidnight sex the drama had certainly enlivened his golden years and deepened his sympathy for this young man who could not go home again but of course there were limits and now as if in gentle rebuke denying a toy to a child he said i cant get you a new gun sorry mugss lips curled back over needlesharp teeth as he crept toward the door his ears flattened back and fur bristling whatever he sensed out there in the hall he was planning to take it by surprise and make short work of it the cat looked up at johanna pleading for her help in this venture for he had never mastered the art of opening doors suddenly he was angry and hissing she was opening the closet the wrong door johanna found her jacket dipped one hand into the pocket and pulled out the small silver gun in barefoot silence she stepped up to the hallway door and stood on tiptoe to see through the peephole no one there perhaps it was only a mouse after all something small hiding below and beyond the perimeter of the fisheye lens she opened the door riker had been sitting on the hall rug and leaning against the wood now he fell backward into the room and came facetoface with the cat hey mugs ol buddy the cat somewhere between disgust and disappointment padded off to his pillow basket where he turned around three times then curled into a ball hello jo said riker still flat on his back and looking up at her johannas weapon was concealed behind her back riker ive got two fbi men watching me so thank you but i really dont need more protection tonight arguss men he rose to his feet sloppy bastards i didnt see either one of them when i got here she waved him to the couch and while his back was turned she slipped the silver gun into the pocket of her robe what are you doing here i just found out that you were on ian zacharys jury that was a shock and a half but you had so much information your notes no they never mentioned you as the jury foreman and now he surprised her one more time he asked none of the predictable questions like how could you let that bastard get away with murder over the next half hour they settled into an easy truce their pact was sealed with johannas hoard of precious goat cheese and a fine bottle of red wine pulled down from the rack on the wall they sat on the couch side by side their feet propped up on the coffee table johanna had eased into a rare mood of happiness so mellow so peaceful and she was the one who finally returned to the subject of ian zacharys trial i didnt even try to get out of jury duty she refilled rikers glass with the last of the bottle i was closing down my private practice and referring my patients to other doctors finding good homes for all my puppies and i was almost done so it was easy enough to clear my calendar i didnt really think the defense lawyers would want a psychiatrist on zacharys jury but they never objected to me never asked a single question they didnt waste any time on the other two women either after a while i figured it out they were using all their challenges to stock the jury with men who fit the demographics of zacharys radio show it was a local program then just the chicago area you know the type of fans he has young males badly educated and immature most of them in goingnowhere jobs seven of the jurors fit that profile that explains why the defense team didnt care about you they only needed one of those bastards for a hung jury so what happened in that jury room how did they get a unanimous verdict i cant tell you any more riker i wont lie to you and i wont drag you into this he leaned down to pick up the leather jacket he had dropped on the floor and now he pulled out a gun much larger than the one she had recently concealed in a cushion of the couch with just a cursory understanding of his affliction she knew it was madness for riker to carry this weapon jo im the one with the gun and youre trying to protect me he looked down at the revolver in his hand i took this away from macpherson tonight is he the one you followed into the parking garage where is he now marvin argus took him away thats his whole job in life isnt it protecting the jury maybe thats why he pulled his men off your surveillance detail well i guess ill be sticking around for a while before he could ask any more questions about macpherson jo selected an open wound that might distract him does your doctor know what causes your seizures any physical problems she already suspected that the pathology was trauma related but men were rarely open to this suggestion seizure he said as if the word might be new to him you mean like a fit i dont throw fits im thinkin it couldve been a heart attack he seemed to prefer this more lifethreatening explanation of course he did men had heart attacks women had fits riker you know ive seen it happen before that day you lost control of the van he shook his head no he had not lost control he had no frailties all this was said with the set of his jaw and then he turned away from her johanna was accustomed to this old obstacle old as time men were the vainest creatures on the planet obviously he believed that he had successfully concealed the previous episode her first day on the job training day he had nearly wrecked a company van there had also been a loud noise on that occasion the sound of one car hitting another with the bang of twoton missiles meeting headon the van had suffered no impact though it had spun out of control and wound up with both front wheels on the sidewalk before johanna could pull up the emergency brake she had opened the passenger door and hit the pavement running to check on the other two drivers both of them had been in better shape than riker she recalled that awful moment when she had turned back to see him frozen behind the windshield in the throes of a seizure his lips had turned blue for lack of oxygen and every cord on his neck had been strained to a rope of flesh the seizure had passed off before she had time to climb back into the van he was already breathing again gulping air and waving off her attentions insisting that he was just fine riker had not driven a van since that day and they had never spoken of the incident and there would be no more discussion tonight he busied himself arranging couch cushions in front of the door to her rooms riker was planning to lay his body down as a human shield to protect her she stared at the revolver he had lain on the glove table by the door this was fresh proof of her trauma theory the cylinder chambers that she could see were empty it was not loaded of course not a gunshot would have paralyzed him he had come to protect her with only the bluff of an empty revolver and johanna regarded that useless weapon with tenderness and great awe special agent marvin argus stared at the sleeping man on the hotelroom couch he had tired out macpherson with the argument for the witness protection program or perhaps the man was faking escaping into feigned sleep the runaway juror seemed to dislike him for no reason that argus could fathom after packing up the meager belongings from his apartment macpherson had been willing enough to come to this hotel under fbi escort but he stubbornly refused to leave town argus blamed dr apollo for giving this fragile little man a backbone the doctors guards were divided in their duties one man was posted on the staircase between floors and the other rode atop the only elevator in service tonight this was not correct procedure for a stakeout he should have had more men but that would have meant answering too many questions no requests would be made to the new york bureau no local agents should learn about the captured juror until the reaper had been taken into custody dead or alive the agent thought better of lighting up his cigar in this hotel room macpherson had claimed to be allergic to smoke and probably lied about that little prig however arguss future depended upon staying on good terms with this man for a while longer he turned down the volume on the radio then pulled a curtain aside and craned his neck to see the sky it was getting light dawn was only hours away dear god how he wanted a smoke and sleep when had he last slept through the night he had only dozed the night before in the past hour he had downed five cups of coffee not enough but there was more on the way that bellman would take at least ten minutes more to fetch it at least that long an infusion of nicotine might help to stave off the drowsiness that and cold fresh air the agent opened the window and stepped out onto the fire escape then sat down on the metal grate and unwrapped his cigar leaning back against the wall he exhaled the first blue cloud of smoke his eyelids weighed ten pounds each argus glanced at his watch as if that would hurry the next pot of coffee the chelsea hotel was an inspired choice now that he was certain that the reaper kept close tabs on dr apollo the death of the homeless man had proven that much he tried to pay attention to the news broadcast from the radio on the other side of the open window but his head lolled to one side and it seemed that his eyes had only closed for a moment surely it had been no more than a minute the window closed behind him with an angry slam and the cigar in his hand was still smoking when he started awake damn you macpherson you and your phony smoke allergy argus could no longer hear the radio the doublepane glass had cut off the sound all he had to listen to was the sporadic static of cars passing by on the street below he pulled out his cell phone to make sure that his men were in place and alert trying the agent in the stairwell first then the one on the elevator who gave him two welcome pieces of news riker was visiting johanna apollos floor one less juror to worry about and arguss pot of coffee had arrived there would be no more communication no sound or movement while they waited for a stone killer to walk into their arms as argus concluded his last call his gaze was drifting down toward the street it was a fight to keep his eyes open as he folded his phone into a pocket so tired he fixed his gaze upon the building directly across the street determined not to let his eyes close one more time and so he never saw the frantic shadow on the curtain behind him arms waving nor did he notice a splatter of red dots appear in the next instant staining the material with blood just beyond the glass his eyes had closed before the drapes were pulled down from their rod clutched in the death grip of a falling man as the horror show was unveiled blood on the walls the furniture and the floor argus would not wake for three more hours a hotel maid would be the first to discover the body at nine oclock and she would call the police chapter key in hand charles stood in the open doorway to the reception area for the third time in as many days he was startled to see his new tenant the former hermit or rather he saw rikers back as the man walked down the hall toward the rear offices of butler and company while mallory another unexpected sight at this early morning hour was making a hasty retreat heading toward the front door with uncommon speed and ignoring the fact that charles was barring her way just a moment he said calling her attention to himself the immovable object in her path and it annoyed her that he would not step aside oh how unfortunate i gather that riker hasnt seen your recent additions to the wall no she said still advancing on him ah well that would explain so much her agitation her strong desire to get the hell out of here she never lost momentum fully expecting him to get out of her way before they collided but he had seen her do this trick too many times and he stood his ground now he was looking down at her upturned face such a lovely face but definitely not a happy one so riker surprised you he said you know hes going to have some questions about what youve done mallory took the long way round him closing the door behind her she said you can fill in for me right resigning himself to damage control charles walked down the hallway and paused by the open door to his business partners private office riker was scanning the half of the cork wall that was all mallorys work a neat square composed of photographs all perfectly aligned and alternating with sheets of text the overall effect was somewhat like a chessboard among the upper rows were candid shots of jurors who were still alive when captured by their photographers pinned alongside them were emails and letters from ian zacharys fans in the lower region were pictures with the same faces eyes closed this time and the predominant color of their photographs was blood red these were the postmortem portraits of people lying on morgue dissection tables previously the only corpse pictured on the wall had been the murdered fbi agent timothy kidd rikers own contribution from the suitcase of dr apollo morning said charles trying to put a good face on what was already shaping up to be a bad day he noted the mans paleness and illconcealed anger well this was no improvement in rikers condition mallorys game plan had a nasty glitch where did she get all the photographs most of them came from ian zacharys computer said charles mallory hijacked it apparently zacharys fans are not above stealing things like morgue records to make him happy and of course to win prizes the detective concentrated on the last row here were all the portraits of a surviving juror dr johanna apollo she was the only one on the wall to be represented from every angle in the final shot her deformed body was in clear focus but the head was slightly blurred turning in the direction of the camera click the fans didnt send zachary these pictures of jo said riker mallory took them how did you know years and years of looking at surveillance shots mallorys the worst photographer on the force ah the center fixation yes lots of wasted space around the subjects face not a very good sense of composition is it charles turned his eyes to the upper gallery of fan photographs representing nine other jurors every one deceased to be fair i think all of these pictures are equally bad yeah but mallorys shots are always perfectly bad riker tore a picture off the wall and its pushpins went flying if i drew a gun sight on this jos head would be in line with a bullet the metaphor was not lost on charles riker was obviously questioning mallorys intentions toward this woman and now in a faceoff the detective elicited a confession of sorts it was all there played out across charles butlers face in the red flush and the sorry eyes that would not meet rikers own after ripping all of dr apollos photographs from the wall the angry man slammed the door on his way out chief medical examiner edward slope was seated behind his office desk catching up on paperwork before cracking open the first corpse of the day without his uniform of bloodstained surgical garb he might be taken for a graying general his face was dignified his expression set in stone and his posture was perfect even when he believed that he was not being observed the pathologist looked up from his paperwork and almost betrayed a look of pleasant surprise before riker had gotten two feet in the door he was subjected to yet another impromptu examination checking the mended bullet holes dr slopes quick appraisal also took in the bomber jacket flannel shirt and jeans in lieu of hello he said you look like hell and i dont mean the wardrobe im guessing that youre losing sleep while working undercover as a lumberjack slope had always fancied that he possessed a sense of humor and now you need a consultation right apparently no one had told this man about the forced separation from nypd and riker planned to take advantage of that its definitely not a social call doc he tossed a slew of photographs on the desk blotter what can you tell me about this woman the medical examiner hardly glanced at the pictures of johanna apollo since shes not dead yet not one of my customers im guessing you want me to tell you whats wrong with her got an x ray or a medical history in your pocket no i didnt think so well then ill tell you the same thing i told mallory just before i sent her packing i cant do a diagnosis without the proper mallory showed you these pictures yes two months ago maybe three at least she came in with a working theory based on her research she decided the woman had scheuermanns kyphosis wanted me to confirm it mallory seems very well versed on the subject of hunchbacks perhaps you two should talk more often maybe compare notes youre still partners arent you riker slumped down in a padded armchair in front of the desk he was feeling all the aches of a night spent sleeping on the floor of jos hotel room what little sleep he had managed but anger was slowly dissipating exhaustion mallory had lied to him again what a surprise her investigation of jo was apparently not a recent thing but dated back to the first encounter during a visit to neds crime scene cleaners he added this to the list of mallorys deceptions then turned his tired face to dr slope i need information on this woman anything you can she has a severe spinal deformity thats all i can tell you with just a damn photograph not good enough doc i once heard you do a twentyminute spiel on the history of a corpse with no id that time all you had to work with was a damn tattoo and a corpse on the dissection table riker gathered up his photographs preparing to leave well thanks for all your help as he rose from the chair he thought better of taking the pictures with him and dropped them on the desk keep em a few souvenirs if she shows up on your dissection table in the next few days i want you to remember this conversation hold it the doctor picked up one of the photographs and studied it with more care i dont believe ive seen this one it shows a bit more of the pathology riker sat down again mallory was probably right said slope scheuermanns kyphosis is the most likely cause the range in laymans terms is round back to hunchback hers is an extreme deformity so im guessing there were other factors maybe a childhood onset of osteoporosis or scoliosis he pointed to the duffel bag that jo carried in the photograph do you know if this is a heavy load shes carrying yeah said riker its her job bag all the gear to clean a crime scene her moon suit a respirator and so in addition to heavy lifting and wearing a respirator on her back shes doing a lot of bending and stretching sure goes with the job but she only works three days a week then i can tell you that she spends the other four days recuperating this woman is either a masochist or a very determined individual how long has she been doing this sort of work three months or so by now her pain medication is probably supporting three pharmacies addiction levels at one time she might have controlled aches and pains with aspirin but that wont help her anymore i doubt if she sleeps through the night without pills so you can add more drugs to the list heavy sedatives antiinflammatory medication amphetamines to keep her going after nights when the pills dont work shes probably under medical supervision she cant get any of these meds without a doctors prescription she is a doctor a psychiatrist slope arched one eyebrow and this was tantamount to an emotional outburst in his limited range of stonefaced expressions and now a psychiatrist is doing menial labor i dont suppose youre planning to tell me why that nope well a psychiatrist thats unfortunate then she also has a medical degree shes probably prescribing her own medication doctors make the most dangerous drug cocktails for themselves things theyd never give to a patient thats why its illegal to selfprescribe but the law is so easily back up doc what about the masochist angle what pain for its own sake well many people go into mental health professions because theyve been treated for emotional problems of their own slopes eyes drifted back to the photograph thats a good possibility here as a small child her appearance wouldve been quite normal then age ten to fifteen she began to change grotesque change hard to imagine a day in her life curious stares clumsy remarks now given that teenagers are not the sanest most stable peer group on the planet try to picture this womans adolescent years at the mercy of pure hell slope nodded at least a thousand arrows to the soul on a good day her father was a shrink too then you can count on a history of longterm therapy he would have put his daughter in treatment with a child psychiatrist what about this angle said riker you say the cleaning job brings on more pain what if the job is like a hair shirt penance i suppose thats one possibility heres another given her choice of work these days crime scenes she might be coming to terms with death she could be suicidal this last suggestion remained with riker riding with him on the subway back to soho and the idea nagged at him as he walked the streets heading toward an old familiar haunt where he had agreed to meet mallory for breakfast she had a lot to answer for today he was planning to make it a very short meal perhaps their last one together in addition to her other crimes against him she had yet to mention tailing the fake blind man last night though she had been given that chance earlier this morning charles butler had not remarked on mallorys reappearance a convenient five minutes after rikers angry departure she had as yet not offered him any opportunity for conversation but busied herself at a computer her fingers were flying across the keyboard her eyes were fixed on the screen and she was stonedeaf to what he was saying until he unplugged the thick gray cable from the wall and her screen went blank good job mallorys hands came to rest but she would not look at him when she said its better if riker knows all of it now all at once oh well that explains everything doesnt it and he knew in mallorys mind it would excuse her for leaving him to face rikers suspicions alone did he tell you where he was going no said charles im not sure we were on speaking terms when he left he obviously thinks i was part of this scheme from the beginning you didnt tell him how long well hes a detective isnt he mallory im sure he can figure that out just a warning and this advance notice was more than she deserved im meeting him for breakfast ill patch it up okay no thats not okay all this deception thats the least of the damage he sees you as a threat to johanna apollo he said that he didnt have to it was now that he knows she was on that jury hell do whatever it takes to keep her alive as if this might pass for an answer to all present and future questions she plugged in her computer then resumed typing its better this way oh of course that after all had been her purpose in posing a threat to johanna apollo and mallory had done it so graphically so deliberately in every photograph you should have been honest with riker he said right from the start why cant you just sit down with the man and talk to him like a he had been about to use the words normal person words that did not apply to her nor to himself charles butler had been raised in an academic womb entering harvard at the age of ten a freak a thing apart from his peers mallory had matriculated to the streets at an even younger age and had also learned to survive on her own absent any ties to other children and thanks to his own more elite education charles knew the cantos of paradise lost but he was unable to recite the simplest line of a valentine to her for fear that it might strain their friendship or altogether end it for her part mallory knew all the dimensions of hell on earth having taken its measurements in her formative years but she knew nothing about the human heart and so they coexisted side by side each in their own separate cell business partners and prisoners who sometimes met for lunch or dinner conversing but never quite touching one another and now he felt like a fool why should it come as a surprise that mallory could not sit down with riker all that she had left in the way of family and tell him that she had created all this misery for him out of love he stood behind her chair planning to tread more carefully with his remaining suspicion riker doesnt know everything yet does he mallory she glanced at her watch as a pure distraction mallory always knew the exact time to the second this was a gift an odd quirk of her brain and perhaps she made finer distinctions in increments of time for all he knew charles watched her quickly gather up keys and coat playing out the charade of being late for her appointment as if that could ever happen to one so pathologically punctual and now without further complaint he watched her go what else could he do mallory had taken hostages riker walked into the din of conversation clattering plates and silverware with no hesitation not pausing this time to examine every face with a wary eye nor to check the patrons clothing for the bulges of concealed weapons for this was a haven a safety zone and most of the regulars carried guns the rest were tame tourists with ilovenewyork tshirts and souvenir buttons breakfast in this soho cafe was a habit that he had cast off during his extended leave from nypd not wanting to meet any familiar faces from his squad and he had missed this place so much the ritual meal had spanned twenty years beginning with his oldest friend and continuing with that mans foster child his partner expartner kathy mallory it was nine oclock still crazy hour for the morning trade but the small table by the front window was magically vacant as if the third chair were still occupied by the late inspector louis markowitz it felt like coming home again as riker pulled up his regular chair he nodded to a lean gray woman with a gravediggers face who stood five tables away her arms were laden with a juggling act of perfectly balanced trays as she distributed ten separate meals round a table of tourists dealing out plates like playing cards she astonished the outoftowners not asking who got what but simply getting it right each entree beverage and side order gurt was an actual waitress not a starving actress or a painter she had always waited tables for her living and knew all her regular customers and what they wanted and she suffered no grief from anyone youre early gurt yelled at him across the room as if the past six months of his absence were but a single day planning to surprise the kid kathy mallory had made no stronger impression on this waitress over the years on her first day as a rookie cop lou markowitz had brought his foster child to the cafe in uniform to show her off to gurt saying with great pride this is my kid as far as the waitress was concerned the young cop was then and now and forever the kid and yes even though this late breakfast date had been earlier arranged the kid would be surprised mallory always walked in the door exactly on time little punctuality freak that she was and riker was always late but not today and he had other surprises for mallory gurt had no sooner placed his coffee mug on the table than he looked up to see mallory hovering in the open doorway and this could only mean that the second hand of the clock on the wall had struck the hour it was rare to see her startled as she crossed the room her long black leather duster was swept back on one side and she consulted lous old pocket watch tethered to her blue jeans by a gold chain reassured that her internal clock had not failed her despite rikers timely presence she shrugged out of her coat folded it over the back of her dead fathers chair and took her customary seat at the table this cafe was also her own haven she disliked change so much lou markowitz might be gone but his chair was still here and though she got no respect from gurt the waitress was a constant fixture in her life thus riker knew with absolute certainty that mallory had sat here each morning of his long absence her head bowed over her plate eating her meal in silence all alone and that realization caused him unexpected pain other cops men she worked with every day also frequented this place but they would never sit down at this table with her for she would do nothing to invite them she would not know how guilt and sorrow tempered everything he had prepared to say to her all his storedup accusations simply died this morning johanna showed some charity to special agent marvin argus only opening the door by a crack mugs could not maul the mans legs not unless argus tried to force his way into the room got a warrant no having learned deep respect for the cat the fbi agent stood beyond the range of swatting claws his eyes were anxious and sunken in their sockets his face was pale and bereft of the annoying smile i need your help johanna theres been a murder a man you knew she had a death grip on the doorknob as her head moved slowly from side to side so deep in denial that she almost missed his next words and now marvin arguss eyes were shocked wide by her inappropriate smile for he had just put a name to the dead man and it was not riker the meal had arrived a few minutes after mallory their waitress never bothered with the formality of menus since they always ordered the same thing the past six months had dissolved and it was as it had always been two partners eating eggs over easy and drinking coffee black when their meal was done and the second cup of coffee poured mallory slapped a thick sheaf of papers on the table and said sign it riker looked down at the familiar appeal form to challenge his separation from nypd how many of these things have you got i can print them out all damn day i can keep this up as long as you can he pushed the paperwork to one side what did lieutenant coffey say he gave commissioner beale your field report what field report i typed one up for you it gives special crimes unit all the credit for locating macpherson and placing him in arguss custody and what about the other fed the local man did you make him look like an idiot for losing ian zachary last night that was your plan wasnt it you mean hennessey i talked to him this morning told him about what happened to zachary in the parking garage then i told him i wasnt planning to mention it to anyone she handed a folded sheet of paper across the table read this he took the report and held it out at arms length squinting at the text there was no mention of the new york fed and his botched security detail nor the shooting in the parking garage agent hennessey was now in mallorys debt clever brat she had no gift for making friends but she knew how to build up the favor bank she was even better at this than her old man he folded the report and gave it back to her glad that he had misjudged her though perhaps not entirely what she had done for agent hennessey also had blackmail potential did he say anything about macpherson no said mallory he had to ask me the name of the shooter interesting argus isnt sharing information with the new york bureau no she smiled so well let the local feds find out the hard way youre setting up a war between the chicago bureau and new york yes mallory would find that irresistible dividing them weakening them there was no doubt left that she was plotting a case takeover so what happens when zachary makes out a complaint on the shooting he wont said mallory i took care of that when he called me last night i told him hed look like an idiot with no corroboration since the only witnesses hated his guts and what about jo she was there and now he knew that mallory had not stayed to watch the show but he would always wonder if she had roughly predicted the outcome had she set him up to intercept macpherson no that was crazy he was giving her too much credit and pushing his trust issues over the edge no he said jo wasnt there i just wondered if coffey knows she needs police protection cant justify the manpower said mallory shes already got feds watching her round the clock riker shook his head argus pulled them off that detail last night hes probably got them watching macpherson fulltime the next item of his agenda was the fake blind man mallory had followed away from the bar last night this was forgotten when he turned to the window distracted by the sudden commotion on the street detectives were pouring out of the station house on the run climbing into cars and peeling off down the street only jack coffey was still on foot and heading for the door to the cafe trouble riker turned to mallory any theories before she could answer lieutenant coffey strode through the door and crossed the room to their table hey boss said riker forgetting for the moment that he was no longer a detective in this mans squad whos minding the store janos needs backup on a crime scene jack coffey picked up the breakfast bill and laid down his own cash i need both of you now but im not a cop anymore then you shouldnt be turning in field reports riker macphersons dead and you were one of the last people to see him alive coffeys thumb gestured toward the door now get your ass in gear mallory was already out the door and moving toward her car running to catch up with the posse of homicide cops chapter it was a standoff the crime scene was on the floor below johanna apollos and the front room was similar to her own differing only in furniture and bloodstained drapes the tension ratcheted higher and higher as men in suits and uniforms squared off against one another detective janos a large man with a thugs face was flanked by two patrolmen and all three were engaged in a quiet staring contest with an equal number of new york fbi agents the police detective glanced at his wristwatch and johanna guessed that he was expecting reinforcements the corpse on the carpet seemed almost incidental to this dogs war over territory but no one had yet pissed on the walls to stake a claim the atmosphere was charged and more energy was added with each person to enter the room the outer hall a contrast of noisy conversations was filled with crimescene technicians men and women with nothing to do until this matter was settled the tension doubled when a fourth agent marvin argus returned from a hallway skirmish with a man from nypd forensics and now the chicago agent made a tactical error as he knelt down by the body not his body not yet when johanna had first entered this room in arguss company the new york agents had given the man a dour reception his own people considered him an intruder on this crime scene and he had made things worse by assuming an air of command unsupported by rank the local fbi men now seemed more closely allied with the police all but spitting in arguss direction an imposing grayhaired man with a military air and posture stood in the neutral zone near the front door and he was looking her way with the evidence of his expensive suit and a medical bag at his feet johanna guessed that he was no minion but the chief pathologist himself he towered over his own people two men wearing jackets emblazoned with the initials of the medical examiners office and they called him dr slope though this distinguished man was a stranger to her he gave her a nod of hello earlier his face had been expressionless stone but fault lines of kindness had since appeared she would not describe his gaze as simple curiosity no after finetuning her intuition she decided that his eyes held merely deep sadness on her account and there was more to it than pity for the hunchback the aspect was closer to empathy for the first time since entering the hotel room johanna felt that she was not alone she smiled at this good doctor who was wasted on the dead more detectives a score of them all flashing badges came barreling through the door to make a stand behind janos mallory the only woman stood shoulder to shoulder with the men to form a wall of police and though none of them held a weapon the room was electrified as if all the guns had gone off at once and real violence could only be moments away riker the last to arrive broke through the ranks and aimed his whole body at marvin argus no one had time to stop him assuming that they would want to he took argus down with one closed fist to the face the hapless agent lay on the floor staring at the ceiling and bleeding from his nose the sudden mayhem shook johanna with revulsion and it was also oddly satisfying this latter reaction was shared all around the room she might have expected the new york agents to close ranks around one of their own but they stood very still with their hands in their pockets perhaps as a precaution against spontaneous applause you stupid bastard riker stood over the fallen argus shouting i handed that poor man over to you you were supposed to take care of him last night all night did you go to sleep on the job he pointed to the corpse lying near the window and partially covered by a fallen set of bloodied drapes and why would you bring him to this hotel you knew the reaper was following johanna you knew he was watching this place its like you invited that freak inside for a clear shot at murdering macpherson apparently this detail was news to the agents from the new york bureau the senior man hailed one of the police by name saying lieutenant coffey a word when the two men returned from their brief conference in the next room the dispute over turf had been settled possession of the corpse was yielded to the force with the greatest numbers very wise or had the police lieutenant purchased this crime scene with a promise of silence on the embarrassing matter of federal incompetence the three new york agents were walking toward the door then suddenly turned back and as an afterthought picked up the debris of marvin argus lifting him from the floor and removing him from the room before his own blood could confuse the evidence by mingling with macphersons guys a nod from lieutenant coffey cleared more people from the room watch where you step not like itll help much jesus did the crimescene techs get any time in here yeah said janos everything was photographed and diagrammed before the feds showed up the detective accepted a large clearplastic bag from a man in uniform then held it up so his lieutenant could examine the dark clothing inside this suit and cap belong to the bellman we found the guy half naked and stuffed in a trash bin the suit was thrown on top of him hes still breathing but not making much sense so i figure the reaper hit him from behind and used this suit to protect his own clothes from blood splatters maybe well get lucky with hair and fibers coffey turned to face johanna dr apollo you saw agent kidds crime scene notice anything different here the writing on the wall she turned to the single line of block letters scrawled in dried blood ten down and two to go beneath these words was the trademark reported in the newspapers a red scythe timothy kidds murderer didnt leave a drawing or a message she watched the medical examiner roll the dead man on his back i think youll find that his trachea is cut thats different too mac was drowning in his own blood she turned to the smudges of blood on the wall by the window see those fist marks thats frustration and a call for help he couldnt cry out all he could do was bang on the walls but no one heard him coffey glanced at the medical examiner who nodded in the affirmative the lieutenant turned his attention back to johanna anything else you can tell us she pointed to sections of wall on both sides of the front door no blood in that area the killer didnt cut him right away not the second he walked in there was probably time for a few words of conversation she walked ten paces along an adjacent wall and paused by the line of red spots across a framed painting thats the fly of blood from the knife mac was standing here when he was cut and this was only one of the lessons from her months as a crimescene cleaner she stared at other areas marked by fountains of macphersons blood at least one carotid artery was severed that would account for those splashes on the wall a cut to the jugular vein wouldve been more like a leak more like timothy kidds murder macs death was quicker she pointed to a corner that was free of bloodstains thats where the killer stood watching mac die her head bowed as she studied the drops and small puddles of blood on the floor mac was moving in circles i wouldve expected that he was losing so much blood so fast the larger puddles have a different pattern no focus anymore just mindless ambling spending his blood dying in profound shock and absolute terror she turned to face the lieutenant forgive me im telling you things that you already know i didnt mean to no problem said coffey be as thorough as you like he stepped up to the unbloodied section of wall then turned to survey the room from a murderers point of view how do you know the reaper stayed to watch his victim die shes right about that said the medical examiner he held up a plastic bag with a note inside this was stuffed in the mouth most likely after he was dead or thered be more blood on the plastic a gloved crimescene technician took the bag from the doctors hand opened it and extracted the typewritten note with tweezers he read the message aloud im too stupid to go on living thats all it says i thought that was part of the message the reaper always left on the walls said coffey no never said johanna but thats what the reporters were told the note in the victims mouth was the only detail the fbi could conceal from the media and ian zacharys fans mallory stepped forward eyes on johanna saying accusing and now weve established that agent kidd gave you crimescene details or maybe you riker caught mallorys eye and unspoken things passed between them the younger detective fell silent and stepped back into the fold of police timothy thought i could help said johanna if i knew more about the ritual aspects head bowed she stared at her clasped hands dr apollo lieutenant coffey touched her shoulder does anything else resemble the crime scene for the dead fbi agent there was no note stuffed in timothys mouth she said nothing in bunnys mouth either the ritual elements were only for the jurors and timothy didnt panic and run around in circles like this there was a single line of blood on one wall of my reception room a light splatter pattern from the blade but the rest of the blood was confined to a small area when his throat was cut he just sat down in a chair and died quietly glances went from cop to cop all around the room and she knew that she had not been believed lieutenant coffey was incredulous the fbi agent never put up a fight there were no defense wounds said johanna if thats what youre asking he just sat down and died he wouldve lasted longer that way less movement less blood lost apart from that timothys death had more in common with bunnys they were a different class of victims more wary of their surroundings their jugular cuts actually did less immediate damage if i can guess your next question yes those two couldve been saved with pressure on their wounds and prompt medical attention given the aspect of heightened paranoia the reaper wasnt quick enough to do his usual thorough job on either of them bunny might have screamed but i doubt that anyone wouldve paid any attention to him she heard the sound of the body bag zipper but kept her eyes cast down as the medical examiners men rolled their gurney into the hall she might have expected the crimescene technicians to take over now instead she watched the shoes of detectives returning to the room and surrounding her johanna took shallow breaths and braced herself for a new attack what about agent kidd coffeys shoes were only a few feet away youre saying he couldve screamed too so you figure he was just sitting there in your reception room patiently waiting for help quietly that last word carried the unmistakable tone of disbelief was he waiting for you doctor mallorys running shoes stepped forward you were in the next room isnt that right dr apollo yes but you never heard a thing janoss massive brogans lumbered toward her no screams no scuffle nothing all the detectives converged on her all firing questions at once enclosing her in a circle of bodies one of dantes outer rings no johanna decided that hell was not a place after all but an ongoing endless event a traveling creep show that followed her about she closed her eyes her right hand was gently pulled away from her side fingers intertwined with her own and then silence she opened her eyes to see riker standing beside her the other police were backing off in a show of respect for this angry man victor patchock set his red wig on the dresser and surveyed his world of one room and a bath bare walls and a patch of floor some time ago he had removed the doors to the closet and the bathroom and even the cupboard doors of the kitchenette for they might also give cover to the enemy but he could not remove the very walls to get at the smallest invaders the mice he could hear them tunneling day and night the soft crumbles of plaster falling away under quick pink feet their movements inside the walls and the ceiling were constant and he was alert to their every sound they invaded his dreams he dreamed them now eyes wide open staring at a bit of sky all that he could see of it from the barred airshaft window the street window had been recently boarded up lest he be seduced into exposing himself to the outside world on those shutin days when the view of the air shaft was not enough his former life was so far removed in time and memory it must have belonged to someone else victor wanted to go home again he could not and he was so changed no one would recognize him he ran one hand over his bald head suddenly shocked forgetting that he had mutilated himself by shaving off his hair he crossed the room to peer through a crack in the boardedup front window the street below had sparse pedestrian traffic but soon people would be coming home from work filling up the spaces all around him above and below him a hive of people stressed out and strung out but the mice were always with him victor selected a white cane from the four in his umbrella stand and whacked one wall to scare the rodent army that he could hear but not see he beat the plaster harder making cracks and gouges infuriated that he could not get at them his cane snapped his mind snapped he walked back to the airshaft window and looked upward to the small square of daylight the walls crumbled around him as the sky grew darker and this was his only proof of hours passing for he no longer had any clear sense of time and now a new sound had been added he could hear a thin stream of tinny music coming through the walls the mice had a radio lieutenant coffey stood beside the sound engineer known as crazy bitch she had introduced herself that way as if she had no other name detective janos waited outside in the hall for her sound booth was a small space jack coffey wondered if she had bathed or changed her clothes in recent memory her bare feet were dirty and the matted spikes of her hair stuck out at odd angles she sounded rational speaking into the microphone of her headset she introduced the police lieutenant to her boss in the studio on the other side of the window glass though it was not yet airtime ian zachary was interviewing a guest with a baby face torn jeans and new tshirt with the call letters of the radio station if this was the soho fan then mallorys information had been correct coffey wondered if she really did have an informant at the station or had she planted an illegal bugging device in the studio he was a long ways from collecting his pension and it was best not to dwell on that the shockjock held up two fingers to tell the lieutenant that he would have to wait a few minutes not likely jack coffey gently removed the headset from the sound engineers dirty hair and boomed into the mouthpiece now zachary flinched with the sudden pain from his earphones and the lieutenant could hear a buzzer sounding in the hall as the security door was unlocked when coffey and janos entered the studio the englishman stood up to shake hands with them hello gentlemen pull up a couple of chairs jack coffey sat down janos remained standing going with his strength silent menacing via looming over small civilians like the man in the torn jeans who was introduced as randy of soho the youngster had a vacant look about him and the lieutenant wondered if he was high on drugs today or was the boy bone stupid all the time coffey glanced at a clock on the wall zachary youre here early tonight im pretaping the interview with randy here i shouldve mentioned that lieutenant youre on tape now too youll be able to hear yourself on the air in three hours randy leaned into the conversation i thought we were on the air right now a bemused zachary pointed to the clock can you tell time its six oclock said randy taking no offense almost exactly six oclock and when does my show start nine oclock so i guess we cant be on the air not right now can we randy actually gave this a moment of thought then grinned and shook his head zachary shrugged as he looked from one cop to the other i wish i could tell you that hes an atypical fan so whats this all about do i need a lawyer oh yeah said jack coffey we just had a few questions but you should have a lawyer sitting in your lap around the clock and the bastards even told you that didnt they they told you never to talk to cops not without a lawyer checking every word that comes out of your mouth they treat you like an idiot dont they but youre safer that way now if you like he pulled a small card from his pocket you can waive the attorney and then we can get this over with or we can take you downtown and you can just drag this out all night your choice he tossed the card on the console that lists all your constitutional rights i know youve seen it before just sign it he turned away from zachary assuming the attitude of a man who did not care one way or the other and of course the shockjock signed the card coffeys smile was genuine as he turned to the interview guest so youre the famous randy youre the one who ratted out that poor bastard macpherson the young man nodded and smiled so pleased with himself just so happy to be here with ian zachary and the cops we live in the same building hes a real nice guy he fixed my busted radiator jack coffey was slightly discouraged to hear the boy use the present tense the living tense for the latest reaper victim so much hung on the words of this moron the lieutenant slid another card from his pocket this is called a miranda card just like zacharys he handed it to the younger man would you like to sign one too oh sure randy accepted a pen from detective janos and signed the card not bothering to read it and now ian zachary was having second thoughts as he stared down at the card he had just put his own name to too late janos whipped the miranda card out of the mans hand slid it into his coat pocket then collected randys coffeys attention was still focused on zacharys guest randy you say you were friends with macpherson so now that your buddy is dead how do you like your game prizes well i couldnt win the trip to new york city could i i mean cause i already live here i got a place in soho but they put me up in a great hotel for the night i love the minibar he turned to zachary i get to keep all that stuff right the candy and those little bottles of booze you earned it said lieutenant coffey answering for the shockjock so the minibar made it all worthwhile well sure but being on the show hell thats the best part can i say hi to my buddies at the carwash coffey held his friendly smile when you turned in macpherson on the radio did you know what would happen next before the younger man could speak ian zachary shook his head saying dont waste your time lieutenant the pinheads never make that connection coffey ignored this and leaned forward in his chair widening his smile for the fan from soho thats not true is it randy give it up said zachary coffey swiveled his chair around to face the talkshow host i understand that randy is the first winner to get on the air before the murder am i right a minor departure from the format said zachary all but yawning randy doesnt have anything quite as sophisticated as email or even a telephone and he only had a bit of change left for the pay phone so you couldnt afford to lose the connection i understand he wondered if zacharys attorneys had been quite so understanding your producer tells me you spend a lot of time at the station needleman you met him zacharys gaze was fixed on some point beyond the lieutenants chair we had a long talk on the phone coffey glanced back over his shoulder but all he saw was a dark window like the one that spanned the girls lighted sound booth needleman says you spend twelve hours a day in here he told me you had this studio built to specs for prison security are you afraid of the reaper hardly zachary was speaking to the dark window the reaper only kills morons why would i be afraid of him and thats what i told your producer coffey smiled i said needleman those two monsters are partners buddies he splayed his hands in the air am i right in a manner of speaking zachary leaned back in his chair so pleased so smug i suppose you could say the reaper is my biggest fan so you knew hed be listening said janos when randy here told you macpherson lived in his building yeah said jack coffey not wanting to give zachary a moment to consider this that was real cute not giving up the exact address instead you just got randy to mention the restaurant next door very smart actually a huge mistake a firstyear law student would never have approved of that ploy and then macpherson was murdered the reaper couldnt have done it without you have i got that right zachary did i miss anything id say youve got the gist of it so thats a yes coffey turned to detective janos saying cause and effect one down zachary was half risen from his chair what the hell is that supposed to mean jack coffey ignored the startled shockjock and leaned toward the young fan saying you never answered my question randy what did you think would happen when you gave up macpherson on the radio i told you said zachary the fans are idiots they dont have the slightest clue zachary put a sock in it said coffey then remembering that this man was british and slangimpaired he added shut up or ill arrest you for obstructing an investigation clear enough the lieutenant turned all of his attention on the younger man the dimwitted one randy when you made that call what did you think would happen to macpherson with no hesitation at all randy raised his right hand there was no malice in his face only cheerful compliance as he used one finger to make a chilling cutthroat gesture from ear to ear the silent demonstration of a death and jack coffey said close enough he looked up at janos saying cuff zachary janos moved behind ian zacharys chair and pulled out a pair of handcuffs saying youre charged with the murder of john macpherson and zachary yelled this is insane he tried to kill mel really did you report that to the police coffey took the mans dumbstruck expression for a no too bad you were seen in a bar with macpherson last night weve got witnesses he left before i did so youre out drinking with a guy who tried to kill you janos slid the manacles over the mans wrists and you just let him walk away no police report you got a better story than that one the waitress says another customer opened your shirt that night said coffey you were wearing a bulletproof vest that suggests another scenario for i always wear the vest i get death threats ask the damn fbi funny you should mention that said janos an agent named hennessey called to tell us that he was assigned to your security detail but you went out of your way to lose him last night you wore a disguise and hired an impersonator to send him off in another direction coffey smiled and shrugged so you can see why the feds dont exactly help your case the handcuff locks clicked shut ask riker he was with me jack coffey shook his head not when macpherson was killed but even if you had a real tight alibi it wouldnt help you see janos misspoke the charge is conspiracy to murder you conspired with the reaper and your fans he turned to look at randy this one for instance zacharys eyes were rounding and his voice was louder yelling you cant do this to me ive got rights he sucked in his breath then said more calmly ask the damn aclu the law is on my side yeah well that was back in chicago said coffey in new york city we like to make up the rules as we go along you and your fans aided and abetted a serial killer young randy had thus far been still and quiet in the rapt attention of one viewing this live action on television he must have recognized himself in a criminal mention for now he stood up and held out both of his hands happily awaiting his turn to be manacled by detective janos just like zachary no not you said coffey to the youngster morons are excused randy nodded and smiled just kidding jack coffey unhooked a pair of handcuffs from his own belt and did the honors himself saying randy remember that card you signed you have the right to an attorney during questioning if you cant afford randy pay attention this is the important stuff charles butler had a formal dining area a waste of space in his opinion dinner guests invariably gravitated toward the kitchen a warm and spacious room with rich ochre walls racked with spices and utensils that only a gourmet cook could identify a redchecked tablecloth and a vivaldi concerto created the atmosphere of an intimate bistro mallory stood by the door spying on riker and johanna apollo in the front room charles left a pot of sauce to bubble on the stove and placed a glass of red wine in her hand so its not working out quite the way you planned no she said rikers not asking her the right questions you mean hes not treating the woman like a criminal well what a damn shame indeed riker was not behaving like a detective tonight but more like a man in love charles knew all the symptoms obviously mallory did not she set down her wineglass and picked up a stack of dinner plates he had thought it best to give her the chore of setting the table since she would have rearranged anyone elses work as she laid down the plates napkins and silverware he needed no ruler to tell him that every item was precisely one inch from the edge of the table he turned back to the stove and his task of stirring sauce perhaps it was a mistake to expect riker to work this out on his own oh not likely that she would ever agree with that idea maybe youre right she said and charles lost his spoon at the bottom of the pot hes too close to that woman mallory straightened the four chairs then stepped back to survey her work as if there might be a chance in hell that those chairs were not perfectly aligned with the table rikers afraid to ask a question that might incriminate the doctor in what crime shes holding out on me oh that crime well from time to time that would incriminate everyone mallory knew so the situation was not so serious after all and he had hopes of getting through this dinner party without serious carnage after retrieving his sauce spoon charles opened the oven and the aroma of fowl roasting in its juices filled the room mingling with that of garlic bread and the wine sauce riker and the doctor look like theyve put in a very long day perhaps we could put this business aside for the night dont you wonder how a smart woman could go along with that insane jury verdict done with the table hands on hips she turned to face him you read the trial transcript you know it wasnt an honest verdict but riker never read that transcript hes taking the lady on faith faith im talking about hard cold facts theres no way mallory if riker set fire to a school bus full of nuns and children then pushed it off a cliff id have to assume that the nuns and children had it coming to them thats faith she grappled with this for a moment then rallied with a better shot people are dying she said as if he might need that reminder i need to know if dr apollo kept in touch with macpherson if she did then she probably knows where the other juror is hiding nothing easier he picked up an open bottle of red and led the way back to his front room where johanna apollo stood by the far wall admiring an original painting by rothko while riker admired her seen from the back the womans deformity was hidden by her long cascade of dark hair it was more apparent when she turned in profile allowing charles to refill her wineglass he knew that riker was seeing a different image of the doctor from the detectives point of view the lady was without blemish her ordinary face without peer and from charless perspective riker had unexpected good taste in women opting for intelligence and large brown eyes with a remarkable depth that appeared to see all the way to the soul the eyes of a healer the wine had called out his poetic bent and he carried it further likening her to a bouquet of roses though her floral perfume was discreet her warmth and presence filled the room as the scent of flowers would do mallory appeared and the flowers shuddering closed my condolences said charles on the death of your friend mr macpherson did you keep in touch with him after the trial dr apollo nodded charles turned to mallory who was less than impressed with his interrogation style she tipped back her glass riker contrary to habit had hardly touched his wine odd that and mallory with all her control issues was drinking more than her careful allotment of precisely one ounce of alcohol this promised to be an interesting evening dr apollo excused herself and headed toward the kitchen of course everyone wound up there eventually however given the example of the past hour mallorys mere presence was motivation enough for the doctor to quit any room charles topped off rikers glass then returned to the kitchen where he found his dinner guest shredding lettuce for the salad the doctor raised her face to his and smiled charless own loony smile always had that happy effect on people they worked side by side chopping vegetables in companionable silence and then he took up rikers cause the complaint that her hotel was not safe my house is your house i have two guest rooms more than enough space i assure you thank you but its better if i go back to the chelsea its perfectly quiet here he said triplepane windows very thick walls you could set off a cannon and never disturb the neighbors so if you want some latenight distraction music or television im just looking forward to a good nights sleep im told you have a cat if youre concerned about him thats not a problem i get along quite well with animals no she said mugs isnt good with strangers hes happier in familiar surroundings well both be better off in the hotel shes right said mallory from the open doorway your walls might be too thick if the reaper was in your guest room cutting the doctor to pieces youd never hear the screams ill stay in her hotel room tonight this was clearly not an offer on mallorys part but a hard statement of fact and no great favor to the doctor johanna apollo was not smiling anymore mallory stood by the spice rack absently rearranging the bottles so that every label faced forward in perfect alignment and the older woman watched with great interest what would dr apollo make of this show of compulsive neatness charles felt suddenly protective of mallory as though she stood naked her vulnerability publicly exposed he wondered what else had been observed and how close the psychiatrist might have come to a dangerous truth and if the doctor should guess right how might she make use of that information riker entered the kitchen wearing a happy glow that did not come from the wine his glass was still full im hungry he said dinner was served quietly and without any more ceremony than the lighting of a single candle at the center of the table riker seemed unaware of any tension between the two women as he took his seat opposite johanna apollo who might as well be the only occupant of the kitchen he seemed content and this went deeper than his standard laidback countenance he was happy for the first time in many months the cause could only be johanna and charless gratitude was boundless when the candle had melted halfway down and they were nearing the last course of dinner the conversation turned to the subject of lawyers its a fascinating dilemma for the aclu said charles johanna nodded they always seem to pick the causes that paint them in a bad light but this one is just too bizarre the justice system is their raison detre and here they are helping ian zachary to dismantle it one could almost feel sorry for them said charles hey said riker theyre lawyers in his economy of words this meant that whatever their predicament the civilrights attorneys had it coming to them while charles busied himself with setting fire to the bananas flambe he wondered why mallory was the only one not on a firstname basis with johanna apollo as he set down the flaming desserts in front of his guests in one frightened corner of his mind he theorized that she was keeping a professional distance from this woman perhaps mallory did not expect the doctor to survive however there was an alternate and equally good explanation and now he chose to believe that mallory simply did not like sharing friends with other people a beeping noise interrupted his thoughts and only charles the confirmed luddite sat perfectly still as the others checked their cell phones it was mallorys and she rose from the table to take her phone call in the privacy of the next room upon returning to the kitchen she said that was ian zachary hes out on bail and he wants to see me tonight this did not sit well with riker who checked his watch theyre gonna let him go back on the air not tonight said mallory hes suspended pending a hearing tomorrow that should minimize the damage even if he gets a lead on the missing juror he wont expose the man till hes back on the air weve got twentyfour hours to find the reaper or his next victim she stood behind johannas chair leaning down to ask any ideas about where we should start looking johanna lowered her head and remained silent never mind doctor we can talk about that later mallory turned her back on the woman and walked toward the kitchen door saying charles will drive you back to your hotel her hand was on the doorknob when she added with just the suggestion of a threat ill catch up to you later ill go with you said riker slightly annoyed mallory turned around obviously preparing to tell riker that he was not invited and now she discovered that he had not spoken to her his eyes were on johanna apollo only charles took note of mallorys expression for it was quick to surface but more quickly hidden and he put a name to it abandonment needlemans using an alias mallory inspected the door to the producers booth and its premium lock hyped as pickproof but this was nothing approaching the advanced technology for the door to the studio the address you gave me is bogus and so is the social security number in anticipation of ian zacharys next question she said your producers contract is still legal as long as theres no attempt to defraud you can report the fake number to irs on suspicion of tax fraud but i promise you ten treasury agents will not show up to break down this door you have to do something why are you whispering zachary turned his back on her and paced the floor in front of the producers booth occasionally glancing at the locked door mallory sighed this was going to be a long night needleman never threatened you right so whats the real problem he watches me i know he does zacharys voice was more normal now that he had been shamed out of the whispering mode the bastard gives me the creeps needleman a man youve never met could she make it more clear that he was wasting her time his window is always dark said zachary but i can feel his eyes on me im telling you this man is insane now normally thats a prerequisite for my staff but im not the one who hired him hes under contract to the network but your station manager knows needleman right yes but they only met once for the interview my lawyer got me a copy of needlemans contract theres a clause that says he never has to personally deal with me so thats the problem hes outside of your control smart man if not for the wine drunk tonight she might have dialed back the sarcasm no probably not you think needleman knows you killed the last producer you only mention that murder every night on the radio zachary faced the door to the booth you see this lock its relatively new i didnt have it installed and my contracts supposed to give me complete control of security needleman put that lock on his door and he has the only key how paranoid is that hes the only producer at the station who locks the damn booth while were on the air his jitters increased when mallory rested her hand on the knob she smiled he might be a fan thats what youre thinking isnt it judging by the calls you get id say most of them are a little disturbed what if hes the missing juror you were supposed to find that man for me remember well suppose after all this time and money he was right here hiding in this booth all along mallory decided to give zachary a little thrill by pulling out a velvet pouch of lock picks and allowing him to watch her in the act of breaking and entering thus giving him some value for the very large check that highland security would never be able to cash its illegal to carry burglar tools she said if you ever rat me out ill have to hurt you understood perverse bastard he seemed to like that idea the lock yielded and the knob turned easily under her hand and now to give him his full moneys worth she pulled her gun from the shoulder holster then opened the door to an empty booth she flicked on the light to see the same meager floor space as the sound booth on the other side of the hall it also had a window spanning the length of one short wall and looking in on the larger area of the studio the console of this small room had one pair of speakers a headset and little else in the way of technical equipment clipboards with schedules hung from hooks on the rear wall and the wastebasket held more than one mans debris how many people use this room during the day two producers for morning shows the rest of the jocks dont rate a staff but sometimes sponsors come by and look in on their shows mallory ran one finger over the surface of the builtin console there was no dust evidently the cleaning staff had no trouble getting inside well this is progress said zachary you can dust this place for fingerprints but i wont theres no point she did not plan to waste much time exploding the civilians television mythology of fingerprints the prints can only be matched by cops and they need a good reason to use the national database too many people have access to this booth some of these prints have been here since the last time the room was painted a hundred sets maybe more now if you die the cops might run all those prints but otherwise so whats the problem not money just bribe a cop and run them all no cop can run a hundred prints without attracting attention and losing his job half the prints wont even be in the database babysitting ian zachary was tedious and now one hand went to her hip sign language to tell him that this discussion was over why not do it the easy way she led him through the door to his studio when they stood before the dark window of the producers booth she pulled out a camera the size of a cigarette lighter tomorrow night palm this in one hand then jam it up against the glass its small but the flash is bright hell never see it coming when youve got his picture i can tail him for you satisfied she gave him the camera ill put that on your bill he looked down at the small object in his hand smiling at this elegant solution great so what about dr apollo did you get me some good dirt suppose i find something that forces her into an interview wouldnt that spoil the reapers game she doesnt fit his criteria of too stupid to live what if shes the reaper think about it he said a shrink is good at mind games didnt you ever wonder why dr apollo voted not guilty with the rest of them she couldve hung that jury all by herself and heres another thing shes a hunchback a cripple she could walk up to those people and slit their throats before they even got suspicious but why he splayed his hands in a gesture of frustration thats what i need from you a motive it could be the other juror too but im betting on the doctor if i could get her on the air for ten minutes you think shed expose herself to you yes im that good what if she didnt do it well id hardly be inclined to let that get in the way of a good show and ive still got one more juror if the lady flops on the air thats assuming that you can find him for me mallory turned to the dark glass of the producers booth youre not coming with us johanna apollo gently pushed riker away from the car you can hardly keep your eyes open go inside and get some sleep riker had no comeback for that he was cold sober yet his feet were dragging and so was his mind he could only stand there and watch the mercedes pull away from the curb when the car had reached the end of the street a concerned charles butler looked back to see the man still standing there as if he might have forgotten the way home a door three steps to his left hes so tired i hope he doesnt fall asleep on the sidewalk its my fault said johanna im guessing he never closed his eyes last night she faced the windshield and her voice was softer lower now in the range of conspirators all through dinner i had this feeling that you wanted to talk to me in private about mallory said charles she tends to be a bit oh how shall i put this utterly ruthless i wouldnt have said that no you wouldnt youre her friend but thats her nature he began again theres a kind of purity in mallorys character and of course shes a sociopath said johanna but you already knew that they drove on in strained silence for a few blocks while charles cast about in his great reservoir of words for exactly the right ones mallorys foster parents were very sheltering people and good people thats what riker tells me he talks about the markowitzes all the time its a pity they didnt get to that child sooner i believe mallory was ten or eleven when they took her into foster care he understood her meaning louis markowitz had missed the wonder years when his foster daughter should have formed her socialization skills but never did ill tell you where mallory departs from the sociopaths ive treated said johanna she doesnt make any effort to be charming she wouldnt even know how charles had intended this as a defense but the words had come out all wrong however she lies true to form said the doctor and much better than most thats a skill that goes with her job did that sound egregiously defensive on his part he kept his eyes on the road and softened his next remark the lying well thats to a good purpose indeed that was sometimes the case heres another departure you may not have noticed she never lies to increase herself in someone elses eyes and that much was certainly true she doesnt care what the world thinks but the world should care what mallory thinks said johanna apollo and her voice was tinged with a sadness that young woman lives large edgy risky and shes dangerous dangerous said charles well of course she is shes the police and she was so much more than that mallorys also gifted high aptitude for mathematics and computers my job is career placement for very bright people with unusual gifts so i can assure you shed make a fortune if she quit her job with special crimes but would she have a gun and all that power dont you think shed miss frightening people the mercedes came to a gentle stop at a red light and he turned his face to johanna apollos her eyes held nothing but compassion but this would not weaken his adversarial resolve for friendship was everything to him and his precious logic was sometimes warped to the best intentions mallory frightens people when she has a reason to do so you for example she thinks youre holding back something important her instincts are remarkable and very rarely wrong and ive never found any false notes in her basic code shes a cop and a good one she is the law im sure she knows exactly what she is charles nodded understanding these words on every intended level but dont be too sure that you have an easy diagnosis for mallory even if you were right about her id never have her trade places with someone someone normal less dangerous perhaps you do understand her and you wanted to warn me about her thank you id be honored to have mallory for an enemy but i think she looks at me like a broken piece of machinery that wont cooperate in her scheme if you know who the reaper is id never tell mallory why ruin her game shes beautifully equipped to work it out on her own oddly enough i admire her she makes no apologies takes no prisoners actually she does said charles as the mercedes rolled forward again thats not just a figure of speech she takes hostages that was the warning riker watched the taillights of the mercedes until they winked out with the turn onto houston he sat down on the front steps preferring this to falling down the cold air was doing him no good had he ever been this tired before jo was right tonight he would be useless to her but he had no worries about the reaper while the giant charles was in her company though mallory would actually make a more formidable opponent and she was the one he counted upon to keep jo alive through the night with any luck the lady would sleep through the changing of the guard when her second watcher arrived at the hotel and he could only hope that jo had the presence of mind to lock up mugs before the cat could annoy mallory and die it was at times like this when he was at his weakest that unbidden memories flooded his mind he covered his eyes as if that would help him block out an image of the wildeyed teenager sitting on his bloody chest the young psycho had been so disappointed that there was not one bullet left so that he might shoot out rikers eye in the mornings in that small space of time when dreams were not yet shaken off he could feel the cold metal pressed to his eyeball and hear the click his head tilted back and he stared at the sky where the stars ought to be there were none chains of thought on the subject of heaven led him back to mexico and starry nights in cholla bay if he could only make it back to that place that summer he had finally found a way to kill his waking nightmare replacing it with a picture of his younger self standing on the beach under a mexican sun this boy was waiting for the man to wise up to come back to the only place where he had been truly happy if jo would go with him he might save himself a cops pension would buy a life for two he shook his head no you damn jerk thats a pipe dream the boy with the guitar had had his chance and blown it thrown it all away and gone home to new york and the man full grown and going gray would surely die in this town falling short of salvation tonight riker thought he might settle for a drink or ten he rose to his feet and headed down the street to a bar hours later closing time he was home again and entering the apartment building feeling insufficiently smashed and counting on a quart of bourbon in his kitchen cupboard to finish the job riker was off to his bottle and his bed and with any luck a blackout night with no dreams when he stepped out of the elevator the hall was pindrop quiet pausing at the door he fumbled with a ring of keys unlike most new yorkers who only bothered with one lock out of three he had lately picked up the habit of locking them all the process of opening them took longer when he was drunk finally after all combinations of keys and locks had been exhausted he opened the door and felt along the wall till he found the switch and flicked it no light the door was slammed shut but not by his hand and riker only had time to track the sound of an intruders quick shuffling footsteps in the dark the gunshots were four explosions in rapid fire and he did not stiffen this time he folded to the floorboards hitting with both knees and feeling no pain kneeling now he faced a wall of blackness and never saw the light from the hall when the shooter opened the door behind him riker closed the door himself as his body completed its fall to the floor toppling backward and slamming into the wood dust motes drifted down to settle on the lenses of his open eyes he never blinked chapter mrs ortegas rolling wire arsenal was armed with liquids powders pastes and every tool of her trade intent on braving a cleaning womans vision of purgatory she walked toward rikers apartment with grim resolve and squeaking cart wheels her apron pockets jingled with quarters for the laundry machines on the floor below wagering that rikers sheets had not been changed in months she planned to root him out in this early morning hour while he was half asleep and helpless to prevent her from completing her mission the real beauty of her strategy was rikers heavy drinking all she had to do was fire up the vacuum cleaner and jack up the pain of his hangover to drive him out so she could get on with her job this was going to happen her attitude abruptly changed rikers door was not quite closed and this was enough to set off a siren in the breast of every new yorker in this town locking up was such a primal instinct that dogs would do it if they only could a sage voice inside her head screamed no dont go in there yet she put out one tentative hand and pushed the knob inward by a few inches before meeting resistance from an obstacle blocking the door she could see a revolver lying at the center of the rug and now she knew what the obstacle was using all her slight weight she pushed hard against the sturdy oak door then slammed herself into the wood again and again rikers inert body slowly grudgingly moved inch by inch dead or alive he would yield to mrs ortegas great will when the telephone rang in johanna apollos hotel suite it was mallory who answered first she heard the voice of the excited cleaning woman then charles butler was on the line and he was only marginally calmer listen to me said mallory mrs ortega is absolutely right dont touch his body dont do anything till i get there im only a few minutes away after hanging up the phone in the middle of charless protest she rapped on the bathroom door shouting to be heard above the sound of running water doctor we have to leave now mallory stood before the open closet reaching for her coat then suddenly turned to see the small animal just released from the master bathroom where he had spent the night he had been softly creeping up behind her when a tiny squeak of excitement gave him away now he paused as their eyes met and they mutually agreed that she could kill him any time she liked mugs wise cat retreated to his basket pillow she said not to touch anything said mrs ortega and that includes him mallory says a lot of things charles could no longer bear to see riker lying there eyes wide and staring seeing nothing he lifted the mans body in his arms then laid him down on the couch i cant think why i let you talk me out of calling no phone calls mrs ortega came running from the bedroom with a blanket to cover riker trust me on this one he wouldnt want anybody to see him like this her only betrayal of emotion was the way she tucked the blanket around the still body then smoothed out all the folds in the material if she could not mend him she could at least neaten him up a bit charles glanced at his watch just as he was thinking that mallory should be here by now given the reckless way she drove a car the detective came striding through the open doorway i told you not to move him mallory only glanced at riker then turned her back on him as if he were a piece of evidence at a crime scene instead of the more obvious victim of a life gone terribly awry she drew her gun opened the doors to the closet and the bathroom then disappeared down the hall to the bedroom reappearing a moment later gun bolstered she said tell me you didnt call anyone else no said charles but i should have he needs a doctor i brought one mallory nodded toward the front door johanna apollo stood in the hallway gladstone bag in hand her wide brown eyes were fixed upon the gun on the floor you didnt say hed been shot not a mark on him said mrs ortega suspiciously eyeing the medical bag in the hunchbacks grip youre a doctor her tone implied fraud quackery apparently johanna apollo was not satisfied with a cleaning womans assessment of rikers bulletfree status she ripped the blanket away then shifted him onto his side and checked for overlooked bloody holes finding none she rolled him on his back again he doesnt blink much said mrs ortega but hes not dead taking the cleaning womans arm mallory led her away from the couch saying show me were you found the body the body charles winced he was right there mrs ortegas pointing finger made the vague outline of a prone figure on the rug in front of the door mallory stared at the weapon on the floor beside it lay a round metal object ringed with deep bulletsize chambers the cleaning woman had earlier identified it as a speedloader this intelligence based on extensive television viewing johanna apollo was bending over her patient shining a light into rikers eyes and finding no one at home in there profound shock heedless of this mallory stood over the weapon on the floor and pulled on a pair of plastic gloves thats not rikers gun she picked up the weapon opened its cylinder and emptied two unspent bullets into the palm of her hand charles lacked his cleaning womans television expertise in weaponry but he was quite sure that these were not normal bullets they would be more accurately described as the bottom halves of bullets sealed with wax blanks said mallory somewhat incredulous someone broke in here and shot him with blanks mrs ortega and charles sighed in unison so ended their only line of speculation the theory of a suicide gone wrong so it was a robbery the cleaning woman was almost cheerful much preferring this less personal crime blanks go figure she returned to the couch and leaned down to pick up the castoff blanket these criminal types get dumber every year thats what riker always says she rearranged the blanket over the mans body saying to the doctor you have to keep him warm youre right thank you johanna apollo moved aside to allow the cleaning woman more room then patiently waited out the manic tucking and smoothing of the blanket as if mrs ortegas ministrations were more important charles was deeply grateful for this small act of grace johanna had rightly intuited that this little stranger with a brooklyn accent was in a bit of trouble herself mrs ortega was tightly reining in emotions that would only humiliate her should they spill out and now he studied mallory the only unaffected person in the room she was utterly focused on the weapon in her gloved hand this has to be the revolver he took away from that idiot juror riker said the man emptied this gun in the parking garage so the perp who broke in here took the ammo from macphersons speedloader in mallorys other hand she hefted the remaining truncated bullets as if they might have real weight the shooter was already inside he was standing here in the middle of the room when riker opened the door the lights were off he was facing the dark and backlit from the hall her gun hand was rising the muzzle pointing toward the door and the shooter fired exactly four blanks charles closed his eyes for a moment her picture of events was all too clear turning to the prone figure on the couch a man twice proved to be unsafe in his own home charles hunkered down beside the doctor who was sorting through bottles in her medical bag johanna you should know his history a psychotic teenager shot him four times all the wounds were to the torso all life threatening it happened in his old apartment back in brooklyn he nearly died said mrs ortega he did die said charles he was clinically dead for three minutes before the paramedics revived him and in a sense the man had died again for the gunshots had obviously seemed quite real to him four bullet wounds said the doctor and now four blanks he must have thought the boy had come back to no said mallory the shooters dead extremely dead said charles yeah said mrs ortega you wouldnt believe how dead that kid is the cleaning woman turned to mallory so let me get this straight when riker fell down the freak left him for dead cause he didnt see any holes in the body and thats how you know the lights were out yeah thats it poor guy didnt even have time to reach for the wall switch it was mallorys mildest form of contempt something bordering on courtesy to simply ignore the cleaning womans observations though charles thought the logic was rather good however now he had time to notice that the wall switch was in the on position but the lights were off perhaps crime detection was something the layperson should not try at home if the freak cased this apartment said mallory hed know the only other tenant on this floor was out of town no risk and thick walls said charles no one would hear the gunfire and come running mallory shook her head i dont think he planned to make a lot of noise he came here with something else in mind finding macphersons gun in the apartment that was a bonus so riker surprised a thief said charles having learned nothing from mrs ortegas last foray well that fits i expect it wouldve taken an experienced burglar to get past the locks on rikers door you never felt that draft the young detective nodded toward the bathroom she had checked upon her arrival the door was slightly ajar charles opened it a bit wider and now he was staring at the broken window overlooking the fire escape not a pro said mallory only amateurs do that but breaking that window shouldve set off the alarm i had a security service install it before he moved in they assured me the police would be notified the instant no said mallory that would only work if riker bothered to pay the monthly service fee she was facing the open door to the kitchen wherein lay a mountain of unopened mail mallory had recommended bars for the bathroom window and even offered to pay for them but riker had declined the bars arguing that he had nothing to steal charles looked around the room of walltowall debris yes jewel thieves and the like so seldom broke into places like this his gaze settled on johanna apollo as she tied a rubber tourniquet around rikers upper arm to plump up a vein she was unaware of the younger woman stealing up behind her mallory bent low to johannas ear saying softly the reaper likes to play with people doesnt he doctor johanna froze as if mallory had screamed instead of whispered the doctor quickly recovered her poise and with a steady hand filled a syringe from a thin bottle yes he does she shot a trial spurt of fluid into the air then filled rikers vein with the rest of her chemicals im going to need a few more things from the pharmacy when mrs ortega had quit the apartment with a handful of prescriptions to fill charles was given the task of putting riker to bed and johanna was left alone with the young detective whom she had come to regard as her jailor at least there was no doubt about who was in charge how long will this take mallory might as well have been asking when her dry cleaning would be done hes in shock said johanna i can bring him around in a few hours the younger woman advanced on her with a slow shake of the head to say no doctor thats not what i mean and you know it how long will it take to fix him the state hes in now thats only a symptom of his core problem johanna sank down on the couch taking her cues from animals in the wild not wanting to give the appearance of challenging mallorys authority in this room she did not regard this young woman as less than human but somewhat more dangerous a cure could take years longterm therapy judging by mallorys sudden anger johanna knew the detective had no clue to the extent of rikers infirmity he would not have shared the entire experience in the underground parking garage he would never have mentioned the paralysis brought on by gunfire not to the police and certainly not to this one you know what happened to him said mallory its a simple the problem goes beyond hearing those shots and thinking hed been ambushed again that effect would have been temporary twice now she had seen it pass off very quickly i interned at a city hospital ive seen my share of trauma victims theres more to this than a single event johanna found herself preaching to the walls youre wrong the detective was shaking her head i need him back on his feet by the end of the day and fully functional hes on the reapers radar now or did you really think that firing exactly four blanks was just a coincidence johanna deferred to mallory on the subject of psychological terrorism she wondered if this young sociopath was what timothy had in mind when he wrote the words only a monster can play this game no case would ever be proven against the reaper and no justice obtained for the dead not by normal human means but perhaps by mallorys johannas sidelong glance caught her own profile in the fulllength mirror hanging on the open bathroom door she studied the hump on her back without bias and fairly deemed herself the lesser monster in this room theres no one i care about more than riker said johanna i wouldve died before id let this happen to him but you you pushed him into this confrontation you might as well have shot him yourself the game means more to you than he does mallory sat down at the extreme edge of a chair creating the nervejangling illusion of hovering there like a cat set to spring you like him so much good she brought one fist down on the coffee table with the force of a hammer then fix him much could be read into that small gesture of violence it was no signal of a runaway temper but deliberate and manipulative the young detective had a freakish containment of emotion and this control had come from long practice at trying to pass for normal a quick fix johanna settled into a calm absolute certainty that mallory would not physically harm her and hence had lost all power over her rikers not unconscious im sure hes aware of whats going on around him she nodded toward the hallway that led to rikers bedroom suppose you go in there hold him very close and tell him you care if he lives or dies or you could shoot him with a real bullet either way there might be a beneficial shock value and she wondered which of these alternatives mallory would be most comfortable with but i still recommend therapy years of therapy the detectives tone was not mere sarcasm but malice she stood up suddenly the better to look down on her opponent no time doctor mallory pulled a velvet wallet from her back pocket and plucked out a thin piece of metal she crossed the room to stand before a small desk after diddling the lock on a drawer she opened it and pulled out another weapon this is rikers gun six months ago i cleaned it for him hes such a slob hed never do it himself she carried the revolver back to the couch and held the muzzle close to the older womans face close enough to see that all the exposed chambers held lethal bullets had the young police been hoping for a cringe or a tremor yes there was a flicker of annoyance in those green eyes breathe deep said mallory smell the oil this guns been cleaned every day since he left the hospital hes got a new oil can under the sink and three empty ones in the trash the trash he only takes out once a month johanna wondered if mallory had been systematically breaking into this apartment to check up on riker of course she had she passed through locks with such ease the detectives body slowly revolved and her eyes wandered over the chaos of the front room so it didnt take me years to figure out what was wrong with him look at the mess in this place but what a nice welloiled spotless weapon her fingers curled tightly round the handle of the revolver its insane how many times he cleans his gun one white hand slowly drifted down to the back of an armchair touching it lightly almost a caress he sits here with his cigarettes his bourbon and his gun the next morning the ashtrays full the bottles empty and the gun is perfectly clean thats how i know what hes thinking about every night hes setting up habits planning his own crime scene staging it thats why the empty bottle and the gun oil are so important theyre props the night he finally decides to do it i know there wont be a note left behind hell want me to believe it couldve been an accident riker thinks thatll make it easier for me to lose him stunned johanna resolved never to underestimate this woman again she would not be tempted one more time to find mallory a convenient slot in the range of sociopathic behavior this creature was standing alone in a category all her own whatever she was she was one of a kind the young detective stood at the window something on the street below had distracted her there was a sudden tension in the rising hand that held the gun she laid the weapon down on the desk blotter saying its fully loaded so dont touch it just think of it as a bomb you still think hes got years she crossed the room quickly and the door closed behind her with a bang johanna stared at the revolver then looked up to see charles butler standing on the far side of the room he must have heard a good part of the conversation for his face was sad and sympathetic riker does that too said johanna always slamming doors charles strolled over to the desk picked up the gun with obvious distaste and shut it up in the drawer mallory only does it when shes irritated or to intimidate that too he joined her on the couch easing down on the cushion and giving her a foolish smile as he hunted for some way to arrange his long legs mallory took the stairs at a dead run feet touching down on every third step and landing in the hall she ran to the door and pushed into the street the man she had seen from the window was heading for the subway she followed at a distance descending the stairs to the underground train following the red wig the black coat and white cane the mans movements were quirky as he turned to see her coming up behind him she made no attempt to hide he dropped his cane and she stood very still patiently waiting for him to retrieve it he backed away and she took two steps forward he turned and ran pausing at the stairs to the lower level then clutching the rail in his stumbling descent cat and mouse they rode the trains uptown and down johanna stared at her hands i thought mallory was using riker to get to me so she could play the game and now he said you realize that it was quite the other way around riker needed help her dragging him into this mess that was brutal and necessary i couldnt have done it neither could you she nodded im wondering if mallory might be the better psychiatrist oh hardly what she did to him was dangerous though i dont think anyone couldve predicted this outcome but rikers still alive isnt he you know it was mallorys idea to move riker in here you might say that was for her convenience so she wouldnt have to drive all the way to brooklyn to check up on him charless eyes slowly took in the entire room this was the only safety net she could devise for him now this is a bit of a stretch for you given what you think of her but she saw rikers breakdown coming yes and long before i did she always knew how much trouble he was in her instincts are superb and thats quite a compliment to you she seems to have great confidence in your ability to she thinks i can fix him in a day impossible theres more to this than a single frightening incident it could take months just to uncover his history before i could even begin to deal with the anger issues thats why he slams doors on some level hes angry all the time but thats a recent thing with riker i agree theres a complex problem here but you might want to consider the idea that it all began six months ago before that before that he drank too much thats been going on for years hasnt it well yes she studied the room the signs of depression spread in long tentacles of debris a tangible malaise just looking at this clutter made her tired charles i recall him saying that hes known you for four or five years in all that time has he ever been a particularly tidy man no but his old apartment wasnt nearly as bad as this charless foot nudged an open carton containing an object that was only recognizable as pizza by the wedge shape of the fungus and all the really moldy food that was kept in the refrigerator his hopeful smile wavered all right granted riker has other issues but he was never unbalanced nothing about him indicated an unstable mind and he never slammed doors johanna nodded for this supported mallorys theory rikers anger was tied to recent history mallorys mouse in the red wig had learned quickly she never came closer than twenty paces now he actually stopped to place a phone call from the wall street station and then they were off again more trains more stations all around the town and all the while he was showing more signs of being rattled dark glasses sliding down his sweaty little nose the next time he looked back at her she smiled and he stumbled she knew with a certainly that his next stop would be grand central johanna leaned forward already forgiving charles butler as she laid one hand upon his arm now tell me what youre holding back something intensely personal yes she was right his face was flushing apologizing for him even before he spoke the mans words were hesitant at first this has to be in confidence one doctor to another said johanna i heard this story from a third party louis markowitz mallorys foster father yes louis was also the commander of special crimes unit and he was rather worried about riker charles paused perhaps realizing that he had just supplied her with more evidence of a man in trouble long before the day he had been shot this wasnt an actual consultation you see i dont treat patients it was more like a conversation to put louiss mind at ease he couldnt handle this problem internally he described the police psychologist as a hack and somewhat less than discreet so i was the only one louis could talk to it seems that riker had been fixated on his former wife at the time theyd been divorced for fifteen years or so as obsession goes i thought it rather mild charles smiled as he accurately read her mind i know given the time frame youre thinking i must be mad but there was no overt behavior problem riker took an apartment a block away from his exwife he kept close tabs on her routine knew where shed be on any given day so that they might pass one another on opposite sides of the street oh and this is what got louis markowitzs attention riker used police privileges to track down all her parking tickets scads of them and he paid them for her anonymously that was the extent of his obsessive behavior he never approached his exwife never even wanted to talk to her and i dont think he loved her anymore just the idea of her of their life together a romantic ideation yes despite appearances i believe hes a deeply romantic man now if you were to repeat that i think riker might shoot me so his exwife merely represented a part of his old life and he simply couldnt move past it his old life when it was good she had made her point for charles lowered his eyes as he nodded after a moment of uncomfortable silence she prompted him saying and then well then he did get past it riker was talking about moving out of that neighborhood even before he was shot before that happened his frame of mind was improving hardly a man in decline and thats why i believe mallorys diagnosis is correct he smiled apologetically sorry thats jarring isnt it but i dont think this problem requires burrowing years into his past and riker wouldnt want you to know the history with his exwife not you of all people he held her gaze a moment to be sure that she understood the import the very reason for this disclosure and there it was inescapable as if charles had written the words within a heart carved upon a tree riker loves johanna apollo chapter the janitor had finished swabbing the first toilet bowl when he realized that he was not alone a sign had been posted to close the mens room while he cleaned it but a patron had slipped silently past him when his back was turned he watched the stall door at the end of one row slowly softly closing and he detected a scent unrelated to cleaning solvents piss and defecation it was not cologne for he knew all those smells odors were his life perfume well if there was a transvestite back there he was a quiet one and absent the sound of a zipper what might the pervert be doing shooting drugs of course so predictable he also knew that the addict would be a newcomer to this downstairs rest room all the permanent residents homeless men who made their beds in the stalls would know better than to enter this place while his cleaning cart barred the door after ten years in grand central terminal the janitor was never taken by surprise his job had gone stale he had seen it all and sometimes saw it ahead of time he could even roughly describe the next person to enter the facility by the light tap of a cane on the floor beyond the door a blind man was an easy guess too easy it was hardly worth the trip around the corner to the section of urinals and sinks the door opened and surprise yeah yeah a white cane preceded a blind woman oh no the janitor was not so easily fooled that was definitely a man behind those dark glasses apart from the long red hair everything was masculine so what he had here was a blind drag queen dressed for a day job from the neck down but not a redhead the wig disappeared into a pocket of the black coat and the blind mans own snowwhite hair was mussed leaning toward the vaguely shiny metal that passed for a vandalproof mirror the old geezer ran his gnarly fingers over his scalp to smooth down the wild strands not blind either but this was hardly surprising grand central was a mecca for bogus beggars the janitor leaned on his mop bored by the ongoing striptease but this was all the spectacle he had the old mans dark glasses were now secreted in the breast pocket of a very fine suit that really belonged in the posh ticketholders rest room upstairs and the white cane was hooked in the crook of his arm then hidden beneath the folded black coat when the crazy old bugger had closed the door behind him and the janitor believed that the rest room held only one drugshooting crossdressing occupant he turned in the direction of the toilet stalls his mouth fell open and his heart banged against the wall of his chest a tall greeneyed blonde blocked his way to the stalls he quickly stood aside as she marched across the tiles heading for the door in hot pursuit of the old man and she was no transvestite no sir no adams apple on her this one was all girl and strictly uptown in that long black leather coat that must have cost the world the janitors heart calmed down he smiled life still had a few surprises for him mallory glared at the old mans back he stood at the center of the great hall and the crisscrossing traffic of commuters once again she had followed a fake blind man with a long red wig he had led her back to this same place but this time she had passed the young man by entering the mens room well ahead of him only to watch him grow old before her eyes somewhere along the route of changing subway trains this elderly man had donned the disguise of the younger one and she planned to make him pay for that deception mallory reached out and clamped one hand on his shoulder then spun him around a cellophanewrapped cigar flew from his hand and he could only stare at her in bugeyed surprise where is he she grabbed the old mans arm in a tight grip where youll have to be more precise my dear i know so many people the cultured tones of an educated man were a good match to his tailored suit she had counted on a little stammering signs of frayed nerves the typical response of civilians in sudden encounters with police so why was this man smiling the guy who gave you the wig and the cane the young one where is he oh i really couldnt tell you sorry he said though his grinning face put a lie to that well i expect youll want to arrest me now obstruction of justice or some such thing as if the city doesnt have enough lawsuits for false arrests he put out his hands awaiting the manacles entirely too gleeful mallory regarded him as she would a bag of snakes and cockroaches for she suspected him of being a lawyer near his feet was the cigar he had dropped but littering was only worth a ticket she stepped closer to him and feigned a swoon eyes closing he reached out to break her fall grabbing her by both arms thats assault her voice was loud heads turned all around the hall you just assaulted a cop the old mans eyes were bulging and he lacked the presence of mind to take his hands off her shoulders he was staring at all the faces turning his way people were slowing down then stopping to watch and two young policemen were running toward him johanna apollo opened the door to find mrs ortega standing in the hall clutching a large plastic bag with a pharmacy logo the cleaning woman wordlessly moved into the room and dumped out the medical supplies on the coffee table then breathless from running all the way she hurried down the short hall to the bedroom johanna followed intending to approach this wiry little person with greater caution than she had taken with rikers other protectors in the bedroom mrs ortega was fretting over the sleeping man tucking the blanket under his chin and smoothing stray hairs from his brow such simple services and done so awkwardly clearly acts of tenderness were outside the character of this roughspoken new yorker the cleaning woman exuded anxiety and she no longer had her mask of bravado to disguise the fact that she was coming undone hes in deep trouble mrs ortega continued to fuss with the blanket picking off tiny wadded balls of wool as she spoke her piece all the drugs in the world aint gonna help him i know said johanna and not in any condescending manner but the prescriptions always make the friends and family feel better gotcha mrs ortega nodded as one conspirator to another but her sorry eyes remained concentrated on riker i shouldve got to him sooner i seen this kind of thing before the cleaning woman waved one hand in the air to say that she had borne witness to the whole sorry range of humanity rikers got nothin and nobody holes up like a hermit since he got shot i mean the time he was really shot real bullets now look at him i seen it before maybe not this bad say one of my customers loses his job well life gets a little crazy sure but that guys still got his nice clean home real clean she pressed one hand to her bosom and said with great pride i do windows she turned back to the man on the bed most people in trouble they still got friends family something normal you know what im sayin i know said johanna rikers home was in brooklyn mrs ortega pulled a rag from an apron pocket he cant go back she absently polished an uncluttered corner of the small table by the bed the rag running round and round as she spoke so how does this happen gettin ambushed again she wagged one finger at johanna ill tell you how he cut off his friends lost his job hes off his game if hed gotten one piece of his life together just a day sooner nobody couldve taken him down this way not riker no maam if id only got to him sooner she sat down at the edge of the bed slowly folding her lean frame as if deflating losing air and will and her voice was smaller when she said i couldve fixed him how mrs ortega looked up suspecting derision instead she found compassion in johannas eyes and also the encouragement to keep going and so she continued its like everybodys life sits on three legs you got your home thats a big one and then theres work then friends well say one thing goes wrong maybe two you can still stand on one leg right but whats riker got mrs ortegas eyes were unfocused looking inside where the guilt was stored no wonder he fell down i shouldve got to him sooner hes still fixable johanna pulled a wad of money from the back pocket of her jeans id like to rent your cart of supplies for the rest of the day naw the woman waved away the proffered money this is my day off thats why i stopped by to finish up with my charity case here the old new yorker attitude was creeping back into mrs ortegas voice and her face showed the more normal state of contempt as she threw up her hands you think this slob would ever pay for a cleaning woman never so ill stay and finish the job for free ive got a better idea said johanna youll like it and mrs ortega did like the plan she loved it it reeked of the poppsychology cures found in her selfhelp books and television programs for johannas part it was merely an entree a means of walking around inside rikers head the elderly lawyer stood in the company of policemen and a hundred other people he was not the focus of everyones attention for the most dedicated travelers obviously outoftowners were bent on catching trains of overground rail and underground subway and selectively blind to the show but a hardcore new york crowd was assembling in a wide circle maintaining the distance of an experienced audience for live theater the old man waited with great trepidation as the two young officers spoke with the pretty blond police who had accused him of assault detective mallory smiled as she turned his way and he took this as a good sign that their recent misunderstanding would be presently and pleasantly resolved she looked down at one of her black running shoes and her face was somewhat petulant when she said you scuffed it do you have a handkerchief ah yes what a small price to pay for freedom a very small price indeed with a courtly bow the old man pulled a folded square of monogrammed irish linen from his pocket and handed it to her she held it for a moment her eyes meeting his with a cold stare when she opened the handkerchief a twentydollar bill appeared in the fold of material he stared at it aghast there was no way it could have a bribe the young woman held up the handkerchief and the mysterious twentydollar bill she handed the money to one of the men in uniform the bill is evidence bag it thats not my twenty said the incredulous lawyer i can prove it he opened his wallet see i dont have anything smaller than a fifty so now youre trying to bribe all of us she turned to the officers thats probable cause for a search pat him down for weapons the brief foray into his clothing turned up the odd contents of his pockets and what was hidden under his folded coat a red wig a white cane and dark glasses were confiscated as the audience of civilians stepped closer this show kept getting better and better the detective had a very unnerving smile this better be a good story what are you up to old man it was the tapping of the blind mans cane that woke riker no not that jo was lightly rapping the floor with her soles a sitdown tap dance an old soft shoe to the rhythm of wake up wake up he opened his eyes a bit wider when he saw the long tube that began with a needle in his arm and led up to a bag of fluid hanging from the bedpost thats a valium drip she said valium how humiliating the drug of choice for old ladies and other sissies a cluster of pharmacy bottles on his nightstand completed the image of an invalids sickroom he looked down at his chest where four new bullet holes should be and saw that his clothes had been changed he wore a black tshirt his pants were also black part of a suit that he seldom wore and that accounted for the lack of stains and cigarette burns in the material and his feet were bare he was all laid out like a corpse at his own wake so jo who picked out my ensemble i did thats your shroud youre dead today she smiled as if this might be a good thing its a trick i learned in college remember final exams those days when you didnt want to get out of bed ever again playing dead can actually cheer you up nobody expects anything of a corpse life gets so much easier after you die oh did i mention that im the one who dressed you and now that ive seen you naked shouldnt i at least know your first name i told you the day i met you jo i dont have a first name never did he fished in one pocket and found it empty go get my id check it out i already looked at it theres an initial a p what does that stand for thats all it says on my birth certificate he watched her remove the needle from his arm then noticed the puncture wounds of other injections a chemical soup he felt docile but not dopey no fog in the mind and he needed no help to get out of his bed had he known what jo had in mind for the day he would have rolled over and gone back to sleep lieutenant coffey had a comfortable frontrow seat in the shadows but the show on the other side of the oneway glass was over in the next room of bright lights an elderly prisoner sat with his babysitter a great hulk of a cop whose facial features suggested that he might be prone to bonesnapping violence detective janos was under orders not to speak for his soft and gentle voice was evidence of a benign soul adored by dogs and children so he merely stared at the old man sometimes grunting a reply the prisoner was smiling apparently enjoying janoss company and chatting amiably not caring that the guttural responses were somewhat limited lieutenant coffey turned to the young detective seated beside him in the dark what possessed you to arrest a lawyer always wanted to said mallory jack coffey nodded this was every cops fantasy what the hell riker would have decked anyone else for trying to wrap him in an apron but since it was jo he was helpless to untie the bow she had fashioned behind his back well start with the kitchen she said its a pit a good description the floor was so sticky with spilled food and beer he sometimes got stuck like a bug on flypaper when he walked through the room barefoot she led the way down the hall to the kitchen where a familiar object was waiting riker had never seen charless cleaning woman separated from her wire cart of tools and supplies dont tell me what you did with mrs os body its better if i dont know jo pulled a garbage bag from a box on the cart and handed it to him i supervise you do the work she sat down at the table and watched him bundle junk mail and beer cans into the bag after the floor had been cleared she handed him a plastic bottle he struggled with the concept of a spray nozzle as she explained that the liquid would cut through the grease on the tiles then asked so what did your parents call you when you were little after spraying the floor he pushed the mop around in silence jos foot tapped to an impatient rhythm and he said my dad called me hey kid my little brothers name was you too you never asked what the p stood for highly unlikely said the tone of her voice okay ill tell you the story my old man told me riker pretended interest in the floor tiles emerging from the dirt dads name was phillip he said i was named after him but he didnt want me to get stuck with a tag like junior for the rest of my life so he just put the p on my birth certificate he said it was a secret just between us and even my mom didnt know well i loved that story and i never told it to anybody not ever not having a first name that drove the other kids nuts it was great but when you were older and less gullible you asked him for the real story right chapter the odor of rancid food was foul and so johanna supervised the cleaning from a distance riker was stalled he stood barefoot in the light of the refrigerators greasesplattered bulb his hands filled with small packets of mustard and ketchup salvaged from takeout containers and now he debated the value of his condiment collection oh get crazy said johanna just toss it every time you throw something away your load gets a little lighter mrs ortegas philosophy of clutter was carried through all the drawers of the kitchen repositories of empty matchbooks dead batteries and metal parts that had fallen off of appliances that he no longer owned one broken swizzle stick was tied to a memorable binge and he was allowed to keep it out on the street johanna watched him load the garbage cans with bags of trash and throwaways including socks with holes that could not be mended not even with the yarn of entire socks the effect of her drugs was wearing off he objected to bare feet on cold pavement but she would not let him put on shoes arguing that dead men had no need for them but socks might be all right he found one hardly used pair beneath the bed and she stood over him as he sat on the rug and put them on so how old were you when you knew your father lied about your first name when did he tell you the real story instead of answering her he lowered his head to take on the next task foraging under the bed for the wildlife of spiders and dust bunnies and now it occurred to her that the story of his first name was not the small easy confidence that she had counted on to open his mind to the healing process and the toxic secret that poisoned him all right she said spilling pharmacy tablets into her hand never mind the meds a chemical cheat would destroy his resistance jo held out the pills in one hand and a glass of water in the other he took them willingly enough trained from childhood to follow the doctors orders with absolute trust she planned to render him defenseless so that she might crack his mind wide open before this day was over lets try something easier she said why do you always slam doors coffey sat in the dark irritated beyond belief in the interview room on the other side of the oneway glass his detective was not faring as well to some extent the silent treatment had worked for the suspect was certainly talkative however the elderly lawyer was winning the day slowly wearing down poor janos with endless prattle about the great game of cops and killers and displaying ignorance of both jack coffey turned to mallory you got his stats she nodded old and rich im guessing he got fed up with retirement he thought i was going to arrest him for obstruction of justice perversely mallory had arrested him for everything but that jack coffey scanned the list of charges against the old man littering assault on a police officer and two counts of bribery and she had no less than twelve corroborating statements god bless eyewitness testimony worthless as it was and the power of suggestion though the evidentiary twentydollar bill was certainly mallorys own money eight of her witnesses had come to believe that they had actually seen the old man hand her the bribe but all the lieutenant had really needed to know was that the elderly lawyer represented a young man with an obsessive interest in detective sergeant riker i guess thisll hold him for a while said coffey but hell never give up his client and now hes going to sue the city just for fun wrong she said hes going to fold after a few hours in a lockup cage the old man was a probate attorney no criminal practice only wealthy lawabiding clients im betting this is his first visit to a police station lets find out the lieutenant pressed the intercom so his voice would be heard in the next room janos book the old bastard and take your time we got all night to dick around with him jack coffey smiled for the attorneys expression of shock was worth the threat to his pension it was slowly dawning on the old man that his incarceration was going to be dragged out a bit longer than he had previously supposed he might be looking forward to lockup time in the company of prisoners with satanic delusions and head lice that were all too real it was during a field trip to the downstairs laundry room that riker made his first confession while waiting for the washing machine to finish the spin cycle he sat beside her on a bench by the window his face bathed in late afternoon light eyes in soft focus looking inward insanity goes with the job he said all the people in this town are smashed in together stacked up like cordwood im surprised they dont go nuts more often and the things they do to each other jo its a horror show every night and heres the scary part sometimes police go nuts too ill never be a cop again because of what happened in the parking garage and that day with the van yeah i froze and those werent the only times she waited out the silence as he loaded the wash into the dryer when he sat down again he would not look at her he spoke of all the details to his waking nightmare while the dryer ran round and round she sat beside him holding his hand and listening to the symptoms of his trauma the paralysis of loud noises the suffocation and panic that followed it was a replay of his own death replete with the weight of a psychotic teenager sitting upon his chest making it impossible to breathe worst was the feeling of shame thats what the burnouts do he said they freeze up when guns go off and then some other cop gets shot because they cant he lowered his eyes every day i wake up scared and this is what youve been living with she said every day for all these months johanna knew he was still holding back the worst thing in his mind was still locked away from her but this was a promising beginning and she had come to share mallorys concern for a quick solution else she might lose him they sat there for a quiet hour her hand rested on his knee to anchor him to the solid world of the laundry room his hand covered hers holding on to save himself holding on to his sanity by touch and force of will the laundry in the dryer went round and round the sun went down the elderly lawyer was pressed up against the wall of the lockup he was in fear of his new cellmate a man much smaller than himself mallory sat at a table a few feet away and watched the performance of the perp who shared the lawyers narrow cage another precinct had contributed the central park flasher a bona fide pervert reportedly too shy to talk the sex offender was wearing nothing underneath his overcoat and now he exposed himself to the lawyer according to the rap sheet the mans gender preference ran to heterosexual liaisons but a few dollars had inspired him to blow the old man a wet kiss did you see that he spit on me said the attorney he must like you said mallory though that little gesture would not get the flashers charges dropped and she did not intend to pay any more cash for anything less than skin contact they were folding laundry at the kitchen table when johanna said you look ten years younger mrs ortega said that would happen riker smiled against his will liking this compliment from her he was highly suggestible now the lingering effect of her drugs he took her orders and put his back into the work when they moved on to the gross problem of the tub and the shower stall there he wiped away months of lethargy and sorrow with a sponge the broken window glass had been replaced by a glazier and jo had swept the floor herself so he would not cut his shoeless feet next she planned to teach him how to turn on a vacuum cleaner by days end riker would be tired and ready for a long and natural sleep but she had yet to break down the rest of his walls johanna resorted to a touch of shock therapy your bouts of paralysis are a form of panic disorder he turned to her with a look that said no anything but that sorry she said that sounds like a womans affliction doesnt it ah men bigots every one of then when you hear the bang of a gun youre always waiting for the next bullet and the he was shaking his head not wanting to discuss this anymore well too bad riker last night you opened the door on a dark room you heard all four bullets and you shut down you were dead again thats what your mind told you but the body rebelled it demanded it your lungs filled up and you came back this time your brain was slow to catch up with what the body already knew how much do you remember about last night more head shaking riker did not want to remember he opened the medicine cabinet and carefully examined a bottle of aspirin with an expiration date from the previous decade to toss or not to toss he never noticed that he was standing alone treading softly into the living room johanna went to the closet and pulled the small silver pistol from the pocket of her jacket she had never fired a gun in her life she held it in both hands bracing for the shot as she glanced toward the bathroom riker turned away from the medicine cabinet and now he watched her through the open doorway his jaw had gone slack then he mouthed the word no she squeezed the trigger and the bang stunned her as she felt the recoil of the weapon she would have dropped the gun but riker was beside her and taking it from her hand what the hell are you doing he pushed the heavy couch to one side and inspected the floorboards we got lucky the upholstery stopped the bullet he looked down at the gun in his hand well that figures a peashooter if youd fired my gun you couldve taken out two tenants on two different floors riker you didnt freeze up that time he looked down at the wonder of his body in motion so im cured no im good but i dont do miracles if it was that easy i wouldve dragged you to a firing range the drugs in your system dulled the panic response and i should probably give some credit to the reaper he gave you what youve been waiting for since the day you left the hospital he took the pressure off the pressure that was killing you even without the drugs you mightve bypassed the paralysis this time but a few visits to the firing range could be she could tell that riker was not listening to her anymore his concentration was somewhere else as he stared at the silver gun in his hand you know he said most people think a smallcaliber pistol is next to useless but this little twentytwo of yours is a mafia favorite its an executioners gun the bullet shatters and it stays in the body no messy holes in the walls to mark a crime scene but jo if you want to kill a man with this first you have to tie his hands then you force him to his knees put the gun to the back of his head and squeeze the trigger he glanced at the new hole in his couch that was the first time you ever fired a gun wasnt it now lets say your guy is on the loose and coming at you if you cant place the shot in his head and you cant then you might just piss him off but im betting you wont even get off one round he removed the clip from her pistol then turned his back on her he walked to the closet and placed the clip and the gun in the separate pockets of her jacket and it wasnt the reaper who fired those blanks hes a slasher not a shooter it was the same psycho kid who ambushed me six months ago he gathered up a stack of clean sheets and walked off down the hall to make up his bed but that boy was long dead a worried johanna picked up the telephone and dialed the number on charles butlers business card mallory edged her chair closer to the lockup cage and its two occupants the pervert and the old man she lightly rubbed the back of h hand feigning an itch damn she gave the flasher an angry look i think i picked up one of your fleas the elderly attorney began to squirm and scratch his own hands and face agitated by the power of suggestion he pressed his back to the cage door and put up both arms to ward off the smaller man who slowly extended one hand for the promised skin contact that mallory had bargained for dont let him kiss you on the mouth she said we dont know where hes been and he hasnt been checked for tb yet this was the flashers cue to cough she smiled as the old man slid into shock ah germs she had found his soft spot and she could read the lawyers thoughts no this cant be happening to me this is just a holding cage said mallory i can move you downtown to a bigger lockup if you like youll have more room more people to talk to maybe twenty or so all a lot like him she shot a warning glance at the coughing pervert a reprimand for overacting riker pushed the vacuum cleaner across his bedroom rug drowning out the sound of johannas worried voice she leaned down to the wall socket and pulled out the machines plug if that psychotic was still alive said johanna youd be under police protection right now i am he dropped the vacuum hose and turned on her theres always cops following me around whats the problem jo does that sound a little crazy what about that dead fbi agent did timothy kidd sound crazy too he was paranoid wasnt he did he think he was being followed but there was somebody following him yeah and i know that feeling poor bastard always looking over his shoulder so now i have to wonder how does the reaper get so close to a paranoid fed close enough to slash his throat well maybe i am a miracle worker youre all cop now arent you isnt this how you talk to suspects youre just trying to evade the subject this idea of yours that the shooter how did agent kidd lose his edge jo he knew he was being followed followed by his own people for christs sake heres a guy armed with a gun and his nerves are so shot he hears pins dropping in other rooms how did his killer get close enough according to your own notes he knew that bastard on sight so how does a thing like that happen jo the same way it happened to you twice the flasher was more sympathetic than mallory he was listening with rapt attention as the elderly attorney rambled on about the death of his wife and the long bout of depression that had followed her funeral mallory s fingernails rapped on the table just a hint that he should speed up his story and get to the good part the identity of the young man who owned the red wig and white cane a uniformed officer opened the door and leaned in detective youve got company the chief medical examiner mallory was immediately suspicious for she had done nothing to merit this kind of service dr slope preferred to have cops come to his shop johanna sat on the edge of the bed tired and feeling the need of support though she had not done any of the physical work this day was wearing on her riker however was showing no signs of all the chemicals she had used to finetune his body and his mind he loomed over her arms folded waiting for her to say something to defend herself yes that was the sentiment and she could not understand the change in him ive already told this story so many times she said it was all in my statement for the chicago police and the and now you can tell it to me how did this turnaround come about riker was growing more remote in every passing minute she stared at the floor as she spoke to him it had to do with comfort zones timothy had one place where he felt safe my waiting room was very private and secure patients were buzzed into that room when the sessions were over they left by the back door of my office coming or going they never encountered one another it was timothys habit to come twenty minutes early for appointments he said my waiting room was like a decompression chamber his safety zone i never buzzed anybody into that room after he arrived im guessing the reaper came up behind timothy when he opened the door his throat mustve been slit instantly so thats how it happened in the one place where he wouldnt expect to be assaulted and you riker you never expected anyone to shoot you in your own apartment not the first time not the second time riker would not allow the subject to come back to him not yet he stepped to one side exposing the small surprise he had prepared for her on the bureau it was the packet of letters she had carried in the torn lining of her jacket he must have found them when he had returned the gun and the clip to the pockets and while she had been on the telephone with charles butler riker had been sitting in this room reading all of them he picked up the packet and held it high as a tangible accusation agent kidd was working fulltime on the reaper case eventually yes but not when we met i didnt lie to you and you didnt tell the whole truth either he was looking into the jury murders while the first one still belonged to the chicago police i know it looks that way and you were lovers he said you lied about that i suppose the police mightve thought so if theyd found those letters the day they searched my rooms he touched you timothy he never did he touched you oh i see she had not expected riker to use that sense of the word i suppose he did but bunny touched me too and he wasnt so talented only a schizophrenic timothy kidd loved you he tossed the letters onto the bed beside her and he died because of you no defense wounds thats what you told lieutenant coffey the guy just sat down in a chair and bled out quietly he wouldnt put up a fight because you were in the next room so he was bleeding dying in your reception room and you a damn doctor help was just on the other side of a door i didnt know she said he never made a sound you said his trachea wasnt cut he couldve yelled for help but he never did and you know why if youd walked into that room the reaper wouldve killed you too thats how you knew the freak stuck around to watch his victims die because timothy loved you so much he never made a sound he died for you thats not why i kept his letters she gathered them up from the bedspread and held them in both hands suddenly realizing that she had betrayed their precious value to her he was my friend this is all thats left of him his personality and she should have burned them long ago for she knew every line by heart i didnt encourage timothys feelings for me i thought he was too vulnerable and too crazy he thought his own people were following him and the reaper and even though it was all true he knew you didnt believe him and why should you he was a freaking paranoid but what about me jo do you believe me cops do follow me around jo and why because the psycho who shot me is still out there still alive and sometimes its not cops i know that boys watching me jo do you believe that paranoia would also go with rikers job the halfturned stance to see over his shoulder the bit of business caught in the corner of his eye as he paused to listen for odd noises singling out one from the rest he thought a teenage psychopath was coming to steal his life and this was his fear every day since he had been shot yes she believed him and she cried he sat on the bed close beside her and a different man when at last he spoke again you feel everything dont you jo everybodys pain johanna dropped the letters to the floor and placed one hand on his chest over the worst of his scars the one perilously close to his heart she had seen all the wounds while dressing him it was miraculous that he had survived and she knew what it had cost him to live with his memories of that event and the crushing weight of stress in every moment of his day he gently moved her hand away so his scars could not hurt her anymore when mallory entered the private office jack coffey rose from his desk and quit the room most likely sensing the tension between the two men who remained and guessing that he was best left out of this conversation chief medical examiner edward slope was seated with his back turned on charles butler who slumped against one wall in abject misery mallory only glanced at him posing a question with her eyes no doubt wondering what he had given away charles shook his head to tell her that he had made no admissions but she was not reassured for his unhappy face said so much he could not hide a thought and never attempted to lie which explained why edward slope took all of his money in a weekly poker game mallory folded her arms against the medical examiner demanding whats going on thats what id like to know said the doctor but charles wont confess tell me kathy how is riker these days mallory she said correcting his forbidden use of her first name i havent seen riker lately why are you here charles wants to know if i botched the autopsy on the boy who shot riker i never said anything of the kind charles turned toward mallory helpless now because he was not adept at misleading people that was her forte i bet dr apollo put that idea in your head said mallory am i right shes the one who thinks the autopsy was rigged right said charles not my idea that fits she circled around to the back of the medical examiners chair and leaned down to speak to him her voice dropped into that low range for telling secrets nothing i say goes beyond this room deal knowing you as long as i have im hardly going to promise that you asked about riker she moved behind the desk and sat down hes in a bad way this unpredictable truth telling was truly disarming and she engaged the surprised man in a staring contest if riker had to take the psych evaluation today hed fail it so dont help me rat him out see to it that he never gets his badge back and now assured of the medical examiners allegiance she faced charles dr apollo got this idea from riker didnt she johanna wouldnt say she only asked if there was anything odd about the autopsy report something withheld mallory nodded every time riker walks into a room hes checking every stranger for concealed weapons thats been going on for a long time now im guessing he thinks the shooter is still alive his concentration is split hes looking for the wrong suspect and thats going to get him killed i told him the perp who shot him was dead i told him that six months ago but i guess he didnt believe me hard to imagine why said edward slope perhaps leaning a bit too hard on the sarcasm i dont understand said charles how could riker believe a thing like that didnt the police shoot this boy quite a few times thirty times well we shot somebody she said charless lips parted to speak but mere words would not suffice not just this minute nor could he get them out for his mouth had gone suddenly dry edward slope leaned back in his chair then graced mallory with a rare smile and people say you have no sense of humor chapter the parents identified the wrong body riker paced the bedroom floor working off his anger and they knew it wasnt their kid thats why they never filed a wrongfuldeath suit against the city happens every time a suspect gets shot by the police the relatives always do that but not this time there mustve been blood tests on the body said johanna riker shook his head what for thirty bullet wounds made the cause of death pretty damn clear and the next of kin identified the corpse that satisfied all the requirements for the state so why run the blood tests why fool with a good thing weary now he sat down beside her at the edge of the mattress it all worked out so nicely for everybody nypd looks good for closing a major case in record time the city avoids a megabucks lawsuit for shooting the wrong suspect and that psycho kid goes free im sure the parents loved that part then this is just theory you dont actually theres more i got all the proof i need the parents went to europe after the shooting probably got their kid settled in with a new identity maybe four weeks later they came back to town so i go by their place and talk to the doorman this is around the time i started picking up on the shadows people following me everywhere i went sometimes it was mallory shes easy to spot thinks she can do surveillance she cant but one of them wasnt a cop it was a little freak in a bad wig not your basic undercover outfit he was young and his size was right he turned to jo so still think im sane or am i as crazy as timothy kidd and now it was johanna who needed a change of subject she took his hand interlaced her fingers with his and said tell me your damn first name tell me or ill make you clean the toilet janos found mallory alone in jack coffeys office the old guy wants out he knows the conditions said mallory did the pervert kiss him yet no the lawyer bought the little guy off with a gold watch janos held up a slip of paper but the old guy gave up the name and address for your phony blind man great just great riker was on his knees wearing a damn apron and his head was deep in the toilet though not on some philosophical mission to see where his life had lately gone he was brushing stains that required closeup squinting oh and this was the best part of his big dream into the bathroom walks edward slope the chief medical examiner himself all decked out in a threepiece suit a house call from a body snatcher riker sat back on his heels then slumped against the tiled wall cant you wait till im dead i want you to see something slope opened an envelope and pulled out a batch of photographs one of them wafted to the floor it was the picture of a body on the doctors dissection table thats the wellbred young man who tried to kill you six months ago i did the autopsy myself as you can see hes quite dead it only took the police a few hours to track him down he was shot to pieces before you got out of surgery another photograph joined the one on the floor the corpse was full of holes the face was gone riker remembered this particular picture as the one mallory had liked best she had brought it to his hospital room and held it up like a trophy at the time he had been surprised that she had not brought in the actual body bronzed and nailed to a plaque for her wall he looked up at the medical examiner and smiled with only half his face to let the man know that he was not buying any of this never had never would edward slope hunkered down and papered the floor with the rest of his evidence this psychotic little geek is as dead as roadkill it was a very thorough job nine cops and precisely thirty bullets you were told about this did you think your own people would lie to you and now perhaps recalling that one of these people was mallory he amended this query all of them liars every cop in special crimes unit well thats what cops do said riker every day we lie to suspects goes with the job yeah theyd all lie to me especially after pumping thirty rounds into this poor bastard whoever he is he picked up one of the photographs and tore it in half hes not the kid who shot me dr slope produced papers from his coat pocket these are the lab results i ran all the tests riker you know me i never leave anything to chance you have to believe in fingerprints in blood and dna and theres the gunpowder residue on the boys hand and theres more oh yeah riker removed his hausfraus rubber gloves well heres the kicker doc the proof there were guards posted in my room the whole time i was in the hospital they only do that to protect crime victims from live suspects nobody and i mean nobody else gets twentyfourhour bodyguards not ever but every time i opened my eyes there was a cop watching me and i could always hear more ofem out in the hall riker saw a painful surprise in the doctors eyes edward slope was now the saddest man in new york city not all of your guards were cops the first few days your doctors only allowed medical personnel to see you he reached out to retrieve some of his pictures from the floor sometimes it was me sitting in the intensive care unit that was right after your surgery you werent expected to survive so if you went sour well i thought someone should be there someone you knew on hands and knees he gathered up the rest of the photographs then made a show of neatly stacking them and avoiding rikers eyes later on said slope there were so many drugs pumped into you im not surprised that you cant recall this one of those guards was your father that old man put in a lot of hours taking turns with kathy mallory they were there through all the days when you were swacked on painkillers that only worked half the time and the others patrolmen detectives they came out of the woodwork to sit in your hospital room on their own time willing you to recover after you were on the mend they still came so many of them my fault i got the hospital to rescind visiting hours i wanted someone in your room round the clock the distraction would keep you from reliving the event when you were most vulnerable and dr apollo will back me up on this most trauma victims have an irrational fear of being alone so those cops all turned out for you so youd always know that you werent on your own that you were at the head of a damn parade the whole police force thirty thousand strong those cops your guards they all thought it was important for you to know that but obviously you got the wrong message he stood up preparing to leave then leaned down to place one hand on rikers shoulder believe me now im sorry i never realized rising slowly stiff and awkward add on shamefaced the pathologist turned sharply on his heel and quit the bathroom riker had no sooner recovered from the shock of an emotional edward slope than he wandered into the front room and met another unannounced visitor trouble he should have told johanna to bolt the door against the cops the commander of special crimes unit was definitely not here on any sentimental errand not a wellwisher or a cheerleader not a happy man jack coffey was holding a thick bundle of papers this could only be mallorys form to appeal the separation from nypd yes he could see that now as the lieutenant held up the paperwork within four inches of his senior detectives face saying dont fuck with me riker just sign it and sign it he did jack coffey departed without another word said and riker closed the door behind him gently no slamming so youre a cop again jo sat on the couch by the dim light of a single lamp her body sunk deep in the cushions she seemed tired and pleased when he sat down beside her she rested her head on his shoulder and they passed a little time this way in companionable silence peace perfect peace that was jos present to him he wished he had something to give to her and perhaps it was natural to be thinking of flowers though she deserved something more exotic than the bloom he had settled upon my old man was tough said riker it took years to get him to talk but he finally gave up the whole story my mother was dying the night i was born or thats what dad thought she was only nineteen and he wasnt much older they were dirt poor in those days they had nothing well mom wanted to leave me something something just grand thats the way my dad put it so she made him promise to he glanced at jos upturned face and smiled it helps if you know she was really drugged up that night lots of heavy medication so mom was stoned when she made him promise to put pimpernel on my birth certificate my god she named you after a flower yeah cruel isnt it but it couldve been worse the scarlet pimpernel was moms alltime favorite movie but crazy as she was that night she knew she couldnt name me scarlet pimpernel everybody wouldve called me scarlet right and that was a girl from gone with the wind wrong sex and a whole different movie so she settled for pimpernel but you cant raise a little boy with a name like that not in brooklyn my old man argued with her for hours even though he thought she was dying finally the poor bastard caved in when she cried one damn tear thats all it took to break him and he swore hed name me pimpernel and then your father saved you by only putting the initial on the birth certificate yeah sometimes i forget how much i owe him for that well mom didnt die not for another fifty years when she got home from the hospital her brain was good as new almost she agreed with dad it wouldve been a rotten thing to do to a kid growing up in a rough neighborhood but she wouldnt let him change the initial on my birth certificate now my old man won the second round when the next baby came along they named him ned nothing fancy just plain old ned a pimpernel said jo i dont think id recognize that flower i would he still had the lieutenants pen in his hand but now that all the clutter was gone there was no scrap of paper within easy reach half the house was wallpapered in damn pimpernels my bedroom too now that was child abuse he took her right hand in his i still have dreams about that wallpaper riker drew a little flower on her open palm its small not much to look at id rather give you roses he loved her smile the door was kicked open breaking the chain before victor could bolt it again he was crying when they entered his apartment victor patchock asked a large man with a thugs face and an incongruously soft voice he nodded believing that he was about to die when the pair advanced on him he reached out to the umbrella stand and plucked out a white cane he waved it high and wide this was the last stand of a righteous man whose eyes were scrunched shut all he could hear was the swish of his cane slicing the air and hitting nothing he dared to open his eyes again the large man seemed astonished and the tall blonde at his side was also taken by surprise she had a gun in her hand but the barrel was pointed toward the floor tilting her head to one side she seemed genuinely curious when she asked how stupid are you earlier upon opening his front door charles butler had been pleased to see the chief medical examiner standing in the hall for this was an opportunity to smooth out the ragged edges of their friendship edward slope had announced that he was making the second house call of his career what an honor charless mood was more somber now that he had come to understand the true purpose of the doctors visit he placed a drink in his guests hand then joined him at the kitchen table and continued his perusal of the crimescene photographs the corpse depicted here was no longer recognizable as a seventeenyearold boy i see most of the shots are to the head edward slope nodded that wouldve been enough to make riker suspicious his eyes were less focused now that he was feeling the anesthetic benefit of twelveyearold singlemalt whiskey but he was not finding sufficient solace in his glass you probably noticed the shots to the torso seem almost like an afterthought yes i agree it appeared that the detectives of special crimes unit had thought it unseemly to blow the boys face away and so they had added more shots to the torso for the sake of decency dr slope set down his empty glass and pushed it away theyre not trained to make head shots you know cops usually aim for the widest part of the body less chance of bullets going wild and their targets frequently survive no chance of that here said charles he examined the last photograph then quickly scanned the postmortem report but it was selfdefense the newspapers all if thats what it said in the newspapers then it must be true the pathologist covered his tired eyes sorry that was unfair the boy fired on them first one shot before they killed him i was on the scene when the techs dug his bullet out of the wall it was a justified shooting no question no question ah but the doctors face was saying something entirely different charles pulled the x rays from the envelope of autopsy materials these pictures of naked bone told him so much more than the boys blownaway flesh could reveal and he would undoubtedly have to fetch edward slope a new whiskey bottle before the evening ended all these bullets charles turned to his friend i imagine you found it impossible to determine which one killed the boy thats what it said in my report the doctor emptied the bottle into his glass then quickly drained it none of the police bullets went wild that was the truly odd part a shootout is a terrifying experience for cops fear gets in the way of their aim but not on this occasion and now fortified by alcohol he found that he could look at the photographs one more time as he replaced each one in the envelope what a mess all those bullets all on target charles held the x ray up to the light fascinated and horrified among the massive damage of shattered facial bones was the one remarkably symmetrical hole in the boys skull it lay between the orbits of the eyes not one hair off center symmetry thy name is mallory she might as well have signed her work other later holes and grooves at the top and sides of the skull told the rest of the story he envisioned the other detectives firing shots at a falling target a dead one to obliterate the evidence of mallorys remarkably cold and steady aim until the final effect appeared less like an execution i suppose its better for all of the detectives said charles if none of them knows which shot was fatal the doctors sudden relief betrayed him obviously he was assuming that the omissions in his report were less transparent than he had supposed edward slope could not fail to believe that his secret was safe his proof of this was sitting right there on the other side of the kitchen table charles butlers face showed no signs of a tellall blush he had learned how to lie riker stepped out of the shower as a new man and donned his best suit the one least stained when he walked into the living room he found mrs ortega surveying the newandimproved state of his apartment he lightly kicked her rolling cart of supplies get this thing out of here okay its ruining the damn ambiance she ignored this turning her back on him to inspect the rug and run one finger over the surfaces of tables and chairs checking for dust so this is what youve been doing all day yeah not bad huh amateurs the both of you ill take it from here just stay out of my way the intrepid cleaning woman marched toward the tall windows that bore the streaks of his own attempted washing i love you too said riker but he said it low almost a whisper so she would not feel obligated to insult him in return wheres jo gone she said she had to go feed some cat mrs ortega spat out this last word with great contempt in her philosophy the only good furshedder was a dead one riker stood before his desk staring down at the small drawer where he kept his weapon it had been opened though the key was still hidden in a crack behind one wooden leg and the gun was gone he wasted no time on this little mystery the perp who had broken his bathroom window would not have known how to finesse this excellent lock and there was no sign of forcing the wood mallory was the only thief who had recently visited his apartment and she traveled everywhere with lock picks in her pocket so the brat had not trusted him with his own gun regulations required him to report a missing weapon but that would only create more trouble for both of them and now he wondered if he should demand its return or should he wait for mallory to break into his apartment and put the revolver back in the drawer yeah that would be the polite solution all but the cats head was swaddled in a white cloth binding so that he could not win this fight to stay alive the veterinarians hand hesitated with the needle all the pity in the doctors eyes was for the woman and not the animal you know its the best thing for him johanna but not for your reasons you dont have to yes i do she held mugs gingerly minding the phantom nerve that so agonized him now please the needle was injected into mugss neck and minutes passed before it had any effect his personality was still intact when he met her eyes looking there for mercy and asking why she cradled him until he was lulled into a drowsy stupor by her slow rocking motion and the sedative at last he was well beyond pain in real or imagined realms she wanted to believe that he was not beyond love that he could luxuriate in the feeling of her arms about him now that it did not hurt him anymore not in his body or his mind she kissed him then held him close until he went limp though the poison would come later this was not like sleep this was goodbye hes at peace johanna said the doctor hell never feel the next one the second shot would wrack the cats body with a violent seizure a prelude to death its for the best i know that she said but a long time passed before she would cease her rocking and open her arms to release mugs chapter johanna apollo had taken the long way home from the law firm on madison avenue the zigzag journey had led her from evening into dead of night as she revisited the favorite streets of her adopted city she was hungry and cold and she needed her meds to ease the pains of the day one of her watchdogs awaited her in the hotel lobby the young fbi mans face was washed with relief that she was still alive and his job was secure now he backed away from her maintaining the discreet distance of a court order she felt guilty though she had never consented to this bodyguard service no matter how the night might end this young man and his partner would have some explaining to do come the morning too bad not their fault they must wonder how she always managed to evade them when she should be so easy to follow in any crowd of normal upright people during the brief elevator ride she consulted her wristwatch twice less than an hour to go it was a short walk from the elevator to the door of her room but the hallway elongated in a side effect of weariness she had a pill for that but nothing to cure the dread of this homecoming the awaiting quiet and the sense of no one home anymore no mugs she put her mind to other things arrangements still to be made preparations for the night ahead she entered the hotel room and flicked on the wall switch everything was as she had left it mugss pillow still held the impression of his small body and the object inside remained hidden the suite was perfectly quiet for the first time since she had moved in and yet she knew that she was not alone the bedroom door was wide open it had been closed when she left and the hotel maids did no cleaning in the evening hours every detail of the room beyond the door was lost in the dark and this moment would have held less terror if she had seen the sudden flash of a knife she might have welcomed that instead she heard the cat cry out the dead cat mallory slowly emerged from the darkness cradling mugss limp body in her arms the cat lifted his head a bare inch softly mewling so enfeebled by heavy sedation you followed me to the animal hospital and i saw you run out of there crying said mallory took me six seconds to work it out so you intercepted the second shot the deadly one the detective walked into the front room and sat down in an armchair the cat reduced to a rag of fur was now casually draped over her crossed legs mugs lifted his head once more and his halfclosed eyes struggled to focus on the one he loved johanna mallorys slow smile was disturbing you think the cat knows you tried to kill him her long red fingernails absently grazed mugss fur youre very good at ditching your fbi bodyguards dr apollo that has to stop i think we understand each other oh yes johanna understood terrorism small scale and large mind games were her stockintrade mallory would have done well to remember that and how much does riker understand she was mentally squaring off against the young police does he know how you manipulated him calculated his every move nearly cost him his sanity does he understand any of the damage youve done suppose hed died that night in the parking garage so you were there mallorys composure was eerie she had missed the implication of some fault within herself or dismissed it her voice was a cold monotone when she said riker always knew what i was doing but it didnt matter to him he played the game for your sake not mine not his the silence was filled with awe and wonder for mallory had successfully transferred the blame for all that had gone before and whatever might happen before this night was done she had neatly shifted past and future blood onto other hands johannas the psychiatrist out of her depth sank down on the couch and merely watched helpless to do otherwise as the younger woman the ruthless one reached behind the chair and pulled out the plastic pet carrier mugs was placed inside with only slightly more care than might be given to a stuffed toy however johanna made no protest for the box would hold no fears for mugs while he was sedated putting the cat to sleep said the detective that fits with the last meeting of your little therapy group in tribeca you bugged that room there could be no other explanation for she had given that news to the group this evening mallory ignored the accusation as her eyes roved over the furnishings this hotel room so temporary such an easy loose end to tie up i know your type dr apollo if you were going to kill yourself youd be one of those nice polite people who slit their wrists in the bathtub so they wont leave a mess behind but youd never have the guts to do it you cant even kill a cat ive seen your drug cabinet youve got enough stuff right here to put down a hundred cats but you had to pay someone else to do it to him so i know youre not planning suicide you just cant count on living through the night mallory picked up the carrier and walked to the door well i cant force you into protective custody where are you taking my cat the detective silently stepped into the outer hallway heading for the elevator and johanna followed saying pleading you wont like mugs when hes fully awake mallory stood before the elevator one red fingernail on the call button when she turned her head with the slow swivel of a machine and that disturbing smile was back are you afraid i wont be nice to the cat johanna hurried to board the elevator as the doors opened and the detective stepped inside with her living cargo stirring faintly crying inside the box why are you doing this to me nothing personal said mallory the last two jurors have to survive its my game now my rules im the law she watched digital numbers changing numerals descending as they sank through all the floors of the hotel riker thinks the feds are using you for bait he hasnt put it all together yet he cant hes too close to you oh i found the gun johanna was so unsettled that she nearly asked which gun she looked down at the small silver twentytwo in mallorys hand it was a ladys pistol purse size and that description alone would explain the look of derision on the detectives face the doors slid open and the two women crossed the lobby in tandem johanna was pulled along by invisible strings lured by the pet carrier in the detectives tight grip mallory paused at the cluster of armchairs by the window then nodded to the fbi agent standing on the far side of the room she turned on johanna saying commanding sit down and johanna obediently sank into a chair stay here said mallory where that fed can see you stay until i come back for you and then ill give you the cat the surprise visitors just kept on coming but at least charles butler had brought a sixpack of imported beer riker had no theories on what mallory might be up to she had yet to divulge anything about the night she had followed the fake blind man from the cop bar on green street damn mallory speak of the devil and she will come when he responded to the next knock at his door mallory stood in the hallway holding jos pet carrier with all the familiar scratch marks he could see the cats fur behind the wire opening but mugs was not in his usual bloodcurdling voice tonight riker bent low to open the small door suddenly concerned that mallory might have killed the poor critter hey mugs buddy no claws no hissing or threats of any kind well this was a bad sign he withdrew the small limp body and checked it for bullet holes riker looked up at mallory but before he could ask what was wrong with the cat she said i didnt do it charles butler entered the room from the kitchen with two cold bottles of beer in hand ah the famous mugs whats wrong with him and now he also turned to mallory she was definitely on the defensive when she said dr apollos vet drugged him riker smiled at charles you dont want to be around when this cat wakes up hell take an arm off you he stroked the cats head enjoying the novelty of getting this close to the animal who maimed him on the day they first met you like that cat mallorys tone of voice said that this could not be a good thing not a normal thing you could say i admire his style riker folded the animal into his arms mugs lifted his head saw a familiar face and closed his eyes again so whats the deal just keep him here for a while she looked around the room appraising the gleaming surfaces of furniture the windowpanes were so clean that the glass had virtually disappeared this was the trademark of a little cleaning woman from brooklyn put him in the bathroom if mrs ortega spots one cat hair youll never see her again mallory walked toward the door saying ill be back ive got a litter box out in the car she had one hand on the doorknob but charless larger hand pressed flat against the wood to delay her he glanced back at the cat when he said still taking hostages i see mallory glared at him angry and biting down on her lower lip until sympathy pains forced him to step aside johanna doubled over as if the pain were sudden and not something that had been building for hours predictably one of her bodyguards came on the run defying the court order to keep his distance my meds said johanna theyre upstairs in my room all right dr apollo hold on the agent pulled out his cell phone ill get my partner hes watching the rear exit no need to bother him she said i can walk she rose from the couch perhaps if youd help me she took his arm as they moved toward the elevator and rode up to her floor without exchanging another word until they entered her hotel suite i have to take the pills on a full stomach she said but i cant wait for room service it takes too long theres a restaurant across the street ill just get a warmer coat if you dont mind waiting a minute later she emerged from her bedroom wearing a hooded black poncho over her down jacket while crossing the street with her escort following at the usual unobtrusive distance she had a change of plans and led him instead to the subway it was a simple matter to separate from him hiding herself behind a staircase but only for a few moments time enough to hand off the poncho to an old woman bent with age a fixture in this place the elderly vagrant accepted the customary twentydollar bill johanna boarded a train and watched from a window as the agent spotted the blackhooded figure and followed the old beggar to the lower level and a southbound train johanna traveled north unmolested the feds are watching her right now said mallory they wont screw up again she carried the litter box into the bathroom where riker was making a nest of towels for the cat he was wondering what charles had meant by hostages so keeping the cat here that was jos idea yes with that single word trailing off to a hiss she managed to upbraid him for doubting her and when that failed to work she added the cats sedative should wear off in another hour and the doctor needs a good nights sleep unspoken were the words and thats the truth there was a distinct ring of truth in there somewhere though he was still planning to call jos hotel but not just this minute he could see that mallory had something else in mind she shifted into attack posture hands on hips confrontation time i know dr apollo was at the parking garage the night zachary was ambushed you lied to me about that mallory dont get me started on the subject of lies did you know the doctor had a gun a little twentytwo she read his face and smiled you did know you held out on me she hunkered down beside him her voice was almost taunting and you never asked her what she was doing at the garage that night did you hands braced on the floor as if set to spring mallory leaned over the body of the sleeping helpless cat saying ive got a fake blind man in custody she pulled back you know the one i mean and hes another little detail you forgot to mention riker was staring at the bathroom tiles wondering how she had managed that turnaround when she was the one who had time for the interview mallory rose to her feet and left the bathroom he could hear her voice drifting down the hall coming riker or dont you want to know what happened in that jury room johanna was admitted to a studio with the configuration of a large dark cave ian zachary stood beside a tall japanese folding screen that partially hid a console of light and dials he waved her to a chair good to see you again doctor its been a long time since the trial i cant talk you into waiting another hour its now or never she said if you wish he raised one hand to the young woman in the lighted window and spoke into the microphone of his headset crazy bitch rack it up he turned back to his guest i cant change your mind no i have other plans for later she watched his eyes travel back and forth between herself and a square pane of glass a dark twin to the brightly lit window of the sound engineers booth if this had been a police station in chicago there would be a watcher behind that glass when ian zachary sat down at his console the japanese screen cut off his view of the dark window but the sound engineers booth was still visible to him and the girl held up one finger to indicate one more minute to go though it was the middle finger interesting so doctor what name are we using tonight johanna apollo or the alias my own name and now she was also captivated by the dark window for the screen did not cut off her own line of sight it only hid ian zachary from a watcher who might or might not be there she tried to gauge his level of paranoia a key element for every player in the game chapter the squad room of special crimes unit was ghosty and quiet tonight all the action would be in the back rooms used for interviews and lockup by the dim lights burning at vacant desks riker could count three detectives working late and another light burned in lieutenant coffeys office mallory switched on rikers own lamp then stood to one side so that he could see how ruthlessly she had taken advantage of his absence the old desk gleamed like a brandnew one gone were the familiar landmarks of grimy smudges fossilized coffee spills and the scorch marks of abandoned cigarettes riker was also suspicious of the chair and its unrecognizable upholstery but when he flopped down on the cushion he was happy to discover that it still conformed to the shape of his rear end though it reeked of the chemicals used to restore the leather raising his eyes to mallorys he picked up the threads of their interrupted conversation more like a confession i thought i was being followed around by cops he swiveled his chair to face the window and looked down on the dark soho street everywhere i went i could swear i saw a cop behind me nuts huh no said mallory that was real some of them were zacharys rentacops but the rest were from internal affairs ia was on my tail slowly his chair spun round to face her what the hell for they got an anonymous tip mallory examined her perfectly manicured fingernails as if one of them might be flawed or chipped as if his desk could sprout wings and fly some citizen told them you were doing a lot of heavy lifting for a cop on full disability they followed you for months with cameras they wanted something incriminating on video nobody told them you never cashed the citys checks but you knew didnt you mrs ortega could have supplied her with that information but long before the cleaning womans discovery of the checks mallory had known that he was not opening his mail her invasion of his private life was tabled for he had a larger issue with her just now so it was an anonymous tip something in his voice oh perhaps the heavy sarcasm gave away his disbelief and he could see that old look in her eye she was getting ready for the grand denial and this told him that his own partner had turned him in to internal affairs it fitted so well with her stealing his gun tonight mallory had not trusted him to stay alive and so she had sicced the ia watchdogs on him cops to keep an eye on him when she could not be there in his alternate theory she had used the internal affairs fumble to embarrass the commissioner just a dab of blackmail to grease the forms for rikers appeal it had taken less than the usual ninety days for his reinstatement it had taken one hour and now it occurred to him that his partner had also diddled a computer to send out those bogus disability checks for he had never asked for any assistance from the city of new york he lit a cigarette and waited for her to lie her way out of this and he waited unpredictable brat she sat on the edge of his desk legs dangling in the old familiar manner of kathy the child and though a clock hung on every wall she pulled out her pocket watch and pretended interest in the hour it was lou markowitzs gold watch handed down through four generations of police mallory was reminding him that she was markowitzs daughter the only child of his oldest friend this was such a clumsy tactic for she had little understanding of sentiment or sympathy she had none of her own offense was her best game her crippled idea of defense only saddened him he had no more heart for this thus wounded he pocketed all his questions and accusations an hour would pass before he realized that mallorys inept ploy had been a roaring success that she had expertly distracted him by creeping up on his sentimental blind side and slaying him with sympathy we should get moving she slid off the desk and turned her back on him heading toward the hallway she said your friend agent hennessey is waiting in the interview room i picked him for the token fed good job as riker rose from his desk and followed her down the narrow hall he was only beginning to appreciate mallorys longrange planning her best scheme had begun with agent hennessey following a doppelganger while ian zachary was ambushed in the parking garage the next piece of fbi incompetence macphersons murder had only sweetened her deal in exchange for files on the reaper and a clear field for nypd all federal foulups would be overlooked during press conferences and new york agents would share the spotlight at endgame hence the token fed riker knew that lou markowitz would have approved of his foster childs work she was manipulating the system even better than her old man lou in his prime had outwitted the fbi but never actually extorted them the partners talked as they walked and now he learned that the fake blind man was undergoing a psychiatric evaluation at bellevue hospital at the insistence of a lawyer the public defender would not believe that his client could competently waive the right to representation and while they awaited the return of victor patchock another interview subject was being held in the lockup cage this one was an elderly attorney named horace fairlamb so you busted a lawyer said riker thats my girl they entered the larger of the two interview rooms the formal one with the long table and a oneway glass for covert observation riker shook hands with agent hennessey then suffered a bear hug from janos the detective had just heard the news of rikers reinstatement and greeted him like a returning prisoner of war while janos made the introductions to horace fairlamb retired attorney at law only riker was positioned to see his partner pirating paperwork from cartons piled at one end of the table each box bore the stamp of the fbi thick documents and manila folders from the reaper file were now disappearing underneath mallorys blazer suspicious brat riker had no doubt that hennessey would honor the deal of full disclosure but mallory trusted no one and now she excused herself from the room after stealing all that she could covertly carry the men took their seats at the table law enforcement on one side and horace fairlamb on the other the old man was asked to repeat his story what he had told of it so far detective janos showing the wear of this babysitting detail pleaded with the elderly lawyer to stick with the pertinent facts then rolled his eyes as fairlamb insisted on beginning his story at the beginning and so they all listened to the drawnout details of a beloved wifes death culminating with the funeral that was the day i gave my new york law practice to my son the old man had then traveled to chicago to live with his daughter and grandchildren and now three men with grim smiles admired his wallet photographs as they were passed around the table but after a few days said horace fairlamb i could see that it wasnt working out i spent most of that time staring at the walls and crying quite a burden for my family so one day i left my daughters house checked into a hotel and stepped out on a ledge janos raised his head interest renewed evidently he had not heard this part before a jumper a wouldbe jumper the attorney corrected him one of the hotel residents was a psychiatrist and that was the day i met dr apollo riker leaned forward so she always lived in hotels even in chicago as long as ive known her three years anyway i became her patient she treated me for depression part of my therapy was studying for the state bar exam at my age imagine if you will but i passed the exam well i was back at work and somewhat useful again then one day i had a breakthrough in therapy i finally admitted to myself that i had never cared for the practice of law he sighed half a century wasted in utter boredom and probate is about as boring as you can so thats when you took on the little freak with the red wig riker was not quite so patient as detective janos then life got interesting right and this was his euphemism for speed it up old man or ill shoot you the lawyer was mildly surprised i never had an attorneyclient relationship with victor patchock is that what you thought oh my word no i performed other services for victor things of a covert nature i arranged for his move from chicago to new york him and another fellow macpherson i never knew the other mans real name he was even more distrustful than victor so i got them both credentials with fake names credit cards passports and the like lodging them in new york was simple enough since i own several buildings here then there were the disguises and running around as a decoy in the middle of the night oh i must say it was miles more fun than lawyering then i procured firearms for them and thats not as easy as you might think you cant just walk into a gun store you know there are forms to fill out serial numbers that can be traced so there was no legal way to proceed i went through a dozen bartenders before i found wait riker had a sixth sense for lawyerly fiddles and this attorney had already confessed to several crimes janos you read him his rights detective janos held up the signed miranda card that listed every constitutional perk including the fact that anything said could be used against the old man in court mr fairlambs representing himself he did his own plea bargain with the das office indeed said horace fairlamb i have complete immunity in exchange for cooperation so there wont be any charges for procuring firearms document fraud or obstruction of justice oh and all those other charges bribery littering and such all gone now i want to make it perfectly clear that getting weapons for victor and his friend well that was not johannas idea in fact she was horrified when i told her somewhat after the fact im afraid all heads turned in the direction of an irritating rapping noise it came from the other side of the oneway mirror that concealed a viewing room riker stared at the glass whos in the box tonight thats an assistant da janos stared at the mirror then raised his voice for the benefit of the man behind the glass hes reminding me that hes a busy little prick with big plans for the evening i suppose he thinks were wasting his time riker banged one fist on the table and the annoying rap abruptly ceased horace fairlamb put a cigar in his mouth cuban of course and riker would bet that contraband was also included in the deal with the district attorney damn every lawyer ever born agent hennessey leaned across the table to light the old mans cigar saying so lets get on with the good stuff all right yeah said riker lets start with the murder trial what happened in that jury room why did they all vote not guilty i have no idea said horace fairlamb i never discussed that with my associates janoss head snapped back as if the lawyer had stunned him with a baseball bat between the eyes hey we had a deal old man oh yes the deal the old man exhaled a cloud of smoke as i recall the terms i agreed to tell you everything i knew about the ian zachary jury so now ive told you all i know and if i may anticipate your next question i have no idea who the reaper is weary janos laid his head on the table and agent hennessey slumped in his chair muttering weve all been scammed well not all of them not mallory and now riker understood why his partner had not bothered to sit in on this interview this worthless crumb she had thrown to the fbi behind the lighted glass sat young crazy bitch eyes glistening feverbright the girl gave the impression of a cat on tenterhooks forever trapped in a conflict of fight or flight johanna apollo stared at the other window on this studio the dark one and this unsettled ian zachary she smiled paranoia my old friend it had been childishly simple to suss out the englishmans weakness she looked down at the carpet and noted the impressions left by the consoles former position he had turned his desk sideways so that he would not have to face the booth window when he worked his telephones his levers and dials however that had not ended his discomfort his next solution had been the japanese folding screen beside his chair it sheltered him from the windows view making it easier to lose the idea of a watcher behind that dark glass crazy bitch must be a mind reader of sorts for she caught the doctors eye and made a thumbsup gesture johanna was uncertain about the words this girl was mouthing but she thought the context might have been go for his balls noting johannas interest zachary stared at the japanese screen as if he could see through it to the dark window on the other side thats needlemans booth my producer did you see something not yet he lost his charming smile for a moment but then he rallied turning to the lighted window and his assistant who instantly ceased to clap her hands crazy bitch you screwed up the voice level again the girl behind the glass extended one finger from a closed fist an obscene gesture to tell him how much his criticism meant to her he flicked a lever then leaned far back in his chair i could run the whole show from this console but my assistant has a certain entertainment value you may have noticed shes insane eccentric perhaps said johanna she had found the younger womans survival instinct was still intact always a good indication for hope but yes crazy bitch was definitely in trouble johannas sudden smile was directed at the producers booth and this had a telling effect on zachary once more he turned to face the screen blocking his view of the dark glass so dr apollo do you know needleman though no sound escaped the lighted booth crazy bitch was laughing hysterically and nodding with wildly exaggerated bobs of her head everyone knows needleman said johanna riker had invited the fbi man to the second interview of the night the one that might actually break the case they entered a small room with a lockup cage and no mirrors no witnesses mallory was clearly surprised and unhappy to see hennessey not liking this change of plans her plans the fake blind man had finally been returned from bellevue and his public defender had just finished reading the psychiatric evaluation slapping it on the table in disgust though the courtappointed lawyer was still not satisfied that his client was competent to waive legal counsel and he said so for the record he now left the strange little man in police custody and quit the room with a secretive smile so happy to finally end his long workday and happier still to be rid of this lunatic victor patchock sat with his arms folded his white cane had been taken away from him but he stubbornly insisted on wearing his wig and dark glasses and neither would he remove his overcoat in case i have to leave in a hurry youre not going anywhere for a long time mallory snatched the dark glasses away patchock raised his hands anticipating a blow to the face and the overcoat fell open to expose drops of blood on his shirtfront a surprised agent hennessey stared at these bloodstains riker and janos turned in unison to stare at mallory before she could utter her trademark line i didnt do it the little man quickly closed up his coat saying i have nosebleeds when im under stress now that mallory had been cleared of mistreating her prisoner she reached toward the little man once more one white hand five sharp red nails flashed out to touch the nylon strands of the red wig and to make the little man flinch why the costume victor that was dr apollos idea said victor patchock she told me no one would look for me under a neon sign if you take my meaning before she bought me the wig i couldnt bring myself to leave my room so she was treating you the little man nodded getting out of my room was a big part of my therapy you know taking back my life so i spent my time following other players around macpherson johanna and and ian zachary mallory touched his arm making him jump a bit thats how you knew hed be in the parking garage the other night yes it took me a while to figure out that his limo was picking up an impersonator after i caught on i followed him to that garage lots of times victor patchock smiled at riker but it was not a happy smile more on the sly side i followed you around too all those nights you went out drinking with dr apollo after work you never saw me did you no you only had eyes for the doctor he wagged one finger at the detective i would kill for that woman just you remember that you bastard now he turned his suspicious eyes on mallory victor riker slapped the table to regain the little mans attention what happened in that jury room why did you all vote not guilty andy said the man in the red wig it was his doing andy sumpter agent hennessey was startled the juror the first one to die said victor patchock johanna apollo continued to glance at the dark window from time to time this had the desired effect of rattling ian zachary but never for more than a few seconds now he relaxed into a selfsatisfied smile you have a lot of explaining to do doctor i know she said it would be easier to understand if we start with the voir dire the jury selection your lawyers dragged out the process there was lots of time to get full background checks on everyone in the jury pool stacking the jury isnt a crime doctor its a science oh i agree said johanna it only seemed insane at the time your lawyers didnt care about biases all the physically small people the frail ones with the most retiring personalities they were never challenged by your defense team and then there was me the hunchback the cripple so vulnerable andy sumpter was the lone exception a man with the emotional maturity of a child and the body of a weight lifter the prosecutor loved him didnt he andy came off as such a lawandorder freak im sure you coached him every step of the way now that would be a crime zacharys smile was unaffected by this accusation lets stay with the facts for now dr apollo we can talk about your unsupported theories later on andy slept through most of your trial thats a fact but when we retired to the jury room for deliberations he was suddenly wide awake the first round of ballots were for a guilty verdict except for andys the judge wouldnt accept a hung jury day after day he kept sending us back to that little room to work it out and every day more votes swung over to andys side the first two crossover votes were easy those people just wanted to go home but the rest stood firm even while andy sat there glaring at them one by one and punching his fist into his hand over and over victor patchock was off to the mens room escorted by detective janos in addition to nosebleeds he had announced that frayed nerves also affected his bladder the moment the door closed agent hennessey discovered that he was mallorys new interview subject she stood beside his chair preferring the advantage of looking down at him jury tampering she said the feds were investigating before the first juror died thats what brought timothy kidd to chicago after the trial he wasnt working the reaper murders unspoken were the words you liar but that cant be right said riker answering for the stunned fbi agent wrong department timothy kidd was a profiler murder cases mallory shook her head kidd was never a profiler he was a gardenvariety field agent just like hennessey here and he was also a flaming nutcase shes right and shes wrong said hennessey speaking only to rikers friendlier face a year ago agent kidd had a nervous breakdown he was pulled from fieldwork and transferred to an office job all he did was shuffle papers and make out reports on obscure complaints so one day dr apollos charge of jury tampering lands on his desk no one else took it seriously a hung jury mightve gotten some attention but you cant buy a whole jury can you the verdict was unanimous and her claim was unsupported he glanced up at mallory to say you were wrong about the tampering charge then quickly looked away not even willing to meet rikers eyes anymore there was no federal case before the first juror died but dr apollo papered every agency local state and federal riker nodded and crazy timothy kidd was the only one who believed her thats right said hennessey so agent kidd went to chicago for a followup interview and that was on his own initiative he was never assigned to any criminal cases a few days later the reaper slaughtered the first juror there was a message on the crimescene wall written in the victims own blood one down and eleven to go thats what it said we never got that detail until the second juror died then the chicago bureau stepped in and placed the rest of the jury in a protection program agent kidd was using sick days commuting between dc and chicago so he did investigate the reaper murders but he did it on his own time argus didnt know that said riker he thought kidd was in town to check up on his work their conversation ended when the door opened detective janos and his charge had returned from the mens room victor patchock sat down adjusted his wig and continued his story of the jury deliberations well andy comes up to me one night when were all eating dinner in a restaurant with the bailiff on my way to the toilet he boxes me into a corner and whispers number four ellery drive thats where i live used to live but we never had any paperwork on you said hennessey why didnt you support dr apollos complaint i was the one who went to the judge said johanna apollo but the other jurors wouldnt back me up no corroborating complaints the judge asked if i might be hysterical all the pressure of a televised murder trial he loved the whole circus actually used makeup in court and he didnt want a mistrial so the judge sent me back in there with all those frightened people and andy sumpter said zachary so you were afraid im not immune to intimidation she said andy was angry with me and he let me know it he glared at me for hours he was so quiet except for the sound of his fist punching into his hand and every punch was for me obviously andy knew about the complaint and that wouldve been your work but i had no contact with the jurors said zachary can you can prove otherwise no i didnt think so well maybe the judge was right are you prone to hysterics doctor actually youre the one who seems on edge tonight she turned her chair to face the dark booth and this had the predictable effect of jumping up the mans anxiety im going public with my story because and here she paused to borrow a phrase from mallory i cant count on living through the night riker was slowly shaking his head from side to side okay victor let me get this straight jo went to the judge to save all your sorry hides and none of you backed her up no said victor patchock not then andy was a crazy bastard we had to deal with him eight hours a day what happened after the verdict asked riker did anybody else come forward to back up her complaint no when andy got killed i never thought anything of it im sure no one else did either he was the type youd expect to get his throat slit i never heard anything about a note written in blood nobody told us a killer was threatening the rest of the jury not then agent hennessey looked up from his perusal of the bureaus reaper file that call was made by the chicago police while they still had jurisdiction the cops had a real short list of people who wanted andy sumpter dead they figured the crime was staged to look like a psycho killing to draw attention away from his loan shark so andy needed cash said mallory who loved money motives best andy was your most insanely loyal fan said johanna but im sure he had other incentives he wouldnt settle for a hung jury did you tell him the verdict had to be unanimous more accusations once again youre all alone dr apollo no support for your story and lets not lose sight of the fact that you also voted not guilty would you like to explain that because right now you look like the prime suspect for jury tampering swaying an entire jury well that would be childs play for a psychiatrist andy was just an overgrown brain tumor a good description so you did get to know him zachary sighed i cant see that moron convincing an entire jury he terrified them and you told him how to do that he wasnt smart enough to work it out on his own he was so close to blowing his temper and hurting those people but he didnt and that was your doing wasnt it dr apollo and yours was the only complaint thats interesting too if the other two women hadnt died i think they might have come forward it wouldve been easier for a woman to admit what happened in that room you make it sound like a rape the assault took place in the jury bathroom said johanna but you already knew that you planned it it was like a rape said victor patchock you lose your manhood the first time he makes you back down none of the men in that room would admit that andy had them cowed the votes changed with every ballot one or two a day till he had them all hennessey looked up from his notebook pen hovering but you say andy never touched anyone well yeah he did it was macpherson poor mac he went into the bathroom it had two stalls so nobody thought it was odd when andy followed him in there but then andy slid under macs stall door oh mac he was scared shitless speechless never called out for help i always wondered how andy knew he wouldnt scream like a woman practice said riker who could see where this story was going hed probably done it before victor patchock lowered his head then andy jammed this stinking dirty snot rag in macphersons mouth he spun the poor guy around and spread his legs so mac had to lean both hands on the wall to keep from falling and that poor bastard still didnt know what was coming not till he heard the sound of andys zipper coming down the little man squeezed his eyes shut outside in the jury room there wasnt much to hear grunts andy laughing and thumps when his rear end hit the stall door victor patchock beat his closed fist on the table over and over saying thump thump thump in the rhythm of a rape so andy comes back to the jury room with this big sloppy grin on his stupid face macpherson was in the bathroom another twenty minutes when he finally came out he wouldnt look anybody in the eye just stared at the floor he was shaking all over dying inside trying so hard not to cry but then he did cry real quiet just tears there was blood on the seat of his pants everybody knew what happened to him in there nobody ever used the bathroom again except andy macpherson changed his vote andy sumpter wasnt gay said ian zachary this man was paying child support on three children the rape wasnt about sex said johanna ah the feminist party line i know this cliche rape isnt about sex its about power is that the way you see it dr apollo no said johanna i thought it was probably about money or did you promise to make andy famous oh the things your fans will do just for a few minutes on the radio maybe andy was your bitch dr apollo you were always in control of that room thats one thing the jurors agreed on when they talked to the media they took their cues from you i did my best to keep andy from spinning out of control he always wanted to use his fists and it was a fight to keep him from hitting those people so in hindsight he probably wasnt your best choice for intimidating that jury always a second away from exploding and this is what comes of amateurs like you dabbling in psychology but you claim this noneck moron thwarted the entire justice system stupid andy swayed the whole jury andy came from the cave said johanna but youre right about one thing it was my fault now i wish id just let him explode in that jury room a room full of witnesses he mightve hurt one of them badly maybe a few broken bones but you never wouldve walked away from that trial as a free man and without that unanimous verdict without your vote doctor the reaper wouldve had no motive to kill the jurors all those people would still be alive when the other jurors were dying dr apollo kept us alive me and macpherson said victor patchock she paid for everything and she kept us from falling apart but then something happened said mallory prompting him something changed i found out who the reaper was that damn lawyer fairlamb ratted me out to dr apollo she was waiting for me in that underground parking garage she took my gun away but she was too late to stop macpherson he turned to riker saying i waited outside on the street and then i followed you guys to that bar on green street and theres poor mac a prisoner jammed in that booth between you and zachary who is the reaper asked agent hennessey he is said patchock pointing to riker he followed mac to the garage that night later on when i was leaving the bar riker was still waiting for mac to come back from the mens room arrest him riker glanced at mallory she was not the least bit annoyed with the little man for wasting her time and he knew why or so he thought but then she surprised him mallory put one hand on victor patchocks shoulder nails embedding in the material just a gentle reminder that she was in control of him and her voice was a monotone when she said i know youre holding back big mistake victor dont fool with me i have to go to the toilet again when the door had closed upon the little man and his warden hennessey turned from one cop to the other did you guys believe any of that the rape happened said riker i believed that much no way said the agent dr apollo never mentioned an assault in her complaint of course not said riker who wouldve believed her you didnt there were ten people on the other side of that bathroom door and a bailiff out in the hall how could andy sumpter be stupid enough to risk it the plan is so stupid its damn smart it did happen said mallory andy needed cash and some people will do anything for money she turned to riker but victor did lie i heard the noise in the bathroom said johanna the other jurors had gone selectively deaf so i went to the door to get the bailiff the hall was empty thats when i realized that youd bought him off he was the one who carried your instructions to andy sumpter you not only arranged the rape but you timed it with the bailiff you wanted him gone while that assault was going on johanna addressed all her words to the dark window even the girl in the lighted booth was a believer now turning that way as if peering through the solid walls that separated her booth from the producers excuse me doctor zachary rose from the console walked around the japanese screen and jammed a small camera up to the glass illuminating the booth with a bright flash no one there he returned to his chair behaving as if that had been a perfectly normal thing to do go on dr apollo you were giving me credit for suborning the entire jury she studied his more relaxed face he was enjoying himself again what a pity but she could fix that you wont get away with jury tampering and you wont be a media star anymore lets talk about your crimes dr apollo after the trial i sent you roses every day for a month im sure you know why i never doubted that the verdict was your work by your own account you kept andy sumpter from beating up those people you more than anyone else helped to sway that entire jury oh and one other thing you voted not guilty id say you earned your roses doctor you wont get away with it he smiled and threw up his hands bring on the police lets have another trial no wait what was i thinking you have no proof you misunderstood she said i was alluding to all the people who want you dead those jurors you and your fans hunted down they had husbands and wives parents and children lots of wounded survivors this is your new trial right here right now if im believed then youre a dead man just one moment dr apollo if i understand you correctly youre openly soliciting my murder on the radio johannas eyes turned back to the dark window of the producers booth and she sucked in a breath startled by the image on the other side of the glass what malicious creativity she would never have anticipated anything on this level of sophistication fascinating zachary lunged for the japanese screen knocking it down with his fist so that he could see the producers booth a sheet had been draped across the window glass and two holes had been slashed in the fabric two dark eyes slanting upward and though there was no third hole to indicate a mouth johanna would later remember a complete face with an evil smile upon the return of victor patchock it was finally established to the little mans satisfaction that an fbi agent not riker had been the last one to see macpherson alive and then hennessey left the room to respond to a cellphone call in private without missing a beat between words mallory picked up the rhythm of the interview lets talk about the parking garage what were the two of you planning that night macpherson and me were going to scare the living shit out of zachary so your gun had blanks too no i was gonna shoot the bastard for real real bullets i wanted to hurt him so bad him and all his moron fans i hate him more than the reaper you wanted revenge said mallory that much is true but you told us a few lies victor i warned you about that you said dr apollo was the last one to change her vote he lowered his eyes as he nodded reaffirming his statement youre lying to me she said and such a stupid little lie mallory held up an old newspaper clipping this is an interview with one of the jurors according to this the last holdout on that jury was a man so it wasnt dr apollo and im damn sure it wasnt you if you lie to me one more time her words trailed off and she let his imagination do the work of frightening him it was mac said victor patchock he was the last one to change his vote and hes not the one who got raped in the bathroom said riker that was you no it wasnt me youre lying said riker that night in the parking garage macpherson only wanted to scare zachary payment in kind he wanted zachary to know what it felt like to be scared but you wanted a different kind of payback you brought real bullets andy sumpter was dead killed by the reaper no satisfaction there so you went after ian zachary said mallory your rapist by proxy i warned you not to hold out on me one more time riker leaned toward the little man did you plan to shoot the bastards balls off you think you couldve made a shot like that while you were hiding in the dark victor patchocks head rolled back and he stared at the overhead lights his nose had begun to bleed and he wiped it with one hand smearing blood across his face i was the first one to change my vote to not guilty not that i was scared that wasnt it i just wanted to go home so i dont know why andy did that to me why i already voted his way he used his coat sleeve to wipe the blood from his hand im a little man i know that dr apollo kept voting guilty it was just her and macpherson but after i came out of the bathroom andy demanded another ballot he stood next to my chair one hand squeezing my shoulder not hard more like i was his girlfriend or something and he was staring at dr apollo everyone else except maybe mac was looking the other way if you know what i mean so you were andys hostage said riker thats why jo voted not guilty he knew where i lived said victor suppose id pressed charges who wouldve believed me nobody backed up dr apollo what chance did i have the stupid ones were clueless and the smart ones would never go up against andy except for jo and macpherson said riker you couldve okay all right but what then im a little man and you damn cops you cant keep criminals in jail for six minutes andy wouldve been back on the street in an hour you know he wouldve raped you again so the lady changed her vote for you said riker jo would have internalized all of victor patchocks fear and pain then sought to end it dr apollo voted not guilty said victor when she caved in mac did too he couldnt make a stand without her he just couldnt do it alone riker lowered his eyes there was guilt enough to spread around this table in equal shares tonight he had his own regrets on macphersons account and took on a share of the blame for that death a good man was gone and this coward this selfdescribed little man had survived victor patchock was about to become famous the news media would make him a symbol for the american justice system proof that it was still alive and well or was it crazy bitch could only stare at the blinking phoneboard lights too afraid to pick up any of the calls it might be a curious fan or maybe an angry station manager the relentless digital clock on her console was counting down the seconds not a moments peace hardly time to draw a breath she dumped her purse out on her desk and rummaged through the mess hunting for a way to keep the entire world at bay and she found it in a paper bag with a hardware store logo she was saved she laughed and laughed while tears streamed down her face tears brought on by a joy so exquisite that it was almost unbearable the mike was dead and her voice could not be heard outside this room she clenched her fists then filled her lungs and screamed to no one im gonna be famous hennessey had not yet returned when mallory decided to reconvene the interrogation in the larger interview room the one that allowed covert observation from behind the mirror on the wall riker guessed that this was for the benefit of the assistant district attorney if that man was still waiting behind the glass he would see mallory end a brief interview with a willing statement from victor patchock absent any duress she pushed a pad of yellow paper in victors direction and the little man began to write down all the details wrung out of him in the smaller room his face was free of tears now and the evidence of his last nosebleed had been wiped away write it all down she turned to the oneway glass saying its a wrap lets go collect the doctor on the other side of the mirror jack coffeys voice was slightly sardonic as he spoke into the intercom the boys from chicago lost dr apollo again no way mallory stood up and faced the mirror and her boss who stood behind it all those idiots had to do was its not a problem agent hennessey stood in the doorway he was smiling as he folded his cell phone into the breast pocket of his suit jacket my guys found her shes a guest on the ian zachary show weve got men at the radio station right now as soon as the show is over well make the arrest for jury tampering betrayal riker leaned his tired head upon one hand the moment mallory turned on the fbi agent he decided to let her rip the mans head off hennessey did not know her well enough to be forewarned as she walked toward him her words carefully measured when did all of this go down my bureau chiefs been monitoring the show for twenty minutes he says the lady makes a good case so zacharys going away for jury tampering and he wont be feeding the reaper any more helpful information hennessey patted victor patchock on the back and now weve got your corroboration for dr apollos complaint he turned to smile at mallory as if that would help him the doctor and mr patchock go back into protective custody whether they like it or not theyre material witnesses now he turned away from mallory a huge mistake to see jack coffey enter the room riker thought the boss was curiously calm so thanks for all your help lieutenant said the agent but well take it from here mallory was silently coming up behind hennesseys back when riker had second thoughts about the impending violence he grabbed her by the shoulders as her nails call them claws were on the rise then whispered in her ear let coffey go off on the bastard trust me on this one his tipoff was the lieutenants composure jack coffey was actually smiling when he pulled up a chair at the table hennessey heres a little something your boss probably didnt mention it happened three minutes ago somebody called for a disturbance at the radio station and six patrol cops responded the fbi agents tried to stop them from going up to ian zacharys floor well the uniforms dont take orders from feds the lieutenant propped his feet up on the table and the fbi agent stiffened his own posture bracing for more bad news sorry hennessey it seems one of your guys is losing a little blood but the good news our guy didnt break his damn jaw its just a split lip a few stitches hell be fine and that disturbance call coffey shrugged turned out to be a false alarm normally riker would have suspected mallory of making that bogus call but she had an alibi for the time frame evidently the lieutenant was picking up her bad habits jack coffey turned to detective janos those uniforms belong to the midtown precinct keep an open line to their sergeant they have orders to hold that floor make sure thats all they do i dont want anybody rattled till were ready to make an arrest and last but with the greatest satisfaction he turned back to the fbi man saying well take it from here you have no jurisdiction on a jury tampering charge said agent hennessey oh thats all changed said coffey we have a few charges of our own he glanced at mallory you didnt tell him about that yet sorry i ruined your fun hennessey would have left the room with his document cartons following in jack coffeys wake but riker was now blocking the door not so fast pal you made a deal with mallory youre going to keep it he looked down at the boxes of reaper files or maybe youd rather leave all that stuff here over the next thirty minutes dr apollos voice was heard on radios all over new york city and the portable set in the interview room riker turned down the volume as he faced the oneway mirror whats taking so long on that arrest warrant jack coffeys voice came over the intercom saying were shopping for a judge who isnt afraid of the aclu shouldnt be much longer the contents of the reaper file were spread across the long table and agent hennessey could only watch this invasion of his paperwork his fingers lightly drummed the table to advertise a bad case of arrogance withdrawal the fbi mans detainment had not been formalized though a strong suggestion was made by the massive bulk of detective janos leaning against the only door mallory owned the agent now and she was in the early stages of toying with her food after scanning the contents of an fbi folder she looked up from her reading so dr apollo was always on the shortlist for the jury murders she crumpled a sheet of paper and hennessey watched fascinated as the wad rolled between her palms compacting into a perfect ball the size of a marble thats destruction of government its bogus she said and you knew it when you padded out the reaper file now i want the good stuff the personal notes that never made it into your database how many screwups were purged from the computer hennessey hesitated too long her paper marble shot past his right ear and bounced off the wall behind him if i have to find those mistakes by myself she said then i add them to the rest of the mess your people made of this case i might hold a press conference all the major networks national publicity all of it bad and those were the magic words hennessey retrieved the wadded paper from the floor this sheet isnt total crap when agent kidd was murdered dr apollo was our prime suspect for a copycat killing she had her own history with psychiatric treatment longterm therapy as a child and a teenager maybe our man said the wrong thing and she snapped it happens or maybe he was the one who snapped and the doctor killed him in selfdefense but we know the reaper didnt murder timothy kidd youre wrong said riker and thats one more screwup for the feds he looked up at his partner mallory are you keeping score agent hennessey might be on the defensive but he was showing no signs of backing down from this theory the fbi man was adamant when he said timothy kidds murder didnt have the elements of a reaper killing except for the penknife and that detail was in the newspapers there was no scythe drawn in blood nothing written on the wall of the doctors reception room there was no note stuffed in his mouth and even the cut to the throat was different less damage and not as deep but then that homeless man was killed with a penknife said mallory the same sloppy cut as the one that killed timothy kidd right said the agent we figure the doctor killed bunny too argus misread the whole thing he thought bunnys death meant that the reaper was keeping tabs on dr apollo mallory seemed genuinely offended for the agent was putting no earnest effort into any of these lies you knew they were both reaper victims bunny and the fed argus was tailing her long before that he was using her as a lure for the reaper and then he did the same thing to macpherson hanging him out as bait argus wasnt on the reaper investigation said hennessey his only job was coordinating juror protection and he screwed that up no one was authorized to use the jurors as bait the agents in behavioral sciences were making a case for the profilers mallory nodded not a decent psych credential between them if it hadnt been for their interference the case wouldve been closed by now you never asked the right question the one that begins every cops investigation who benefits its not that kind of crime said hennessey sure it is she said you messed up because you were all trying to think like psychiatrists dr apollo was the only one thinking like a cop jack coffeys voice came over the intercom weve got the warrant lets move people hennessey was rising perhaps believing that he was invited to go along a uniformed officer entered the room and set a formidable power tool on the table before riker big enough for you thatll do me thanks whats the drill for asked hennessey riker plugged it into a wall socket to test it ian zacharys studio has a worldclass security door three inches of metal and an electronic lock cant force it cant pick it he switched on the drill for the full effect of a squadron of dentists from hell then cut the power so we go right through the lock lets do this the smart way said hennessey sincerely deluded in the idea that he might have some influence in this room we wait till the shows over well let the doctor play it out maybe collect more evidence that way recorded evidence bad idea said riker shes locked in that room with a stone killer he turned to the oneway mirror ready when you are boss the reaper cant be ian zachary said hennessey the man has an unbreakable alibi for timothy kidds murder agents were parked right outside his door round the clock yeah right said mallory he could never get past one of your guys it was rare and wonderful to hear mallorys laugh even if it was slightly evil and riker smiled as he followed the sound of her laughter through the door hennessey was right behind them when he met up with the immovable obstacle of detective janos mallorys tan sedan took a corner and took his breath away the car hung on two wheels for exactly four of rikers heartbeats tonight she had grudgingly used the siren and the portable turret light thus giving civilian motorists fair warning before she climbed up their tails and scared them out of their minds it was a great plan she said almost flawless riker hefted the weight of the drill in one hand you know hell be out on the street an hour after we book him he watched the cityscape flying past the passenger window of mallorys tan rocket i promise you well nail zachary she said but it was a good plan the feds were always looking for some sick twitchy lawandorder freak hiding in a dark room but there he was hiding right out in the open and well never make a case against him hell never do any time for murder well nail him cold you mean in the act right with jo for bait that was the doctors plan said mallory riker turned up the radio and jos voice saying did i do the right thing no and i regret my errors every day all those mallory reached out and turned down the volume what do you think shes doing shes calling him out hes rattled enough to go after her right now but he wont first hell want to set up an alibi maybe hell try to use the feds to the car stopped short of the curb slinging rikers body forward as his partner ripped open his suit jacket to expose the empty shoulder holster why arent you wearing your gun she dug her nails into his arm your gun riker where is it and only now did he realize that mallory for all her crimes was not the concerned thief who had made off with his weapon so you didnt pick the lock on my desk drawer well yeah i did but i didnt take your revolver his eyes closed as he recalled his lecture on the stopping power of a smaller caliber firearm than his own aw jo it had to be her shes got my damn gun he handed mallory the drill shes planning to shoot that bastard and she wants to do a proper job of it you go ill wait here and cover the entrance mallory had not expected that not from him her hand froze on the doors handle and her eyes narrowed so suspicious unable to come up with any logical scenario where he would volunteer to remain behind gun or no gun mallory did not trust him anymore yet she opened the door she had no choice but to leave him here upstairs in that building there was a gun in play and she was the only cop who knew about it time was precious bullets traveled so fast she broke off this conversation of the eyes and ran for the door when she had disappeared into the radio station he slid into the drivers seat and put her car in gear as he nosed it out into the street he turned up the volume on the radio confirming his suspicions words chopped off at the end of one segment were now repeated in the next and this was the mark of an amateur at the switch he watched the radio station recede in his rearview mirror at best he could only count on ten minutes of lead time it would not take long for mallory to discover that she had been scammed he headed the car toward the chelsea hotel then glanced at the clock on the dashboard as he listened to jos prerecorded voice taunting a serial killer calling him out for a showdown there was no other way to read her intentions calling for backup was not an option neither feds nor local cops would approve of rikers plans for their material witness johanna apollo he intended to grab that woman to rip his stolen revolver from her hands then run with jo to mexico no baggage just her very life was all he wanted all he needed but first he must have his gun back so that no one would ever make it past him to get to her not even mallory chapter the outnumbered fbi agents had been contained on the floor below and lieutenant coffey stood outside the door to ian zacharys studio he had lost his satisfied smile according to mallory there was a lethal weapon in play and the game plan had radically changed the narrow corridor was crowded with police and yet the only sound was the tap of mallorys foot special crimes unit had never used the lower ranks for cannon fodder and so they waited for a uniformed officer to fetch two bulletproof vests one for the lieutenant and one for his detective with a wave of his hand jack coffey motioned the remaining uniforms to move back down the hall the metal studio door was thick enough to offer protection from acaliber bullet but the surrounding wall might not prescient mallory had known that this arrest would not go down nicely she had brought her own drill to the party and she handled it like a gun in her other hand was a wiring diagram of the electronic door lock coffey stared at the power tool youre sure you cant electrocute yourself with that thing no electricity she said the lock has its own circuit breaker her voice was testy she obviously resented having to play this out by the book and respond to silly questions the body armor should have been here by now maybe we shouldnt bore out the studio lock ian zacharys door could only be opened from an interior control panel the doors to the booths had locks made to open with keys but they had both been fused shut with a glue that had hardened to the temperance of steel the studio door was mallorys own preference for the first strike the lieutenant was not yet convinced zachary might not hear the drill if we go through one of these side doors theyve both got windows on the studio and the glass is four inches thick unbreakable mallory looked up from her reading to glance at the ruined lock on one of the flanking doors you know why those locks are glued shut one of them doesnt want any witnesses probably dr apollo we cant wait for the body armor lieutenant a uniformed officer was monitoring zacharys show on a pocket radio as he walked toward them he removed his earpiece and turned up the volume on the noise of violent breakage it sounds like hes taking the place apart without waiting on orders mallory put the drill to the lock knowing that the sound would alert the people inside jack coffey stayed her hand before she could power up the tool and give them away cover me he said ill drill the lock its my drill she held it tightly in both hands the lieutenant could only stare at her what a hell of a time for this silly kid stunt however it was her drill her case her show all the way jack coffey removed his hand from the tool stepping back he drew his gun demoting himself to mallorys backup then waved the uniforms farther down the hall okay mallory nowl he had not expected so much noise the loud squeal of metal grinding on metal made all his nerve endings stand at attention zachary and dr apollo would know they were coming but which of them would be holding the gun when the door opened he trained his own gun on the door ready to kill whoever pointed a weapon at mallory she was halfway through the lock and a death might be only seconds away his detective looked up from her work saying well never make a case if you shoot my corroborating witness mallory later you can remind me to fire your ass he turned to the sound of footfalls pounding down the hall at his back two uniformed officers came on the run instead of the requested flak jackets they carried two large bulletproof shields johanna apollo was startled to hear her own voice on the radio she had not expected zachary to play that interview tape on the air how could she have guessed wrong about that if he thought he was impervious to an investigation he might not come tonight or was he already here she turned off the radio and held her breath standing very still in the dead quiet of the front room had she actually heard a noise in the hall or had she intuited a presence out there sensed it in the fashion of mugs or timothy kidd tonight there would be no buffer of fbi agents downstairs in the hotel lobby the federal bodyguards were looking for her elsewhere no interruptions no witnesses gun in hand johanna settled into an armchair and braced her elbows on the upholstery the recoil of rikers revolver would be stronger than victors smaller gun and she would not risk it falling from her trembling hands for one bullet might not do the job after turning off the table lamp all that illuminated the hotel room she could see the shadows of two shoes in a crack of yellow light below the door the narrow foyers walls seemed like an extension of the guns barrel a knock how polite and unexpected johanna called out its not locked the door opened slowly and this was something she should have anticipated she could see that now her error ian zachary would pride himself on theatrics his dark silhouette filled the door frame backlit by the lamps in the hall she had rehearsed this moment inside her head so many times it had always begun with immediate violence a body barreling through the door rushing in with a view to unbalancing her with cold paralyzing terror that had been timothy kidds imagined recreation of the juror murders but that was not to be not here and now and what else might she get wrong before this night was over the room suddenly flooded with light from the ceiling fixture her eyes were still adapting to the brightness when she saw his hand on the wall switch and heard him say i should come inside his voice was in the range of seduction and this was another surprise if you shoot me in the hall he said the police might not buy the idea of selfdefense during her training days as a crimescene cleaner riker had told her that hesitation should be listed as the cause of death for most homicide victims educable johanna raised the gun she must kill ian zachary now he closed the door behind him and locked it the gun was so heavy there thats better he said now you have privacy for a murder and a better story for the police zachary strolled toward her smiling all but laughing at the gun in her hands only sparing it one glance he stopped a few paces from her chair then raised his arms to show her the spread of his empty hands i dont have a weapon but heres a thought maybe you could plant one on my dead body he lowered his arms you might have time to run to the store some allnight bodega where the clerk wont remember a distraught hunchback buying a penknife the gun barrel wavered her finger touched lightly on the trigger and he became an easier target as he closed the gap between them she fancied timothy inside her head screaming to the rhythm of a banging heart kill him kill him kill him her script for this event was already in shambles it should not have surprised her so when zachary leaned down and simply plucked the gun from her shaking hands saying not quite the scenario you had in mind too civilized for a coldblooded killing you dont know what youre missing dr apollo he pressed the gun to her forehead an inch above her eyes what a rush better than sex she looked down at her hands limp useless things and waited for the shot riker sailed through another red light avoiding collisions by the grace of providence for his eyes kept wandering to the rearview mirror expecting mallory to climb up his taillights at any moment she would have discovered by now that jos interview was on tape and it would only take her six seconds to steal another car a fire engine beat him into the intersection stringing its long body across the entire width of the street he slammed on the brakes but not before he had done some damage to the other vehicle and crumpled a fender of mallorys car he reversed gears and backed up by ten feet as an angry fireman climbed down from the drivers seat and walked toward him now the driver was joined by other men dropping down to the pavement like combat troops parachuting in for a battle they were all moving in tandem and the strategy was clear they were planning to surround riker and take a little satisfaction out of his hide slow torture by paperwork and forms filled out in triplicate flashing his badge would not save him and he could not spare the time to do even that much taking a tip from the mallory school of bad driving riker aimed the car at the walking wall of firemen brave bastards they waited until the last possible moment to jump aside and now the small tan sedan was running round the long red truck using all of the sidewalk to do it and civilians were diving into the street move or die that was the message mallory would have been proud if i wanted you dead said ian zachary i could have killed you months ago you were the easiest one to keep track of he ran the gun barrel lightly along the deformity of her spine such a distinctive profile tell you what lets do a trade your life for victor patchocks he reached out to a small table picked up the telephone and carried it to her chair call him over here youll kill us both no no no zachary wore a condescending smile as he knelt down before her the last juror standing takes all the blame i thought you understood that doctor thats why people keep dying in your vicinity first timothy kidd then poor bunny when the police find victor bleeding all over your rug i think theyll have enough to close out the case and no witness to back up the charge of jury tampering johanna nodded her understanding one of the surviving jurors must die tonight but if im supposed to be the reaper if i die you have no show left you do understand he rewarded her with his widest smile then patted her hand good girl yes ideally there would be another trial yours a long drawnout affair youre wealthy dr apollo you can hire the best legal team in the country i promise youll never do a day in prison for all those murders youll buy your way out with legal talent its the american way and then we start over right a fresh jury and next time all twelve of them die and then another trial do you get all your plans from comic books ah she had disappointed him this was not the response he had expected but she knew he would not kill her not yet first he must make her into a believer a fan of sorts she was all the audience that he would ever have he wanted applause he set the telephone in her lap you see i do have an interest in keeping you alive so you know ill keep my word he pressed the receiver into her hand call victor patchock you have a famous face she said how many people spotted you downstairs in the lobby how many of them saw you get on the elevator oh i dont need an alibi tonight this time ill be the one who discovers the reapers next victim he held up her old business card and flipped it over to show her a personal note recognize your own handwriting i took this off the corpse of agent kidd the wording is ambiguous no names or dates just a reminder that the appointments been changed from ten to eleven oclock ill say you invited me over lured me here with the prospect of interviewing victor but then what a shock you killed him right before my eyes he looked down at his watch its close to eleven oclock i dont know where victor is and this was true she had been unable to reach him tonight what a pity he pulled a small silver penknife from his pocket and opened the blade the honed metal edge gleamed bright you can split hairs with this thing razor sharp zachary smiled in mock chagrin oh i lied about not having a weapon removing the telephone from her lap he set it on the floor fine dont call victor ill just have to make do with you he rose to his feet and backed away from her more fun this way make me chase you around a bit up you go with a lifting gesture of the small knife he urged her to rise how fast can a hunchback run crazy bitch sat behind ian zacharys console leaning into a stationary microphone and saying theyre coming boys and girls she had cut off the pretaped interview to give the fans a momentbymoment account of an unknown invader drilling out the lock on the studio door is it the cops is it the reaper stay tuned she laughed too loud creating an electronic feedback squeal that drowned out the sound of the drill hysteria was toned down to mere giggles yeah like youre gonna turn me off before that door opens oh here they come there was an unintentional moment of high drama in the silence that followed the door swung open and crazy bitch had lost her voice unable to adequately describe the scene before her eyes when tall mallory strode into the room wielding a wickedlooking drill and carrying the shield of a medieval knight the blonde was moving forward with grim resolve could this woman be any more pissed off crazy bitch thought not ian zachary could not yet bear to part with his audience or this was johannas thought as she watched the small blade dip and rise to punctuate his words you have no alibi for any of the jury murders he said i was very careful about that curse of the grotesque poor baby you spent all your evenings alone and then there was timothy kidd murdered in your reception room now bunnys crime scene was a piece of luck i was counting on the neighbors to lead the police back to you i never expected you to be there when they found the body zachary turned away from her thinking so little of her ability to fight back after plumping up the couch pillows he sat down and stretched out his legs on the coffee table standing trial for murder isnt the worst that could a knock on the door was followed by rikers voice yelling jo its me open up i know youve got my gun zachary vaguely amused pulled the revolver from his pocket this is his you stole a cops gun he inclined his head in the manner of a complimentary bow youre an interesting woman dr apollo he waved the revolver in the direction of the door let him in johanna smiled and he didnt like that youre afraid of riker she said youre the one with the gun but youd never open that door yourself you dont want to get that close to him the knocking was constant now and louder you were hoping hed just get tired and go away zachary crooked one finger around the base of a ceramic table lamp i think this might get his attention the lamp toppled to the floor smashing to pieces rikers knocking escalated to the bang of a closed fist and he yelled jo zachary took aim at the door i can drop him from here if you like let him in or ill shoot him right now its a big gun said johanna powerful she stood up and moved between the door and the couch blocking his aim behind her back she could hear the savage kicks to the wood but the dead bolt lock was holding you could get both of us with one bullet if youre lucky but you wont risk a shot through a closed door not you the pathological planner what if you miss riker what happens to all that careful scheming improvisation is not your forte its a moot point doctor look at what hes doing to that door she turned to see the wood splintering on one side of the lock the frame was cracking yielding and there was only time to open the bottom drawer of the armoire before the door banged inward and riker crashed into the room he had one instant to register the weapon in the other mans hand and then johanna made a mighty swing to bring the wine bottle across the back of his skull riker dropped like a stone crazy bitch played the tape for a commercial break during the policeenforced interlude her eyes were trained on mallory who was evidently not zacks own private cop one of the uniformed officers carried the drill into the hall and knelt down before the lock on the producers door inside the studio the two police in street clothes stood before the booths window admiring the sheet spread across it far from the effect of a cartoon ghost the black slashes that stood for eyes were eerie the thick glass was scratched but intact and the remnants of a broken chair lay on the floor below detective mallory walked toward the console intractable as a slow train wreck in the making she wanted an explanation right now zack did it said crazy bitch so easily prompted by a vision of mallorys footprint on her face he left before the show started she affected a deep frown as she turned to the producers booth at least i think zacks gone was she overdoing this yes she must be for the blonde had one hand on her hip and in the other hand the drill was slowly swinging like a pendulum ive been playing pretaped interviews you cant have dead airtime i could lose my job for that so how do you like the show so far the drill crashed to the floor the blond police braced both hands on the top of the console leaning forward to communicate that crazy bitch should not to try her patience for one more minute lieutenant coffey interceded calling out hey kid what happened here im pretty sure zack wanted to kill needleman the producer coffey turned to face the draped window is he in there now who knows well needlemans door is always locked said crazy bitch so zack tried to break through bulletproof glass and that was really nuts he even knows the glass is unbreakable but there he is red in the face banging that chair against the window then he racked up a few hours of old canned interviews and ran out the door but i really liked the tape he made tonight so after he left i changed the shut up said detective mallory the lieutenant was more polite but just barely when zachary left was he carrying a weapon no not that i could see but i wouldnt take chances if i were you i mean look at what he did to that chair she stared at the sheet covering the producers window zack might be in there if you kill him can i still finish the show ian zachary stood over the inanimate body of riker well that solves the immediate problem is he dead im a doctor johanna knelt on the floor checking life signs and finding them strong i know how to place my shots the blow had split the skin of rikers scalp and his blood was on her right hand zachary leaned into the hallway i love this town all these people behind their closed doors they dont want to get involved ah new yorkers they probably didnt hear anything the walls are very thick just like rikers place i know what you did to him and that was a mistake he had no idea you were the reaper oh the blanks yes i suppose it was a pointless plan but great fun he actually fainted johanna shook her head he scared you didnt he riker caught you by surprise that night but youd never go up against him with a knife so you picked up the first weapon that came to hand macs gun macs bullets no that wasnt planning zachary that was just another mistake she looked up at him only a glance to gauge the fall of his confidence then her eyes were cast down as she stared at her hand at rikers blood you can still walk away from this she said my fingerprints are on the bottle that hit him he saw me point the gun at him thats not a problem side effect of concussion it can wipe out ten or twenty minutes of memory and riker only saw you for a second but what if he did remember so what he knows im the one who stole his gun you can say you took it away from me that you saved him from the reaper me dont you see you dont need one more dead body to make the case just pick up the phone and call the storys more believable if youre the one who makes that call youre good doctor and youre right your little plan might work but that would still leave the loose end of victor patchock he wont make a credible witness in court zachary was no longer listening to her his smiling eyes were lit with some new inspiration you have a much more interesting choice now he pointed the gun at riker i can kill him or you can get victor patchock over here pick one he waved the gun from side to side who lives who dies up to you ill think about it said johanna as if rikers life meant very little to her she rose from the floor the bottle still gripped in one hand first im going to wash up and then im going to pour myself a drink she turned toward the bathroom fighting down the impulse to look back at riker and see which way the gun was pointing now dr apollo hold it ill tell you where you can go and when then shoot me she turned around to face him no you cant do that can you a gun thats not the reapers style she took one step toward him and raised the bottle as a reminder that she had just brought down a bigger man a better one now how do you like your chances with that tiny knife like i said zachary youre no good at improvising and theres another flaw in your plan that business card with my personal invitation that note is in my secretarys handwriting she lied i havent seen that woman since timothy died do you want the police to find that card in your pocket no i didnt think so while youre burning that little piece of evidence ill be washing up bottle gripped tight in her right hand she left him standing there and closed the bathroom door behind her no i said zack might be inside crazy bitch stared at the recently opened door of the producers booth he really wanted to get in there but youre the one who glued the locks shut said mallory yeah just in case he was in there well hes crazy isnt he and you didnt want anybody to know that you were running the show tonight mallory inspected the interior then pointed to the sheet spread across the window is that your work how could it be the producers door is always locked but you had a key didnt you crazy bitch gave her a wobbly smile as she backed up to the door of the studio the commercial break is over i have to get back to my show its my show now just a minute jack coffey appeared behind her blocking her backward exit where can we find this guy needleman probably home in bed its a school night mallory loomed over the shorter woman willing her to make sense with a glare that promised unspeakable violence if sense was not immediately forthcoming crazy bitch hurried to explain that needleman was the station managers nephew hes only fourteen years old a payroll scam said mallory so the station manager pockets the extra paycheck you didnt hear that from me okay tell me how you know said coffey well the station manager goes home at six so it was my job to unlock the producers booth after zack left for the night a couple of real producers use it for the morning shows i was told it was a joke just a way to get back at the bastard and drive him nuts and that was fine with me but i didnt believe it if that was true why not just give the other producers keys of their own lieutenant coffey seemed smug as he turned on mallory saying good reasoning i might give this kid your job crazy bitch sensed a note of payback in his voice as he rested one hand on her shoulder saying go on kid tell us how you cracked the payroll scam i screwed the hundredyearold bookkeeper he gets a cut from the producers paycheck and he told me mallory missed the moment of the lieutenants disappointment her head was turned listening to the whispers of a policewoman and now she ran down the hall lieutenant coffey turned to the officer what did you say to her i gave her a message from detective janos said the police officer her car was stolen some firemen got the license plate number after the car hit their truck they saw the thief driving south johanna stood before the sink looking down at the pimpernel riker had drawn on the palm of her hand she washed away his flower and his blood after leaving the bathroom she walked into the kitchen pulled down a wineglass from a rack on the wall then rummaged in a drawer the noise attracted zachary he was at her side when she pulled out the corkscrew the muzzle of the gun was pressed to the back of her head yet her voice was perfectly calm sorry she said looks dangerous doesnt it she held up the twisty metal and made a show of inspecting it so sharp johanna walked past him pretending that the gun did not exist she sat down in an armchair and plunged the tip of the screw into the cork of the wine bottle your plan is falling apart she twisted the corkscrew by a full turn driving it deeper wondering how many other mistakes you made and now she noticed her crimescene bag open on the floor by the couch zachary pulled on one of her disposable gloves then picked up a rag and proceeded to clean rikers revolver tell me what you think of my new plan my improvisation first i shoot you in the head you see i can be flexible then i put the gun in your dead hand and shoot poor riker in the heart he held up his gloved hand when the police arrive yours are the only fingerprints on the weapon a clear case of murder and suicide that works so nicely with all your guilt for those dead jurors youre making this too complicated she said twisting the screw deeper more mistakes she pulled out the cork i washed rikers blood off the bottle i hope you dont mind me tampering with your evidence he made a long reach across the cocktail table and ripped the bottle from her grasp no problem theres still a bloodstain on the label i think thats enough to point the way for the police how dumb can they be incidentally you have excellent taste in wine the last time i saw this vintage was the night timothy saw you in the liquor store thats when you thought hed pegged you as the reaper and thats why you killed him she gave him a benign smile you cant fob that off as just another detail in your great plan you killed him because you panicked one more murder might be dicey youve botched so many things he leveled the gun at her face are you sure you want to piss me off not my intention just a symptom of something called the stockholm syndrome he nodded hostages bonding with their kidnappers i dont see the theres more to it the hostages actually work with the kidnappers you see its in their best interests to help the kidnapper get the result he wants so the victim can survive thats why im going to help you fix your errors like the one with the business card no youre stalling for time waiting for reinforcements do you actually believe that riker would tell another cop hed lost his gun to a woman absurd no one is coming to your rescue time to make a decision dr apollo he walked to the kitchen and pulled another goblet from the rack on the wall on his way back to the couch he paused to nudge rikers body with his foot then moved on to pour some wine into johannas glass and more into his own are you sure you want to drink that are you insane he held the bottle high its impossible to find this vintage anymore that might well be true she had inadvertently cornered the market with her collection what if the wine is poisoned his glass hovered in midair and his face was also frozen youre not sure are you lost your edge she sipped from her wineglass and assumed what she hoped was a mallory smile perversely he found that reassuring and tipped back his own glass for a long draught you still believe you can talk your way out of this she nodded and drank her wine and he drank just as i remember it fabulous his gaze fell on rikers body too bad i actually liked that man hes not dead yet said johanna hell be dead soon enough doctor and its all your fault you know all those murders if only youd hung that jury when you had the chance it wouldve taken one vote yours if youd voted guilty my plan would have died right there in the courtroom you see that now dont you all your fault and now poor riker has to die youre making everything too complicated thats how theyll catch you youll never know doctor youll be dead or one phone call to victor patchock and you get to live he perused the bottles label so timothy kidd put you onto this wine that night in the liquor store was he following me she sipped from the glass thats been driving you crazy hasnt it how did timothy know it was you what did you do wrong he found me in the neighborhood of a fresh corpse that wasnt it the body hadnt been found yet no the odd note was when you recognized him in hindsight its so simple you haunted your crime scenes thats part of the kick isnt it the police activity the media frenzy thats how you knew timothy was fbi forgive me im digressing of course he recognized you your face was on the news every night but he had to wonder why youd be surprised to see him a man youd never met and then you disappeared so quickly details like this are food for a paranoid personality he was only suspicious that night when another juror turned up dead the next day thats when he still trying to buy time you really think the cavalry is coming over the hill to save you now thats odd because youre the one with the rescuer complex he yawned lets get this over with shall we he aimed the gun at her face actually i was just about to pay you a compliment he lowered the gun she knew he would the idea was brilliant she said and you almost pulled it off you nearly disemboweled the justice system with a little help from the aclu yes a nice touch she watched the rise and fall of rikers chest and found comfort in this i dont have to kill him doctor choose riker or victor his gun hand warred a moment with the hand that held the wine the revolver was left to rest on the couch cushion he drained his glass then filled it again perhaps i shouldnt rush you as victims go youre miles more entertaining than the rest of them even my friend timothy oh absolutely boring though to be fair i suppose its difficult to be scintillating company once your throat is slashed and youre bleeding to death zachary lifted his wineglass again then watched surprised and helpless to prevent it from tipping forward his fingers could not close around the crystal the wine spilled across the couch cushions in a wide red stain johanna was reminded of timothy kidd quietly bleeding his life away in an armchair zachary gave her a foolish smile im drunk she shook her head no thats not it johanna looked down at her glass such a poor wine thats all you had in common with timothy neither one of you had a discriminating palate i think my chemicals actually improved the taste it was a struggle for him to keep his eyes open there was a high color in his cheeks and his eyes were those of a dullard slow to focus but now as he began to understand what she had done he made a clumsy attempt to rise from the couch panic worked against him you drugged me his fingers wormed around the handle of the gun but he could not lift it from the cushion you put me to sleep i considered that option she said i have a high tolerance for these drugs but you have greater body mass so i couldnt count on outlasting you and you mightve been the first to wake up no i didnt sedate you i killed you a syringe in the cork its the simple plans that work best but you drank i killed us both there was no other way johanna sat quietly finally coming to terms with timothy kidds last moments and sharing them she sipped air and life what measure was left the more ian zachary struggled the faster he died the red wine stain spread across the upholstery just like the bloodstains on timothys chair she had not anticipated the justice of this tableau she had not dared to think so far ahead lest she falter with the syringe while poisoning the wine zacharys head rolled to one side and he stared at her in dumb surprise the muscle spasm a preview of her own death made his body go suddenly rigid then came the violent shakes and then nothing at all he had ceased to exist and she was alone there was no euphoria to numb her own panic while she separated from the solid earth johanna apollo the recalcitrant suicide grieved for her lost life as she careened away from it this was the moment after the leap from a mountain the knowledge that she could not scratch her way back to the ledge and the experience of free fall was intense there was such cruelty in this long descent from grace so much time for regret the final spasm came the wineglass fell from her hand and in the ether of her dying brain starved of oxygen and blood regret tenacious thing remained riker was bleeding from a head wound always a good indication of ongoing life and his pulse was strong mallory was still holding on to his wrist as she spoke to the operator saying the words guaranteed to get the best service officer down his limp hand fell back to the floor mallory rose to a stand and moved on to examine other elements of her new crime scene rikers blood on the wine bottle his stolen revolver in the loose grip of zacharys gloved hand so the doctor had lost the gun to this man before she could get off one round no surprise there the reapers trademark a honed penknife lay at zacharys feet and one case was closed what else spilled wine on the couch and a shattered glass on the floor by the doctors chair in the absence of visible wounds poison was such an easy call a murdersuicide no it was not quite that simple there were a few outstanding details and now the scene was all too easily read and here her mind made a bruising stumble slamming up against her own mistake she had underestimated the doctors feelings for riker he moaned and she turned around to see other signs of rikers awakening subtle movements of his face and limbs before the real horror show could begin she turned out the light so he would not open his eyes to see the dead white face of johanna apollo after dragging his body into the hallway the young detective returned to tamper with the crime scene in her limited rule book for a cops life this was an act of heresy she could not remove rikers stolen gun from the premises jack coffey knew who had taken it and he would expect to find it listed on the crimescene inventory she settled for hiding the revolver in a drawer of the armoire and now it was less clear that suicide had been dr apollos second option next with one hand mallory wiped the wet face of a corpse formerly a woman who had loved her life and proved it leaving behind the irrefutable evidence of tears all gone now perfectly dry riker would never know and never blame himself when the ambulance arrived mallory was on her knees holding riker tightly in her arms rocking him and lying to him telling him that everything was fine just fine epilogue a wake for a dead cat rlkers father shook his head mystified that he should be invited here on such a foolish pretext the old man had been the first guest to arrive mugss real friends would come later to view the remains possibly to spit upon them and be reassured that the cat from hell was finally out of their lives the ever skeptical mrs ortega would prefer to see the dead body but ashes would do riker lifted his beer can in a toast to a great scrapper over the months since jos death the cat had declined day by taildragging day finally succumbing to old age and grief but not without one last fight a good one by rikers account though mugs now resided in an urn on the fireplace riker still bore the scabs of long scratches his own fault he had tried to cradle the dying animal in his arms though he always omitted that part from the story of the cats final brawl however he had invited his father for another reason he wanted to tie up one last loose end a question had nagged at him every day since jo had been gone without being asked the old man had taken charge of her funeral arrangements and rikers gratitude ran deep had the matter been left to himself the turnout would have been pathetic not filling one pew of a small church dad had called in a lifetime of storedup favors to fill a cathedral with cops a grand affair that had made the front page of the new york times what power the old man had even high command officers had come out that day in dress blues as a tribute to the lady a stranger to them all father and son so rarely spoke it was difficult to ask how dad had known about this womans terrible importance to him no one could have mentioned it to the old man riker had not even told jo and so he had to ask dads reply was predictably brief i read your statement and the police report he glowered at his son for this evidence was so obvious why was he being asked to waste words upon it that was not his way and his own son should know better than to expect this of him all of that was in the old mans eyes but no more words were forthcoming not good enough dad riker slugged back his beer then crumpled the can in one fist to tell the old bastard that he was dead serious now why did you go to all that trouble for a woman youve never met i told you it was all in the paperwork and her fingerprints when she clubbed you with that wine bottle well what that woman did this was a strain on him so many words and all in a row he paused to read his sons expression which said with quiet resolve that there must be more and so his dry cracked lips pressed into a line of resignation for dad wanted it known that he spoke under duress you went in there that night without your gun you loved her he tilted his head to one side to ask his son if this was clear the connection between these two things or had he not raised a detective after all she died for you the old man said and thus he owed an enormous debt to johanna apollo for his son was precious to him that was also in his eyes and he lowered them lest any more nonsense should leak out in this manner rising from his chair dad reached out one bonedry hand and let it rest a moment on his sons shoulder just a light tap that stood for a kiss and now he took his leave of this ridiculous party for a dead cat that last sentiment was conveyed by the subtle shake of the head as he walked toward the door his hand was on the knob when he spoke again without turning around and this was one of his longest speeches the day of the funeral you asked me about johannas gravestone well it was finally installed i went out there this morning to make sure they did a right job of it they followed the attorneys instructions the ones she gave him the day she died and now he quickly departed sparing himself the emotional response of a simple thank you from his son the stone had not yet been carved on the day when jo had gone into the ground a wooden marker had sufficed for the burial riker had been told that a more permanent monument had been ordered by the recent codicil to her will and this had been more evidence of a suicide planned in advance of the reaper knocking on jos door he kissed his last hope goodbye thanks to the concussion his memory of that night had ended on the wrong side of jos door he could not recall breaking it down and now he knew that his father had not been privy to any more evidence beyond the reports and statements riker could not stop thinking like a cop even on this his day off why had his father the miser of words found it necessary to repeat the gravestone story and why did the old man prefer his own fable to the truth both father and son had reviewed the same evidence but only his father had seen the instructions for the stonecutter had jo left a sentimental passage on her tombstone some message the old man had mistaken for rikers but actually meant for another man on his black days riker believed that jo had died for the love of timothy kidd that she had always planned to kill herself to end the grief and buy a little justice for a dead man on his good days all he had left was pain mallory slumped down behind the wheel of her car and waited for riker to emerge from the apartment building she knew it would not be long he had been too eager to end the only party he had ever given the deadcat celebration she passed some time studying the pocket watch handed down from her foster father the cover bore a gold engraving of an open field beneath a heaven of roiling clouds a lone figure bent and bowed was walking against the wind once it had conjured up memories of home and the people who had loved her that old connection was lost to her now for every time she looked at the watch she thought of johanna apollo everything had changed mallory looked up to see riker standing at the curb waving one hand to stop a taxicab she put her tan sedan in gear and edged out into the street following at a distance of several car lengths when the yellow cab stopped at an intersection she saw rikers arm extend from the rolleddown rear window holding out money to buy a bouquet of flowers from a sidewalk vendor the red roses could only be intended for a woman she followed his cab across the bridge to brooklyn and now she knew where he was heading for that way lay the cemetery twenty minutes later the cabbie left his passenger at the gate mallory took her own time finding a parking space some distance away she had no fear of losing him among the many paths that wound through acres of grave sites when she found him again his body blocked her view of the tombstone from her hiding place behind a larger monument mallory could only tell that the grave marker had been recently installed the workmens tracks had disturbed a light covering of this mornings snow rikers felt hat went flying off in a strong gust of frigid air when he dropped his bouquet the wind took his roses too nudging them along the cold ground picking at their petals destroying them and what damage had dr apollo done to riker had the woman left some little bomb of words engraved in granite he was bending folding as if the doctor had reached out from the frozen ground and gutted him mallory had said nothing to alter his theory of the murdersuicide as a longplanned event nor had she discouraged him from casting himself in the role of an unwanted intruder on that scene in her rationale riker would not grieve if johanna apollo had never been his to lose but now that plan was unraveling and her frustration was escalating by the second for there was no way to get even with the dead she need not have worried that riker would catch her watching over him when he finally turned around he was as good as blind tears blurring his eyes and streaming down his face after he had disappeared over the rise of the gravel path an angry mallory approached the gravestone to see what the dead woman had done to him but there was nothing written there that could break a man in half no words at all beyond the doctors name and the dates of her life and death understanding came swiftly as a hammerfall the man had come to a boneyard of all places looking for love and he had gone away without it johanna apollo had died for him and for a little while something very rare had belonged to riker until mallory had destroyed the only evidence in her own inimical violent style her own version of remorse she slammed one closed fist down on the gravestone wanting the pain wanting to feel something mallory turned toward the path intending to hunt riker down before he reached the gate she planned to hurt him with the certain knowledge that johanna apollo had loved him more than her own life this fresh agony would be her gift to him all the details of the altered crime scene but she could not move it was as if a wall had suddenly sprung up about her surrounding her with invisible bricks of irony riker would never believe her not her a liar and a manipulator extraordinaire though he would nod and smile thanking her for her trouble then he would pour himself a shot of bourbon dismissing her gift as some new trick to fix him one last time riker had lost everything a family of four came along the path crunching gravel underfoot and bearing flowers for a nearby grave they gave a wide berth to the young woman who stood there so quietly all of them believing that her sorrow must be recent and profound the mourners departed night fell and kathy mallory was left in the cold company of stone the marker was a plain one of deep red granite and its only ornament was modest the flower carved within a heart was not a rose nor any bloom that one could readily identify it was small not much to look at a common pimpernel carol oconnell born in carol oconnell studied at the california institute or artschouinard and the arizona state university for many years she survived on occasional sales of her paintings as well as freelance proofreading and copyediting at the age of carol oconnell sent the manuscript of mallorys oracle to hutchinson because she felt that a british publisher would be sympathetic to a first time novelist and because hutchinson also publish ruth rendell having miraculously found the book on the slush pile hutchinson immediately came back with an offer for world rights not just for mallorys oracle but for the second book featuring the same captivating heroine at the frankfurt book fair hutchinson sold the rights to dutch french and german publishers for six figure sums mallorys oracle was then taken back to the states where it was sold at auction to putnam for over carol oconnell is now writing full time
