michael connelly angels flight the sixth book in the harry bosch series chapter the word sounded alien in his mouth as if spoken by someone else there was an urgency in his own voice that bosch didnt recognize the simple hello he had whispered into the telephone was full of hope almost desperation but the voice that came back to him was not the one he needed to hear detective bosch for a moment bosch felt foolish he wondered if the caller had recognized the faltering of his voice this is lieutenant michael tulin is this bosch the name meant nothing to bosch and his momentary concern about how he sounded was ripped away as an awful dread entered his mind this is bosch what is it whats wrong hold please for deputy chief irving what is the caller clicked off and there was only silence bosch now remembered who tulin was irving s adjutant bosch stood still and waited he looked around the kitchen only the dim oven light was on with one hand he held the phone hard against his ear the other he instinctively brought up to his stomach where fear and dread were twisting together he looked at the glowing numbers on the stove clock it was almost two five minutes past the last time he had looked at it this isnt right he thought as he waited they dont do this by phone they come to your door they tell you this facetoface finally irving picked up on the other end of the line detective bosch where is she what happened another moment of excruciating silence went by as bosch waited his eyes were closed now excuse me just tell me what happened to her i mean is she alive detective im not sure what it is you are talking about im calling because i need to muster your team as soon as possible i need you for a special assignment bosch opened his eyes he looked through the kitchen window into the dark canyon below his house his eyes followed the slope of the hill down toward the freeway and then up again to the slash of hollywood lights he could see through the cut of the cahuenga pass he wondered if each light meant someone awake and waiting for someone who wasnt going to come bosch saw his own reflection in the window he looked weary he could make out the deep circles etched beneath his eyes even in the dark glass i have an assignment detective irving repeated impatiently are you able to work or are you i can work i just was mixed up there for a moment well im sorry if i woke you but you should be used to it yes its no problem bosch didnt tell him that he hadnt been awakened by the call that he had been roaming around in his dark house waiting then get it going detective well have coffee down here at the scene what scene well talk about it when you get here i dont want to delay this any further call your team have them come to grand street between third and fourth the top of angels flight do you know where im talking about bunker hill i dont it will be explained when you get here seek me out when you are here if i am at the bottom come down to me before you speak with anyone what about lieutenant billets she should she will be informed about what is happening were wasting time this is not a request it is a command get your people together and get down here am i making myself clear to you youre clear then i will be expecting you irving hung up without waiting for a reply bosch stood with the phone still at his ear for a few moments wondering what was going on angels flight was the short inclined railroad that carried people up bunker hill in downtown far outside the boundaries of the hollywood division homicide table if irving had a body down there at angels flight the investigation would fall under the jurisdiction of central division if central detectives couldnt handle it because of caseload or personnel problems or if the case was deemed too important or media sensitive for them then it would be bumped to the bulls the robberyhomicide division the fact that a deputy chief of police was involved in the case before dawn on a saturday suggested the latter possibility the fact that he was calling bosch and his team in instead of the rhd bulls was the puzzle whatever it was that irving had working at angels flight didnt make sense bosch glanced once more down into the dark canyon pulled the phone away from his ear and clicked it off he wished he had a cigarette but he had made it this far through the night without one he wouldnt break now he turned his back and leaned on the counter he looked down at the phone in his hand turned it back on and hit the speed dial button that would connect him with kizmin riders apartment he would call jerry edgar after he talked to her bosch felt a sense of relief come over him that he was reluctant to acknowledge he might not yet know what awaited him at angels flight but it would certainly take his thoughts away from eleanor wish riders alert voice answered after two rings kiz its harry he said weve got work chapter bosch agreed to meet his two partners at the hollywood division station to pick up cars before they headed downtown to angels flight on the way down the hill to the station he had punched in kfwb on his jeeps radio and picked up a breaking news report on a homicide investigation under way at the site of the historic inclined railroad the newsman on the scene reported that two bodies had been found inside one of the train cars and that several members of the robberyhomicide squad were on the scene but that was the extent of the reporters information as he also noted that the police had placed an unusually wide cordon of yellow tape around the crime scene prohibiting him from getting a closer look at the station bosch communicated this thin bit of information to edgar and rider while they signed three slickbacks out of the motor pool so it looks like were gonna be playing sloppy seconds to rhd edgar concluded showing his annoyance at being rousted from sleep to spend probably the whole weekend doing gofer work for the rhd bulls our guts their glory and we arent even on call this weekend why didnt irving call out rices gotdamned team if he needed a hollywood team edgar had a point team one bosch edgar and rider wasnt even up on call rotation this weekend if irving had followed proper callout procedure he would have called terry rice who headed up team three which was currently on top of the rotation but bosch had already figured that irving wasnt following any procedures not if the deputy chief had called him directly before checking with his supervisor lieutenant grace billets well jerry bosch said more than used to his partners whining youll get the chance to ask the deputy chief personally in a little while yeah right i do that and ill find my ass down in harbor the next ten years fuck that hey harbor divisions an easy gig rider said just to rag edgar a bit she knew edgar lived in the valley and that a transfer to harbor division would mean a miserable ninetyminute commute each way the pure definition of freeway therapy the brasss method of unofficially punishing malcontents and problem cops they only pull six seven homicides a year down there thats nice but count me the fuck out okay okay bosch said lets just get going and well worry about all of that stuff later dont get lost bosch took hollywood boulevard to the and coasted down the freeway in minimal traffic to downtown halfway there he checked the mirror and saw his partners cruising in the lanes behind him even in the dark and with other traffic he could pick them out he hated the new detective cars they were painted black and white and looked exactly like patrol cruisers with the exception that they did not carry emergency lights across the roof it had been the former chiefs idea to replace unmarked detective cars with the socalled slickbacks the whole thing had been a scam perpetrated to fulfill his promises to put more cops on the street by changing unmarked cars into clearly marked cars he was giving the public the erroneous impression that there were more cops patrolling the streets he also counted the detectives using slickbacks when he addressed community groups and proudly reported that he had increased the number of cops on the street by hundreds meantime detectives trying to do their jobs drove around like targets more than once bosch and his team had sought to serve an arrest warrant or had attempted to come into a neighborhood quietly in the course of an investigation only to have their presence signaled by their own cars it was stupid and dangerous but it was the chiefs edict and it was carried out throughout the departments divisional detective bureaus even after the chief was not asked back for a second fiveyear term bosch like many of the departments detectives hoped the new chief would soon order the detective cars back to normal meanwhile he no longer drove the car assigned to him home from work it had been a nice detective supervisors perk having a takehome car but he didnt want the marked car sitting in front of his house not in la you never knew what menace that could bring to your door they got to grand street by two fortyfive as bosch pulled to a stop he saw an unusually large number of policerelated vehicles parked along the curb at california plaza he noted the crime scene and coroners vans several patrol cars and several more detective sedans not the slickbacks but the unmarked cars still used by the rhd bulls while he waited for rider and edgar to pull up he opened his briefcase took out the cellular phone and called his home after five rings the machine picked up the call and he heard his own voice telling him to leave a message he was about to click off but decided to leave a message eleanor its me ive got a call out but page me or call me on the cell phone when you get in so i know youre okay um okay thats it bye oh its about two fortyfive right now saturday morning bye edgar and rider had walked up to his door he put the phone away and got out with his briefcase edgar the tallest held up the yellow crime scene tape and they crossed under gave their names and badge numbers to a uniform officer with the crime scene attendance list and then walked across california plaza the plaza was the centerpiece of bunker hill a stone courtyard formed by the conjoining of two marble office towers a highrise apartment building and the museum of contemporary art there was a huge fountain and reflecting pool at its center though the pumps and lights were off at this hour leaving the water still and black past the fountain was the beaux arts revivalstyled station and wheelhouse at the top of angels flight it was next to this small structure that most of the investigators and patrol officers milled about as if waiting for something bosch looked for the gleaming shaven skull that belonged to deputy chief irvin irving but didnt see it he and his partners stepped into the crowd and moved toward the lone rail car sitting at the top of the tracks along the way he recognized many faces of robberyhomicide detectives they were men he had worked with years earlier when he had been part of the elite squad a few of them nodded to him or called him by name bosch saw francis sheehan his former partner standing off by himself smoking a cigarette bosch broke from his partners and stepped over frankie he said whats going on harry what are you doing here got called out irving called us out shit sorry partner i wouldnt wish this one on my enemy why whats going you better talk to the man first hes putting the big blanket on this one bosch hesitated sheehan looked worn down but bosch hadnt seen him in months he had no idea what had put the dark circles under his hound dog eyes or when they had been cut into his face for a moment bosch remembered the reflection of his own face that he had seen earlier you okay francis never better okay ill talk to you bosch rejoined edgar and rider who were standing near the rail car edgar nodded slightly to boschs left hey harry you see that he said in a low voice thats sustain chastain and that bunch over there what are those pricks doin here bosch turned and saw the grouping of men from internal affairs got no idea he said chastain and bosch locked eyes for a moment but bosch didnt hold it it wasnt worth the waste of energy to get worked up over just seeing the iad man instead he focused on trying to put the whole scene together his curiosity level was at maximum the number of rhd bulls hanging around the iad shines a deputy chief on the scene he had to find out what was going on with edgar and rider behind him in single file bosch worked his way to the rail car portable lights had been set up inside and the car was lit up like somebodys living room inside two crime scene techs were at work this told bosch that he was quite late arriving at the scene the crime scene techs didnt move in until after the coroners techs had completed their initial procedures declaring victims dead photographing the bodies in situ searching them for wounds weapons and identification bosch stepped to the rear of the car and looked through the open door the technicians were at work around two bodies a woman was sprawled on one of the stepped seats about midway through the car she was wearing gray leggings and a white thighlength tshirt a large flower of blood had blossomed on her chest where she had been hit dead center with a single bullet her head was snapped back against the sill of the window behind her seat she had dark hair and features her lineage obviously stretching somewhere south of the border on the seat next to her body was a plastic bag filled with many items bosch couldnt see a folded newspaper protruded from the top of it on the steps near the rear door to the car was the facedown body of a black man wearing a dark gray suit from his viewpoint bosch could not see the mans face and only one wound was visible a throughandthrough gunshot wound at the center of the victims right hand bosch knew it was what would later be called a defensive wound in the autopsy report the man had held his hand up in a futile attempt to ward off gunfire bosch had seen it often enough over the years and it always made him think about the desperate actions people take at the end putting a hand up to stop a bullet was one of the most desperate though the techs were stepping in and out of his line of sight bosch could look straight down through the inclined train car and down the track to hill street about three hundred feet below a duplicate train car was down there at the bottom of the hill and bosch could see more detectives milling about by the turnstiles and the closed doors of the grand central market across the street bosch had ridden the inclined railroad as a kid and had studied how it worked he still remembered the two matching cars were counterbalanced when one went up the sidebyside tracks the other went down and vice versa they passed each other at the midpoint he remembered riding on angels flight long before bunker hill had been reborn as a slick business center of glass and marble towers classy condominiums and apartments museums and fountains referred to as water gardens back then the hill had been a place of oncegrand victorian homes turned into tiredlooking rooming houses harry and his mother had taken angels flight up the hill to look for a place to live finally detective bosch bosch turned around deputy chief irving stood in the open door of the little station house all of you he said signaling bosch and his team inside they entered a cramped room dominated by the large old cable wheels that once moved the train cars up and down the incline bosch remembered reading that when angels flight was rehabilitated a few years earlier after a quarter century of disuse the cables and wheels had been replaced with an electric system monitored by computer on one side of the wheel display was just enough room for a small lunch table with two folding chairs on the other side was the computer for operating the trains a stool for the operator and a stack of cardboard boxes the top one open and showing stacks of pamphlets on the history of angels flight standing against the far wall in the shadow behind the old iron wheels his arms folded and his craggy sunreddened face looking down at the floor was a man bosch recognized bosch had once worked for captain john garwood commander of the robberyhomicide division he knew by the look on his face that he was very put out about something garwood didnt look up at them and the three detectives said nothing irving went to a telephone on the lunch table and picked up the loose handset as he began talking he motioned to bosch to close the door excuse me sir irving said it was the team from hollywood they are all here and we are ready to proceed he listened for a few moments said goodbye and hung up the phone the reverence in his voice and his use of the word sir told bosch that irving had been talking to the chief of police it was one more curiosity about the case all right then irving said turning around and facing the three detectives i am sorry to roust you people especially out of rotation however i have spoken with lieutenant billets and as of now you have been cut free of the hollywood rotation until we get this handled what exactly is this that we are handling bosch asked a delicate situation the homicides of two citizens bosch wished he would get to the point chief i see enough rhd people around here to investigate the bobby kennedy case all over again he said glancing at garwood and thats not to mention the iad shines hovering around the edges what exactly are we doing here what do you want simple irving said i am turning the investigation over to you it is your case now detective bosch the robberyhomicide detectives will be withdrawing as soon as you people are brought up to speed as you can see you are coming in late thats unfortunate but i think you will be able to overcome it i know what you can do bosch stared at him blankly for a long moment then glanced at garwood again the captain had not moved and continued to stare at the floor bosch asked the only question that could bring understanding to this strange situation that man and woman on the train car who are they irving nodded were is probably the more correct word were the womans name was catalina perez who exactly she was and what she was doing on angels flight we do not know yet it probably does not matter it appears that she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time but that will be for you to officially determine anyway the man in there he is different that was howard elias the lawyer irving nodded bosch heard edgar draw in a breath and hold it this is for real unfortunately bosch looked past irving and through the ticket window he could see into the train car the techs were still at work getting ready to shut off the lights so they could laser the inside of the car to look for fingerprints his eyes fell to the hand with the bullet wound through it howard elias bosch thought about all the suspects there would be many of them standing around outside at that very moment watching shit edgar said dont suppose we could take a pass on this one could we chief watch your language detective irving snapped the muscles of his jaw bulging as he grew angry that is not acceptable here look chief all im sayin is if youre looking for somebody to play department uncle tom it aint going to be that has nothing to do with this irving said cutting him off whether you like it or not you have been assigned to this case i expect each of you to do it professionally and thoroughly most of all i expect results as does the chief of police other matters mean nothing absolutely nothing after a brief silence during which irvings eyes went from edgar to rider and then to bosch the deputy chief continued in this department there is only one race he said not black or white just the blue race chapter howard eliass notoriety as a civil rights attorney did not come to him because of the clients he served they could best be described as neerdowells if not outright criminals what had made eliass face and name so well known to the masses of los angeles was his use of the media his skill at probing the inflamed nerve of racism in the city and the fact that his law practice was built entirely around one particular expertise suing the los angeles police department for nearly two decades he had made a more than comfortable living filing lawsuit after lawsuit in federal court on behalf of citizens who had collided in some way with the police department elias sued patrol officers detectives the chief of police the institution itself when he filed he used the shotgun approach naming as defendants anyone remotely connected with the incident at the heart of the matter after a fleeing burglary suspect was chewed up by a police dog elias had sued on the injured mans behalf naming the dog its handler and the line of supervision from the handler up to the chief of police for good measure he had sued the handlers academy instructors and the dogs breeder as well in his latenight television infomercials and frequent impromptu but cleverly orchestrated press conferences on the steps of the us district courthouse elias always cast himself as a watchdog a lone voice crying out against the abuses of a fascist and racist paramilitary organization known as the lapd to his critics and they ran from the rank and file of the lapd to the offices of the city and district attorneys elias was a racist himself a loose cannon who helped widen the fractures in an already divided city to these detractors he was the scum of the legal system a courtroom magician who could reach into the deck at any place and still pull out the race card most often eliass clients were black or brown his skills as a public speaker and his selective use of facts while employing those skills often turned his clients into community heroes emblematic victims of a police department out of control many in the citys south neighborhoods credited elias with singlehandedly keeping the lapd from behaving as an occupying army howard elias was one of the few people in the city who could be absolutely hated and fervently celebrated in different quarters at the same time few who revered elias understood that his entire practice was built around one simple piece of the law he filed lawsuits only in federal court and under provisions of the us civil rights codes that allowed him to bill the city of los angeles for his fees in any case in which he was victorious in court the rodney king beating the christopher commission report excoriating the department in the wake of the king trial and subsequent civil unrest and the racially divisive o j simpson case created a shadow that stretched over every case elias filed and so it was not particularly difficult for the lawyer to win cases against the department convincing juries to award at least token damages to plaintiffs those juries never realized that such verdicts opened the door for elias to bill the city and its taxpayers themselves included hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees in the dog bite lawsuit which became eliass signature case the jury found that the rights of the plaintiff had been violated but since that plaintiff was a burglar with a long track record of prior arrests and convictions the jury awarded him only one dollar in damages their intent was clear to send a message to the police department rather than to make a criminal wealthy but that didnt matter to elias a win was a win under the federal guidelines he then submitted a bill to the city for in legal fees the city screamed and audited it but still ended up paying more than half in effect the jury and the many before and since believed they were delivering a rebuke to the lapd but they were also paying for eliass halfhour latenight infomercials on channel his porsche and his italian courtroom suits his opulent home up in baldwin hills elias of course was not alone there were dozens of attorneys in the city who specialized in police and civil rights cases and mined the same federal provision allowing them to extract fees far in excess of the damages awarded their clients not all were cynical and motivated by money lawsuits by elias and others had brought about positive change in the department even their enemies the cops could not begrudge them that civil rights cases brought about the end of the departmentapproved use of the choke hold while subduing suspects after an inordinately high number of minority deaths lawsuits had also improved conditions and protections in local jails other cases opened and streamlined means for citizens to file complaints against abusive police officers but elias stood head and shoulders above them all he had media charm and the speaking skills of an actor he also seemed to lack any criteria when it came to choosing his clients he represented drug dealers who claimed to have been abused by their interrogators burglars who stole from the poor but objected to being beaten by the police who chased them down robbers who shot their victims but then cried foul when they in turn were shot by police eliass favorite line used as a tagline on his commercials and whenever cameras were pointed at his face was to say that abuse of power was abuse of power regardless of whether the victim was a criminal he was always quick to look into the camera and declare that if such abuse was tolerated when it was aimed at the guilty it wouldnt be long before the innocent were targeted elias was a sole practitioner in the last decade he had sued the department more than a hundred times and won jury verdicts in more than half of the cases his was a name that could freeze a cops brain when he heard it in the department you knew that if elias sued you it would not be a small case that would be cleaned up and swept away elias didnt settle cases out of court nothing in the civil rights codes gave an incentive to settle cases no you would be dragged through a public spectacle if elias aimed a lawsuit at you there would be press releases press conferences newspaper headlines television stories youd be lucky to come out of it in one piece let alone with your badge angel to some devil to others howard elias was now dead shot to death on the angels flight railroad bosch knew as he looked through the small rooms window and watched the orange glow of the laser beam move about the darkened train car that he was in the calm before the storm in just two days what might have been eliass biggest case was due to begin the lawsuit against the lapd that had become known in the media as the black warrior case was set for jury selection in us district court on monday morning the coincidence or as a wide swath of the public would undoubtedly believe the lack of coincidence between eliass murder and the start of the trial would make the investigation of the attorneys death an easy seven on the medias richter scale minority groups would howl with rage and rightful suspicion the whites in the west side would whisper about their fears of another riot and the eyes of the nation would be on los angeles and its police department once more bosch at that moment agreed with edgar though for different reasons than his black partners he wished they could take a pass on this one chief he said turning his focus back to irving when it gets out who i mean when the media find out it was elias were going to that is not your concern irving said your concern is the investigation the chief and i will deal with the media not a word comes from anyone on the investigation not a word forget the media rider said what about south central people are going to that will be handled irving said interrupting the department will institute the public disorder readiness plan beginning with the next watch all personnel shift to twelve and twelves until we see how the city reacts nobody who saw nineteen ninetytwo wants to see that again but again that is not your concern you have one concern here you didnt let me finish rider said i wasnt going to say they would riot i actually have faith in the people there i dont think there will be trouble what i was going to say was that they will be angry about this and suspicious if you think you can ignore that or contain it by putting more cops on the detective rider irving said interrupting again that is not your concern the investigation is your concern bosch saw that irvings interruptions and words telling a black woman not to be concerned about her own community had incensed rider it was on her face and bosch had seen the look before he decided to speak before she said something out of line were going to need more people with just the three of us well be running down alibis fulltime for weeks maybe a month case like this we need to move fast not only because of the case but because of the people were going to need more than just three of us that too has been taken care of irving said you will have all the help you need but it wont come from robberyhomicide its a conflict of interest because of the michael harris matter before speaking bosch noted how irving refused to call it the black warrior case instead using the plaintiffs name why us what i understand why rhd is out but where are the central division teams were off our beat and out of rotation here why us irving exhaled audibly the entire central division homicide squad is in academy training this week and next sensitivity training and then the fbi workshop on new crime scene techniques robberyhomicide was covering their calls they took this one once it was determined who that was with the bullets in his head i was contacted and in subsequent discussions with the chief of police it was determined that we would reach out to you you are a good team one of our best you have cleared your last four including that hardboiled eggs job yes i was briefed on it plus the main thing is none of you were ever sued by elias he pointed with his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the crime scene in the train car as he did this he glanced at garwood but the captain was still looking down at the floor no conflict of interest irving said correct the three detectives nodded bosch had been sued often enough in his twentyfive years with the department but somehow he had always avoided tangling with elias still he didnt believe irvings explanation was complete he knew that edgar had already alluded to a reason for their choice probably a reason more important than the fact that none of them had been sued by elias boschs two partners were black that might come in handy for irving at some point bosch knew irvings desire that the department have only one face and one race blue would go out the window when he needed a black face for the cameras i dont want my people paraded in front of the media chief bosch said if were on the case were on the case to work it not for a show irving stared at him with angry eyes what did you call me bosch was momentarily taken aback i called you chief oh good because i was wondering if there was some confusion here over the line of command in this room is there detective bosch looked away and out the window again he could feel his face turning red and it upset him to give himself away no he said good irving said without a trace of tension then i am going to leave you with captain garwood he will bring you up to speed on what has been accomplished so far when he is done we will talk about how we are going to set this case up he turned to the door but bosch stopped him one more thing chief irving turned back to him bosch had recovered his composure now he looked calmly at the deputy chief you know we are going to be looking hard at cops on this lots of them well have to go through all of the lawyers cases not just the black warrior thing so i just need to know up front we all need to do you and the police chief want the chips to fall where they fall or he didnt finish and irving said nothing i want to protect my people bosch said this kind of case we just need to be clear about everything up front bosch was taking a gamble saying it in front of garwood and the others it would likely anger irving again but bosch took the shot because he wanted irving to answer him in front of garwood the captain was a powerful man in the department bosch wanted him to know that his team would be following the directives of the highest command just in case the chips fell close to some of garwoods people irving looked at him for a long moment before finally speaking your insolence is noted detective bosch yes sir but whats the answer let them fall detective two people are dead that should not be dead it does not matter who they were they should not be dead do your best work use all your skills and let the chips fall bosch nodded once irving turned and glanced quickly at garwood before leaving the room chapter harry you have a smoke sorry cap im trying to quit me too i guess all that really means is that you borrow em rather than buy em garwood stepped away from the corner and blew out his breath with his foot he moved a stack of boxes away from the wall and sat down on them he looked old and tired to bosch but then he had looked that way twelve years before when bosch had gone to work for him garwood didnt raise any particular feelings in bosch he had been the aloof sort of supervisor didnt socialize with the squad after hours didnt spend much time out of his office and in the bullpen at the time bosch thought maybe that was good it didnt engender a lot of loyalty from garwoods people but it didnt create any enmity either maybe that was how garwood had lasted in the spot for so long well it looks like we really got our tit in the wringer this time garwood said he then looked at rider and added excuse the saying detective boschs pager sounded and he quickly pulled it off his belt disengaged the beep and looked at the number it was not his own number as he had hoped it would be he recognized it as the home number of lieutenant grace billets she probably wanted to know what was going on if irving had been as circumspect with her as he had been with bosch on the phone then she knew next to nothing important garwood asked ill take care of it later you want to talk in here or should we go out to the train let me tell you what we have first then its your scene to do with what you want garwood reached into the pocket of his coat took out a softpack of marlboros and began opening it i thought you asked me for a smoke bosch said i did this is my emergency pack im not supposed to open it it made little sense to bosch he watched as garwood lit a cigarette and then offered the pack to bosch harry shook his head he put his hands in his pockets to make sure he wouldnt take one this going to bother you garwood asked holding up the cigarette a taunting smile on his face not me cap my lungs are probably already shot but these guys rider and edgar waved it off they appeared as impatient as bosch did in getting to the story okay then garwood finally said this is what we know last run of the night man named elwood elwood hold on a sec he pulled a small pad from the same pocket he had replaced the cigarette package in and looked at some writing on the top page eldrige yeah eldrige eldrige peete he was running the thing by himself it only takes one person to run the whole operation its all computer he was about to close her down for the night on friday nights the last ride is at eleven it was eleven before sending the top car down for the last ride he goes out gets on it closes and locks the door then he comes back in here puts the command on the computer and sends it down he referred to the pad again these things have names the one he sent down is called sinai and the one he brought up was olivet he says theyre named after mountains in the bible it looked to him when olivet got up here that the car was empty so he goes out to lock it up cause then he has to send them one more time and the computer stops them side by side in the middle of the track for overnight then hes done and out of here bosch looked at rider and made a signal as if writing on his palm she nodded and took her own pad and a pen out of the bulky purse she carried she started taking notes only elwood i mean eldrige he comes out to lock up the car and he finds the two bodies onboard he backs away comes in here and calls the police with me so far what next bosch was already thinking of the questions he would have to ask garwood and then probably peete so were covering for central dicks and the call eventually comes to me i send out four guys and they set up the scene they didnt check the bodies for id not right away but there was no id anyway they were going by the book they talked to this eldrige peete and they went down the steps and did a search for casings and other than that held tight until the coroners people arrived and did their thing guys wallet and watch are missing his briefcase too if he was carrying one but they got an id off a letter the stiff had in his pocket addressed to howard elias once they found that my guys took a real good look at the stiff and could tell it was elias they then of course called me and i called irving and he called the chief and then it was decided to call you he had said the last part as if he had been part of the decision process bosch glanced out the window there was still a large number of detectives milling about id say those first guys made more than just a call to you captain bosch said garwood turned to look out the window as if it had never occurred to him that it was unusual to see as many as fifteen detectives at a murder scene i suppose he said okay what else bosch said what else did they do before they figured out who it was and that they werent long for the case well like i said they talked to this fellow eldrige peete and they searched the areas outside the cars top and bottom they did they find any of the brass no our shooter was careful he picked up all the casings we do know that he was using a nine though how the second victim the woman the shot was through and through the slug hit a steel window bracket behind her flattened and fell on the floor its too mashed for comparison but you can still tell it was a nine hoffman said if he was guessing hed say it was a federal youll have to hope for better lead from the autopsies as far as ballistics go if you ever get that far perfect bosch thought nine was a cops caliber and stopping to pick up the shells that was a smooth move you didnt usually see that the way they see it garwood continued elias got it just after he stepped onto the train down there the guy comes up and shoots him in the ass first the ass edgar said thats right the first shot is in the ass see elias is just stepping on so hes a couple steps up from the sidewalk level the shooter comes up from behind and holds the gun out its at ass level he sticks the muzzle in there and fires off the first cap then what bosch asked well we think elias goes down and sort of turns to see who it is he raises his hands but the shooter fires again the slug goes through one of his hands and hits him in the face right between the eyes thats probably your causeofdeath shot right there elias drops back down hes facedown now the shooter steps into the car and puts one more in the back of his head pointblank he then looks up and sees the woman maybe for the first time he hits her from about twelve feet one in the chest through and through and shes gone no witness the shooter gets the wallet and watch off elias picks up his shells and is gone a few minutes later peete brings the car up and finds the bodies you now know what i know bosch and his partners were quiet a long moment the scenario garwood had woven didnt sit right with bosch but he didnt know enough about the crime scene yet to challenge him on it the robbery look legit bosch finally asked it did to me i know the people down south arent going to want to hear that but there it is rider and edgar were silent stones what about the woman bosch asked was she robbed doesnt look like it i kind of think the shooter didnt want to come onto the train anyway the lawyer was the one in the thousanddollar suit hed be the target what about peete did he hear the shots a scream anything he says no he says the generator for the electric is right below the floor here sounds like an elevator running all day long so he wears earplugs he never heard anything bosch stepped around the cable wheels and looked at the train operators station for the first time he saw that mounted above the cash register was a small video display box with a split screen showing four camera views of angels flight from a camera in each of the train cars and from above each terminus on one corner of the screen he could see a long shot of the inside of olivet the crime scene techs were still working with the bodies garwood came around the other side of the cable wheels no luck there he said the cameras are live only no tape they are so the operator can check to make sure everyone is aboard and seated before starting the train did he he didnt look garwood said knowing boschs questions he just checked through the window thought the car was empty and brought it up so he could lock it up where is he at parker our offices i guess youll have to come over and talk to him for yourself ill keep somebody with him until you make it by any other witnesses not a one eleven oclock at night down here the place is pretty dead the grand central market closes up at seven theres nothing else down there except some office buildings a couple of my guys were getting ready to go into those apartments next door here to knock on doors but then they got the id and sort of backed away bosch paced around in a small area of the room and thought very little had been done so far and the discovery of the murders was already four hours old this bothered him even though he understood the reason behind the delay why was elias on angels flight he asked garwood they figure that out before backing away well he mustve wanted to go up the hill dont you think come on captain if you know why not save us the time we dont know harry we ran a dmv check he lives out in baldwin hills thats a long way from bunker hill i dont know why he was coming up here what about where he was coming from thats a little easier eliass office is just over on third in the bradbury building he was probably coming from there but where he was going okay then what about the woman shes a blank my guys hadnt even started with her when we were told to pull back garwood dropped his cigarette to the floor and crushed it with his heel bosch took it as a signal that the briefing was about over he decided to see if he could get a rise out of him you pissed off captain about what about being pulled off about your people being on the suspect list a small smile played on garwoods thin lips no im not angry i see the chiefs point are your people going to cooperate with us on this after some hesitation garwood nodded of course the quicker they cooperate the quicker you will clear them and youll tell them that thats exactly what ill tell them we appreciate that captain tell me which one of your people do you think could have done this the lips curled into a full smile now bosch studied garwoods cigaretteyellowed teeth and for a moment was glad he was trying to quit youre a clever guy harry i remember that he said nothing else thanks captain but do you have an answer to the question garwood moved to the door and opened it before leaving he turned and looked back at them his eyes traveling from edgar to rider to bosch it wasnt one of mine detectives i guarantee it youll be wasting your time if you look there too long thanks for the advice bosch said garwood stepped out closing the door behind him jeez rider said its like captain boris karloff or something does that guy only come out at night bosch smiled and nodded mr personality he said so what do you think so far i think were at ground zero rider said those guys didnt do jack before getting the hook yeah well robberyhomicide what do you want edgar said they arent known for tap dancing they back the tortoise over the hare any day of the week but if you ask me were fucked you and me kiz we cant win on this one blue race my ass bosch stepped toward the door lets go out and take a look he said cutting off discussion of edgars concerns he knew they were valid but for the moment they only served to clutter their mission maybe well get a few ideas before irving wants to talk again chapter the number of detectives outside the station had finally begun to decrease bosch watched as garwood and a group of his men crossed the plaza toward their cars he then saw irving standing to the side of the train car talking to chastain and three detectives bosch didnt know them but assumed they were iad the deputy chief was animated in his discussion but kept his voice so low that bosch couldnt hear what he was saying bosch wasnt sure exactly what the iad presence was all about but he was getting an increasingly bad feeling about it he saw frankie sheehan hanging back behind garwood and his group he was about to leave but was hesitating bosch nodded at him i see what you mean now frankie he said yeah harry some days you eat the bear right you taking off yeah the cap told us all to get out of here bosch stepped over and kept his voice low any ideas i could borrow sheehan looked at the train car as if considering for the first time who might have killed the two people inside it none other than the obvious and i think that will be a waste of time but then again you have to waste it right cover all the bases yeah anybody you think i should start with yeah me he smiled broadly i hated the douche bag know what im gonna do im going now to try and find an allnight liquor store and buy the best irish whiskey they got im going to have a little celebration hieronymus because howard elias was a motherfucker bosch nodded with cops the word motherfucker was rarely used it was heard a lot by them but not used with most cops it was reserved as being the worst thing you could say about someone when it was said it meant one thing that the person had crossed the righteous that the person had no respect for the keepers of the law and therefore the rules and bounds of society cop killers were always motherfuckers no questions asked defense lawyers got the call most of the time and howard elias was on the motherfucker list too right at the top sheehan gave a little salute and headed off across the plaza bosch turned his attention toward the interior of the train while he put on rubber gloves the lights were back on and the techs were finished with the laser bosch knew one of them hoffman he was working with a trainee bosch had heard about but not met she was an attractive asian woman with a large bust he had overheard other detectives in the squad room discussing her attributes and questioning their authenticity gary is it cool to come in bosch asked leaning in through the door hoffman looked up from the tackle box in which he kept his tools he was organizing things and was about to close it its cool were wrapping up this one yours harry it is now got anything good for me gonna make my day bosch stepped into the car followed by edgar and rider since the car was on an incline the floor was actually a series of steps down to the other door the seats also were on graduated levels on either side of the center aisle bosch looked at the slatted bench seats and suddenly remembered how hard they had been on his skinny behind as a boy fraid not hoffman said its pretty clean bosch nodded and moved down a few more steps to the first body he studied catalina perez the way someone might study a sculpture in a museum there was no feeling for the object in front of him as human he was studying details gaining impressions his eyes fell to the bloodstain and the small tear the bullet had made in the tshirt the bullet had hit the woman dead center bosch thought about this and envisioned the gunman in the doorway of the train twelve feet away hell of a shot huh it was the tech bosch didnt know he looked at her and nodded he had been thinking the same thing that the shooter was someone with some expertise in firearms hi i dont think weve met im sally tam she put out her hand and bosch shook it it felt weird they were both wearing rubber gloves he told her his name oh she said somebody was just talking about you about the hardboiled eggs case it was just luck bosch knew he was getting a longer ride out of that case than he deserved it was all because a times reporter had heard about it and written a story that exaggerated boschs skills to the point where he seemed like a distant relative of sherlock holmes bosch pointed past tam and said he needed to get by to take a look at the other body she stepped to the side and leaned back and he slid by careful not to allow himself to rub against her he heard her introducing herself to rider and edgar he dropped into a crouch so he could study the body of howard elias is this still as is he asked hoffman who was squatting next to his tackle box near the feet of the dead man pretty much we turned him to get into his pockets but then put him back there are some polaroids over on that seat behind you if you want to doublecheck coroners people took those before anybody touched him bosch turned and saw the photos hoffman was right the body was in the same position in which it had been found he turned back to the body and used both hands to turn the head so that he could study the wounds garwoods interpretation had been correct bosch decided the entry wound at the back of the head was a contact wound though partially obscured by blood that had matted the hair there were still powder burns and stippling visible in a circular pattern around the wound the face shot however was clean this did not refer to the blood there was a good amount of that but there were no powder burns on the skin the bullet to the face had come from a distance bosch picked up the arm and turned the hand so he could study the entry wound in the palm the arm moved easily rigor mortis had not yet begun the cool evening air was delaying this process there was no discharge burn on the palm bosch did some computing no powder burns on the palm meant the firearm was at least three to four feet away from the hand when the bullet was discharged if elias had his arm extended with his palm out then that added another three feet edgar and rider had made their way to the second body bosch could feel their presence behind him six to seven feet away through the hand and still right between the eyes he said this guy can shoot better remember that when we take him down neither of them answered bosch hoped they picked up on the confidence in his last line as well as the warning he was about to place the dead mans hand down on the floor when he noticed the long scratch mark on the wrist and running along the side of the palm he guessed the wound had occurred when eliass watch had been pulled off he studied the wound closely there was no blood in the track it was a clean white laceration along the surface of the dark skin yet it seemed deep enough to have drawn blood he thought about this for a moment there were no shots to the heart only to the head the blood displacement from the wounds indicated the heart had continued to pump for at least several seconds after elias had gone down it would seem that the shooter would have yanked the watch off eliass wrist very quickly after the shooting there was obviously no reason to hang around yet the scratch on the hand had not bled it was as if it had occurred well after the heart had stopped pumping what do you think about the lead enema hoffman asked interrupting boschs thoughts as hoffman got out of the way bosch stood and gingerly stepped around the body until he was down by the feet he crouched again and looked at the third bullet wound blood had soaked the seat of the pants still he could see the tear and tight burn pattern where the bullet went through the cloth and into howard eliass anus the weapon had been pressed in deep at the point where the seams of the pants were joined and then fired it was a vindictive shot more than a coup de grâce it showed anger and hatred it contradicted the cool skill of the other shots it also told bosch that garwood had been wrong about the shooting sequence whether the captain had been intentionally wrong he didnt know he stood up and backed to the rear door of the car so that he was in the spot where the shooter had probably stood he surveyed the carnage in front of him once more and nodded to no one in particular just trying to commit it all to memory edgar and rider were still between the bodies and making their own observations bosch turned around and looked down the tracks to the turnstile station below the detectives he had seen before were gone now a lone cruiser sat down there and two patrol officers guarded the lower crime scene bosch had seen enough he made his way past the bodies and carefully around sally tam again and up onto the platform his partners followed edgar moving by tam more closely than he had to bosch stepped away from the train car so they could huddle together privately what do you think he said i think theyre real edgar said looking back toward tam theyve got that natural slope to them what do you think kiz funny rider said not taking the bait can we talk about the case please bosch admired how rider took edgars frequent comments and sexual innuendo without more than a sarcastic remark or complaint fired back at him such comments could get edgar in serious trouble but only if rider made a formal complaint the fact that she didnt indicated either she was intimidated or she could handle it she also knew that if she went formal shed get what cops called a k jacket a reference to the city jail ward where snitches were housed bosch had once asked her in a private moment if she wanted him to talk to edgar as her supervisor he was legally responsible for resolving the problem but he knew that if he talked to edgar then edgar would know he had gotten to her rider knew this as well she had thought about all of this for a few moments and told bosch to let things alone she said she wasnt intimidated just annoyed on occasion she could handle it you go first kiz bosch said also ignoring edgars comment even though he privately disagreed with his conclusion about tam anything catch your eye in there same as everybody else i guess looks like the victims were not together the woman either got on ahead of elias or was about to get off i think its pretty clear elias was the primary target and she was just an alsoran the shot up the ass tells me that also like you said in there this guy was a hell of a shot were looking for someone whos spent some time at the range bosch nodded anything else nope its a pretty clean scene nothing much to work with jerry nada what about you same but i think garwood was telling us a story his sequence was for shit how rider said the shot up the pipe was the last one not the first elias was already down its a contact wound and the entry is in the underside where all the seams of the pants come together it would be hard to get a muzzle up there if elias was standing even if he was up a step from the shooter i think he was already down when the shooter popped that cap that changes things rider said makes the last one a fuck you shot the shooter was angry at elias so he knew him edgar said bosch nodded and you think garwood knew this and was just trying to steer us wrong by planting the suggestion rider asked or do you think he just missed it what i know about garwood is that he is not a stupid man bosch said he and fifteen of his men were about to be pulled into federal court on monday by elias and dragged right through the shit he knows any one of those boys might possibly be capable of this he was protecting them thats what i think well thats bullshit protecting a killer cop he should be maybe protecting a killer cop we dont know he didnt know i think it was probably a justincase move doesnt matter if thats what he was doing he shouldnt have a badge bosch didnt say anything to that and rider wasnt placated she shook her head in disgust like most cops in the department she was tired of fuckups and coverups of the few tainting the many what about the scratch on the hand edgar and rider looked at him with arched eyebrows what about it edgar said probly happened when the shooter pulled off the watch one of those with the expanding band like a rolex knowing elias it was probly a rolex makes a nice motive yeah if it was a rolex bosch said he turned and looked out across the city he doubted elias wore a rolex for all of his flamboyance elias was the kind of lawyer who also knew the nuances of his profession he knew that a lawyer wearing a rolex might turn jurors off he wouldnt wear one he would have a nice and expensive watch but not one that advertised itself like a rolex what harry rider said what about the scratch bosch looked back at them well whether it was a rolex or a highpriced watch or not theres no blood in the scratch meaning there is a lot of blood in there the bullet wounds bled out but there was no blood in the scratch meaning i dont think the shooter took the watch that scratch was made after the heart stopped id say long after which means it was made after the shooter left the scene rider and edgar considered this maybe edgar finally said but that vascular system shit is hard to nail down even the coroner isnt gonna be definitive on that yeah bosch said nodding so call it gut instinct we cant take it to court but i know the shooter didnt take the watch or probably the wallet for that matter so what are you saying edgar asked somebody else came along and took it something like that you think it was the guy who ran the train the one who called it in bosch looked at edgar but didnt answer him he hiked his shoulders you think it was one of the rhd guys rider whispered another justincase move send us down the robbery path just in case it was one of their own bosch looked at her a moment thinking about how to respond and how thin the ice was where they now stood detective bosch he turned it was sally tam were clear and the coroners people want to bag em and tag em if thats okay fine hey listen i forgot to ask did you get anything with the laser we got a lot but probably nothing that will help a lot of people ride that car we probably got passengers not the shooter well youll run them anyway right sure well put everything through afis and doj well let you know bosch nodded his thanks also did you collect any keys from the guy we did theyre in one of the brown bags you want them yeah were probably going to need them be right back she smiled and went back to the train car she seemed too cheerful to be at a crime scene bosch knew that would wear off after a while see what i mean edgar said they gotta be real jerry bosch said edgar raised his hands in surrender im a trained observer just filing a report well you better keep it to yourself bosch whispered unless you want to file it with the chief edgar turned just in time to see irving come up to them well initial conclusions detectives bosch looked at edgar jerry what were you just saying you observed uh well uh at the moment were still kind of thinking about all we saw in there nothing that doesnt really jibe with what captain garwood told us bosch said quickly before rider could say anything that would reveal their true conclusions at least preliminarily what next then weve got plenty to do i want to talk to the train operator again and weve got to canvass that residential building for wits weve got nextofkin notification and weve got to get into eliass office when is that help you promised us going to show up chief right now irving raised an arm and beckoned chastain and the three others he stood with bosch had known that was probably what they were doing at the scene but seeing irving waving them over still put a tight feeling in his chest irving was well aware of the animosity between iad and the rank and file and the enmity that existed between bosch and chastain in particular to put them together on the case told bosch that irving wasnt as interested in finding out who killed howard elias and catalina perez as he had outwardly expressed this was the deputy chiefs way of appearing to be conscientious but actually working to cripple the investigation are you sure you want to do this chief bosch asked in an urgent whisper as the iad men approached you know chastain and i dont yes it is how i want to do it irving said cutting bosch off without looking at him detective chastain headed up the internal review of the michael harris complaint i think he is an appropriate addition to this investigation what im saying is that chastain and i have a history chief i dont think its going to work out with i do not care if you two do not like each other find a way to work together i want to go back inside now irving led the entourage back into the station house it was close quarters no one said anything by way of a greeting to one another once inside they all looked expectantly at irving okay we are going to set some ground rules here the deputy chief began detective bosch is in charge of this investigation the six of you report to him he reports to me i do not want any confusion about that detective bosch runs this case now i have arranged for you to set up an office in the conference room next to my office on the sixth floor at parker center there will be added phones and a computer terminal in there by monday morning you men from iad i want you to be primarily used in the areas of interviewing police officers running down alibis that part of the investigation detective bosch and his team will handle the traditional elements of homicide investigation the autopsy witness interviews that whole part of it any questions so far the room went stone silent bosch was quietly seething it was the first time he had thought of irving as a hypocrite the deputy chief had always been a hardass but ultimately a fair man this move was different he was maneuvering to protect the department when the rot they were seeking might be inside it but what irving didnt know was that bosch had accomplished everything in his life by channeling negatives into motivation he vowed to himself that he would clear the case in spite of irvings maneuvers and the chips would fall where they would fall a word of warning about the media it will be all over this case you are not to be distracted or deterred you are not to talk to the media all such communications will come through my office or lieutenant tom orourke in media relations understood the seven detectives nodded good that means i will not have to fear picking the times up off the driveway in the morning irving looked at his watch and then back at the group i can control you people but not the coroners people or anyone else who learns about this through official channels in the next few hours i figure by ten hundred the media will be all over this with full knowledge of the victims identities so i want a briefing in the conference room at ten hundred after i am uptodate i will brief the chief of police and one of us will address the media with the bare minimum of information we wish to put out any problem with that chief that barely gives us six hours bosch said i dont know how much more well know by then weve got a lot of legwork to do before we can sit down and start sifting through that is understood you are to feel no pressure from the media i do not care if the press conference is merely to confirm who is dead and nothing else the media will not be running this case i want you to run with it full bore but at ten hundred i want everyone back at my conference room questions there were none okay then i will turn it over to detective bosch and leave you people to it he turned directly to bosch and handed him a white business card you have all my numbers there lieutenant tulins as well anything comes up that i should know about you call me forthwith i do not care what time it is or where you are at you call me bosch nodded took the card and put it in his jacket pocket go to it people as i said before let the chips fall where they may he left the room and bosch heard rider whisper yeah right bosch turned and looked at the faces of the new team coming to chastains last you know what hes doing dont you bosch said he thinks we cant work together he thinks well be like those fighting fish that you put in the same bowl and they go nuts trying to get at each other meantime the case is never cleared well its not going to happen anything anybody in heres ever done to me or anyone else forget about it i let it go this case is the thing there are two people in that train that somebody blew away without so much as a second thought were going to find that person thats all i care about now he held chastains eyes until he finally saw a slight nod of agreement bosch nodded back he was sure all the others had seen the exchange he then took out his notebook and opened it to a fresh page he handed it to chastain okay then he said i want everybody to write down their names followed by their home and pager numbers cell phones too if you got em ill make a list up and everybody will get copies i want everybody in communication thats the trouble with these big gang bangs if everybody isnt on the same wavelength something can slip through we dont want that bosch stopped and looked at the others they were all watching him paying attention it seemed that for the moment the natural animosities were relaxed if not forgotten okay he said this is how were going to break this down from here on out chapter one of the men from iad was a latino named raymond fuentes bosch sent him along with edgar to the address on catalina perezs identification cards to notify her next of kin and to handle the questions about her it was most likely the deadend part of the investigation it seemed apparent that elias was the primary target and edgar tried to protest but bosch cut him off the explanation he would share privately with edgar later was that he needed to spread the iad men out in order to give him better control of things so edgar went with fuentes and rider was sent with a second iad man loomis baker to interview eldrige peete at parker center and then bring him back to the scene bosch wanted the train operator at the scene to go over what he had seen and to operate the train as he had before discovering the bodies that left bosch chastain and the last iad man joe dellacroce bosch dispatched dellacroce to parker center as well to draw up a search warrant for eliass office he then told chastain that the two of them would go to eliass home to make the death notification to his next of kin after the group split up bosch walked to the crime scene van and asked hoffman for the keys found on the body of howard elias hoffman looked through the crate he had placed his evidence bags in and came out with a bag containing a ring with more than a dozen keys on it from the front pants pocket right side hoffman said bosch studied the keys for a moment there seemed to be more than enough keys for the lawyers home office and cars he noticed that there was a porsche key on the ring as well as a volvo key he realized that when the investigators finished the current crop of tasks one assignment he would have to make would be to put someone on locating eliass car anything else in the pockets yeah in the left front he had a quarter a quarter costs a quarter to ride angels flight thats probably what that was for bosch nodded and in the inside coat pocket was a letter bosch had forgotten that garwood had mentioned the letter lets see that hoffman looked through his crate again and came up with a plastic evidence bag inside it was an envelope bosch took it from the crime scene tech and studied it without removing it the envelope had been addressed to eliass office by hand there was no return address on the left lower corner the sender had written personal amp confidential bosch tried to read the postmark but the light was bad he wished he still carried a lighter its your neck of the woods harry hoffman said hollywood mailed wednesday he probably got it friday bosch nodded he turned the bag over and looked at the back of the envelope it had been cleanly cut open along the top elias or his secretary had opened it probably at his office before he had put it into his pocket there was no way of knowing if the contents had been examined since anybody open it we didnt i dont know what happened before we got here i understand that the first detectives saw the name on there and then recognized the body but i dont know if they actually looked at the letter bosch was curious about the contents of the envelope but knew it wasnt the right time or place to open it im going to take this too you got it harry let me just get you to sign it out and the keys too bosch waited while hoffman got a chainofevidence form out of his kit he squatted down and put the envelope and keys into his briefcase chastain came over ready to leave the scene you want to drive or you want me to bosch said as he snapped his case closed ive got a slick what have you got i still have a plain jane runs like dogshit but at least i dont stand out like dogshit on the street thats good you got a bubble yes bosch even iad guys have to respond to calls now and then hoffman held a clipboard and pen out to bosch and he signed his initials next to the two pieces of crime scene evidence he was taking with him then you drive they started walking across california plaza to where the cars were parked bosch pulled his pager off his belt and made sure it was running properly the battery light was still green he hadnt missed any pages he looked up at the tall towers surrounding them wondering if they could possibly interfere with a page from his wife but then he remembered the page from lieutenant billets had come through earlier he clipped the pager back to his belt and tried to think about something else following chastains lead they came to a beatup maroon ltd that was at least five years old and about as impressivelooking as a pinto at least bosch thought it isnt painted black and white its unlocked chastain said bosch went to the passenger side door and got in the car he got his cell phone out of his briefcase and called the central dispatch center he asked for a department of motor vehicles run on howard elias and was given the dead mans home address as well as his age driving record and the plate numbers of the porsche and volvo registered in his and his wifes names elias had been fortysix his driving record was clean bosch thought that the lawyer was probably the most cautious driver in the city the last thing elias probably ever wanted to do was draw the attention of an lapd patrol cop it made driving a porsche seem almost a waste baldwin hills he said after closing the phone her name is millie chastain started the engine then plugged the flashing emergency light the bubble into the lighter and put it on the dashboard he drove the car quickly down the deserted streets toward the freeway bosch was silent at first not sure how to break the ice with chastain the two men were natural enemies chastain had investigated bosch on two different occasions both times bosch was grudgingly cleared of any wrongdoing but only after chastain was forced to back off it seemed to bosch that chastain had a hardon for him that felt close to a vendetta the iad detective seemed to take no joy in clearing a fellow cop all he wanted was a scalp i know what you are doing bosch chastain said once they got onto the freeway and started west bosch looked over at him for the first time he considered how physically similar they were dark hair going gray full mustache beneath dark brownblack eyes a lean almost wiry build almost mirror images yet bosch had never considered chastain to be the kind of physical threat that bosch knew he projected himself chastain carried himself differently bosch had always carried himself like a man afraid of being cornered like a man who wouldnt allow himself to be cornered what what am i doing youre thinning us out that way you have better control he waited for bosch to reply but only got silence but eventually if were going to do this thing right you are going to have to trust us after a pause bosch said i know that elias lived on beck street in baldwin hills a small section of uppermiddleclass homes south of the freeway and near la cienega boulevard it was an area known as the black beverly hills a neighborhood where affluent blacks moved when they did not wish to have their wealth take them out of their community as bosch considered this he thought that if there was anything that he could like about elias it was the fact that he didnt take his money and move to brentwood or westwood or the real beverly hills he stayed in the community from which he had risen with little middleofthenight traffic and chastain cruising on the freeway at ninety they got to beck street in less than fifteen minutes the house was a large brick colonial with four white columns holding up a twostory portico it had the feeling of a southern plantation and bosch wondered if it was some kind of statement being made by elias bosch saw no lights from behind any of the windows and the hanging light in the portico was dark as well this didnt sit right with him if this was eliass home why wasnt a light left on for him there was a car in the circular driveway that was neither a porsche nor a volvo it was an old camaro with fresh paint and chromed wheels to the right of the house there was a detached twocar garage but its door was closed chastain pulled into the drive and stopped behind the camaro nice car chastain said tell you what i wouldnt leave a car like that out overnight even in a neighborhood like this too close to the jungle he turned the car off and reached to open his door lets wait a second here bosch said he opened his briefcase got out the phone and called dispatch again he asked for a double check on the address for elias they had the right place he then asked the dispatcher to run the plate on the camaro it came back registered to a martin luther king elias age eighteen bosch thanked the dispatcher and clicked off we got the right place chastain asked looks like it the camaro must be his sons but it doesnt look like anyone was expecting dad to come home tonight bosch opened his door and got out chastain doing the same as they approached the door bosch saw the dull glow of a bell button he pushed it and heard the sharp ringing of a chime inside the quiet house they waited and pushed the bell button two more times before the portico light came on above them and a womans sleepy but alarmed voice came through the door what is it mrs elias bosch said were police we need to talk to you police what for its about your husband maam can we come in i need some identification before i open this door bosch took out his badge wallet and held it up but then noticed there was no peephole turn around the womans voice said on the column bosch and chastain turned and saw the camera mounted on one of the columns bosch walked up to it and held up his badge you see it he said loudly he heard the door open and turned around a woman in a white robe with a silk scarf wrapped around her head looked out at him you dont have to yell she said sorry she stood in the onefoot opening of the door but made no move to invite them in howard is not here what do you want uh can we come in mrs elias we want no you cant come in my house my home no policeman has ever been in here howard wouldnt have it neither will i what do you want has something happened to howard uh yes maam im afraid it would really be better if we oh my god she shrieked you killed him you people finally killed him mrs elias bosch started wishing he had better prepared himself for the assumption he should have known the woman would make we need to sit down with you and again he was cut off but this time it was by an unintelligible animallike sound from deep in the woman its anguish was resonant the woman bowed her head and leaned into the doorjamb bosch thought she might fall and made a move to grab her shoulders the woman recoiled as if he were a monster reaching out to her no no dont you touch me you you murderers killers you killed my howard howard the last word was a fullthroated scream that seemed to echo through the neighborhood bosch looked behind him halfexpecting to see the street lined with onlookers he knew he had to contain the woman get her inside or at least quiet she was moving into a fullfledged wail now meantime chastain just stood there paralyzed by the scene unfolding before him bosch was about to make another attempt to touch the woman when he saw movement from behind her and a young man grabbed hold of her from behind ma what what is it the woman turned and collapsed against the young man martin martin they killed him your father martin elias looked up over his mothers head and his eyes burned right through bosch his mouth formed the horrible oh of shock and pain that bosch had seen too many times before he suddenly realized his mistake he should have made this call with either edgar or rider rider probably she would have been a calming influence her smooth demeanor and the color of her skin would have done more than bosch and chastain combined son chastain said coming out of his inertia we need to settle down a bit here and go inside to talk about this dont you call me son im not your goddamn son mr elias bosch said forcefully everyone including chastain looked at him he then continued in a calmer softer voice martin you need to take care of your mother we need to tell you both what has happened and to ask you a few questions the longer we stand here cursing and yelling the longer it will be before you can take care of your mother he waited a moment the woman turned her face back into her sons chest and began to cry martin then stepped back pulling her with him so that there was room for bosch and chastain to enter for the next fifteen minutes bosch and chastain sat with the mother and son in a nicely furnished living room and detailed what was known of the crime and how the investigation would be handled bosch knew that to them it was like a couple of nazis announcing they would investigate war crimes but he also knew that it was important to go through the routine to do his best to assure the victims family that the investigation would be thorough and aggressive i know what you said about it being cops bosch said in summation at the moment we dont know that it is too early in the investigation to know anything about a motive we are in a gathering phase at this time but soon well move to the sifting phase and any cop who might have had even a remote reason to harm your husband will be looked at i know there will be many in that category you have my word that they will be looked at very closely he waited the mother and son were huddled together on a couch with a cheerful floral pattern the son kept closing his eyes like a child hoping to ward off a punishment he was flagging under the weight of what he had just been told it was finally hitting home that he would not see his father again now we know this is an awful time for you bosch said softly we would like to put off any kind of prolonged questioning so that you have time to yourselves but there are a few questions that would help us right now he waited for an objection but none came he continued the main one is that we cant figure out why mr elias was on angels flight we need to find out where he was he was going to the apartment martin said without opening his eyes what apartment he kept an apartment near the office so he could just stay over on court days or when he was busy getting ready for trial he was going to stay there tonight right hed been staying there all week he had depos the wife said with the police they were coming in after work so he was staying late at the office then he would just go over to the apartment bosch was silent hoping either one of them would add something more about the arrangement but nothing else was said did he call you and tell you he was staying over he asked yes he always called when was this this last time is what i mean earlier today he said hed be working late and needed to get back into it on saturday and sunday you know preparing for the trial on monday he said he would try to be home on sunday for supper so you werent expecting him to be home here tonight thats right millie elias said a note of defiance in her voice as if she had taken the tone of boschs question to mean something else bosch nodded as if to reassure her that he was not insinuating anything he asked the specific address of the apartment and was told it was in a complex called the place just across grand street from the museum of contemporary art bosch took out his notebook and wrote it down then kept the notebook out now he said mrs elias can you remember more specifically when it was you last spoke to your husband it was right before six that is when he calls and tells me otherwise i have to figure out whats for supper and how many im cooking for how about you martin when did you last speak to your father martin opened his eyes i dont know man couple days ago at least but whats this got to do with anything you know who did it somebody with a badge did this thing tears finally began to slide down martins face bosch wished he could be somewhere else anywhere else if it was a cop martin you have my word we will find him he wont get away with it sure martin replied without looking at bosch the man gives us his word but who the hell is the man the statement made bosch pause a moment before continuing a few more questions he finally said did mr elias have an office here at home no the son said he didnt do his work here okay next question in recent days or weeks had he mentioned any specific threat or person who he believed wanted to harm him martin shook his head and said he just always said that it was the cops who would get him someday it was the cops bosch nodded not in agreement but in his understanding of martins belief one last question there was a woman who was killed on angels flight it looks like they were not together her name was catalina perez does that name mean anything to either of you boschs eyes moved from the womans face to her sons both stared blankly and shook their heads okay then he stood up we will leave you alone now but either myself or other detectives will need to speak with you again probably later on today neither the mother nor son reacted mrs elias do you have a spare photo of your husband we could borrow the woman looked up at him her face showing confusion why do you want a picture of howard we may need to show people in the course of the investigation everybody already knows howard what he looks like probably maam but we might need a photo in some cases do you martin she said go get me the albums out of the drawer in the den martin left the room and they waited bosch took a business card from his pocket and put it down on the wroughtironandglass coffee table theres my pager number if you need me or if there is anything else i can do is there a family minister you would like us to call millie elias looked up at him again reverend tuggins over at the ame bosch nodded but immediately wished he hadnt made the offer martin came back into the room with a photo album his mother took it and began to turn through the pages she began to weep silently again at the sight of so many pictures of her husband bosch wished he had put off getting the photo until the followup interview finally she came upon a closeup shot of howard eliass face she seemed to know it would be the best photo for the police she carefully removed it from the plastic sleeve and handed it to bosch will i get that back yes maam ill see that you do bosch nodded and was about to make his way to the door he was wondering if he could just forget about calling reverend tuggins wheres my husband the widow suddenly asked bosch turned back his body is at the coroners office maam i will give them your number and they will call you when it is time for you to make arrangements what about reverend tuggins you want to use our phone uh no maam well contact reverend tuggins from our car we can see ourselves out now on the way to the door bosch glanced at the collection of framed photographs that hung on the wall in the entrance hallway they were photos of howard elias with every notable black community leader in the city as well as many other celebrities and national leaders there he was with jesse jackson with congresswoman maxine waters with eddie murphy there was a shot of elias flanked by mayor richard riordan on one side and city councilman royal sparks on the other bosch knew that sparks had used outrage over police misconduct to forge his rise in city politics he would miss having elias around to keep the fire fanned though bosch also knew that sparks would now use the lawyers murder to any advantage he could bosch wondered how it was that good and noble causes often seemed to bring slick opportunists to the microphones there were also family photos several depicted elias and his wife at social functions there were shots of elias and his son one of them on a boat both holding up a black marlin and smiling another photo showed them at a firing range posing on either side of a paper target with several holes shot through it the target depicted daryl gates a former police chief whom elias had sued numerous times bosch remembered that the targets created by a local artist were popular toward the end of gatess tumultuous stewardship of the department bosch leaned forward to study the photo and see if he could identify the weapons elias and his son held but the photo was too small chastain pointed to one of the photos which showed elias and the chief of police at some formal affair supposed adversaries smiling at the camera they look cozy he whispered bosch just nodded and went out through the door chastain pulled the car out of the driveway and headed down out of the hills and back to the freeway they were silent both absorbing the misery they had just brought to a family and how they had received the blame for it they always shoot the messenger bosch said i think im glad i dont work homicide chastain replied i can deal with cops being pissed at me but that that was bullshit they call it the dirty work nextofkin notification they ought to call it something fucking people were trying to find out who killed the guy and theyre saying it was us you believe that shit i didnt take it literally chastain people in that position are entitled to a little slack theyre hurting they say things thats all yeah youll see wait until you see that kid on the six oclock news i know the type you wont have much sympathy then where are we going anyway back to the scene go to his apartment first you know dellacroces pager number not offhand no look at your list bosch opened his notebook and looked up the pager number dellacroce had written down he punched the number into his phone and made the page what about tuggins chastain asked you call him you give him the head start on getting the south end ready to rock and roll i know im thinking bosch had been thinking about that decision since the moment millie elias had mentioned the name preston tuggins as with many minority communities pastors carried as much weight as politicians when it came to shaping that communitys response to a social cultural or political cause or event in the case of preston tuggins he carried even more he headed a group of associated ministers and together they were a force a major mediasavvy force that could hold the whole community in check or unleash it like an earthquake preston tuggins had to be handled with utmost care bosch dug through his pocket and pulled out the card irving had given him earlier he was about to call one of the numbers on it when the phone rang in his hand it was dellacroce bosch gave him the address of eliass apartment at the place and told him to draw up an additional search warrant dellacroce cursed because he had already wakened a judge to fax him the office search warrant he would now have to do it again welcome to homicide bosch said as he clicked off what chastain said nothing just bullshit bosch punched in irvings number the deputy chief answered after one ring giving his full name and rank it seemed odd to bosch that irving seemed fully alert as if he had not been asleep chief its bosch you said to call if no problem detective what is it we just made notification to eliass wife and son uh she wanted me to call her minister i do not see the problem the minister is preston tuggins and i thought maybe somebody a little further up the ladder might be better making i understand it was good thinking i will have it taken care of i think perhaps the chief will want to handle that i was just about to call him anyway anything else not at this time thank you detective irving hung up chastain asked what he said and bosch told him this case chastain said i have a feeling things are going to get hairy say that again chastain was about to say something else but boschs pager sounded he checked the number again it wasnt a call from home but grace billetss second page he had forgotten to call her earlier he called now and the lieutenant answered after one ring i wondered if you were going to call me back sorry i sort of got tied up then i forgot so whats going on irving wouldnt tell me who was dead just that rhd and central couldnt handle it howard elias oh shit harry im sorry its you its okay well make out everybody will be watching you and if its a cop its a nowin situation do you get any sense from irving does he want to go at it balls to the wall mixed signals you cant talk freely right well im getting mixed signals here too irving told me to take your team off the rotation but he said it would only be until friday then im supposed to talk to him about it now that i know who is dead i think the translation of that is that you have till then before he probably ships you back to hollywood and you have to take howard elias back here with you and work it when you can bosch nodded but didnt say anything it went with the other moves irving had made the deputy chief had created a large team to work the case but it looked as though he was only giving them a week to work it fulltime maybe he hoped that the media glare would drop off to a more manageable level by then and the case could eventually disappear into the unsolved files but bosch thought irving was kidding himself if he thought that he and billets talked for a few minutes more before billets finally signed off with a warning watch yourself harry if a cop did this one of those rhd guys what just be careful i will he closed the phone and looked out the windshield they were almost to the transition they would be back at california plaza soon your lieutenant chastain asked yeah she just wanted to know what was going on so whats the deal with her and rider they still munching each others pie on the side its none of my business chastain and none of yours just asking they rode in silence for a while bosch was annoyed by chastains question he knew it was the iad detectives way of reminding bosch that he knew secrets that he might be out of his element when it came to straight homicide investigation but he knew secrets about cops and should not be taken lightly bosch wished he hadnt made the call to billets while chastain was in the car chastain seemed to sense his misstep and broke the silence by trying some harmless banter tell me about this hardboiled eggs caper i keep hearing people talk about he said it was nothing just a case i missed the story in the paper i guess just a piece of luck chastain like we could use on this case well tell me i want to know especially now that were partnering up bosch i like stories about luck maybe it will rub off it was just a routine call out on a suicide patrol called us to come out and sign off on it started when a mother got worried about her daughter because she hadnt shown up at the airport up in portland she was supposed to fly up there for a wedding or something and never showed up the family was left waiting at the airport anyway the mother called up and asked for a driveby check of the daughters apartment a little place over on franklin near la brea so a blue suit went by got the manager to let him in and they found her she had been dead a couple of days since the morning she was supposed to have flown up to portland what did she do it was made to look like she took some pills and then cut her wrists in the bathtub patrol said suicide thats the way it was supposed to look there was a note it was torn out of a notebook and it said things about life not being what she expected and about being lonely all the time and stuff it was kind of a ramble very sad actually so howd you figure it out well we were edgar was with me rider had court we were about to close it out we had looked around the place and found nothing really wrong except for the note i couldnt find the notebook that the page had been torn out of and that didnt sit right i mean it didnt mean she didnt kill herself but it was a loose end you know a what is wrong with this picture sort of thing okay so you thought somebody was in there and took the notebook maybe i didnt know what to think i told edgar to take another look around and this time we switched and searched through things the other guy had searched the first time and you found something edgar had missed he didnt miss it it just didnt register with him it did with me what was it already in her refrigerator there was a shelf for the eggs you know like little indentations that you sit the eggs in right well i noticed on some of the eggs she had written a date all the same date it was the same day she was flying up to portland bosch looked over at chastain to see if there was a reaction the iad man had a confused look on his face he didnt get it they were hardboiled eggs the ones with dates on them had been hardboiled i took one over to the sink and cracked it it was hardboiled okay he still didnt get it the date on the eggs was probably the date she had boiled them bosch said you know so she could tell the boiled ones from the others and shed know how old they were and it just hit me then you dont boil a bunch of eggs so theyre ready for when you want them and then go kill yourself i mean whats the point so it was a hunch more than that but you just knew homicide it changed things we started to look at things differently we began a homicide investigation it took a few days but we got it friends told us about some guy who was giving her trouble harassing her stalking her because she turned him down on a date we asked around the apartment and we started looking at the apartment manager shit i shoulda guessed it was him we talked to him and he fucked up just enough for us to convince a judge to sign a search warrant in his place we found the notebook that the supposed suicide note had been torn from it was like a diary where she wrote down her thoughts and things this guy found a page where she was talking about life being bad and knew he could use it as a suicide note we found other stuff that was hers whyd he keep the stuff because people are stupid thats why chastain you want clever killers watch tv he kept the stuff because he never thought wed think it wasnt a suicide and because he was in the notebook she wrote about him stalking her about how she was sort of flattered and scared of him at the same time he probably got off on reading it he kept it whens the trial couple months sounds like a slam dunk yeah well see so was oj what did he do drug her somehow then put her in the tub and cut her he was letting himself in her apartment when she was out there was stuff in the diary about her thinking someone had been creeping her place she was a runner did three miles a day we think that was when he liked to go in she had prescription painkillers in the medicine cabinet she got hurt playing racquetball a couple years before we think he took the pills on one of his visits and dissolved them in orange juice the next time he went in he poured it into the juice bottle in her fridge he knew her habits knew that after jogging she liked to sit on the steps out front drink her juice and cool down she may have realized she had been drugged and looked around for help it was him who came he took her back inside he rape her first bosch shook his head he probably tried but he couldnt get it up they drove in silence for a few moments youre cool bosch chastain said nothing gets by you yeah i wish chapter chastain parked the car in the passenger loading zone in front of the modern highrise building called the place before they were out of the car the night doorman came through the glass entrance to either greet them or tell them to move bosch got out and explained that howard elias had been murdered less than a block away and that they needed to check his apartment to make sure there were no additional victims or someone needing help the doorman said no problem but wanted to go along bosch told him in a tone that invited no debate to wait in the lobby for other officers who would be arriving howard eliass apartment was on the twentieth floor the elevator moved quickly but the silence between bosch and chastain made the trip seem longer they found their way to e and bosch knocked on the door and rang the doorbell on the wall next to it after getting no response bosch stooped and opened his briefcase on the floor then took the keys out of the evidence bag hoffman had given him earlier you think we ought to wait on the warrant chastain asked bosch looked up at him as he closed the briefcase and snapped the locks no that was a line of bullshit you gave the doorman that people maybe needed help bosch stood up and started trying keys in the doors two locks remember what you said before about me eventually having to trust you this is where i start to trust you chastain i dont have the time to wait on a warrant im going in a homicide case is like a shark its gotta keep moving or it drowns he turned the first lock you and your fucking fish first fighting fish now a shark yeah you keep sticking around chastain you might even learn how to catch something just as he said the line he turned the second lock he looked at chastain and winked then opened the door they entered a mediumsized living room with expensive leather furnishings cherrywood bookcases and windows and a balcony with an expansive southern view across downtown and the civic center the place was neatly kept except for sections of friday mornings times spread across the black leather couch and an empty coffee mug on the glasstopped coffee table hello bosch called out just to be sure the place was empty police anyone home no answer bosch put his briefcase down on the dining room table opened it and took a pair of latex gloves out of a cardboard box he asked chastain if he wanted a pair but the iad man declined im not going to be touching anything they separated and began moving through the apartment on a quick initial survey the rest of the place was as neat as the living room it was a twobedroom and had a master suite with its own balcony facing west it was a clear night bosch could see all the way to century city past those towers the lights dropped off in santa monica to the sea chastain came into the bedroom behind him no home office he said the second bedroom looks like a guest room maybe for stashing witnesses okay bosch scanned the contents of the top of the bureau there were no photos or anything of a strong personal nature same with the small tables on either side of the bed it looked like a hotel room and in a way it was if elias only used it for overnight stays while readying cases for court the bed was made and this stood out to bosch elias was in the middle of preparations for a major trial working day and night yet he had stopped to make his bed that morning when supposedly it would just be he returning at the end of the day no way bosch thought either he made the bed because there would be someone else in the apartment or someone else made the bed bosch ruled out a maid because a maid would have picked up the strewn newspaper and the empty coffee cup in the living room no it was elias who had made the bed or someone who was with him it was gut instinct based on his long years of delving into human habits but at that moment bosch felt reasonably sure that there now was another woman in the mix he opened the drawer of the bed table where a phone sat and found a personal phone book he opened it and flipped through the pages there were many names he recognized most were lawyers bosch had heard about or even knew he stopped when he came across one name carla entrenkin she too was an attorney specializing in civil rights cases or had been until a year earlier when the police commission appointed her inspector general of the los angeles police department he noted that elias had her office and home number listed the home number was in darker seemingly more recent ink it looked to bosch as though the home number had been added well after the business number had been recorded in the book whaddaya got chastain said nothing bosch answered just a bunch of lawyers he closed the phone book as chastain stepped over to look he tossed it back in the drawer and closed it better leave it for the warrant he said they conducted a casual search of the rest of the apartment for the next twenty minutes looking in drawers and closets under beds and couch cushions but not disturbing anything they found at one point chastain called out from the bathroom off the master bedroom got two toothbrushes here okay bosch was in the living room studying the books on shelves he saw one he had read years before yesterday will make you cry by chester himes he felt chastains presence and turned around chastain stood in the hallway leading to the bedrooms he was holding a box of condoms up for bosch to see these were hidden in the back of a shelf under the sink bosch didnt respond he just nodded in the kitchen there was a wallmounted telephone with an answering machine there was a flashing light on it and the digital display showed there was one message waiting to be played bosch pushed the playback button it was a womans voice on the message hey its me i thought you were going to call me i hope you didnt fall asleep on me that was it after the message the machine reported that the call had come in at am elias was already dead by then chastain who had come into the kitchen from the living room when he heard the voice just looked at bosch and hiked his shoulders after the message was played bosch played it again doesnt sound like the wife to me bosch said sounds white to me chastain said bosch thought he was right he played the message one more time this time concentrating on the tone of the womans voice there was a clear sense of intimacy in the voice the time of the call and the womans assumption that elias would know her voice supported this conclusion as well condoms hidden in the bathroom two toothbrushes mystery woman on the phone chastain said sounds like we got a girlfriend in the works that could make things interesting maybe bosch said somebody made the bed this morning any female stuff in the medicine cabinet nothing chastain went back to the living room after bosch was finished in the kitchen he felt he had seen enough for the time being and slid open the glass door leading from the living room to the balcony he leaned on the iron railing and checked his watch it was he then pulled the pager off his belt to make sure he hadnt turned it off by mistake the pager was on the battery not dead eleanor had not tried to reach him he heard chastain come out onto the balcony behind him bosch spoke without turning to look at him did you know him chastain who elias yeah sort of how ive worked cases he later went to court on i got subpoenaed and deposed plus the bradbury hes got his office there weve got offices there id see him every now and then but if youre asking if i played golf with the guy the answer is no i didnt know him like that the guy made a living suing cops when he got into court he always seemed to have real good information inside stuff some say better stuff than he should have had access to through legal discovery some say he mightve had sources inside i wasnt a snitch for howard elias bosch chastain said his voice tight and i dont know anyone in iad who was we investigate cops i investigate cops sometimes they deserve it and sometimes it turns out they dont you know as well as i do that there has to be somebody to police the police but snitching to the likes of howard elias and his bunch thats the lowest of the low bosch so fuck you very much for asking bosch looked at him now studying the way the anger was moving into his dark eyes just asking he said had to know who i am dealing with he looked back out across the city and then down to the plaza below he saw kiz rider and loomis baker crossing toward angels flight with a man bosch assumed was eldrige peete the train operator all right you asked chastain said can we get on with it now sure they were silent during the elevator ride down it wasnt until they were in the lobby that bosch spoke you go on ahead he said im gonna see if theres a can around here tell the others ill be right there sure the doorman had overheard the exchange from his little lobby desk and told bosch the rest room was around the corner behind the elevators bosch headed that way in the rest room bosch put his briefcase on the sink counter and got his phone out he called his house first when the machine picked up he punched in the code to play all new messages only his own message played back to him eleanor hadnt got it shit he said as he hung up he then called information and got the number for the hollywood park poker room the last time eleanor had not come home she had told him she was playing cards there he called the number and asked for the security office a man identifying himself as mr jardine answered and bosch gave his name and badge number jardine asked him to spell his name and give the number again he was obviously writing it down are you in the video room sure am what can i do for you im looking for somebody and there is a good chance she is at one of your tables right now i was wondering if you could look at the tubes for me whats she look like bosch described his wife but could not give any description on clothes because he had not checked the closets at the house he then waited two minutes while jardine apparently studied the video screens connected to the surveillance cameras in the poker room uh if shes here im not seeing her jardine finally said we dont have very many women in here this time of night and she doesnt match the ones weve got i mean she could have been in here earlier maybe one or two oclock but not now okay thanks hey you got a number ill take a walk around the place call you back if i see anything ill give you my pager but if you see her dont approach her just give me a page will do after giving the man his pager number and hanging up bosch thought about the card clubs in gardena and commerce but decided not to call if eleanor was going to stay local she would have gone to hollywood park if she didnt go there shed go to vegas or maybe the indian place in the desert near palm springs he tried not to think about that and focused his mind back on the case bosch next called the district attorneys night switchboard after getting the number out of his phone book he asked to be connected to the oncall prosecutor and was eventually connected to a sleepy attorney named janis langwiser she happened to be the same prosecutor who had filed charges in the socalled hardboiled eggs case she had recently moved over from the city attorneys office and it had been the first time bosch had worked with her he had enjoyed her sense of humor and enthusiasm for her job dont tell me she said youve got a scrambled eggs case this time or better yet the western omelet case not quite i hate to pull you out of bed but were going to need somebody to come out and give us a little guidance on a search well be doing pretty soon whos dead and wheres the search dead is howard elias esquire and the search is going to be in his office she whistled into the phone and bosch had to hold it away from his ear wow she said now fully alert this is going to be well something tell me the general details he did and when he was finished langwiser who lived thirty miles north in valencia agreed to meet the search team at the bradbury in one hour until then take things very carefully detective bosch and dont go into the office until i am there will do it was a little thing but he liked her calling him by his title it was not because she was a good deal younger than he was it was because so often prosecutors treated him and other cops without respect as simply tools for them to use whatever way they wanted in prosecuting a case he was sure janis langwiser would be no different as she became more seasoned and cynical but at least for now she outwardly showed him small nuances of respect bosch disconnected and was about to put the phone away when he thought of something else he called information again and asked for the home listing for carla entrenkin he was connected to a recording that told him the number was unlisted at the customers request it was what he had expected to hear as he crossed grand street and california plaza to angels flight bosch again tried not to think of eleanor and where she might be but it was hard it hurt his heart when he thought about her being out there somewhere alone searching for something he obviously couldnt give her he was beginning to feel his marriage would be doomed if he didnt soon figure out what it was she needed when they had married a year ago he had found a feeling of contentment and peace that he had never experienced before for the first time in his life he felt there was someone to sacrifice for everything if needed but he had come to the point where he was acknowledging to himself that it was not the same for her she was not content or complete and it made him feel awful and guilty and a small bit relieved all at the same time again he tried to concentrate on other things on the case he knew he needed to put eleanor aside for the time being he started thinking about the voice on the phone the condoms hidden in the bathroom cabinet and the bed that had been neatly made he thought about how howard elias could come to have the unlisted home telephone number of carla entrenkin in the drawer next to his bed chapter rider was standing next to a tall black man with graying hair just outside the door to the angels flight station house they were sharing a smile about something when bosch walked up mr peete this is harry bosch rider said hes in charge of this investigation peete shook his hand worst thing i ever saw in mlife worst thing im sorry you had to witness this sir but im glad you are willing to help us out why dont you go in and have a seat inside well be with you in a few minutes when peete was inside bosch looked at rider he didnt have to speak same as garwood said he didnt hear anything and he didnt see a lot until the car came up and he went to lock it up for the night he didnt see anybody hanging around down there as if they were waiting for anyone either any chance hes just playing deaf and dumb my gut says no i think hes legit he didnt see it or hear it go down he touch the bodies no you mean the watch and wallet i doubt it was him bosch nodded mind if i ask him a couple followups be my guest bosch walked into the little office and rider followed eldrige peete was sitting at the lunch table holding the phone to his ear i gotta go hon he said when he saw bosch the policeman wants to talk to me he hung up my wife shes wondering when im coming home bosch nodded mr peete did you go into the train after you saw the bodies in there no sir uh they looked pretty dead to me i saw a lot of blood i thought i should leave it all alone for the authorities did you recognize either of those people well the man i couldnt rightly see but i thought it might be mr elias just on account of the nice suit and how he looked now the woman i recognized her too i mean i didnt know her name or nothin but she got on the train a few minutes before and went on down you mean she went down first yes sir she went down she also a regular like mr elias cept she ride maybe only one time a week on fridays like last night mr elias he ride more why do you think she went down the hill but didnt get off the train peete stared at him blankly as if surprised by such an easy question cause she got shot bosch almost laughed but kept it to himself he wasnt being clear enough with the witness no i mean before she was shot it seems as though she never got up as if she was on the bench and had been waiting to go back up when the shooter arrived behind the other passenger who was getting on i surely dont know what she was doing when exactly did she go down the ride right before i sent olivet down and that lady was on it this was five six minutes to leven i sent olivet down and i just let her sit down there till leven and then i brought her up you know last ride when she came up those people were dead on there peetes apparent ascribing of the female gender to the train was confusing to bosch he tried to make it clear so you sent olivet down with the woman on it then five six minutes later she is still on the train car when you bring it up is that right right and during that five or six minutes that olivet was sitting down there you werent looking down there no i was counting the money outta the register then when it was leven clock i went out and locked up sinai then i brought olivet on up thats when i found them they were dead but you didnt hear anything from down there no shots no like i told the lady miss kizmin i wear earplugs on account of the noise underneath the station also i was countin the money its mostly all quarters i run em through the machine he pointed to a stainlesssteel change counter next to the cash register it looked like the machine put the quarters into paper rolls containing ten dollars he then stamped his foot on the wood floor indicating the machinery below bosch nodded that he understood tell me about the woman you said she was a regular yeah once a week fridays like maybe she have a little job up here in the apartments cleanin or somethin the bus runs down there on hill street i think she caught it down there and what about howard elias he a regular too two three times a week all different times sometimes late like last night one time i was locking up and he was down there callin up to me i made a ception i brought him up on sinai i was bein nice at christmastime he gave me a little envelope he was a nice man membering me like that was he always alone when he rode the train the old man folded his arms and thought about this for a moment mostly i think you remember him ever being with somebody else i think one or two times i remember him bein with somebody i cant rightly remember who it was was it a man or woman i dont know i think it mighta been a lady but im not gettin a picture know what i mean bosch nodded and thought about things he looked at rider and raised his eyebrows she shook her head she had nothing more to ask before you go mr peete can you turn everything on and let us ride down sure whatever you and miss kizmin need he looked at rider and bowed his head with a smile thank you bosch said then lets do it peete moved to the computer keyboard and began typing in a command immediately the floor began to vibrate and there was a lowpitched grinding sound peete turned to them anytime he said above the din bosch waved and headed out to the train car chastain and baker the iad man who had been paired with kizmin rider were standing at the guardrail looking down the track were going down bosch called over you guys coming without a word they fell in behind rider and the four detectives stepped onto the train car called olivet the bodies had long been removed and the evidence technicians cleared out but the spilt blood was still on the wood floor and the bench where catalina perez had sat bosch moved down the steps careful to avoid stepping in the maroon pool that had leaked from howard eliass body he took a seat on the right side the others sat on benches further up the train away from where the bodies had fallen bosch looked up at the station house window and waved immediately the car jerked and began its descent and immediately bosch again recalled riding the train as a kid the seat was just as uncomfortable as he remembered it bosch didnt look at the others as they rode he kept looking out the lower door and at the track as it went underneath the car the ride lasted no longer than a minute at the bottom he was the first off he turned and looked back up the tracks he could see peetes head silhouetted in the station house window by the overhead light inside bosch did not push through the turnstile as he could see black fingerprint powder on it and didnt want to get it on his suit the department did not consider the powder a hazard of the job and would not repay a dry cleaning bill if he got it on himself he pointed the powder out to the others and climbed over the turnstile he scanned the ground on the off chance something would catch his eye but there was nothing unusual he was confident that the area had already been gone over by the rhd detectives anyway bosch had primarily come down to get a firsthand look and feel for the place to the left of the archway was a concrete staircase for when the train wasnt running or for those who were afraid to ride the inclined railroad the stairs were also popular with weekend fitness enthusiasts who ran up and down them bosch had read a story about it a year or so back in the times next to the stairs a lighted bus stop had been cut into the steep hill there was a fiberglass sunshade over a doublelength bench the side partitions were used to advertise films on the one bosch could see there was an ad for an eastwood picture called blood work the movie was based on a true story about a former fbi agent bosch was acquainted with bosch thought about whether the gunman could have waited in the bus shelter for elias to walk up to the angels flight turnstile he decided against it the shelter was lit by an overhead light elias would have had a good view of whoever sat in there as he approached the train since bosch thought it was likely that elias knew his killer he didnt think the shooter would have waited out in the open like that he looked at the other side of the archway where there was a heavily landscaped tenyard strip between the train entrance and a small office building bushes crowded thickly around an acacia tree bosch wished he hadnt left his briefcase up in the station house anybody bring a flashlight he asked rider reached into her purse and brought out a small penlight bosch took it and headed into the bushes putting the light on the ground and studying his pathway in he found no obvious sign that the killer had waited in here there was trash and other debris scattered in behind the bushes but none of it appeared to be fresh it looked like a place where homeless people had stopped to look through trash bags they had picked up from somewhere else rider made her way into the bushes find anything nothing good im just trying to figure out where this guy would have hidden from elias this could have been as good a spot as any elias wouldnt see him hed come out after elias walked by move up behind him at the train car maybe he didnt need to hide maybe they walked here together bosch looked at her and nodded maybe as good as anything im coming up with in here what about the bus bench too open too well lighted if it was someone elias had reason to fear hedve seen him what about a disguise he could have sat in the bus stop in a disguise theres that youve already considered all of this but you let me go on talking saying things you already know he didnt say anything he handed the flashlight back to rider and headed out of the bushes he looked over at the bus stop once more and felt sure he was right in his thinking the bus stop hadnt been used rider came up next to him and followed his gaze hey did you know terry mccaleb over at the bureau she asked yeah we worked a case once why you know him not really but ive seen him on tv he doesnt look like clint eastwood if you ask me yeah not really bosch saw chastain and baker had crossed the street and were standing in the hollow created by the closed rollup doors at the entrance of the huge grand central market they were looking at something on the ground bosch and rider walked over got something rider asked maybe maybe not chastain said he pointed to the dirty worn tiles at his feet cigarette butts baker said five of them same brand means somebody was waiting here a while could have been a homeless rider said maybe baker replied couldve been our shooter bosch wasnt that impressed any of you smokers he asked why baker asked because then youd see what this probably is what is it you see when you go in the front doors at parker center chastain and baker looked puzzled cops baker tried yeah but cops doing what smoking rider said right no smoking in public buildings anymore so the smokers gather round the front doors this market is a public facility he pointed at the cigarette butts crushed on the tiles it doesnt necessarily mean somebody was waiting there a long time i think it means somebody in the market came out five times during the day for smokes baker nodded but chastain refused to acknowledge the deduction still could be our guy he said where else did he wait the bushes over there he could have or like kiz said maybe he didnt wait maybe he walked right up to the train with elias maybe elias thought he was with a friend bosch reached into his jacket pocket and took out a plastic evidence bag he handed it to chastain or maybe im all wrong and youre all right bag em and tag em chastain make sure they get to the lab a few minutes later bosch was finished with his survey of the lower crime scene he got on the train picked up his briefcase where he had left it and moved up the stairs to one of the benches near the upper door he sat down heavily almost dropping onto the hard bench he was beginning to feel fatigue take over and wished he had gotten some sleep before irvings call had come the excitement and adrenaline that accompany a new case caused a false high that always wore off quickly he wished he could have a smoke and then maybe a quick nap but only one of the two was possible at the moment and he would have to find an allnight market to get the smokes again he decided against it for some reason he felt that his nicotine fast had become part of his vigil for eleanor he thought that if he smoked all would be lost that he would never hear from her again what are you thinking harry he looked up rider was in the doorway of the train coming aboard nothing everything were really just getting started on this theres a lot to do no rest for the weary say that again his pager sounded and he grabbed it off his belt with the urgency of a man who has had one go off in a movie theater he recognized the number on the display but couldnt remember where he had seen it before he took the phone out of his briefcase and punched it in it was the home of deputy chief irvin irving i spoke with the chief he said he will handle reverend tuggins he is not to be your concern irving put a sneer into the word reverend okay he isnt so where are we were still at the scene just finishing up we need to canvass the building over here for witnesses then well clear out elias kept an apartment downtown that was where he was headed we need to search that and his office as soon as the search warrants are signed what about next of kin on the woman perez should be done by now too tell me how it went at the elias home since irving had not asked before bosch assumed he was asking now because the chief of police wanted to know bosch quickly went over what had happened and irving asked several questions about the reaction of eliass wife and son bosch could tell he asked them from the standpoint of public relations management he knew that just as with preston tuggins the way in which eliass family reacted to his murder would have a direct bearing on how the community reacted so it does not at this time sound as though we can enlist the widow or the son in helping us contain things correct as of now thats correct but once they get over the initial shock maybe you also might want to talk to the chief about calling the widow personally i saw his picture on the wall in the house with elias if hes talking to tuggins maybe he could also talk to the widow about helping us out maybe irving switched gears and told bosch that his offices conference room on the sixth floor of parker center was ready for the investigators he said that the room was unlocked at the moment but in the morning bosch would be given keys once the investigators moved in the room was to remain locked at all times he said that he would be in by ten and was looking forward to a more expanded rundown of the investigation at the team meeting sure thing chief bosch said we should be in from the canvass and the searches by then make sure you are i will be waiting right bosch was about to disconnect when he heard irvings voice excuse me chief one other matter i felt because of the identity of one of the victims in this case that it was incumbent upon me to notify the inspector general she seemed how do i put this she seemed acutely interested in the case when i explained the facts we had at that time using the word acutely is probably an understatement carla entrenkin bosch almost cursed out loud but held it back the inspector general was a new entity in the department a citizen appointed by the police commission as an autonomous civilian overseer with ultimate authority to investigate or oversee investigations it was a further politicizing of the department the inspector general answered to the police commission which answered to the city council and the mayor and there were other reasons bosch almost cursed as well finding entrenkins name and private number in eliass phone book bothered him it opened up a whole set of possibilities and complications is she coming out here to the scene he asked i think not irving said i waited to call so that i could say the scene was clearing i saved you that headache but do not be surprised if you hear directly from her in the daylight can she do that i mean talk to me without going through you shes a civilian unfortunately she can do whatever she wants to that is how the police commission set up the job so what it means is that this investigation wherever it goes it better be seamless detective bosch if it is not we will be hearing from carla entrenkin about it i understand good then all we need is an arrest and all will be fine sure chief irving disconnected without acknowledging bosch looked up chastain and baker were stepping onto the train theres only one thing worse than having the iad tagging along on this he whispered to rider thats the inspector general watching over our shoulders rider looked at him youre kidding carla imthinkin is on this bosch almost smiled at riders use of the nickname bestowed on entrenkin by an editorialist in the police unions thin blue line newsletter she was called carla imthinkin because of her tendency toward slow and deliberate speech whenever addressing the police commission and criticizing the actions or members of the department bosch would have smiled but the addition of the inspector general to the case was too serious nope he said now we got her too chapter at the top of the hill they found edgar and fuentes had returned from notifying catalina perezs family of her death and joe dellacroce had returned from parker center with completed and signed search warrants courtapproved searches were not always needed for the home and business of the victim of a homicide but it made good sense to get warrants in highprofile cases such cases attracted highprofile attorneys if they eventually resulted in arrest these attorneys invariably created their high profiles by being thorough and good at what they did they exploited mistakes took the frayed seams and loose ends of cases and ripped open huge holes often big enough for their clients to escape through bosch was already thinking that far ahead he knew he had to be very careful additionally he believed a warrant was particularly necessary to search eliass office there would be numerous files on police officers and cases pending against the department these cases would most likely proceed after being taken on by new attorneys and bosch needed to balance the preservation of attorneyclient privacy with the need to investigate the killing of howard elias the investigators would no doubt need to proceed carefully while handling these files it was the reason he had called the district attorneys office and asked janis langwiser to come to the scene bosch approached edgar first taking him by the arm and nudging him over to the guardrail overlooking the steep dropoff to hill street they were out of earshot of the others howd it go it went the way they all go about a million other places id rather be than watching the guy get the news know what i mean yeah i know you just tell him or did you ask him some questions we asked but we didnt get very many answers the guy said his wife was a housecleaner and she had a gig somewhere over here she took the bus over he couldnt give an address said his wife kept all of that stuff in a little notebook she carried bosch thought for a moment he didnt remember any notebook in the evidence inventory balancing his briefcase on the guardrail he opened it and took out the clipboard on which he had the accumulated paperwork from the crime scene on top was the yellow copy of the inventory hoffman had given him before he had left it listed victim s belongings but there was no notebook well well have to check with him again later on we didnt get any notebook well send fuentes back the husband didnt speak english all right anything else no we did the usual checklist any enemies any problems anybody giving her trouble anybody stalking her so on and so forth nada the husband said she wasnt worried about anything okay what about him he looked legit like he got hit in the face with the big frying pan called bad luck you know yeah i know hit hard and there was as much surprise there as anything else okay bosch looked around to make sure they were not being overheard he spoke low to edgar were going to split up now and go with the searches i want you to take the apartment elias kept over at the place i was so thats where he was going looks like it i was just up there with chastain did a driveby i want you to take your time this time i also want you to start in his bedroom go to the bed and take the phone book out of the top drawer of the table with the phone on it bag it and seal it so nobody can look at it until we get everything back to the office sure how come ill tell you later just get to it before anybody else also take the tape from the phone machine in the kitchen theres a message we want to keep right okay then bosch stepped away from the guardrail and approached dellacroce any problems with the paper not really except for waking the judge twice which judge john houghton hes okay well it didnt sound like he appreciated having to do everything twice what did he say about the office had me add in a line about preserving the sanctity of attorneyclient privilege thats it let me see dellacroce took the search warrants out of the inside pocket of his suit jacket and handed bosch the one for the office at the bradbury bosch scanned through the stock wording on the first page of the declaration and got to the part dellacroce had talked about it looked okay to him the judge was still allowing the search of the office and the files but was simply saying that any privileged information gleaned from the files must be germane to the murder investigation what hes saying is that we cant go through the files and turn what we get over to the city attorneys office to help defend those cases dellacroce said nothing goes outside our investigation i can live with that bosch said he called everybody into a huddle he noticed fuentes was smoking and tried not to think about his own desire for a cigarette okay weve got the search warrants he said this is how were gonna split it up edgar fuentes and baker you three take the apartment i want edgar on lead the rest of us will go to the office you guys on the apartment i also want you to arrange for interviews of all the doormen in the building all shifts we need to find out as much about this guys routines and personal life as we can were thinking there may be a girlfriend somewhere we need to find out who that was also on the key chain there is a key to a porsche and a volvo my guess is elias drove the porsche and its probably in the parking garage at the apartment building i want you to take a look at that too the warrants dont specify a car dellacroce protested nobody told me about a car when i was sent to work up the warrants okay then just find the car check it out through the windows and well get a search warrant if you see something and think it is necessary bosch was looking at edgar as he said this last part edgar almost imperceptibly nodded meaning that he understood that bosch was telling him to find the car and to simply open it and search it if anything of value to the investigation was found then he would simply back out get a warrant and they would act as if they had never been in the car in the first place it was standard practice bosch looked at his watch and wrapped it up okay its fivethirty now we should be done with the searches by eightthirty max take anything that even looks of interest and well sift through it all later chief irving has set up the command post for this investigation in the conference room next to his office at parker but before we go back there i want to meet everybody right back here at eightthirty he pointed up to the tall apartment building overlooking angels flight well canvass this building then i dont want to wait until later have people get out for the day before we can get to them what about the meeting with deputy chief irving fuentes asked thats set for ten we should make it if we dont dont worry about it ill take the meeting and you people will proceed the case comes first hell go along with that hey harry edgar said if we get done before eightthirty all right if we get breakfast yes its all right but i dont want to miss anything do not hurry the search just so you can get pancakes rider smiled tell you what bosch said ill make sure we have doughnuts here at eightthirty if you can just wait until then okay so lets do it bosch took out the key ring they had taken from the body of howard elias he removed the keys to the apartment and the porsche key and gave them to edgar he noted that there were still several keys on the ring that were unaccounted for at least two or three would be to the office and another two or three for his home in baldwin hills that still left four keys and bosch thought about the voice he had heard on the answering machine maybe elias had keys to a lovers home he put the keys back in his pocket and told rider and dellacroce to drive cars down the hill and over to the bradbury he said he and chastain would take the train down and walk over making a check of the sidewalks elias would have covered between his office building and the lower angels flight terminus as the detectives broke up and headed toward their assignments bosch went to the station window and looked in on eldrige peete he was sitting on the chair by the cash register earplugs in place and his eyes closed bosch rapped gently on the window but the train operator was startled anyway mr peete i want you to send us down once more and then you can close up lock up and go home to your wife okay whatever you say bosch nodded and turned to head to the train then he stopped and looked back at peete theres a lot of blood do you have someone who is going to clean up the inside of the train before it opens tomorrow dont worry ill get that ive got a mop and bucket back here in the closet i called my supervisor before you got here he said i gotta clean olivet up so shes ready to go in the morning we start at eight satadays bosch nodded okay mr peete sorry you have to do that i like to keep the cars clean also down at the bottom they left fingerprint dust all over the turnstile its nasty stuff if you get that on your clothes ill get that too bosch nodded well thanks for your help tonight we appreciate it tonight hell its morning aready peete smiled i guess youre right good morning mr peete yeah not if you ask them two that were on the train bosch started away and then once more came back to the man one last thing this is going to be a big story in the papers and on tv im not telling you what to do but you might want to think about taking your phone off the hook mr peete and maybe not answering your door i gotcha good im gonna sleep all day anyway bosch nodded to him one last time and got on the train chastain was already on one of the benches near the door bosch walked past him and again went down the steps to the end where howard eliass body had fallen he was careful again not to step in the pooled and coagulated blood as soon as he sat down the train began its descent bosch looked out the window and saw the gray light of dawn around the edges of the tall office buildings to the east he slumped on the bench and yawned deeply not bothering to raise a hand to cover his mouth he wished he could turn his body and lie down the bench was hard worn wood but he had no doubts that he would quickly fall into sleep and that he would dream about eleanor and happiness and places where you did not have to step around the blood he dropped the thought and brought his hand up and all the way into the pocket of his jacket before he remembered there were no cigarettes to be found there chapter the bradbury was the dusty jewel of downtown built more than a century before its beauty was old but still brighter and more enduring than any of the glassandmarble towers that now dwarfed it like a phalanx of brutish guards surrounding a beautiful child its ornate lines and glazed tile surfaces had withstood the betrayal of both man and nature it had survived earthquakes and riots periods of abandonment and decay and a city that often didnt bother to safeguard what little culture and roots it had bosch believed there wasnt a more beautiful structure in the city despite the reasons he had been inside it over the years in addition to holding the offices for the legal practice of howard elias and several other attorneys the bradbury housed several state and city offices on its five floors three large offices on the third floor were leased to the lapds internal affairs division and used for holding board of rights hearings the disciplinary tribunals police officers charged with misconduct must face the iad had leased the space because the rising tide of complaints against officers in the s had resulted in more disciplinary actions and more bors hearings were now happening every day sometimes two or three running at a time there was not enough space for this flow of misconduct cases in parker center so the iad had taken the space in the nearby bradbury to bosch the iad was the only blemish on the buildings beauty twice he had faced board of rights hearings in the bradbury each time he gave his testimony listened to witnesses and an iad investigator once it had been chastain report the facts and findings of the case and then paced the floor beneath the atriums huge glass skylight while the three captains privately decided his fate he had come out okay after both hearings and in the process had come to love the bradbury with its mexican tile floors wroughtiron filigree and suspended mail chutes he had once taken the time to look up its history at the los angeles conservancy offices and found one of the more intriguing mysteries of los angeles the bradbury for all its lasting glory had been designed by a aweek draftsman george wyman had no degree in architecture and no prior credits as a designer when he drew the plans for the building in yet his design would see fruition in a structure that would last more than a century and cause generations of architects to marvel to add to the mystery wyman never again designed a building of any significance in los angeles or anywhere else it was the kind of mystery bosch liked the idea of a man leaving his mark with the one shot hes given appealed to him across a whole century bosch identified with george wyman he believed in the one shot he didnt know if hed had his yet it wasnt the kind of thing you knew and understood until you looked back over your life as an old man but he had the feeling that it was still out there waiting for him he had yet to take his one shot because of the oneway streets and traffic lights dellacroce and rider faced bosch and chastain got to the bradbury on foot before them as they approached the heavy glass doors of the entrance janis langwiser got out of a small red sports car that was parked illegally at the curb out front she was carrying a leather bag on a shoulder strap and a styrofoam cup with the tag of a tea bag hanging over the lip hey i thought we said an hour she said goodnaturedly bosch looked at his watch it was an hour and ten minutes since they had talked so youre a lawyer sue me he said smiling he introduced chastain and gave langwiser a more detailed rundown on the investigation by the time he was finished rider and dellacroce had parked their cars in front of langwisers car bosch tried the doors to the building but they were locked he got out the key ring and hit the right key on the second try they entered the atrium of the building and each of them involuntarily looked up such was the beauty of the place above them the atrium skylight was filled with the purples and grays of dawn classical music played from hidden speakers something haunting and sad but bosch couldnt place it barbers adagio langwiser said what bosch said still looking up the music oh a police helicopter streaked across the skylight heading home to piper tech for change of shift it broke the spell and bosch brought his eyes down a uniformed security guard was walking toward them he was a young black man with closecropped hair and startling green eyes can i help you people the buildings closed right now police bosch said pulling out his id wallet and flipping it open weve got a search warrant here for suite fiveohfive he nodded to dellacroce who removed the search warrant from his coat pocket once again and handed it to the guard thats mr eliass office the guard said we know dellacroce said whats going on the guard asked why do you have to search his place we cant tell you that right now bosch said we need you to answer a couple questions though whens your shift start were you here when mr elias left last night yeah i was here i work a sixtosix shift i watched them leave about eleven last night them yeah him and a couple other guys i locked the door right after they went through the place was empty after that cept for me do you know who the other guys were one was mr eliass assistant or a whatchamacallit secretary clerk yeah clerk thats it like a young student who helped him with the cases you know his name nah i never asked okay what about the other guy who was he dont know that one had you seen him around here before yeah the last couple nights they left together and a few times before that i think i saw him going or coming by hisself did he have an office here no not that i know of was he eliass client how would i know a black guy white guy black what did he look like well i didnt get a real good look at him you said youve seen him around here before what did he look like he was just a normallooking guy he bosch was growing impatient but wasnt sure why the guard seemed to be doing the best he could it was routine in police work to find witnesses unable to describe people they had gotten a good look at bosch took the search warrant out of the guards hand and handed it back to dellacroce langwiser asked to see it and began reading it while bosch continued with the guard whats your name robert courtland im on the waiting list for the academy bosch nodded most security guards in this town were waiting for a police job somewhere the fact that courtland a black man was not already in the academy told bosch that there was a problem somewhere in his application the department was going out of its way to attract minorities to the ranks for courtland to be waitlisted there had to be something bosch guessed he had probably admitted smoking marijuana or didnt meet the minimum educational requirements maybe even had a juvenile record close your eyes robert what just close your eyes and relax think of the man you saw tell me what he looks like courtland did as he was told and after a moment came up with an improved but still sketchy description hes about the same height as mr elias but he had his head shaved it was slick he got one of them soul chips too soul chip you know like a little beard under his lip he opened his eyes thats it thats it bosch said in a friendly cajoling tone robert howre you going to make it into the cops we need more than that how old was this guy i dont know thirty or forty thats a help only ten years difference was he thin fat thin but with muscles you know the guy was built i think hes describing michael harris rider said bosch looked at her harris was the plaintiff in the black warrior case it fits rider said the case starts monday they were probably working late getting ready for court bosch nodded and was about to dismiss courtland when langwiser suddenly spoke while still reading the last page of the search warrant i think we have a problem with the warrant now everyone looked at her okay robert bosch said to courtland well be all right from here thanks for your help you sure you want me to go up with you unlock the door or something no we have a key well be all right okay then ill be in the security office around behind the stairs if you need anything thanks courtland started walking back the way he had come but then stopped and turned around oh you know all five of you better not take the elevator up at once thats probably too much weight on that old thing thanks robert bosch said he waited until the guard had gone around the staircase and was out of sight before turning back to langwiser miss langwiser you probably havent gone out on too many crime scenes before he said but heres a tip never announce that there is a problem with a search warrant in front of somebody who isnt a cop oh shit im sorry i didnt whats wrong with the warrant dellacroce said his voice showing he was upset by the apparent challenge to his work the judge didnt see anything wrong with it the judge said it was fine langwiser looked down at the threepage warrant in her hand and waved it its pages fluttering like a falling pigeon i just think that with a case like this we better be damn sure of what were doing before we go in there and start opening up files we have to go into the files bosch said thats where most of the suspects will be i understand that but these are confidential files relating to lawsuits against the police department they contain privileged information that only an attorney and his client should have dont you see it could be argued that by opening a single file youve violated the rights of eliass clients all we want is to find the mans killer we dont care about his pending cases i hope to christ that the killers name isnt in those files and that it isnt a cop but what if it is and what if in those files elias kept copies or notes on threats what if through his own investigations he learned something about somebody that could be a motive for his killing you see we need to look at the files all of that is understandable but if a judge later rules the search was inappropriate you wont be able to use anything you find up there you want to run that risk she turned away from them and looked toward the door i have to find a phone and make a call about this she said i cant let you open that office yet not in good conscience bosch blew out his breath in exasperation he silently chastised himself for calling in a lawyer too soon he should have just done what he knew he had to do and dealt with the consequences later here he opened his briefcase and handed her his cell phone he listened as she called the das office switchboard and asked to be connected to a prosecutor named david sheiman who bosch knew was the supervisor of the major crimes unit after she had sheiman on the line she began summarizing the situation and bosch continued to listen to make sure she had the details right were wasting a lot of time standing around harry rider whispered to him you want me to go pick up harris and have a talk with him about last night bosch almost nodded his approval but then hesitated as he considered the possible consequences michael harris was suing fifteen members of the robberyhomicide division in a highly publicized case set to begin trial on monday harris a carwash employee with a record of burglary and assault convictions was seeking million in damages for his claims that members of the rhd had planted evidence against him in the kidnapping and murder of a twelveyearold girl who was a member of a wellknown and wealthy family harris claimed the detectives had abducted held and tortured him over a threeday period in hopes of drawing a confession from him as well as learning the location of the missing girl the lawsuit alleged that the detectives frustrated by harriss unwillingness to admit his part in the crime or lead them to the missing girl pulled plastic bags over harriss head and threatened to suffocate him he further claimed that one detective pushed a sharp instrument a black warrior no pencil into his ear puncturing the ear drum but harris never confessed and on the fourth day of the interrogation the girls body was found decomposing in a vacant lot just one block from his apartment she had been sexually assaulted and strangled the murder became one more in a long line of crimes that gripped public attention in los angeles the victim was a beautiful blond blueeyed girl named stacey kincaid she had been spirited from her bed while she slept in her familys large and seemingly safe brentwood home it was the kind of crime that sent a chilling message across the city nobody is safe as horrible as it was in itself the murder of the little girl was exponentially magnified by the media initially this was because of who the victim was and where she came from she was the stepdaughter of sam kincaid scion of a family that owned more automobile dealerships in los angeles county than it was possible to count on two hands sam was the son of jackson kincaid the original car czar who had built the family business from a single ford dealership his father had passed on to him after world war ii like howard elias after him jack kincaid had seen the merit in local television marketing and in the s became a fixture of latenight tv advertising on camera he showed a folksy charm exuding honesty and friendship he seemed as reliable and trustworthy as johnny carson and he was in the living rooms and bedrooms of los angeles just as often if los angeles was seen as an autotopia then jack kincaid was certainly seen as its unofficial mayor off camera the car czar was a calculating businessman who always played both sides of politics and mercilessly drove competitors out of business or at least away from his dealerships his dynasty grew rapidly his car lots spreading across the southern california landscape by the s jack kincaids reign was done and the moniker of car czar was turned over to his son but the old man remained a force though a mostly unseen one and this was never more clear than when stacey kincaid disappeared and old jack returned to tv this time to appear on newscasts and put up a milliondollar reward for her safe return it was another surrealistic episode in los angeles murder lore the old man everyone had grown up with on tv was back on once again and tearfully begging for his granddaughters life it was all for naught the reward and the old mans tears became moot when the girl was found dead by passersby in the vacant lot close to michael harriss apartment the case went to trial based solely on evidence consisting of harriss fingerprints being found in the bedroom from which the girl had been abducted and the proximity of the bodys disposal to his apartment the case held the city rapt playing live every day on court tv and local news programs harriss attorney john penny a lawyer as skilled as elias when it came to manipulating juries mounted a defense that attacked the bodys disposal location as coincidental and the fingerprints found on one of the girls schoolbooks as simply being planted by the lapd all the power and money the kincaids had amassed over generations was no match against the tide of antipolice sentiment and the racial underpinnings of the case harris was black the kincaids and the police and prosecutors on the case were white the case against harris was tainted beyond repair when penny elicited what many perceived as a racist comment from jack kincaid during testimony about his many dealerships after kincaid detailed his many holdings penny asked why not one of the dealerships was in south central los angeles without hesitation and before the prosecutor could object to the irrelevant question kincaid said he would never place a business in an area where the inhabitants had a propensity to riot he said he made the decision after the watts riots of and it was confirmed after the more recent riots of the question and answer had little if anything to do with the murder of a twelveyearold girl but proved to be the pivotal point in the trial in later interviews jurors said kincaids answer was emblematic of the citys deep racial gulf with that one answer sympathy swayed from the kincaid family to harris the prosecution was doomed the jury acquitted harris in four hours penny then turned the case over to his colleague howard elias for civil proceedings and harris took his place next to rodney king in the pantheon of civil rights victims and heroes in south la most of them deserved such honored status but some were the creations of lawyers and the media whichever harris was he was now seeking his payday acivil rights trial in which million would be just the opening bid despite the verdict and all the attached rhetoric bosch didnt believe harriss claims of innocence or police brutality one of the detectives harris specifically accused of brutality was boschs former partner frankie sheehan and bosch knew sheehan to be a total professional when dealing with suspects and prisoners so bosch simply thought of harris as a liar and murderer who had walked away from his crime he would have no qualms about rousting him and taking him downtown for questioning about howard eliass murder but bosch also knew as he stood there with rider that if he now brought harris in he would run the risk of compounding the alleged wrongs already done to him at least in the eyes of much of the public and the media it was a political decision as much as a police decision that he had to make let me think about this for a second he said he walked off by himself through the atrium the case was even more perilous than he had realized any misstep could result in disaster to the case to the department to careers he wondered if irving had realized all of this when he had chosen boschs team for the case perhaps he thought irvings compliments were just a front for a real motive leaving bosch and his team dangling in the wind bosch knew he was now venturing into paranoia it was unlikely that the deputy chief could have come up with such a plan so quickly or that he would even care about boschs team with so much else at stake bosch looked up and saw the sky was much brighter now it would be a sunny and hot day harry he turned it was rider shes off he walked back to the group and langwiser handed him his phone youre not going to like this she said dave sheiman wants to bring in a special master to look at the files before you do special master dellacroce asked what the hell is that its an attorney langwiser said an independent attorney appointed by a judge who will oversee the files he will be hired to protect the rights of those clients while still giving you people what you need hopefully shit bosch said his frustration finally getting the better of him why dont we just stop the whole thing now and drop the damn case if the das office doesnt care about us clearing it then we wont care either detective bosch you know its not like that of course we care we just want to be safe the warrant you have is still good for searching the office sheiman said you can even go through completed case files which i am sure you need to look at as well but the special master will have to come in and look at all pending files first remember this person is not an adversary to you he will give you everything you are entitled to see and when will that be next week next month no sheiman is going to go to work on that this morning hell call judge houghton apprise him of the situation and see if he has any recommendations for a special master with any luck the appointment will be made today and youll have what you need from the files this afternoon tomorrow at the very latest tomorrow at the latest is too late we need to keep moving on this yeah chastain chimed in dont you know an investigation is like a shark its got to keep all right chastain bosch said look langwiser said ill make sure dave understands the urgency of the situation in the meantime youll just have to be patient now do you want to keep standing down here talking about it or do you want to go up and do what we can in the office bosch looked at her for a long moment annoyed by her chiding tone the moment ended when the phone in his hand rang it was edgar and he was whispering bosch held a hand over his ear so he could hear i didnt hear that what listen im in the bedroom theres no phone book in the bed table i checked both bed tables its not here what the phone book its not here man bosch looked at chastain who was looking back at him he turned and walked away out of earshot of the others now he whispered to edgar you sure course im sure i woulda found it if it was here you were first in the bedroom right first one in its not here youre in the bedroom to the right when you come down the hall yeah harry im in the right place its just not here shit what do you want me to do nothing continue the search bosch flipped the phone closed and put it in his pocket he walked back to the others he tried to act calm as if the call had only been a minor annoyance okay lets go up and do what we can up there they moved to the elevator which was an open wroughtiron cage with ornate flourishes and polished brass trim why dont you take the ladies up first bosch said to dellacroce well come up after that ought to distribute the weight pretty evenly he took eliass key ring out of his pocket and handed it to rider the office key should be on there he said and never mind about that other thing with harris for the time being lets see what weve got in the office first sure harry they got on and dellacroce pulled the accordion gate closed the elevator rose with a jerking motion after it was up one floor and those on it could not see them bosch turned to chastain the anger and frustration of everything going wrong flooded him then he dropped his briefcase and with both hands grabbed chastain by the collar of his jacket he roughly pushed him against the elevator cage and spoke in a low dark voice that was full of rage goddammit chastain im only asking this one time wheres the fucking phone book chastains face flushed crimson and his eyes grew wide in shock what what the fuck are you talking about he brought his hands up to boschs and tried to free himself but bosch maintained the pressure leaning all of his weight into the other man the phone book in the apartment i know you took it and i want it back right the fuck now finally chastain tore himself loose his jacket and shirt and tie were wrenched askew he stepped away from bosch as if he was scared and adjusted himself he then pointed a finger at him stay away from me youre fucking nuts i dont have any phone book you had it i saw you put it in the goddamn drawer next to the bed bosch took a step toward him you took it when i was on the bal i said stay away i didnt take it if its not there then somebody came in and took it after we left bosch stopped it was an obvious explanation but it hadnt even entered his mind he had automatically thought of chastain he looked down at the tiles embarrassed by how hed let an old animosity cloud his judgment he could hear the elevator gate opening on the fifth floor he raised his eyes fixed chastain with a bloodless stare and pointed at his face i find out otherwise chastain i promise ill take you apart fuck you i didnt take the book but i am going to take your badge for this bosch smiled but not in a way that had any warmth go ahead write your ticket chastain anytime you can take my badge you can have it chapter the others were inside howard eliass law offices by the time bosch and chastain made it up to the fifth floor the office was essentially three rooms a reception area with a secretarys desk a middle room where there was a clerks desk and two walls of file cabinets and then the third and largest room eliass office as bosch and chastain moved through the offices the others stood silently and didnt look at them it was clear that they had heard the commotion in the lobby as they had taken the elevator up bosch didnt care about that he had already put the confrontation with chastain behind him and was thinking about the search he was hoping something would be found in the office that would give the investigation a focus a specific path to follow he walked through the three rooms making general observations in the last room he noticed that through the windows behind eliass large polished wood desk he could see the huge face of anthony quinn it was part of a mural depicting the actor with arms outstretched on the brick wall of a building across the street from the bradbury rider came into the office behind him she looked out the window too you know every time im down here and see that i wonder who that is you dont know césar chávez anthony quinn you know the actor he got a nonresponse from her before your time i guess the mural is called the pope of broadway like hes watching over all the homeless around here oh i see she didnt sound impressed how you want to do this bosch was still staring at the mural he liked it even though he had a hard time seeing anthony quinn as a christlike figure but the mural seemed to capture something about the man a raw masculine and emotional power bosch stepped closer to the window and looked down he saw the forms of two homeless people sleeping under blankets of newspapers in the parking lot beneath the mural anthony quinns arms were outstretched over them bosch nodded the mural was one of the little things that made him like downtown so much just like the bradbury and angels flight little pieces of grace were everywhere if you looked he turned around chastain and langwiser had entered the room behind rider ill work in here kiz and janis you two take the file room and what chastain said me and del get the secretarys desk yeah while youre going through it see if you can come up with her name and the name of the intern or clerk well need to talk to them today chastain nodded but bosch could see he was annoyed about getting the weakest assignment tell you what bosch added why dont you go out first and see if you can find some boxes were going to be taking a lot of files out of here chastain left the office without a word bosch glanced at rider and saw her give him a look that told him he was acting like an asshole what nothing ill be in the file room she left then leaving just langwiser and bosch everything okay detective everythings fine im going to get to work now do what i can until we hear about your special master look im sorry but you called me out here to advise you and this is what i advise i still think it is the right way to go well well see for most of the next hour bosch methodically went through eliass desk studying the mans belongings appointment calendar and paperwork most of his time was spent reading through a series of notebooks in which elias had kept reminders to himself lists of things to do pencil drawings and general notes from phone calls each notebook was dated on the outside cover it appeared that elias filled the pages of one book every week or so with his voluminous notations and doodles nothing in the books jumped out at bosch as being pertinent to the investigation but he also knew that so little about the circumstances of eliass murder was known that something seeming unimportant in the notebooks at the moment might become important later before starting to page through the most recent notebook bosch was interrupted by another call from edgar harry you said there was a message on the phone machine thats right there aint now bosch leaned back in eliass chair and closed his eyes goddammit yeah its been cleared i dicked around with it and its not a tape messages are stored on a microchip the chip was cleared okay bosch replied angrily continue the search when youre done talk to the security people about whos been in and out of that place see if theyve got any video points in the lobby or parking garage somebody went in there after i left what about chastain he was with you wasnt he im not worried about chastain he flipped the phone closed and got up and went to the window he hated the feeling growing inside that he was being worked by the case rather than the other way around he blew out his breath and went back to the desk and the last notebook that howard elias had kept as he paged through he came across repeated notes regarding someone referred to as parker bosch did not believe this to be a persons real name but rather a code name for a person inside parker center the notations were mostly lists of questions elias apparently intended to ask parker as well as what looked like notes on conversations with this person they were mostly in abbreviated form or the lawyers own version of shorthand and therefore difficult to decipher but in other instances the notes were clear to bosch one notation clearly indicated to bosch that elias had a deeply connected source inside parker center parker get all s unsustained sheehan coblenz rooker rooker stanwick bosch recognized the names as belonging to four rhd detectives who were among the defendants in the black warrior case elias wanted the reports or citizen complaint files on the four detectives more specifically elias wanted the unsustained files meaning he was interested in complaints against the four that had been investigated by the iad but not substantiated such unsustained complaints were removed from officers personnel files as a matter of department policy and were therefore out of reach of a subpoena from a lawyer like elias the notation in the notebook told bosch that elias somehow knew that there were unsubstantiated prior complaints against the four and that he had a source in parker center who had access to the old files on those complaints the first assumption was not a major leap all cops had unsubstantiated complaints it was part of being a cop but someone with access to that sort of file was different if elias had such a source it was a wellplaced source one of the last references to parker in the notebook appeared to be notes of a conversation which bosch assumed to have been a phone call to elias at his desk it appeared that elias was losing his source parker wont jeopardyexposure force the issue parker wont what bosch wondered turn over the files elias wanted did parker believe that getting the files to elias would expose him as a source there wasnt enough there for him to make a conclusion there wasnt enough for him to understand what force the issue meant either he wasnt sure what any of the notes might have to do with the killing of howard elias nevertheless bosch was intrigued one of the departments most vocal and successful critics had a mole inside parker center there was a traitor inside the gate and it was important to know this bosch put the last notebook into his briefcase and wondered if the discoveries he had made through the notes particularly about eliass source inside the department now placed him in the area janis langwiser feared might be an infringement of attorneyclient privilege after mulling it over for a few moments he decided not to go out into the file room and ask her for an interpretation he moved on with the search bosch turned the chair to a side desk that had a personal computer and laser printer set up on it the machines were off there were two small drawers in this desk the top contained the computer keyboard while the bottom contained office supplies with a single manila file on top bosch took out the file and opened it it contained a color printout of a photo of a partially nude woman the printout had two crease marks indicating it had been folded at one time the photo itself did not have the technical quality of those in skin magazines found on the newsstand there was an amateurish badly lit quality to it the woman in the picture was white and had short whiteblond hair she wore thighhigh leather boots with threeinch heels and a gstring nothing else she stood with her rear to the camera one foot up on a chair her face turned mostly away there was a tattoo of a ribbon and bow at the center of the small of her back bosch also saw at the bottom of the picture a notation that had been printed by hand httpwwwgirlawhirlcomgina bosch knew little about computers but he knew enough to understand he was looking at an internet address kiz he called rider was the resident computer expert on his team before coming to hollywood homicide she had worked a fraud unit in pacific division a lot of the work she had done was on computers she walked in from the file room and he waved her over to the desk how is it going out there well were just stacking files she wont let me look through anything until we hear from the special master i hope chastain brings back a lot of boxes because we have awhat is that she was looking at the open file and the printout of the blond woman it was in the drawer take a look its got an address on it rider came around the desk and looked down at the printout its a web page right so how do we get to it and take a look let me get in there bosch got up and rider sat in front of the computer bosch stood behind the chair and watched as she turned the computer on and waited for it to boot up lets see what internet provider hes got she said did you see any letterhead around what letterhead stationery sometimes people put their email address on it if we know eliass email address were halfway there bosch understood now he hadnt seen any letterhead during his search hold on he went out to the reception room and asked chastain who was sitting behind the secretarys desk if hed seen any stationery chastain opened a drawer and pointed to an open box of letterhead stationery bosch grabbed a page off the top rider had been correct eliass email address was printed beneath his postal address on the top center of the page heliaslawyerlinknet bosch took the page with him back to eliass office when he got there he saw rider had closed the file that contained the printout of the blond woman bosch realized it must have been embarrassing to her i got it he said she looked at the page bosch placed on the desk next to the computer good thats the user name now we just need his password hes got the whole computer password protected shit well she said as she began typing most people choose something pretty easy so even they wont forget she stopped typing and watched the screen the cursor had turned into an hourglass as it worked a message then printed across the screen informing rider she had used an improper password what did you use bosch asked his dob you did next of kin right what was his wifes name millie rider typed it in and after a few seconds got the same rejection message what about his son bosch asked his names martin rider didnt type anything whats the matter a lot of these password gates give you three strikes if you dont get in on the third one they go into automatic lockdown forever no for however long elias would have set it at could be fifteen minutes or an hour or even longer lets think about this for a vslapd rider and bosch turned chastain was in the doorway what bosch asked thats the password vslapd as in elias versus the lapd how do you know that the secretary wrote it down on the underside of her blotter guess shes got to use the computer too bosch studied chastain for a moment harry rider said should i give it a shot bosch said still looking at chastain he then turned and watched as his partner typed in the password the hourglass blinked on and then the screen changed and icon symbols began appearing on a field of blue sky and white clouds were in rider said bosch glanced back at chastain good one he then looked back at the screen and watched as rider hit keys and maneuvered through the icons files and programs all of it meaning little to bosch and reminding him that he was an anachronism you really ought to learn this stuff harry rider said seeming to know his thoughts its easier than it looks why should i when ive got you what are you doing anyway just having a look around well have to talk to janis about this there are a lot of file names corresponding with cases i dont know if we should open them before dont worry about it for now bosch interjected can you get on the internet rider made a few more moves with the mouse and then typed the user name and password into blanks on the screen im running lawyerlink she said hopefully the same passwords work and well be able to go to that naked ladys web page what naked lady chastain said bosch picked the file off the desk and handed it unopened to chastain he opened it glanced at the photo and smirked bosch looked back at the screen rider was on lawyerlink using eliass user name whats that address chastain read it off to her as she typed she then hit the enter key and they waited what this is is a singular web page address within a larger web site she said what well get here is the gina page you mean thats her name gina looks like it as she said this the photo from the printout appeared on the screen beneath it was information on what the woman in the photo provided and how to contact her i am mistress regina i am a lifestyle dominatrix providing elaborate bondage humiliation forced feminization slave training and golden blessings other torments available upon request call me now below the block of information there was a phone number a pager number and an email address bosch wrote these down in a notebook he took from his pocket he then looked back at the screen and saw there was also a blue button with the letter a on it he was about to ask rider what the button meant when chastain made a disdainful sound with his mouth bosch turned and looked at him and the internal affairs man shook his head the bastard was probably getting his rocks off on his knees with this broad chastain said i wonder if reverend tuggins and his pals down at the scca knew about that he was referring to an organization called the south central churches association a group which tuggins headed and which always seemed to be at eliass beck and call when he needed to show the media an image of south central outrage in regard to alleged police misconduct we dont know that he ever even met the woman yet chastain bosch said oh he met her why else did he have this laying around i tell you bosch if elias was into rough trade like that theres no telling where that couldve led its a righteous avenue of investigation and you know it dont worry well be checking everything out youre damn right we will uh rider said interrupting theres an audio button bosch looked at the screen rider had the arrow poised over the blue button what do you mean he asked i think we can actually hear mistress regina she clicked the arrow on the button the computer then downloaded an audio program and started playing it a dark and heavy voice came from the computers speaker this is mistress regina if you come to me i will find the secret of your soul together we will reveal the true subservience through which you will know your rightful identity and attain the release you can find nowhere else i will mold you into my own i will own you i am waiting call me now they were all silent for a long moment bosch looked at chastain does it sound like her like who the woman on tape at the apartment chastain suddenly realized the possibility and was silent as he thought about this what tape rider asked can you play it again bosch asked rider clicked the audio button again and asked about the tape once more bosch waited until the replay was over a woman left a message on the phone at eliass apartment it wasnt his wife but i dont think it was this voice either he looked at chastain once more i dont know chastain said could be well be able to do a comparison in the lab if we need to bosch hesitated studying chastain for any indication that he knew the phone message had been erased he saw nothing what chastain said uneasy under boschs stare nothing bosch said he turned back and looked at the computer screen you said this was part of a larger web site he said to rider can we look at that rider didnt answer she just went to work on the keyboard in a few moments the screen changed and they were looking at a graphic which showed a womans stockingclad leg bent at the knee and reaching across the screen below this it said welcome to girlawhirl a directory of intimate sensual and erotic services in southern california below this was a table of contents by which the user could choose listings of women offering a variety of services from sensual massage to evening escort to female domination rider clicked the mouse on this last offering and a new screen was revealed featuring boxes with the names of mistresses followed by an area code prefix its a goddamn internet whorehouse chastain said bosch and rider said nothing rider moved the arrow onto the box marked mistress regina this is your directory she said you choose which page you want and click she clicked the mouse and the regina page appeared again he chose her rider said a white woman chastain said there was glee in his voice golden blessings from a white woman i bet they arent going to be too pleased about that on the south side either rider turned around and looked sharply at chastain she was about to say something when her eyes widened and looked past the iad detective bosch noticed this and turned standing in the doorway of the office was janis langwiser next to her was a woman bosch recognized from her newspaper photos and television appearances she was an attractive woman with the smooth coffeeandcream skin of mixed races wait a minute bosch said to langwiser this is a crime investigation she cant come in here and yes detective bosch she can langwiser said judge houghton just appointed her special master on the case shell be reviewing the files for us with that the woman bosch recognized stepped fully into the room smiled but not warmly and held her hand out to him in order to shake his detective bosch she said its good to meet you i hope we will be able to work together on this im carla entrenkin she waited a beat but no one responded she continued now the first thing i am going to need is for you and all of your people to vacate these premises chapter outside the front doors of the bradbury the detectives walked emptyhanded to their cars bosch was still angry but was cooler now he walked slowly allowing chastain and dellacroce to get to their car first as he watched them drive off on their way back up bunker hill to california plaza he opened the passenger door of kizs slickback but didnt get in he bent down and looked in at her as she pulled the seat belt across her lap you go on up kiz ill meet you up there youre going to walk it bosch nodded and looked at his watch it was eightthirty ill take angels flight it should be running again when you get up there you know what to do start everybody knocking on doors okay see you up there you going to go back up and talk to her again entrenkin yeah i think so do you still have eliass keys yeah she dug them out of her purse and handed them to bosch is there something i should know about bosch paused for a moment not yet ill see you up there rider started the car she looked over at him again before putting it into drive harry you okay yeah im fine he nodded its just the case first we got chastain assholes always been able to get to me now weve got carla imthinkin its bad enough we knew shed be watching the case now shes a part of it i dont like politics kiz i just like putting cases together im not talking about all of that its like youve been walking on the sun since we met this morning to pick up the cars in hollywood you want to talk about it he almost nodded maybe later kiz he said instead we got work to do right now whatever but im about to get worried about you harry you need to be straight if youre distracted then were distracted and we arent going to get anywhere on this thing thatd be okay most days but on this one you just said it yourself were under the glass bosch nodded again her having picked up on his personal turmoil was a testament to her skill as a detective reading people was always more important than reading clues i hear you kiz ill straighten up i copy that ill see you up there he slapped the roof of the car and watched her drive off knowing this would be the time he would normally put a cigarette in his mouth he didnt instead he looked down at the keys in his hand and thought about his next move and how he had to be very careful bosch went back into the bradbury and as he rode the slowmoving elevator back up he tumbled the keys in his hand and thought about entrenkins three separate entries into the case first as a curious listing in eliass now missing phone book then in her capacity as inspector general and now finally a full entrance as a player the special master who would decide what in eliass files the investigators would be allowed to see bosch didnt like coincidences he didnt believe in them he needed to know what entrenkin was doing he believed he had a good idea what that was and intended to confirm it before going any further with the case after being delivered to the top floor bosch pushed the button that would send the elevator back down to the lobby and got off the door to eliass offices was locked and bosch knocked sharply on the glazed glass just below the lawyers name in a few moments janis langwiser opened it bosch could see carla entrenkin standing a few feet behind her forget something detective bosch langwiser asked no but is that your little foreign job down there in the nopark zone the red one it was about to get towed i badged the guy and told him to give me five minutes but hell be back oh shit she glanced back at entrenkin as she headed out the door ill be right back as she moved by him bosch stepped into the office and closed the door behind him he then locked it and turned back to entrenkin why did you lock that she asked please leave it open i just thought it might be better if i said what i want to say without anybody interrupting us entrenkin folded her arms across her chest as if bracing for an attack he studied her face and got the same vibe he had gotten before when she had told them all they had to leave there was a certain stoicism there propping her up despite some clear pain beneath she reminded bosch of another woman he knew only from tv the oklahoma law school teacher who was brutalized in washington by the politicians a few years before during the confirmation of a supreme court justice look detective bosch i really dont see any other way around this we have to be careful we have to think about the case as well as the community the people have to be reassured that everything possible is being done that this wont be swept under in the manner they have seen so many times before i want bullshit excuse me you shouldnt be on this case and we both know it thats what is bullshit i have the trust of this community you think they will believe anything you say about this case or irving or the police chief but you dont have the trust of the cops and youve got one big conflict of interest dont you inspector general what are you saying i think it was rather wise of judge houghton to choose me to act as special master as inspector general i already have a degree of civilian oversight on the case this just streamlines things instead of adding another person to the mix he called me i didnt call him im not talking about that and you know it im talking about a conflict of interest a reason you shouldnt be anywhere near this case entrenkin shook her head in an idontunderstand gesture but her face clearly showed she feared what bosch knew you know what im saying bosch said you and him elias i was in his apartment mustve been just before you got there too bad we missed each other we couldve settled all of this then i dont know what youre talking about but i was just led to believe by miss langwiser that you people waited on warrants before entering his apartment and the office are you telling me that is not true bosch hesitated realizing he had made a mistake she could now turn his move away or back on him we had to make sure no one was hurt or in need of help in the apartment he said sure right just like the cops who jumped the fence at o j simpsons house just wanting to make sure everybody was okay she shook her head again the continued arrogance of this department amazes me from what i had heard about you detective bosch i expected more you want to talk about arrogance you were the one who went in there and removed evidence the inspector general of the department the one who polices the police now you want to evidence of what i did no such thing you cleared your message off the phone machine and you took the phone book with your name and numbers in it im betting you had your own key and garage pass you came in through the garage and nobody saw you right after irving called to tell you elias was dead only irving didnt know that you and elias had something going on thats a nice story id like to see you try to prove any of it bosch held his hand up on his palm were eliass keys eliass keys he said theres a couple on there that dont fit his house or his apartment or his office or his cars i was thinking of maybe pulling your address from dmv and seeing if they fit your door inspector entrenkins eyes moved quickly away from the keys she turned and walked back into eliass office bosch followed and watched as she slowly walked around the desk and sat down she looked as if she might cry bosch knew he had broken her with the keys did you love him he asked what did you love how dare you ask me that its my job theres been a murder youre involved she turned away from him and looked to her right she was staring through the window at the painting of anthony quinn again the tears appeared to be barely holding back look inspector can we try to remember one thing howard elias is dead and believe it or not i want to get the person who did it okay she nodded tentatively he continued talking slowly and calmly in order to get this person im going to need to know everything i can about elias not just what i know from television and newspapers and other cops not just from whats in his files ive got to know out in the reception area someone tried the locked door and then knocked sharply on the glass entrenkin got up and went to the door bosch waited in eliass office he listened as entrenkin answered the door and spoke to langwiser give us a few minutes please she closed the door without waiting for a response locked it again and came back to eliass office where she took the seat behind the desk bosch spoke to her in a voice low enough not to be heard outside of the office ive got to know it all he said we both know you are in a position to help so cant we come to some sort of truce here the first tear fell down entrenkins cheek soon followed by another on the other side she leaned forward and began opening drawers in the desk bottom left bosch said from memory of his inventory of the desk she opened the drawer and removed the box of tissues she placed it on her lap took one tissue and dabbed at her cheeks and eyes she began to speak its funny how things change so quickly a long silence went by i knew howard superficially for a number of years when i was practicing law it was strictly professional mostly how are yous in the hallways of the federal building then when i was appointed inspector general i knew it was important that i knew the critics of the police department as well as i knew the department i arranged to meet howard we met right here him sitting right here it went from there yes i loved him this confession brought more tears and she pulled out several tissues to take care of them how long were you two together bosch asked about six months but he loved his wife he wasnt going to leave her her face was dry now she returned the tissue box to its drawer and it seemed as though the clouds that had crossed her face moments before were gone bosch could see she had changed she leaned forward and looked at him she was all business ill make a deal with you detective bosch but only with you despite everything i think if you give me your word then i can trust you thank you what is your deal i will only talk to you in return i want you to protect me and by that i mean keep the source of your information confidential you dont have to worry nothing i tell you would be admitted in court anyway you can keep everything i tell you in background it may help you it may not bosch thought about this for a moment i should be treating you as a suspect not a source but you know in your gut that it wasnt me he nodded it wasnt a womans murder he said its got male written all over it its got cop written on it too doesnt it maybe thats what im going to find out if i could just get to the case and not have to worry about the community and parker center politics and everything else then do we have an agreement before making any agreement like that i have to know something first elias had a source inside parker somebody with high access somebody who could get him unsustained iad files i need it wasnt me believe me i may have crossed a line when i began a relationship with him that was my heart not my head but i didnt cross the line you are talking about never in a hundred years contrary to what most of your fellow officers think my goal is to save and improve the department not destroy it bosch looked at her blankly she took it as disbelief how would i get him files i am public enemy number one in that department if i went in to get files or even just made a request for them the word would spread around that building and out into the ranks faster than an earthquake wave bosch studied her defiant face he knew she was right she wouldnt make much of a deep cover source he nodded then we have an agreement she asked yes with one asterisk and what is that if you lie one time to me and i find out about it all bets are off that is more than acceptable to me but we cant talk now i want to finish the files so that you and your people can pursue all leads now you know why i want this case solved not only for the sake of the city but for myself what do you say we meet later when the files are done fine with me as bosch crossed broadway fifteen minutes later he could see the garage doors of the grand central market had been rolled up it was years since he had been in the market maybe decades he decided to cut through it to hill street and the angels flight terminus the market was a huge conglomeration of food booths produce stalls and butcher shops vendors sold cheap trinkets and candy from mexico and though the doors had just opened and there were more sellers readying for the day than buyers inside the overwhelming smell of oil and fried food already hung heavy in the air as he made his way through bosch picked up pieces of conversations delivered in staccato snippets of spanish he saw a butcher carefully placing the skinned heads of goats on ice in his refrigerated display case next to the neat rows of sliced oxtail at the far end old men sat at picnic tables nursing their cups of thick dark coffee and eating mexican pastries bosch remembered his promise to edgar to bring doughnuts before they began the canvass he looked around and found no doughnuts but bought a bag of churros the crispfried dough sticks with cinnamon sugar that were the mexican alternative as he came out on the hill street side of the market he glanced to his right and saw a man standing in the spot where baker and chastain had found the cigarette butts hours earlier the man had a bloodstained apron wrapped around his waist he wore a hair net he snaked his hand in underneath the apron and came out with a pack of smokes got that right bosch said out loud he crossed the street to the angels flight arch and waited behind two asian tourists the train cars were passing each other at the midpoint on the tracks he checked the names painted above the doors of each car sinai was going up and olivet was coming down a minute later bosch followed the tourists as they stepped onto olivet he watched as they unknowingly sat on the same bench where catalina perez had died about ten hours earlier the blood had been cleaned away the wood too dark and old to reveal any stain he didnt bother telling them the recent history of their spot he doubted they understood his language anyway bosch took the spot where he had sat before he yawned again the moment the weight was off his feet the car jerked and started its ascent the asians started taking photos eventually they got around to using sign language to ask bosch to take one of their cameras and take photos of them he obliged doing his part for the tourist trade they then quickly took the camera back and moved to the other end of the car he wondered if they had sensed something about him a danger or maybe a sickness in him he knew that some people had that power that they could tell these things with him it would not be difficult it was twentyfour hours since he had slept he rubbed a hand across his face and it felt like damp stucco he leaned forward elbows on his knees and felt the old pain that he had hoped would never be in his life again it had been a long time since he had felt so alone since he had felt like such an outsider in his own city there was a tightness in his throat and chest now a feeling of claustrophobia like a shroud about him even in the open air once more he got the phone out he checked the battery display and found it almost dead enough juice for one more call if he was lucky he punched in the number for home and waited there was one new message fearing the battery wouldnt hold he quickly punched in the playback code and held the phone back up to his ear but the voice he heard was not eleanors it was the sound of a voice distorted by cellophane wrapped around the receiver and then perforated with a fork let this one go bosch the voice said any man who stands against cops is nothing but a dog and deserves to die like a dog you do the right thing you let it go bosch you let it go chapter bosch got to parker center twentyfive minutes before he was to meet with deputy chief irving to update him on the investigation he was alone having left the other six members of the elias team to conclude the canvass of the apartment building next to angels flight and then to pursue their next assignments stopping at the front counter he showed his badge to the uniformed officer and told the man that he was expecting some information to be called in anonymously to the front desk within the next half hour he asked the officer to relay the information to him immediately in chief irvings private conference room bosch then took an elevator up to the third floor rather than the sixth where irvings office was located he went down the hall to the robberyhomicide division squad room and found it empty except for four detectives he had called earlier they were bates otoole engersol and rooker the four detectives who had originally handled the call out to the angels flight murder scene they looked suitably blearyeyed having been up half the night before the case was turned over to bosch and his squad bosch had rousted them from sleep at nine and given them a half hour to meet him at parker center it had been easy enough to get them in so quickly bosch had told them their careers depended on it i dont have a lot of time bosch began as he walked down the main aisle between the rows of desks locking eyes with the four three of the detectives were standing around rooker who was seated at his desk this was a clear giveaway whatever decisions had been made out at the scene when it was only the four of them bosch was sure were made by rooker he was leader of the pack bosch stayed standing stopping just outside the informal grouping of the other four he started telling the story using his hands in an informal manner almost like a television news reporter as if to underline that it was simply a story he was telling not the threat that he was actually delivering the four of you get the call out he said you get out there push the uniforms back and make a perimeter somebody checks the stiffs and lo and behold the dl says one of them is howard elias you then put there was no drivers license bosch rooker said interrupting didnt the cap tell you that yeah he told me but now im telling the story so listen up rooker and shut up im trying to save your ass here and i dont have a lot of time to do it he waited to see if anybody wanted to say anything more so like i said he began again looking directly at rooker the dl identifies one of the stiffs as elias so you four bright guys put your heads together and figure theres a good chance that it was a cop who did this you figure elias got what he had coming and more power to the badge who had the guts to put him down thats when you got stupid you decided to help out this shooter this murderer by staging the robbery you took off bosch you are full i said shut up rooker i dont have the time to hear a bunch of bullshit when you know it went down just like i said you took off the guys watch and his wallet only you fucked up rooker you scratched the guys wrist with the watch postmortem wound its going to come up on the autopsy and that means you four are going to go down the toilet unless it gets contained he paused waiting to see if rooker had anything to say now he didnt okay sounds like i have your attention anybody want to tell me where the watch and wallet are another pause while bosch looked at his watch it was a quarter to ten the four rhd men said nothing i didnt think so bosch said looking from face to face so this is what were going to do i meet with irving in fifteen minutes to give him the overview he then holds the press conference if the front desk downstairs doesnt get a call with information as to the location of the gutter or trash can or whatever place this stuff was stashed then i tell irving the robbery was staged by people at the crime scene and it goes from there good luck to you guys then he scanned their faces again they showed nothing but anger and defiance bosch expected nothing less personally i wouldnt mind it going that way seeing you people get what you got coming but it will fuck the case put hair on the cake taint it beyond repair so im being selfish about it and giving you a chance it makes me sick to give bosch looked at his watch youve got fourteen minutes now with that he turned and started heading back out through the squad room rooker called after him who are you to judge bosch the guy was a dog he deserved to die like a dog and who gives a shit you should do the right thing bosch let it go as if it was his intention all along bosch casually turned behind an empty desk and came back up a smaller aisle toward the foursome he had recognized the phrasing of the words rooker had used his demeanor disguised his growing rage when he got back to the group he broke their informal circle and leaned over rookers desk his palms down flat on it listen to me rooker you call my home again whether its to warn me off or to just tell me the weather and ill come looking for you you wont want that rooker blinked but then raised his hands in surrender hey man i dont know what the fuck youre talk save it for somebody you can convince at least you couldve been a man and skipped the cellophane thats coward shit boy bosch had hoped that when he got to irvings conference room there would be at least a few minutes for him to look at his notes and put his thoughts together but irving was already seated at the round table his elbows on the polished surface and the fingertips of both hands touching and forming a steeple in front of his chin detective have a seat he said as bosch opened the door where are the others uh bosch said putting his briefcase down flat on the table theyre still in the field chief i was just going to drop my case off and then run down to get a cup of coffee can i get you something no and you do not have time for coffee the media calls are starting they know it was elias somebody leaked probably in the coroners office so its about to get crazy i want to hear what is happening starting right now i have to brief the police chief who will lead a press conference that has been scheduled for eleven sit down bosch took a seat opposite irving he had worked a case out of the conference room once before that seemed like a long time ago but he remembered it as the time he had earned irvings respect and probably as much trust as the deputy chief was willing to give to anyone else who carried a badge his eyes moved across the surface of the table and he saw the old cigarette scar that he had left during the investigation of the concrete blonde case that had been a difficult case but it seemed almost routine beside the investigation he was involved in now when are they coming in irving asked he still had his fingers together like a steeple bosch had read in an interrogation manual that such body language denoted a feeling of superiority who the members of your team detective i told you i wanted them here for the briefing and then the press conference well theyre not coming in they are continuing the investigation i thought that it didnt make sense that all seven of us should just drop things to come in here when one of us could easily tell you the status of things bosch watched angry flares of red explode high on irvings cheeks once again we seem to have either a communication problem or the chain of command remains unclear to you i specifically told you to have your people here i mustve misunderstood chief bosch lied i thought the important thing was the investigation i remembered that you wanted to be brought up to date not that you wanted everybody here in fact i doubt there is enough room in here for everybody i the point is i wanted them here do your partners have phones edgar and rider who else they have phones but theyre dead weve been running all night mines dead then page them get them in here bosch slowly got up and headed to the phone which was on top of the storage cabinet that ran along one wall of the room he called rider and edgars pagers but when he punched in the return number he added an extra seven at the end this was a longstanding code they used the extra seven as in code seven the radio call for out of service meant they should take their time in returning the pages if they returned them at all okay chief bosch said hopefully theyll call in what about chastain and his people never mind them i want your team back here by eleven for the press conference bosch moved back to his seat how come he asked though he knew exactly why i thought you said the police chief was going the chief will lead it but we want to have a show of force we want the public to know we have topnotch investigators on this case you mean topnotch black investigators dont you bosch and irving held hard stares for a moment your job detective is to solve this case and solve it as quickly as you can you are not to concern yourself with other matters well thats kind of hard to do chief when you are pulling my people out of the field cant solve anything quickly if theyve got to be here for every dog and pony show you people cook up that is enough detective they are topnotch investigators and thats what i want to use them for not as cannon fodder for the departments race relations they dont want to be used that way either that in itself is ra enough i said i do not have time to debate racism institutional or otherwise with you detective bosch we are talking about public perceptions suffice it to say that if we mishandle this case or its perceptions from the outside this city could be burning again by midnight irving paused to look at his watch i meet the police chief in twenty minutes could you please begin to enlighten me with the accomplishments of the investigation up to this point bosch reached over and opened his briefcase before he could reach for his notebook the phone on the cabinet rang he got up and went to it remember irving said i want them here by eleven bosch nodded and picked up the phone it wasnt edgar or rider and he had not expected that it would be this is cormier downstairs in the lobby this bosch yeah you just got a message here guy wouldnt give a name he just said to tell you that what you need is in a trash can in the metrolink station first and hill its in a manila envelope thats it okay thanks he hung up and looked at irving it was something else bosch sat back down and took his notebook out of his briefcase along with the clipboard with the crime scene reports sketches and evidence receipts attached to it he didnt need any of it to summarize the case but he thought it might be reassuring to irving to see the accumulation of paper the case was engendering im waiting detective the deputy chief said by way of prompting him bosch looked up from the paperwork where we are is pretty much point zero we have a good idea what we have we dont have much of a handle on the who and why then what have we got detective were going with elias being the primary target in what looks like an outright assassination irving brought his head down so that his clasped hands hid his face i know thats not what you want to hear chief but if you want the facts thats what the facts point to we have the last thing captain garwood told me was that it looked like a robbery the man was wearing a thousanddollar suit walking through downtown at eleven oclock at night his watch and wallet are missing how can you discount the possibility of a robbery bosch leaned back and waited he knew irving was venting steam the news bosch was giving him was guaranteed to put ulcers on his ulcers once the media picked it up and ran the watch and wallet have been located they werent stolen where bosch hesitated though he had already anticipated the question he hesitated because he was about to lie to a superior on the behalf of four men who did not deserve the benefit of the risk he was taking in his desk drawer at the office he mustve forgotten them when he closed up and headed to his apartment or maybe he left them on purpose in case he got robbed bosch realized he would still need to come up with an explanation in his reports when the autopsy on elias revealed the postmortem scratches on his wrist he would have to write it off to having occurred while the body was being manipulated or moved by the investigators then perhaps it was an armed robber who shot elias when he did not turn over a wallet irving said oblivious to boschs internal discomfort perhaps it was a robber who shot first and searched for valuables second the sequence and manner of the shots suggests otherwise the sequence suggests a personal tie rage transmitted from one person to elias whoever did this knew elias irving put his hands down on the table and leaned a few inches toward its center he seemed impatient when he spoke all i am saying is that you cannot completely eliminate these other possible scenarios that might be true but were not pursuing those scenarios i believe it would be a waste of time and i dont have the manpower i told you i wanted a thorough investigation i want no stone unturned well well get to those stones later look chief if you are focusing on this so you can tell the media it might be a robbery then fine say it might be i dont care about what you tell the media im just trying to tell you where we stand and where were going to be looking fine proceed he waved a hand in a dismissive gesture we need to look at the mans files and draw up lists of potential suspects the cops who elias really nailed in court or vilified in the media over the years or both the grudges and the cops he would have tried to nail beginning monday irving showed no reaction at all it seemed to bosch he was already thinking about the next hour when he and the police chief would go out on a cliff and address the media about such a dangerous case we are being handicapped bosch continued carla entrenkin has been appointed by the warrants judge as a special master to oversee the protection of eliass clients shes in his office right now and wont let us in i thought you said you found the mans wallet and watch in the office i did that was before carla showed up and kicked us out how did she get appointed she says the judge called her thought shed be perfect she and a deputy from the da are there im hoping to get the first batch of files this afternoon okay what else theres something you should know before carla made us leave we came across a couple things of interest the first is some notes elias kept at his desk i read through them and there were indications that he had a source in here parker center i mean a good source somebody who apparently knew how to find and get access to old files unsubstantiated iad investigations and there were indications of a dispute the source either couldnt or wouldnt provide something elias wanted on the black warrior thing irving went quiet for a second staring at bosch processing when he spoke again his voice was more distant still was this source identified not in what i saw which wasnt a lot it was coded what was it that elias wanted could it be related to the killings i dont know if you want me to pursue it as a priority i will i was thinking that other things would be the priority the cops he dragged into court in the past the ones he was going to pull in starting monday also there was a second thing we found in the office before we got kicked out what was that it actually branches into two more avenues of investigation he quickly told irving about the photo printout of mistress regina and the indication that elias might have been involved in what chastain had called rough trade the deputy chief seemed to take a keen interest in this aspect of the investigation and asked bosch what his plans were in regard to pursuing it im planning on attempting to locate and interview the woman see if elias ever actually had any contact with her after that we see where it goes and the other branch of investigation this leads to the family whether it was this regina woman or not it looks like elias was a philanderer there are enough indications in his downtown apartment to suggest this so if the wife knew about all of this then we have a motivation right there of course im just talking at the moment we have nothing that indicates she even knew let alone arranged or carried out the kill it also flies in the face of the psychological read on the killings which is what it doesnt look like the dispassionate work of a hired killer there is a lot of rage in the killing method it looks to me like the killer knew elias and hated him at least at the moment of the shooting i would also say it looks like it was a man how so the shot up the ass it was vindictive like a rape men rape women dont so my gut instinct tells me this clears the widow but my instincts have been wrong its still something we have to follow up on theres the son too like i told you before he reacted pretty hot when we gave them the news but we dont really know what his relationship with his father was like we do know that the kid has been around weapons we saw a picture in the house irving pointed a finger of warning at bosch you be careful with the family he said very careful that has to be handled with a lot of finesse it will be i do not want that blowing up in our faces it wont irving checked his watch once more why have your people not answered the pages i dont know chief i was just thinking the same thing well page them again i need to meet with the chief at eleven i want you and your team in the press conference room id rather get back to work on the case ive got that is a direct order detective irving said as he stood no debate you wont have to answer questions but i want your people on hand bosch picked up the clipboard and threw it back into his open briefcase ill be there he said though irving was already through the door bosch sat for a few minutes thinking he knew irving would now repackage the information he had given him and deliver it to the police chief they would put their heads together and then reshape it once more before delivering it to the media he looked at his watch he had a half hour until the press conference he wondered if that was time enough to get over to the metrolink station find eliass wallet and watch and get back in time he had to make sure he recovered the dead lawyers property particularly because he had already told irving it was in his possession finally he decided that there wasnt enough time to do it he decided to use the time to get coffee and to make a phone call he walked to the cabinet once more and called his house once more the machine picked up bosch hung up after hearing his own voice saying no one was home chapter bosch decided he would be too nervous waiting until after the press conference and drove over to the metrolink station at first and hill it was only three minutes away and he was pretty sure he could make it back to parker center for the start of the press conference he parked illegally at the curb in front of the entrance to the subway platform it was one of the few good things about driving a slickback there was no need to worry about parking tickets as he got out he removed the baton from the sleeve in the cars door he trotted down the escalator and spotted the first trash can next to the automatic doors at the entrance to the station the way he figured it rooker and his partner had left the angels flight crime scene with the stolen property and stopped at the first spot they knew they would find a trash can one waited up top with the car while the other ran down the stairs to get rid of the wallet and watch so bosch was confident this first trash can would be the one it was a large white rectangular receptacle with the metrolink symbol painted on its sides a blue hood on top housed the push door bosch quickly lifted it off and looked down the receptacle was full but there was no manila envelope visible in the debris at the top bosch put the hood on the ground and used the baton to stir through the detritus of discarded newspapers fastfood wrappers and garbage the can smelled as though it had not been emptied in days cleaned in months he came across an empty purse and one old shoe as he used the baton like an oar to dig deeper he began to worry that one of the homeless men who populated downtown had beaten him to the can and found the watch and wallet first near the bottom just before he gave up to try one of the cans further into the station he saw an envelope smeared with catsup and fished it out with two fingers he tore it open careful to take most of the catsup with the discarded end and looked inside at a brown leather wallet and a gold cartier watch bosch used the escalator on the way up but this time was content to just ride as he looked in the envelope the watchband was also gold or gold plated and was the accordion style that slipped over the wrist and hand bosch bounced the envelope a bit in his hand in order to move the watch without touching it he was looking for any fragments of skin that might be caught in the band he saw nothing once he was back inside the slickback he put on gloves took the wallet and watch out of the torn envelope and threw the envelope over the seat and to the floor in the back he then opened the wallet and looked through its partitions elias had carried six credit cards in addition to identification and insurance cards there were small studioposed photos of his wife and son in the billfold section there were three credit card receipts and a blank personal check there was no currency boschs briefcase was on the seat next to him he opened it and took out the clipboard then flipped through it until he found the victims property report it detailed everything taken from each victim only a quarter had been found in eliass pockets at the time they were searched by a coroners assistant you pricks bosch said out loud as he realized that whoever took the wallet had decided to keep whatever cash had been in it it was unlikely that elias had been walking to his apartment with only the quarter it would cost him to ride angels flight once more he wondered why he was sticking his neck out for people who didnt deserve it he tried to dismiss the thought knowing that it was too late to do anything about it but he couldnt he was a coconspirator now bosch shook his head in disgust with himself then put the watch and wallet into separate plastic evidence bags after labeling each one with a white sticker on which he wrote the case number the date and a time of am he then wrote a brief description of each item and the drawer of eliass desk in which it was found initialed the corner of each sticker and put the bags into his briefcase bosch looked at his watch before starting the car he had ten minutes to make it to the press conference room no sweat there were so many members of the media attending the press conference that several were standing outside the door to the police chiefs press room unable to find space inside bosch pushed and excused and squeezed his way through them inside he saw the back stage was lined wall to wall with television cameras on tripods their operators standing behind them he quickly counted twelve cameras and knew that the story would soon go national there were eight television stations carrying local news in los angeles including the spanishlanguage channel every cop knew that if you saw more than eight camera crews at a scene or a press conference then you were talking network attention you were working something huge something dangerous in the middle of the room every folding chair was taken by a reporter there were close to forty with the tv people clearly identifiable in their nice suits and makeup and the print and radio people just as recognizable as the ones wearing jeans and with ties pulled loose at the neck bosch looked to the front stage and saw a flurry of activity around the podium which had the lapd chiefs badge affixed sound men were taping their equipment to the everwidening tree of microphones on the podium one of them was standing directly behind the podium and giving a voice check behind and to the side of the podium stood irving conferring in whispers with two men in uniform both wearing lieutenants stripes bosch recognized one of them as tom orourke who worked in the media relations unit the other bosch did not recognize but assumed he was irvings adjutant michael tulin whose call had awakened bosch just hours earlier a fourth man stood on the other side of the podium by himself he wore a gray suit and bosch had no idea who he was there was no sign of the police chief not yet the police chief did not wait for the media to get ready the media waited for him irving spotted bosch and signaled him to the front stage bosch walked up the three steps and irving put a hand on his shoulder to usher him into a private huddle out of earshot of the others where are your people i havent heard back from them that is not acceptable detective i told you to get them in here all i can say chief is that they must be in the middle of a sensitive interview and didnt want to break the momentum of the situation to call back on my pages they are reinterviewing eliass wife and his son it takes a lot of finesse especially in a case like i am not interested in that i wanted them here period at the next press conference you have them here or i will split your team up and send you to three divisions so far apart you will have to take a vacation day to have lunch together bosch studied irvings face for a moment i understand chief good remember it now we are about to get started here orourke is going now to get the chief and escort him in you will not be answering any questions you do not have to worry about that then why am i here can i go irving looked as though he was finally about to curse for the first time in his career maybe his life his face was turning red and the muscles of his powerful jaw were at full flex you are here to answer any questions from me or the chief of police you can leave when i dismiss you bosch raised his arms in a handsoff fashion and took a step back against the wall to wait for the show to begin irving stepped away and conferred briefly with his adjutant and then walked over to the man in the suit bosch looked out into the audience it was hard to see because the overhead tv lights were on but past the glare he managed to pick out a few faces he knew either personally or from tv when his eyes finally came to keisha russells he attempted to look away before the times reporter saw him but was too late their eyes briefly caught and held then she nodded once almost unnoticeably bosch did not nod back he didnt know who might pick up on it it was never good to acknowledge a reporter in public so he just held her gaze for a few moments longer and then looked away the door to the side of the stage opened and orourke came through and turned so that he could then hold the door open for the chief of police who entered the room wearing a charcoal gray suit and with a somber look on his face orourke stepped to the podium and leaned down to the microphone tree he was much taller than the police chief for whom the microphones had been set everybody ready though a couple of cameramen from the back called out no and not yet orourke ignored them the chief has a brief statement about todays events and then hell field a few questions but only general details of the case will be released at this time because of the ongoing investigation deputy chief irving is also here to field questions lets maintain some order and well get through this quickly and smoothly and everybody will get what they need chief orourke stepped aside and the chief of police moved to the podium he was an impressive man tall black and handsome he had spent thirty years on the job in the city and was a skilled media man he was however new to the chiefs post chosen for the job just the summer before after his predecessor an overweight outsider with no feel for the department and little feel for the community was dumped in favor of the insider who was striking enough to play himself in a hollywood movie the chief gazed out silently at the faces in the room for a moment the vibe bosch picked up was that this case and how he handled it would be the chiefs first true test in the job he was sure the chief had picked up the vibe as well good morning the chief finally said i have disturbing news to report today the lives of two citizens were taken late last night here in downtown catalina perez and howard elias were riding separately on the angels flight railroad when they were each shot and killed shortly before eleven oclock most people in this city know of howard elias revered or not he was a man who nevertheless was a part of our city who helped mold our culture on the other hand catalina perez like so many of us was not a famous person or a celebrity she was just struggling to make a living so that she and her family a husband and two young children could live and prosper she worked as a housekeeper she worked long days and nights she was going home to her family when she was slain i am simply here this morning to assure our citizens that these two murders will not go unanswered or forgotten you can be assured that we will be working tirelessly on this investigation until we achieve justice for catalina perez and howard elias bosch had to admire what the chief was doing he was packaging both victims as a set making it seem implausible that elias was the sole target and perez just an unlucky traveler in the crossfire he was slickly attempting to portray them as equal victims of the senseless and often random violence that was the citys cancer at this point we cant go into too many details because of the investigation but it can be said that there are leads being followed and we have every belief and hope that the killer or killers will be identified and brought to justice in the meantime we ask that the good citizens of los angeles remain calm and allow us to do our job what we need to guard against at this time is jumping to conclusions we dont want anyone to get hurt the department either through me or deputy chief irving or the media relations office will be providing regular updates on the progress of the case information will be provided when it can be released without being detrimental to the investigation or eventual prosecution of suspects the chief took a half step back from the podium to look at orourke a signal that he was finished orourke made a move toward the podium but before he had raised a foot there was a loud chorus from the audience of reporters yelling chief and above this din came the deeply resonant voice of one reporter a voice recognizable to bosch and everyone else with a television as belonging to channel s harvey button did a cop kill howard elias the question caused a momentary pause then the chorus continued the chief stepped back to the podium and raised his hands as if trying to calm a pack of dogs okay hold on a second i dont want everybody yelling at me one at a did a cop do this chief can you answer that or not it was button again this time the other reporters remained silent and in doing so fell in behind him their silence demanding that the chief address the question it was after all the key question the entire press conference boiled down to one question and one answer at this time the chief said i cannot answer that the case is under investigation of course we all know howard eliass record with this department it would not be good police work if we did not look at ourselves and we will do that we are in the process of doing that but at this point we sir how can the department investigate itself and still have credibility with the community button again thats a good point mr button first off the community can be assured that this investigation will reach its fruition no matter where it leads the chips will fall where they may if a police officer is responsible then he or she will be brought to justice i guarantee it secondly the department is being aided in this investigation by inspector general carla entrenkin who as you all know is a civilian observer who reports directly to the police commission the city council and mayor the chief raised his hand to cut off another question from button im not finished mr button as i said lastly i would like at this time to introduce assistant special agent in charge gilbert spencer from the los angeles field office of the federal bureau of investigation i have discussed this crime and this investigation with mr spencer at length and he has agreed to bring the bureau in to help us beginning tomorrow fbi agents will be working side by side with lapd detectives in a group effort to bring this investigation to a swift and successful conclusion bosch tried to show no response as he listened to the chief announce the fbi involvement he was not shocked by it he realized it was a good move by the chief and might buy some time in the community it might even get the case solved though that was probably a secondary condition in the chiefs decision making he was primarily trying to put out fires before they started the bureau was a pretty good hose with which to do that but bosch was annoyed that he had been left out of the loop and was finding out about the bureaus entry into his case at the same time as harvey button and everybody else he glanced over at irving who picked it up on his radar and looked back they traded glares until irving looked away to the podium as spencer took a position behind the microphones i dont have much to say yet the bureau man said we will be assigning a team to the investigation these agents will work with the lapd detectives and it is our belief that together we will break this case quickly will you be investigating the officers in the black warrior case a reporter called out we will be taking a look at everything but we are not going to be sharing our investigative strategy at this time from this point all media inquiries and releases will be handled through the lapd the bureau will under what authority is the fbi entering the case button asked under civil rights codes the bureau has the authority to open an investigation to determine if an individuals rights have been violated under color of law the color of law by an officer of the law i am going to turn this over to spencer stepped back from the podium without finishing he clearly didnt enjoy being in the glare of the medias headlights the police chief stepped back into place and introduced irving who then moved behind the podium and began reading a press release which contained more details of the crime and the investigation it was still just the basics nothing anybody could do much with the statement also mentioned bosch by name as the detective in charge of the investigation it also explained why potential conflict of interest with the rhd and scheduling problems with central division detectives required a team from hollywood division to run the case irving then said he could field a few questions reminding the reporters once again that he would not compromise the investigation by revealing vital information can you talk more about the focus of the investigation a reporter called out ahead of the others the focus is wideranging irving said we are looking at everything from police officers who might have held a grudge against howard elias to the possibility of the killings being part of a robbery we a followup another reporter barked knowing that you had to get your question in before the subject finished the last one or youd never be heard in the ensuing cacophony was there anything at the crime scene to indicate a robbery we are not going to discuss details of the crime scene my information is that there was no watch or wallet on the body bosch looked at the reporter he was not a tv man bosch could tell that by his rumpled suit and it did not appear that he was from the times because keisha russell was already in the room bosch didnt know who he was but he had obviously been leaked the information on the watch and wallet irving paused as if deciding on how much to reveal your information is correct but incomplete mr elias apparently left his watch and wallet in his desk when he left his office last night the property was found there today of course that does not preclude attempted robbery as a motive for this crime but it is too early in the investigation and we know too little to make such an assumption at this time keisha russell ever the cool one had not joined the shouting for attention she sat calmly with her hand raised waiting for the others to run out of things to ask and for irving to call on her after irving fielded a few more repetitive questions from the tv people he finally called on her you said mr eliass property was found in his office today have you searched his office and if so what if anything is being done to safeguard the attorneyclient privilege that mr elias shared with his clients all of whom are suing the agency that conducted the search of the office good question irving replied we have not conducted a full search of the victims office for the very reason you just mentioned that is where inspector general entrenkin comes into play she is reviewing files in the victims office and will turn them over to investigators after she has vetted them for any sort of sensitive information that could possibly fall under attorneyclient privilege this review process was ordered earlier today by the judge who issued search warrants for howard eliass office my understanding is that the watch and wallet were found in or on the victims desk very much as if he had simply forgotten them last night when he left work now i think that will wrap things up here we have an investigation to focus on when there are any further updates we will one last one russell called out why has the department gone to twelve and twelves irving was about to answer but then looked back at the chief of police who nodded and stepped back to the podium we want to be ready for any eventuality he said going to twelvehour shifts puts more officers on the street at any given time we believe the citizens of this city will remain calm and give us time to conduct our investigation but as a safety precaution i have instituted a readiness plan that includes all officers working twelve hours on and twelve hours off until further notice is this the civil disorder response plan that was drawn up after the last riots russell asked when the department was caught flatfooted because it had no plan it is the plan drawn in yes he was about to step away from the podium when russell tossed another curveball then you are expecting violence it was said as a statement not a question the chief returned to the microphones no miss uh russell i am not expecting that as i said this is merely precautionary i am expecting the citizens of this community to act in a calm and responsible manner hopefully the media will act in the same way he waited for one more response from russell but this time got none orourke moved forward and leaned in front of the chief to get to the microphones okay thats it there will be copies of chief irvings statement down in media relations in about fifteen minutes as the reporters slowly filed out of the room bosch kept his eyes on the man who had asked the question about the wallet and watch he was curious to know who he was and what news outlet he worked for at the logjam at the door the confluence of people brought the man side by side with button and they started talking bosch thought this was odd because he had never seen a print reporter give a tv reporter the time of day detective bosch turned the chief of police was standing to his side with his hand out bosch instinctively shook it he had spent nearly twentyfive years in the department to the chiefs thirty yet they had never crossed paths close enough to speak to each other let alone shake hands chief good to meet you i want you to know how much we are counting on you and your team if you need anything dont hesitate to contact my office or to go through deputy chief irving anything well at the moment i think were okay i appreciate the headsup on the bureau though the chief hesitated but only for a moment apparently discarding boschs gripe as unimportant that couldnt be helped i wasnt sure the bureau was going to become involved until shortly before we started the press conference the chief turned and looked for the fbi man spencer was talking with irving the chief signaled them over and introduced bosch to spencer bosch thought he caught a glimmer of disdain on spencers face bosch did not have a positive record over the years in his dealings with the fbi he had never dealt directly with spencer but if he was assistant special agent in charge of the la field office then he had probably heard of bosch how are we going to work this gentlemen the chief asked ill have my people assembled and here at eight tomorrow morning if you like spencer said excellent chief irving yes that will be fine we will be working out of the conference room next to my office ill have our team there at eight we can go over what weve got and take it from there everybody nodded except bosch he knew he had no say in the matter they broke up and headed toward the door the chief had come through bosch found himself next to orourke he asked him if he knew who the reporter was who asked about the watch and wallet tom chainey it almost rang a bell with bosch but not quite hes a reporter not really he was with the times a lot of years ago but now hes tv hes harvey buttons producer hes not pretty enough to go on camera so they pay him a ton of money to get scoops for harvey and to tell him what to say and ask to make him look good harveys got the face and that voice chaineys got the brains why do you ask is there something i can do for you no i was just wondering you mean the question about the wallet and the watch well like i said chaineys been around hes got sources more than most they moved through the doorway and bosch turned left to head back to irvings conference room he wanted to leave the building but didnt want to wait for an elevator with all of the reporters irving was waiting for him in the conference room he was sitting in the same spot he had taken before sorry about the bureau deal he said i did not know about it until right before it was the chiefs idea so i heard its probably the smart play he was quiet for a moment waiting for irving to make the next move so what i want you to do is have your team finish up the interviews they are involved in now then everybody gets a good nights sleep because tomorrow it all starts again bosch had to stop himself from shaking his head no you mean just shelve everything until the bureau shows up chief this is a homicide a double homicide we cant just shut it down and start over tomorrow i am not talking about shutting anything down i said finish up what you have going at the moment tomorrow we will retrench and regroup and create a new battle plan i want your people fresh and ready to run fine whatever but bosch had no intention of waiting for the bureau his intention was to continue the investigation drive it forward and then follow where it led it didnt matter what irving said can i get a key to this room bosch asked we should get the first batch of files from entrenkin in a little while we need a secure place for them irving shifted his weight and reached into his pocket he removed a key that was unattached to a ring and slid it across the table bosch picked it up and started working it onto his own key ring so how many people have a copy of this he said just so i know you dont have to worry detective no one will be going into this room who is not a member of the team or does not have my permission bosch nodded even though irving had not answered his question chapter as bosch stepped through the glass doors of parker center he saw the beginning of the manufacturing and packaging of a media event spread out across the front plaza were a half dozen television crews and reporters ready to transmit standup reports as leadin on the footage from the press conference out at the curb was the microwave forest a line of tv trucks with their microwave transmitters raised high and ready it was a saturday normally the slowest news day of the week but the murder of howard elias was big the guaranteed lead story and then some a saturday morning assignment editors dream come true the local stations were going to go live at noon and then it would begin the news of eliass murder would blow through the city like the hottest santa ana wind setting nerves on edge and possibly turning silent frustrations into loud and malevolent actions the department and the city for that matter was relying on how these young and beautiful people interpreted and delivered the information they had been given the hope was that their reports would not fan the already smoldering tensions in the community the hope was that they would show restraint and integrity and common sense that they would simply report the known facts without any speculation or editorial twisting of the knife but bosch knew those hopes had about as much chance as elias had when he stepped onto angels flight little more than twelve hours before bosch took an immediate left and headed to the employee parking lot careful not to walk into view of any of the cameras he didnt want to be on the news unless absolutely necessary he successfully avoided detection and got to his car ten minutes later he parked illegally in front of the bradbury pulling in behind yet another tv truck he looked around as he got out but didnt see the news crew he guessed that they had walked over to the angels flight terminus to tape footage for the story after taking the old elevator up to the top floor bosch pulled back the gate and stepped out onto the landing only to be met by harvey button his producer and a cameraman there was an uneasy silence as he tried to move around them then the producer spoke uh detective bosch im tom chainey from channel four good for you i was wondering if we could talk for a few moments about the no we cant talk have a nice day bosch managed to get around them and started toward eliass office chainey spoke to his back you sure were picking up a lot of information and it would probably do us both a lot of good if we could get it confirmed we dont want to cause you any problems it would be better if we could work as a team you know bosch stopped and looked back at him no i dont know he said if you want to put unconfirmed information on the air thats your choice but im not confirming anything and i already have a team he turned without waiting for a reply and headed toward the door with howard eliass name on it he heard nothing else from chainey or button when he walked into the office he found janis langwiser sitting behind the secretarys desk looking through a file next to the desk there were three cardboard boxes full of files that werent there before langwiser looked up detective bosch hey these boxes for me she nodded the first batch and hey that wasnt very nice what you did before what telling me my car was being towed that was a lie wasnt it bosch had completely forgotten uh no not really he said you were in a towaway zone they wouldve gotten you he smiled when he knew she knew it was a bullshit coverup his face started turning red look i had to talk to inspector entrenkin alone im sorry before she could say anything carla entrenkin looked in from the room next door she too was holding a file in her hand bosch pointed to the three boxes on the floor looks like youre making some progress i hope so can i talk to you for a moment in here sure but first did channel four come in here and try to talk to you two they did langwiser said and channel nine was here before them did you talk to them langwisers eyes darted momentarily toward entrenkin and then down at the floor she said nothing i gave a brief statement entrenkin said something innocuous just explaining my role can we talk in here she stepped back from the doorway and bosch entered the file room there was another cardboard box on the desk that was half full of files entrenkin closed the door after bosch entered she then threw the file she was holding on the clerks desk folded her arms and put a stern expression on her face what is it bosch asked tom chainey just told me that it was announced at the press conference that how uh mr elias had left his wallet and watch in his office in his desk and i thought that when you people were asked to leave this morning it was clear that im sorry i forgot bosch put his briefcase down on the desk and opened it he lifted out the evidence bags containing the wallet and watch i had already bagged them and put them in my case before you came in this morning i forgot about it and left with them you want me to put it all back where i found it no i just wanted an explanation and im not sure i believe the one you just offered there was a long silence while they stared at each other was that all you wanted to talk to me about bosch finally asked she turned back to the desk and the file she had been looking through i thought our relationship would be better than this look bosch said as he closed the briefcase youve got your secrets youve got to give me mine the bottom line is howard elias wasnt robbed so we move on from there okay if you are telling me that there were people involved in this investigation who were attempting to tamper with evidence then im not telling you anything he saw anger flare in her eyes they shouldnt be a part of this department you know that thats another battle for another day ive got more import you know there are some people who might think there is nothing more important than a police department in which there is no question about the integrity of its members sounds like youre giving a press conference inspector im going to take those files now ill be back for the next batch later he started to turn back to the front room i just thought you were different thats all she said he turned back to her you dont know if im different because you dont know the first thing about me ill talk to you later theres something else missing bosch stopped and looked back at her what howard elias was a consummate note taker he kept a spiral notebook on his desk or with him all the time his last notebook is missing you know where that is bosch came back to the desk and reopened his briefcase he took the notebook out and tossed it down you wont believe me but i had already put that in my briefcase when you came in and kicked us out matter of fact i do believe you did you read it parts of it also before you showed up she looked at him for a long moment ill look through it and if it is okay you will have it back later today thank you for returning it youre welcome by the time bosch got to philippes the original the others were already there and eating they had one of the long tables in the back room and were by themselves he decided to take care of business before waiting in one of the lines at the counter to order howd it go rider asked as he stepped over the bench and sat next to her well i think i definitely was a little too pale for irvings liking well fuck him edgar said i didnt sign up for this shit me too rider said what are you talking about chastain asked race relations rider said typical you cant figure that out hey i never mind bosch interjected lets talk about the case okay you first chastain did you finish the apartment building yeah we finished nothing except we found out about the woman fuentes said oh yeah right what woman the other victim catalina perez hold a second chastain reached down to the bench next to him and came up with a legal tablet he flipped to the second page and looked at the notes apartment nineohnine perez was the cleaning woman came every friday night so thats where she was coming from but she was going up bosch said she didnt work till eleven no this is the deal she works six to tenthirty then takes angels flight down to the bus stop catches the bus and goes home only on the way down she mustve looked in her purse and noticed her notebook where she keeps her schedule and phone numbers is missing she took it out in the apartment last night because her employer a mr d h reilly changed his phone number and gave her the new one only she left the notebook on his kitchen table she had to go back for it so shed know her schedule this lady he reached to the bench again and pulled up the notebook it was in a plastic evidence bag i mean i looked at the schedule she worked her tail off shes got gigs every day and a lot of nights this reilly guy said friday nights was the only regular night he could get her for she did a good job so she was going back up to get her book when she got popped edgar said looks that way the old ioia rider said in a singsong way that was not mirthful in any way whats that chastain asked nothing they were all silent for a long moment bosch was thinking about how leaving that notebook behind had cost catalina perez her life he knew that what rider had said referred to the inequities of it all the phrase she began using after a year on the homicide squad to sum up the bad breaks coincidences and twists of fate that often left people dead okay good bosch finally said we now know what everybody was doing on that train the rest of the building was clean nobody heard a thing nobody saw a thing chastain said you get everybody no response at four apartments but they were all on the other side away from angels flight all right let those go for now kiz you talk to the wife and son again rider was chewing her last bite of french dip sandwich and held her finger up until she swallowed yeah separately and together nothing pulled my trigger theyre both pretty much convinced a cop did it i didnt of course they are chastain interjected let her talk bosch said i didnt pick up any feel that they knew much about his cases or possible threats he didnt even keep a home office i touched on eliass fidelity and millie said she believed he was faithful she said it like that she believed something about it sounds wrong i think if there was no doubt she would say he was faithful not that she believed he was faithful know what i mean so you think she knew maybe but i also think that if she knew then she was the type that would put up with it there was a lot of social standing in being howard eliass wife lot of wives in that position make choices they look the other way on some things to keep the image intact to keep the life they have intact what about the son i think he believed his father was a god hes hurting bosch nodded he respected riders interviewing skills he had seen her in action and knew she was empathic he also knew he had used her in a way not so dissimilar to the way irving had wanted to use her during the press conference he had sent her to do the followup interviews because he knew she would be good at it but also because she was black you ask them the a question yeah they were both at home last night neither went out theyre each others alibi great chastain said okay kiz bosch said anybody else got something they want to bring up bosch leaned forward on the table so he could look down his side and see every face no one said anything he noticed everybody had finished eating their sandwiches well i dont know if youve heard anything about the press conference but the chief called in the cavalry tomorrow morning the bureau enters the case we have a meet at eight in irvings conference room shit chastain said what the hell are they going to do that we cant edgar asked probably nothing bosch said but his announcing it at the press conference will probably go a long way toward keeping the peace at least for now anyway lets worry about that tomorrow when we see how things shake out we still have the rest of today irving gave me an unofficial cease and desist until the agents show up but thats bullshit i say we keep working yeah we dont want the shark to drown do we chastain said thats right chastain now i know nobodys had much sleep my thinking is that some of us keep working and knock off early some of us go home take a nap and come back in fresh tonight any problem with that again no one said anything all right this is how we break it up ive got three boxes of files from eliass office in my trunk i want you iad guys to take them and go back to irvings conference room you take the files pull out names of cops and anybody else to be checked out i want a chart made up when we get legit alibis we scratch the names off the chart and move on i want this ready by the time the bureau arrives tomorrow when you have it done then you guys can knock off for the night and what are you going to be doing chastain asked were going to run down eliass secretary and his clerk then after that im going home to take a nap hopefully then tonight were going to talk to harris and chase down that internet thing i want to know what thats all about before the bureau comes in you better be careful with harris we will thats one reason were waiting until tonight we play it right and the media doesnt even find out we talked to the guy chastain nodded what about these files youre giving us they old or new theyre old ones entrenkin started on the closed cases when are we going to see the black warrior file thats the one the rest of this is bullshit hopefully ill be picking that up later today but the rest isnt bullshit we have to look at every damn file in that office because the one we skip is likely to be the one some lawyer shoves up our ass in trial you understand that dont skip anything i got it besides what do you care so much about the black warrior file for you cleared those guys on it right yeah so so what are you going to find in the file other than what you already know you think you missed something chastain no but but what its the case of the moment i think theres gotta be something there well well see all in good time for now stick to the old files and dont skip anything i told you we wont its just a pain in the ass to know youre wasting time welcome to homicide yeah yeah bosch reached into his pocket and pulled out a small brown bag it contained several copies of the key irving had given him that he had had made in chinatown on his way to the restaurant he turned the bag over on the center of the table and keys clattered onto the table everybody take a key theyll open the door to irvings conference room once the files are in there i want the room locked at all times everybody reached to the center of the table and took a key except bosch he had already put the original on his key ring he stood up and looked at chastain lets go get those files out of my car chapter the interviews with the secretary and the clerk were so uneventful that bosch wished the detectives could have spent the time in their beds sleeping tyla quimby the secretary had been out with the flu and holed up in her home in the crenshaw district for the last week she had no knowledge of howard eliass activities during the days before his death aside from exposing bosch edgar and rider to the flu she gave the detectives very little she explained that elias kept his case strategies and other aspects of his work largely to himself her role was primarily opening mail answering phones handling walkin visitors and clients and paying the office expenses through a small operating account elias put money into each month as far as the phone traffic went she said elias had a direct private phone line in his office that over the years had become widely known among friends and associates as well as some reporters and even enemies so she was of little use in helping them determine whether elias had been specifically threatened in the weeks before his murder the investigators thanked her and left her home hoping they would not fall victim to her illness the clerk john babineux was an equal disappointment he was able to confirm that it had been he and michael harris who had worked until late friday with elias but babineux said that harris and elias had been behind closed doors most of the evening babineux as it turned out had graduated from the usc law school three months before and was studying for the bar exam at night while clerking for elias by day he did his studying in eliass offices at night because it allowed him access to the law books he needed for memorizing case law and penal codes it obviously was a better study environment than the crowded apartment near usc he shared with two other law students shortly before eleven he had walked out with elias and harris because he had felt he had done enough studying for one night he said he and harris walked to their cars in a nearby pay lot while elias walked up third street alone toward hill street and angels flight like quimby babineux described elias as secretive about his cases and preparation for trial the clerk said that his responsibility in the last week of work had largely been preparing the transcripts of the many pretrial depositions taken in the black warrior case his job was to download the transcripts and related material onto a laptop computer which would then be taken to court and accessed by elias when he needed specific references to evidence and testimony during trial babineux could give the detectives no information about specific threats to elias at least none that the attorney was taking seriously he described elias as extremely upbeat in recent days he said elias wholeheartedly believed that he was going to win the black warrior case he said it was a slam dunk babineux told the three detectives as bosch drove up woodrow wilson drive toward home he thought about the two interviews and wondered why elias had been so secretive about the case he was bringing to trial this didnt fit with his past history of press leaks and sometimes fullscale press conferences as a primary strategy elias was being uncharacteristically quiet yet he was confident in his case enough to call it a slam dunk bosch hoped the explanation of this would be revealed when he got the black warrior file from entrenkin hopefully in a few hours he decided to put thoughts of it aside until then immediately eleanor came to mind he thought about the closet in the bedroom he purposely hadnt checked it before not sure how he would react if he found she had taken her clothes he decided he needed to do that now to get it over with it would be a good time to do it he was too tired now to do anything other than crash down onto his bed regardless of what he found but as he came around the last curve he saw eleanors car the beatup taurus parked at the curb in front of their house she had left the carport open for him he felt the muscles in his neck and shoulders begin to relax the tightness in his chest began to ease she was home the house was quiet when he entered he put his briefcase down on one of the dining room chairs and started stripping off his tie as he moved into the living room he then moved down the short hallway and looked into the bedroom the curtains were drawn and the room was dark except for the outline of exterior light around the window he saw eleanors still form under the covers on the bed her brown hair was splayed over the pillow he moved into the bedroom and quietly took off his clothes draping them over a chair he then went back down the hallway to the guest bathroom to take a shower without waking her up ten minutes later he slid into the bed next to her he was on his back looking through the darkness to the ceiling he listened to her breathing he didnt hear the slow measured breaths of her sleeping that he was used to you awake he whispered mmmhmm he waited a long moment where were you eleanor hollywood park bosch didnt say anything he didnt want to accuse her of lying maybe jardine the security guy had simply missed her during his survey of the video screens he stared at the ceiling wondering what to say next i know that you called there looking for me eleanor said i knew tom jardine in las vegas he used to work at the flamingo he lied when you called he came to me first bosch closed his eyes and remained silent im sorry harry i just didnt want to have to deal with you then deal with me you know what i mean not really eleanor how come you didnt answer my message when you got home what message bosch realized he had played the message back himself earlier there wouldnt have been a flashing light on the machine she would not have heard the message never mind when did you get home she lifted her head off the pillow to look at the glowing numbers on the bedside clock couple hours ago howd you do he didnt really care he just wanted her to keep talking to him all right came out a little ahead but i messed up i missed a big one what happened i went with a long shot when i shouldve stuck with a sure thing what do you mean i was dealt a pair of aces but i also had four clubs ace three four five so on the draw i broke the pair of aces i discarded the ace of hearts and went for the deuce the two of clubs to make the straight flush they keep a progressive bonus pot going for a straight flush it was up to about three thousand dollars thats what i was going for so what happened i didnt get the deuce i didnt even get a club to make a flush what i got was the ace of spades damn yeah i threw down an ace only to get an ace i stayed in with that but didnt come close three tens won it the pot was about three hundred so if i had kept the ace of hearts i would have ended up with three aces and been the winner i blew it thats when i left bosch didnt say anything he thought about the story and wondered if she was trying to say something else tossing the ace of hearts aiming for the bigger pot failing after a few minutes of silence eleanor spoke again were you out on a case you hadnt been in the bed i could tell yeah i got a call out i thought you werent up on rotation its a long story and i dont feel like talking about it i want to talk about us tell me whats going on eleanor we cant this isnt right some nights i dont even know where you are or if you are all right somethings wrong or missing and i dont know what it is she turned and moved under the covers until she was next to him she put her head down on his chest and brought her hand up to caress the scar on his shoulder harry he waited but she didnt say anything she moved over on top of him then and started a gentle rocking motion with her hips eleanor we need to talk about this he felt her finger glide across his lips telling him not to speak they made love slowly boschs mind a jumble of conflicting thoughts he loved her more than he had ever loved anyone he knew she loved him in some way having her in his life had made him feel whole but at some point he could tell that eleanor had realized she did not have that feeling for her there was something missing and the realization that they were on separate planes brought bosch down as low as he had ever felt the feeling of doom had fallen upon the marriage then during the summer he had caught a series of timeconsuming investigations including a case requiring him to make a weeklong trip to new york while he was gone she went to the poker room at hollywood park for the first time it was out of the boredom of being left alone and the frustration at her lack of success in finding an acceptable job in los angeles she had returned to the cards doing what she had done when bosch had found her and it was at those blue felt tables that she found the thing that was missing eleanor he said when they were finished making love his arms wrapped around her neck i love you i dont want to lose you she smothered his mouth with a long kiss and then whispered go to sleep darling go to sleep stay with me he said dont move away until im asleep i wont she held him tighter and he tried for the moment to let everything go just for a while he decided he would take it all up later but for now he would sleep in a few minutes he was gone deep into a dream in which he was riding angels flight up the tracks to the top of the hill as the other car came down and passed he looked in through the windows and saw eleanor sitting alone she wasnt looking back at him bosch awoke in a little over an hour the room was darker as the light from outside was no longer directly on the windows he looked around and saw eleanor was gone from the bed he sat up and called her name his voice reminding him of how he had answered the phone that morning im here she called from the living room bosch pulled on his clothes and left the bedroom eleanor was sitting on the couch wearing the bathrobe he had bought for her at the hotel in hawaii where they had gone after getting married in las vegas hey he said i thought i dont know you were talking in your sleep i came out here what did i say my name a few other things that didnt make sense something about a fight angels fighting he smiled and nodded and sat down in the chair on the other side of the coffee table flight not fight you ever been on angels flight in downtown no its two train cars when one goes up the hill the other goes down they pass in the middle i dreamed i was going up and you were in the car going down we passed in the middle but you wouldnt look at me what do you think it means that were going different ways she smiled sadly i guess it means youre the angel you were going up he didnt smile i have to go back in he said this ones going to take up my life for a while i think you want to talk about it why were you called out he ran the case down for her in about ten minutes he always liked telling her about his cases he knew it was a form of ego gratification but sometimes she made a suggestion that helped or a comment that let him see something he had missed it was many years since she had been an fbi agent it was a part of her life that was a distant memory but he still respected her investigative logic and skills oh harry she said when he was done telling the story why is it always you its not always me seems like it is what are you going to do same as i always do im going to work the case all of us are theres a lot there to work with they just have to give us the time with it its not going to be a quick turn i know you theyll throw every roadblock they can think of in front of you it does no one any good to hook somebody up and bring them in on this but youll be the one to do it youll bring somebody in no matter if it makes every cop in every division despise you every case counts eleanor every person i despise people like elias he was a suckerfish making his life off bullshit cases against cops just trying to do their jobs for the most part at least every now and then he had a legitimate case i guess but the point is nobody should get away with what they did even if its a cop who did it its not right i know harry she looked away from him out through the glass doors and past the deck the sky was turning red the lights of the city were coming on whats your cigarette count he asked just to be saying something i had a couple you still at zero he had smelled the smoke in her hair earlier he was glad she hadnt lied what happened over at stocks and bonds hed been hesitant about asking he knew that whatever had happened during the interview had been what sent her to the poker room same as the others theyll call if something comes up ill go over and talk to charlie next time im at the station stocks and bonds was a storefront bail bond agency across from the hollywood station on wilcox bosch had heard they were looking for a skip tracer preferably female because a good portion of the bail jumpers out of hollywood station were prostitutes and a female tracer stood a better chance of running them down he had gone over and talked to the owner charlie scott about it and he had agreed to consider eleanor for the job bosch was honest about her background both good and bad former fbi agent on the plus side convicted felon being the minus scott said he didnt believe the criminal record would be a problem the position did not require a state private investigators license which eleanor could not qualify for with a record the problem was that he liked his tracers to be armed especially a woman when they went looking for bail jumpers bosch didnt share the concern he knew that most skip tracers were unlicensed to carry weapons but did so anyway the true art of the craft though was never to get close enough to your quarry to make having or not having a weapon a question the best tracers located their quarry from a safe distance and then called the cops in to make the pickup dont talk to him harry i think he was just trying to do you a favor but reality hit him between when he told you to send me in and when i arrived just let it go but youd be good at that thats beside the point bosch stood up ive got to get ready he went into the bedroom and stripped off his clothes took another shower and then dressed in a fresh suit eleanor was in the same position on the couch when he came back out to the living room i dont know when ill be back he said not looking at her weve got a lot to do plus the bureaus coming in tomorrow the bureau civil rights the chief made the call he thinks it will keep things calm down south he hopes do you have a name of who is coming over not really there was an assistant sac at the press conference today what was his name gilbert spencer but i doubt hell be involved anymore eleanor shook her head hes after my time he probably just came for the show yeah hes supposed to send a team over tomorrow morning good luck he looked at her and nodded i dont have the number yet if you need me just use the pager okay harry he stood there for a few moments before finally asking her what he wanted to ask all along are you going to go back she looked back out through the doors i dont know maybe eleanor harry you have your addiction i have mine whats that mean you know that feeling you get when you pull up on a new case that little thrill you get when youre back in the hunt you know what im talking about well i dont have that anymore and the closest thing ive found to it is when i pick those five cards up off the felt and see what ive got it is hard to explain and even harder to understand but i feel like im alive again then harry were all junkies its just different drugs i wish i had yours but i dont bosch just stared at her a moment he wasnt sure he could say anything without his voice betraying him he moved to the door looking back at her once he had it open he moved through it but then stepped back you break my heart eleanor i always hoped that i could make you feel alive again eleanor closed her eyes she looked as though she might cry im so sorry harry she whispered i should never have said that bosch stepped silently through the door and closed it behind him chapter bosch was still feeling emotionally bruised when he got to howard eliass office a half hour later the door was locked and he knocked he was about to use the keys to open it when he saw movement behind the glazed glass carla entrenkin opened the door and allowed him in he could tell by the way she appraised him that she noticed he was wearing a different suit i got to take a little break he said i think well be working a good part of the night wheres miss langwiser we finished and i sent her home i said i would wait for you its only been a few minutes she led him back to eliass office and took the seat behind the huge desk bosch could see anthony quinn through the window though it was getting dark out he also saw that there were six file cartons on the floor in front of the desk sorry you were waiting he said i thought you were going to page me when you were done i was about to i was just sitting here thinking bosch looked at the boxes this is the rest thats it those six are more closed cases these back here are current cases she rolled her chair back and pointed to the floor behind the desk bosch stepped over and looked down there were two more full boxes this is mostly michael harris stuff most of it is the police file and depo transcripts there are also files on lawsuits that havent proceeded past the initial claims and there is a file containing general threats and crank mail i mean unrelated specifically to the harris case mostly just anonymous stuff from racist cowards okay what are you not giving me im holding back only one file it was his working file it contains notes on strategy in the harris case i dont think you should have that i believe it goes directly to attorneyclient privilege strategy basically its a trial map howard liked to chart his trials he once told me he was like a football coach who designs the plays and what order he will call them in before the game even starts howard always knew exactly where he wanted to go during trial the trial map showed his strategy what witness came when when each piece of evidence was to be introduced things like that he had the first few questions for every one of his witnesses already written and he also had his opening statement outlined and in the file okay i cant give it to you it was the heart of his case and i think whoever the attorney is who inherits the case will want to follow the map it was a brilliant plan therefore the lapd shouldnt have it you think he was going to win definitely i take it you dont bosch sat down in one of the chairs in front of the desk despite having taken the nap he was still tired and feeling it i dont know the particulars of the case he said all i know is frankie sheehan harris accused him of some of that stuff you know with the plastic bag and i know thats not frankie how can you be sure i cant i guess but we go back sheehan and i were partners one time it was a long time ago but you still know people i know him i cant see him doing these things i cant see him letting anybody else do it either people change bosch nodded they do but usually not at the core the core let me tell you a story one time frankie and i brought this kid in a carjacker his deal was that first hed steal a car any shit can off the street then hed go out driving and looking for something nice something he could take to a chop shop and get a decent amount of bread for when he saw what he wanted hed come up behind and at a stoplight hed hit the back end you know like a little fender bender not enough to do much damage then the owner of the mercedes or the porsche or whatever it was would get out to check the jacker would get out and just jump into the target car and take off the owner and the stolen shit can were left behind i remember when carjacking was the big fad yeah some fad this guyd been doing this about three months and making a good amount of money at it then one time he hits the back of a jaguar xj too hard the little old lady who was driving wasnt wearing her seat belt she weighs about ninety pounds and she is thrown into the steering wheel hits it hard no air bag it crushes one lung and sends a rib through the other shes sitting there filling up with blood and dying when this kid comes up opens the door and just yanks her out of the car he leaves her lying on the street and drives off with the jag i remember that case what was that ten years ago the media went nuts on it yeah carjack homicide one of the first ones and thats where me and frankie came in it was a hot case and we were under pressure we finally got a line on the kid through a chop shop that burglaryauto theft took down in the valley this kid lived over in venice and when we went to pick him up he saw us coming fired a three fiftyseven through the front door after frankie knocked missed him by an inch frankie had longer hair back then the bullet actually went through his hair the kid went through the back door and we chased him through the neighborhood calling for backup on our handhelds as we ran the radio calls brought the media out helicopters reporters everything you got him right i remember we chased him almost all the way through oakwood we finally got him in an abandoned house a shooting gallery the hypes went scattering and he stayed inside we knew he had the gun and he had already taken a shot at us we couldve gone in there and blown his shit away and there wouldnt have been a question but frankie went in first and talked the kid out it was just him and me and the kid in there nobody wouldve known or questioned what had happened but frankie he didnt think like that he told the kid he knew the lady in the jag was an accident that he didnt mean to kill anybody he told him he still had a chance at life fifteen minutes earlier the kid tried to kill frankie now frankie was trying to save the kids life bosch stopped for a moment remembering the moments in the abandoned house the kid finally stepped out of a closet holding his hands up he still had the gun in his hand it would have been so easy and so right but it was frankies call he was the one who almost took the bullet but he just went over and took the gun from the kid and cuffed him end of story entrenkin considered the story for a long moment before responding so what you are saying is that because he spared one black man that he could have easily gotten away with killing then he would not have tried to suffocate another black man nearly a decade later bosch shook his head and frowned no im not saying that im saying that that was just one of the times i saw frank sheehans core it was when i knew what he was made of and thats why i know the harris thing is bullshit he would never have planted evidence on the guy he would never have pulled a bag over his head he waited for her to say something but she didnt and i never said anything about the carjacker being black that had nothing to do with it thats just something you bring to the story yourself i think it was an obvious part that you left out maybe if it had been a white boy in that abandoned house you would never even have thought about what you could have gotten away with bosch stared at her a long moment no i dont think so well its not worth arguing about you left something else out of the story didnt you what a few years later your buddy sheehan did use his gun and he put a bunch of bullets into a black man named wilbert dobbs i remember that case too that was a different story and a righteous shoot dobbs was a murderer who drew down on sheehan he was cleared by the department the da everybody but not a jury of his peers that was one of howards cases he sued your friend and he won it was bullshit the case went to trial a few months after the rodney king thing there was no way a white cop who had shot a black man was going to get a clean verdict in this town back then be careful detective youre revealing too much of yourself look what i said was the truth deep down you know it was the truth how come the moment the truth might be uncomfortable people raise the race card lets just drop this detective bosch you have your belief in your friend and i admire that i guess well see what happens when the lawyer who inherits this case from howard brings it to trial bosch nodded and was thankful for the truce the accusatory discussion had made him feel uncomfortable what else have you held back he asked to try to move on thats pretty much it spent all day in here to basically hold one file back she blew her breath out and suddenly seemed very tired you doing okay he asked fine i think it was good for me to stay busy i havent had much time to think about what has happened im sure i will tonight bosch nodded any more reporters come around a couple i gave them a sound bite and they went on their merry way they all think the citys going to cut loose over this what do you think i think if a cop did this theres no telling whats going to happen and if a cop didnt do it there will be people who just wont believe it but you already know that bosch nodded one thing you should know about the trial map whats that despite what you said about frank sheehan a moment ago howard was out to prove harris innocent bosch hiked his shoulders i thought he already was in the criminal trial no he was found not guilty theres a difference howard was going to prove his innocence by proving who did it bosch stared at her a long moment wondering how he should proceed does it say in that trial map who that was no like i said there was just an outline of the opener but its in there he was going to tell the jury that he would deliver the murderer to them those were his words deliver the murderer to you he just didnt write who that was it would have been a bad opener if he did it would give it away to the defense and make for an anticlimactic moment later in trial when he revealed who this person was bosch was silent as he thought about this he didnt know how much weight to give what she had told him elias was a showman in and out of court revealing a killer in court was perry mason stuff it almost never happened im sorry but i probably shouldnt have told you that she said why did you because if others knew this was his strategy it could have been a motive you mean the real killer of that little girl came back to kill elias thats a possibility bosch nodded did you read the depos he asked no not enough time im giving all depositions to you because the defense in this case the city attorneys office would have been furnished copies so im not giving you something you wouldnt already have access to what about the computer i looked through it very quickly it appears to be depositions and other information out of the public file nothing privileged okay bosch started to get up he was thinking about how many trips down to the car it would take him to move the files oh one other thing she reached down to the box on the floor and came up with a manila file she opened it on the desk revealing two envelopes bosch leaned over the desk to see this was in the harris stuff i dont know what it means both envelopes were addressed to elias at his office no return addresses both were postmarked hollywood one mailed five weeks earlier and the other three weeks earlier theres a single page with a line in each nothing that makes sense to me she started opening one of the envelopes uh bosch began she stopped holding the envelope in her hand what i dont know i was thinking about prints i already handled these im sorry okay go ahead i guess she finished opening the envelope unfolded the page on the desk and turned it so bosch could read it there was one typed line at the top of the page dot the i humbert humbert humbert humbert bosch said its the name of a character from literature or what some people consider literature entrenkin said lolita by nabokov right bosch noticed that a notation had been written in pencil at the bottom of the page that was probably howards marking entrenkin said or someone in his office she opened the next envelope the more recently mailed of the two and unfolded the letter bosch leaned over again license plates prove his innocense looks to me like theyre obviously from the same person entrenkin said also notice that innocence is spelled wrong right there was also a pencil notation at the bottom of the page bosch pulled his briefcase up onto his lap and opened it he took out the evidence envelope that contained the letter elias had been carrying in his inside suit pocket when gunned down elias was carrying this when he when he got on angels flight i forgot that the crime scene people gave it to me it might be good if you are here observing when i open it its got the same postmark as those two it was mailed to him wednesday this one i want to preserve for prints he took a pair of rubber gloves out of the cardboard dispenser in his case and put them on he then carefully removed the letter and opened it he unfolded a piece of paper similar to the first two again there was one line typed on the page he knows you know as bosch stared at the page he felt the slight flutter in his heart that he knew came with the surge of adrenaline detective bosch what does this mean i dont know but i sure wish i had opened it sooner there was no pencil notation on the bottom of the third page elias hadnt gotten around to it apparently it looks like were missing one bosch said these are marked two and three and this one came after this one would be four i know but i havent found anything that would be number one nothing in the files maybe he threw it out not realizing it meant something until the second one came maybe he thought about the letters for a moment he was mostly going on instinct and premonition but he felt the charge sustaining in his blood he felt he had found his focus this exhilarated him but at the same time he also felt a bit foolish at having unknowingly carried such a potentially key piece of the case around in his briefcase now for about twelve hours did howard ever talk to you about this case he asked no we never talked about each others work entrenkin said we had a rule you see we knew that what we were doing was something that wouldnt be understood the inspector general with one of the departments most vocal and wellknown critics not to mention him being married and all her face turned hard look what is wrong with you one minute were getting along fine and maybe making some progress on this and the next you just want to antagonize me whats wrong is that i wish you would save the weknewitwaswrong sermon for somebody else i find it hard to believe you two didnt talk about the lapd when you were alone up in that apartment bosch saw pure fire in her eyes well i dont give a good goddamn what you find hard to believe detective look we made our deal im not going to tell anyone if i make trouble for you you can make trouble for me if i did tell even my partners you know what theyd say theyd say i was crazy for not treating you as a suspect thats what i should be doing but im not im flying on pure instinct and that can be scary so to make up for it im looking for any edge or piece of luck or help i can get she was silent a moment before responding i appreciate what you are doing for me detective but i am not lying to you howard and i never spoke in detail about his cases or my work with the department never in detail the one thing i remember him saying about the harris case is so vague as to defy interpretation but if you must know what it was i will tell you he told me to brace myself because he was going to blow the department and a few of the citys big shots out of the water on this one i didnt ask him what he meant and when was that that was tuesday night thank you inspector bosch got up and walked around a bit he found himself at the window staring out at anthony quinn in shadows he looked at his watch and saw it was almost six he was supposed to rendezvous with edgar and rider at seven at the hollywood station you know what this means dont you he asked without turning back to entrenkin what does it mean he turned to her that if elias was on to something and got close to identifying the killer the real killer then it wasnt a cop who put him down she thought a moment and said youre only looking at it from one side whats the other say he was about to go to trial and pull the real killer out of his hat conclusively that would put the lie to the police evidence wouldnt it so proving harris innocent would at the same time prove the cops framed him if the real killer knew howard was on to him yes he could have come after him but say a cop knew that howard was going to prove that that cop framed harris he could have come at him too bosch shook his head its always the cops with you maybe the frame was in place before the cops even showed up he shook his head again more emphatically as if warding off a thought i dont know what im saying there was no frame its too farfetched entrenkin watched him for a long moment whatever you say detective just never say i didnt warn you bosch ignored her statement he looked at the boxes on the floor for the first time he noticed a twowheeled trolley leaning against the wall near the door entrenkin followed his eyes to it i called the security guy and told him we needed to move some boxes he brought it up bosch nodded i guess i better get this stuff to my car do you still have the search warrant or did miss langwiser take it i need to fill out the receipt i have it and ive already catalogued the files you just need to sign it bosch nodded and walked over to the trolley he remembered something and turned back to her what about the file we were looking at when you came in this morning with the photo in it what about it its in the box there well i mean uh what do you think i dont know what to think about it if youre asking me if i believed howard elias was involved with that woman i would say no we asked his wife today if it was possible he was having an affair and she said no it was not possible i get your point but i still think its impossible howard was a wellknown man in this city first of all he would hardly have to pay for sex and secondly he was smart enough to know that he would be vulnerable to extortion from these people if they recognized him then what was the file doing in his desk like i said i dont know it had to be part of a case but i dont know which one i looked at every file in the office today and didnt find anything that connects to it bosch just nodded his mind was already off the file and back on the mystery letters the last one in particular his take on it was that it was a warning to elias someone had discovered that the lawyer was in possession of a dangerous piece of information bosch was feeling more certain that the investigation the true investigation should stem from that note do you mind if i put on the television now entrenkin said its six i want to watch the news bosch came out of his reverie sure turn it on she moved to a large oak cabinet against the wall opposite the desk and opened the doors inside the cabinet were two shelves each containing a television elias apparently liked to watch more than one tv at a time probably bosch guessed so he had a better chance of catching all his appearances on newscasts entrenkin hit the power on both sets as the picture came into focus on the top set bosch saw a reporter standing in front of a strip shopping center in which three or four stores were ablaze several yards behind the reporter firefighters worked to contain the blaze but it looked to bosch as though the buildings were beyond being saved they were already gutted its happening he said not again entrenkin said her voice a scared plea chapter bosch turned on kfwb on the car radio while driving into hollywood the radio reports were more conservative than the tv news at six this was because the radio report contained only words not images the bottomline news was that there was a fire in a strip mall on normandie just a few blocks from the intersection of florence the intersection that was the flashpoint of the riots at that moment it was the only fire burning in south la and there was not yet any confirmation that the fire was an arson linked to protest or anger over the murder of howard elias but every news channel that bosch and entrenkin had checked in the office was broadcasting from the mall flames filled the screens and the image projected was clear los angeles was burning once again fucking tv he said excuse my language what about tv it was carla entrenkin she had talked her way into being taken along for the interview with harris bosch hadnt put up much of a protest he knew she might help put harris at ease if he knew who she was bosch knew it was important that harris be willing to talk to them he might be the only one to whom howard elias had confided the identity of stacey kincaids murderer overreacting as usual bosch said one fire and theyre all there showing the flames you know what that does thats like throwing gasoline on it it will spread now people will see that in their living rooms and go outside to see what is happening groups will form things will be said and people wont be able to back down from their anger one thing will lead to another and well have our mediamanufactured riot i give the people a little more credit than that entrenkin responded they know not to trust the tv civil unrest occurs when the feelings of overwhelming powerlessness hit critical mass it has nothing to do with television it has to do with society not addressing the essential needs of overlooked people bosch noted that she called it civil unrest instead of rioting he wondered if calling a riot a riot had become politically incorrect its about hope detective she continued most of the people in the minority communities of los angeles have no power have no money have no voice they subsist on hope for these things and howard elias was hope for many of them a symbol of hope for a day when things will be equal when their voice will be heard of a day when they need not fear the police officers in their community when you take hope away it leaves a void some people fill that up with anger and with violence to simply blame it on the media is wrong its much deeper than that bosch nodded i understand he said at least i think i do but all im saying is the media dont help any by exaggerating things entrenkin now nodded his point somebody once called the media the merchants of chaos yeah well they got that right it was spiro agnew right before he resigned bosch had no answer for that and decided to drop the conversation he got his cell phone out of the charger on the floor between the seats and called his home there was no answer except for the machine and he left a message asking eleanor to call him he tried not to show outwardly that he was upset he called information and got the number for the hollywood park poker room again he called the number asked for jardine the security man and he was transferred through this is jardine this is detective bosch from last night i she never showed up pal at least not on my wa you can save it pal she told me that you and she go back to the flamingo i understand what you did and its cool but i know shes back there now and i want you to give her a message tell her to call me on my cell phone as soon as she takes a break tell her its an emergency you got that mister jardine bosch stressed the word mister so that maybe jardine would realize he was making a mistake screwing with the lapd yeah jardine said i got it good bosch clicked off you know what i remember most about ninetytwo entrenkin said one image a photo that was in the times the caption was something like father and son looters and the picture showed a man leading his fouror fiveyearold son out of the smashedin door of a kmart or something and you know what each one was carrying what they had looted what each one had taken one of those thighmaster things you know that ridiculous exercise contraption that some television star from the eighties sold late at night on tv bosch shook his head at the inanity of her image they saw it on tv and so they thought it was valuable he said like howard elias she didnt respond and he realized he had been out of line even if he believed there was something valid in what he had said sorry they drove in silence for a few minutes before bosch spoke again you know what my image is of ninetytwo what i was assigned to hollywood boulevard and as you know we werent really supposed to do anything unless we saw people in danger of physical harm essentially this meant that if the looters were orderly about it we basically werent going to stop them it made no anyway i was on the boulevard and i remember a lot of weird things the scientologists surrounding their buildings standing practically shoulder to shoulder and carrying broomsticks ready to make a stand if needed the guy who ran the army surplus store near highland was in full combat infantry dress and carrying a sniper rifle over his shoulder he was marching back and forth in front of his store like he was at the gate at benning people get crazy the good and the bad its day of the locusts well arent you the wellread detective detective bosch not really i once lived with a woman who taught junior lit at grant high in the valley it was one of the books she taught i read it then anyway the image that sticks with me from ninetytwo is fredericks of hollywood the lingerie place bosch nodded i pulled up there and the place was swarming multiracial multiage people who had just lost it they cleaned that place out in about fifteen minutes i mean everything when they were done i walked in there and there was nothing left they even stole the manikins absolutely nothing but the hangers left on the floor and the chrome display racks and the thing is all it had been was underwear four cops get off for beating the shit out of rodney king on video and people respond by going nuts and stealing underwear it was so surreal that thats what comes into my head when people bring up the riots i remember walking around in that empty store it didnt matter what they took they were acting out frustrations its like the thighmasters that father and son didnt care what they took the important thing was that they took something that in some way they made a statement they had no use for those things but by taking them they were showing the man thats the lesson the father taught his son it still doesnt make boschs phone rang and he opened it it was eleanor you winning he asked he said it with a happy inflection and then immediately realized he had said it in such a way so that his passenger might not surmise what was really going on with his marriage at once he felt embarrassed and guilty that he would even let what entrenkin thought or interpreted enter into his relationship with eleanor not yet i just got here eleanor i want you to go home harry were not going to talk about this now i no im not talking about all of that i think the city have you watched the news no ive been coming here well it doesnt look good the medias lighting the match eleanor and if something happens and the city goes youre not in a good place to be bosch took a furtive glance at entrenkin he knew he was acting out white paranoia in front of her hollywood park was in inglewood a primarily black community he wanted eleanor back at their home in the hills where it was safe harry i think youre being paranoid ill be fine eleanor why take the harry i have to go theyre holding my chair ill call you later she hung up then and bosch said goodbye to a dead line he dropped the phone onto his lap for what its worth entrenkin said i think youre being paranoid thats what she said ill tell you right now there are as many blacks as whites maybe even more who dont want to see it happen again give them the benefit of the doubt detective i guess i dont have a choice the hollywood station seemed deserted when bosch and entrenkin arrived there were no patrol cars in the rear lot and when they came through the back door the rear hallway usually abuzz with activity was empty bosch stuck his head through the open door of the watch office and saw a lone sergeant at a desk a television mounted on the wall was on there were no flames on the screen it showed a news anchor in a studio the graphic hanging over his shoulder was a photo of howard elias the volume was too low for bosch to hear what was being said how we doing bosch said to the sergeant hanging in for now bosch knocked twice on the door and headed down the hallway to the detective bureau entrenkin following rider and edgar were already there they had rolled the television out of the lieutenants office and were watching the same news report they saw bosch and entrenkin and the surprise registered on their faces bosch introduced entrenkin to edgar who had not been in eliass office that morning he then asked what the latest news was the citys holding tight it looks like edgar said couple fires and thats it meantime theyre pretty much making elias into saint howard not much said about what an opportunistic asshole he was bosch glanced at entrenkin she showed nothing well lets turn it off he said we have to talk bosch brought his partners up to date and showed them the three anonymous notes that had been mailed to elias he explained entrenkins presence and said he wanted to try to get harriss cooperation and at the same time eliminate him as a potential suspect in the killings do we even know where harris is edgar asked he hasnt shown up on tv that ive seen maybe he doesnt even know about elias well well find out his current address and phoner were in eliass files looks like elias was putting him up probably trying to keep him out of trouble before the trial hes close by if hes home bosch got out his notebook and got the phone number he went to his desk and called it a man answered can i speak to harry bosch said goodnaturedly no harry here man the phone was hung up well somebodys home bosch said to the others lets go they drove in one car harris currently lived in an apartment on beverly boulevard near the cbs complex elias had put him into a large complex that wasnt luxurious but was more than nice and downtown was a straight shot down beverly there was a security door but harriss name was not on the list of occupants next to the door phone bosch had the apartment number but this did not mean anything the phone codes following occupants names did not correspond with apartment numbers for security reasons bosch called the code number for the buildings manager but got no answer look at this rider said she pointed to a listing for e howard bosch shook his shoulders as if to say it was worth a try and punched in the number a male voice answered and bosch thought it was the same voice that had answered his earlier call from the station michael harris who is it lapd we need to ask you some questions i no fucking way not without my lawyer here you dont he hung up bosch immediately called back what the fuck you want in case you dont know it yet your lawyer is dead thats why we are here now listen and dont hang up i have inspector general carla entrenkin here with me you know who she is shes going to make sure you are treated well we just need to she the watchdog lady sposed to tell when the lapd is runnin roughshod thats her hold on bosch stepped to the side and handed the phone to entrenkin tell him hes safe she took the phone giving bosch a look that said she now realized why he allowed her to come along she spoke into the phone while looking at him michael this is carla entrenkin you dont have to worry no one is here to harm you we need to ask you about howard elias that is all if harris said anything to her bosch didnt hear it the door lock buzzed and edgar pulled it open entrenkin hung up the phone and they all went in the guys a mutt edgar said i dont know why were treating him like a saint entrenkin gave edgar her look then yes you do detective edgar edgar was sufficiently cowed by her tone when harris opened the door of his fourthfloor apartment he was holding a gun at his side aright this is my home he announced i dont mean to be threatenin anybody but i need this for my persnal comfort and protection otherwise you aint comin in the place know what i mean bosch looked at the others got no read and looked back at harris he tried to contain his fury despite what entrenkin had told him earlier he still had little doubt that harris was the murderer of a child but he knew that what was important at the moment was the current investigation he had to put his enmity for the man aside in order to extract whatever information he had all right he said but you keep that weapon low and at your side you point it at one of us and were going to have a big problem we understand each other oh we understand harris backed away from the door and let them in by pointing the weapon toward the living room remember keep that thing down bosch said sternly harris dropped the gun to his side and they all entered the apartment was furnished with rental stuff puffy couch and matching chairs in light blue cheap faux wood tables and shelves pastoral prints were on the walls there was a cabinet with a television in it the news was on have a seat ladies and gentlemen harris took one of the big chairs slumping in it so that the back rose above his head giving him the appearance of sitting on a throne bosch stepped over and turned the television off then introduced everybody and showed his badge it figure the white man in charge harris said bosch ignored it i take it you know that howard elias was murdered last night he asked course i know been sittin here watchin it all gotdamned day then whyd you say you wouldnt talk to us without your lawyer if you knew your lawyer was dead i got more than one lawyer dumbshit i also got a crimnal lawyer and i got a entertainment lawyer i got lawyers dont worry and ill get another to take howies place im gonna need em man specially after they start cuttin up in south central imma have my own riot like rodney thatll put me on top bosch could barely follow harriss line of thought but he understood enough to know harris was on a power trip at his own communitys expense well lets talk about your late lawyer howard elias when was the last time you saw him last night but you already know that right chet till when till we walked out the muthafuckin door are you throwin down on me man what you interohgatin me man im trying to find out who killed elias you did that you people got him well thats a possibility thats what were trying to find out harris laughed as if what bosch had said was absurd yeah you know that thing they say about the kettle and the pot thats what that is well see when did you two part company you and howard elias when he went to his apartment and i went home which was when i dont know chet quarter to leven leven aclock i dont wear a watch people tell me the time when i want to know it they say on

i got to say chet why do you call me that because thats what you are youre a chet chet harriss smile was a challenge bosch held his gaze for a moment then turned to entrenkin and nodded she took it from there michael do you know who i am sure i seen ya on the tv just like mr elias i know you then you know i am not a police officer my job is to make sure the police officers in this city are honest and do their jobs the way they should be done harris snickered you got a lot a work head you lady i know that michael but the reason i am here is to tell you that i think these three detectives want to do what is right they want to find the person who killed howard elias whether it is a cop or not and i want to help them you should want to help as well you owe howard that much so will you please answer a few more questions harris looked around the room and at the gun in his hand it was a smith amp wesson millimeter with a satin finish bosch wondered if harris would have brandished it in front of them if he knew the murder weapon was a nine harris shoved the weapon into the crack between the seat cushion and the arm of the big chair okay i guess but not chet i don talk to white cops or tom boys you ask me entrenkin looked back at bosch and then back to harris michael i want the detectives to ask the questions they are better at it than me but i think its okay for you to answer harris shook his head you dont unnerstand lady why should i help these fuckers these people tortured me for no fucking reason i aint got forty percent of my hearing because of the lapd i aint coperatin now if you got a question then you ask it okay michael thats fine entrenkin said tell me about last night what did you and howard work on we worked on my testimony only you know how the cops call it testilying on account they never tell the damn truth when it comes to the brothers well i call it my testimoney cause the lapd is going to pay my ass for framin me and then fuckin with me damn right bosch picked up the questioning as though harris had never said he wouldnt speak to him did howard tell you that sure did mr chet did he say he could prove it was a frame yeah cause he knew who really done the murder a that little white girl and then put her in the lot near my place an it wudnt me he was goin to court monday to start to zonerate me completely and get my money my man howard bosch waited a beat the next question and answer would be crucial who who what who really did the murder did he tell you nope he said i didnt need to know said it was dangerous to know that shit but i bet its in there in his files he aint gonna get away again bosch glanced at entrenkin michael i spent all day with the files yes there are indications that howard knew who killed stacey kincaid but no name was recorded anywhere are you sure he never told you a name or gave you any indication of who this person was harris was momentarily nonplussed he evidently realized that if elias went down with the murderers name kept to himself his case might have gone down a few notches as well he would always carry the stigma of being a murderer who got off because a slick defense lawyer knew how to play a jury gotdamn he said bosch came over and sat on the corner of the coffee table so that he could be close to harris think hard he said you spent a lot of time with him who would it be i dont know harris said defensively whynt you ask pelfry about it man who is pelfry pelfrys his leg man his investigator you know his whole name i think its somethin like jenks or somethin jenks yeah jenks thas what howard call him bosch felt a finger poke his shoulder and he turned to see entrenkin give him a look she knew who pelfry was he could let it go bosch stood up and looked down at harris you came back here last night after you left elias yeah sure why anybody with you you call anybody what the fuck is this youre throwin down on me man its routine relax we ask everybody where theyve been where were you i was here man i was beat i came home and got in my bed aint nobody with me okay mind if i have a look at your pistola for a second jesus christ i shoulda known you people werent on the level gotdamn he pulled the gun out from the side of the chair cushion and handed it to bosch bosch kept his eyes on harriss until the gun was safely in his hand he then studied the weapon and smelled the barrel he smelled no oil or burned gunpowder he ejected the cartridge and thumbed out the top bullet it was a federal full metal jacket a very popular brand and make of ammunition bosch knew and the same brand used in the angels flight murders he looked back down at harris youre a convicted felon mr harris you realize it is a crime for you to have this weapon not in my house man i need protection anywhere im afraid this could send you back to prison harris smiled at him bosch could see one of his incisors was gold with a star etched on the front then take me away man he raised his arms offering his wrists for the handcuffs take me away and watch this muthafuckin place burn baby burn no actually i was thinking of cutting you a break seeing how youve been so helpful tonight but im going to have to keep the weapon id be committing a crime if i left it here with you be my gues chet i can always get what i need from my car know what i mean he said chet the way some white people say the word nigger sure i know what you mean they waited for the elevator in silence once they were inside and descending entrenkin spoke does that gun match its the same kind ammos the same well have the lab check it but i sort of doubt he would have kept it around if he killed elias with it hes not that stupid what about his car he said he could get anything from his car he didnt mean his car car he meant his crew his people together theyre a car driving somewhere together its a saying that comes from county lockup eight people to a cell they call them cars what about pelfry you know him jenkins pelfry hes a pi an independent i think hes got an office over in the union law center in downtown a lot of the civil rights lawyers use him howard was using him on this we have to talk to him then thanks for telling us there was annoyance in boschs voice he looked at his watch he figured it was too late to try to run down pelfry look its in the files i gave you entrenkin protested you didnt ask me about it how was i to know to tell you youre right you didnt know if you want i could put a call no thats okay weve got it from here inspector thanks for your help with harris we probably wouldnt have gotten up there to see him without you along you think he had anything to do with the murders im not thinking anything yet i seriously doubt hes involved bosch just looked at her hoping his eyes conveyed that he believed she was treading into areas where she had neither expertise nor a mandate to be well give you a ride back he said your car at the bradbury she nodded they were crossing the lobby to the doors detective i want to be kept apprised of the case and any significant developments fine ill talk to chief irving in the morning and see how he wants to do that he might prefer to keep you informed himself i dont want the whitewashed version i want to hear it from you whitewashed you think that whatever i tell you wont be whitewashed im flattered inspector a poor choice of words but my point being i would rather hear it from you than after it has been processed by the departments management bosch looked at her as he held the door ill remember that chapter kiz rider had run the telephone number from the mistress regina web page through the crisscross directory contained on a cdrom in the squad room computer the phone was assigned to an address on north kings road in west hollywood this did not mean that the address would be where they would find the woman however most prostitutes latenight masseuses and socalled exotic entertainers used elaborate callforwarding systems to make it hard for law enforcement agencies to find them bosch rider and edgar pulled to the curb at the intersection of melrose and kings and bosch used his phone to call the number a woman answered after four rings bosch went into his act mistress regina yes who is this my name is harry i was wondering if you were available tonight have we had a session before no i saw your web page and thought thought what i thought i might want to try a session how advanced are you i dont under what are you into im not sure yet id like to try it out you know there is no sex right no physical contact i play mind games with people nothing illegal i understand do you have a secure phone number that i can call you back at what do you mean secure i mean no pay phones she said harshly you have to give me a real number bosch gave her his cell phone number okay ill call you back in one minute be there i will i will ask for threesixseven that is you you are not a person to me you do not have a name you are simply a number threesixseven i understand he closed the phone and looked at his partners well know if it worked in about a minute you sounded nice and subservient harry rider said thank you i try my best you sounded like a cop to me edgar said well see bosch turned the car on just to be doing something rider yawned and then he had to then edgar joined in the phone rang it was mistress regina she asked for him by number you can come to me in one hour i require a donation of two hundred dollars for a onehour session cash only and in advance is that understood yes yes what uh yes mistress regina thats very good bosch looked over at rider who was in the front passenger seat and winked she smiled back at him regina gave the address and apartment number bosch turned the overhead light on and looked over at riders notes the address he had just been given was the same one rider had but the apartment number was different he told regina he would be there and they ended the call its a go but not for an hour she uses a different apartment in the same building we gonna wait edgar asked nope i want to get home and get some sleep bosch turned the car onto kings road and cruised a half block up until they found the address it was a small apartment building made of wood and stucco there was no parking anywhere so he pulled into a red zone in front of a fireplug and they got out he didnt really care if regina had a front apartment and saw the slickback they werent coming to make an arrest all they wanted was information apartments six and seven were in the back of the building anyway their doors were side by side bosch guessed the woman who called herself mistress regina lived in one apartment and worked in the other they knocked on the work door and got no answer edgar hit the door again harder and this time kicked it a couple times as well finally a voice was heard from the other side what is it open up police nothing come on regina we need to ask you some questions thats all open the door or well have to break the lock then what are you gonna do it was a baseless threat bosch knew he had no legal power to do anything if she didnt want to open her door finally bosch heard the locks turning and the door opened to reveal the angry face of the woman bosch recognized from the photo print he had found in howard eliass office what do you want let me see some id bosch badged her can we come in youre lapd this is west hollywood mister youre off your turf she pushed the door closed but edgar reached a strong arm up and stopped it he pushed it all the way back open and stepped in a mean look on his face dont you be closing the door on my face mistress regina edgar said her name in a tone that indicated that he was subservient to no one regina stepped back to allow him space to enter bosch and rider followed him in they stepped into a dimly lit landing with stairs going up and down from it bosch looked down the stairs to his left and saw them retreat into complete darkness the stairs going up led to a lighted room he moved to them and started up hey you cant just barge in here like this regina said but the protest was leaving her voice you need a warrant we dont need anything mistress regina you invited us in im harry or make that threesixseven we just talked on the phone remember she followed them up the stairs bosch turned and got his first full look at her she was wearing a sheer black robe over a leather corset and black silk underwear she wore black stockings and spikeheeled shoes her makeup consisted of dark eye liner and glaring red lipstick it was a sad caricature of a depressing male fantasy been a long time since halloween bosch said who are you supposed to be regina ignored the question what are you doing here we have questions sit down i want to show you a picture bosch pointed to a black leather couch and the woman reluctantly went to it and sat down he put his briefcase down on the coffee table and opened it he nodded slightly to edgar and started looking for the photo of elias hey wheres he going regina cried edgar had moved to another set of stairs that led up to a loft hes insuring our safety by making sure you dont have anybody hiding in the closet bosch said now take a look at this picture please he slid the photo across the table and she looked at it without touching it recognize him what is this do you recognize him of course he a client look i dont have to tell you a fucking thing about is he a client bosch yelled silencing her edgar came down from the loft and moved across the living room he glanced into the alcove kitchen saw nothing that interested him and went down the stairs to the landing bosch then heard his steps on the lower staircase as he descended into the darkness below no he isnt a client okay now will you please leave if he isnt a client then how do you recognize him what are you talking about havent you been watching tv today who is he hes that guy the one that got killed on harry it was edgar from below what i think you ought to come down here a sec bosch turned to rider and nodded take over kiz talk to her bosch went down the steps and made the turn in the landing there was now a glowing red light emanating from the room below as he came down bosch saw edgar was wideeyed what is it check this out as they crossed the room bosch saw that it was a bedroom one wall was completely mirrored against the opposite wall was a raised hospitalstyle bed with what looked like plastic sheets and restraints buckled across it next to it was a chair and a floor lamp with a red bulb in it edgar led him into a walkin closet another red bulb glowed from the ceiling there was nothing hanging on the clothes rods running down either side of the closet but a naked man stood spreadeagled on one side of the closet his arms up and wrists handcuffed to the clothes rod the cuffs were goldplated and had ornate designs on them the man was blindfolded and had a red ball gag in his mouth there were red welts caused by fingernail scratches running down his chest and between his legs a full liter bottle of coke dangled at the end of a leather strap that was tied in a slipknot around the head of his penis jesus bosch whispered i asked him if he needed help and he shook his head no i think hes her customer take the gag out bosch pulled the blindfold up on the mans forehead while edgar pulled out the gag the man immediately jerked his face to the right and tried to turn away he moved his arm and tried to use it to block the view of his face but his cuffed wrist prevented him from hiding the man was in his midthirties with a good build it seemed as though he could certainly defend himself against the woman upstairs if he wanted to please he said in a desperate voice leave me alone im fine just leave me alone were the police bosch said are you sure of course im sure you think if i needed help i wouldnt ask for it i dont need you here this is completely consensual and nonsexual just leave us alone harry edgar said i think we ought to just step the fuck back out of here and forget we ever saw this guy bosch nodded and they stepped out of the closet he looked around the room and saw that the chair had clothes draped over it he went to them and checked the pockets of the pants he pulled out the wallet and walked to the floor lamp where he opened it and studied the drivers license in the red glow he felt edgar come up behind him and look over his shoulder recognize the name no do you bosch shook his head and closed the wallet he walked back and returned it to the pocket of the pants rider and regina were silent as they came back up the steps bosch studied regina and thought he saw a look of pride and a slight smile on her face she knew that what they had seen down there had shocked them he glanced at rider and saw that she too had registered the looks on their faces everything okay she asked everythings fine he said what is it bosch ignored the question and looked at the other woman where are the keys she put a little pout on her face and reached into her bra her hand came out with the tiny cuff key and she held it out to him bosch took it and handed it to edgar go down and cut him loose if he wants to stay after that thats his business harry he said he i dont care what he said i said cut him loose we arent going to leave here with some guy in shackles down there edgar went down the stairs while bosch stared at regina thats what you get two hundred dollars an hour for believe me they get their moneys worth and you know they all come back for more hmm i wonder what it is about men maybe you should try me sometime detective might be kind of fun bosch stared a long time before breaking away and looking at rider whatve you got kiz her real name is virginia lampley she says she knows elias from tv not as a client but she says eliass investigator was here a few weeks ago asking questions just like us pelfry what did he ask a bunch of bullshit regina said before rider could answer he wanted to know if i knew anything about that little girl that was murdered last year the daughter of the car czar from tv i told him i didnt know why the hell he was asking me about that what would i know about it he tried to get rough but i got rough right back i dont let men fuck with me he left i think somebody put you on the same wild goose chase he was on maybe bosch said there was silence for a moment bosch was distracted by what he had seen in the closet he couldnt think of what else to ask hes staying it was edgar he came up the stairs and handed the cuff key back to regina she took it and made a big production out of returning it to her bra looking at bosch all the while all right lets go bosch said are you sure you dont want to stay for a coke detective virginia lampley asked a clever smile on her face were going bosch said they went silently down the steps to the door bosch the last in line on the landing he looked down into the dark room the glow of the red light was still there and bosch could see the faint outline of the man sitting on the chair in the corner of the room his face was in darkness but bosch could tell the man was looking up at him dont worry detective regina said from behind him ill take good care of him bosch turned and looked at her from the door that smile of hers was back chapter on the way back to the station rider repeatedly asked exactly what they had seen in the lower room but neither bosch nor edgar told her more than the basic fact that one of mistress reginas clients was shackled in the closet rider knew there was more to it and kept pressing but she got nowhere the man down there is not important bosch finally said as a means of ending that part of the discussion we still dont know what elias was doing with her picture and web address or for that matter why he sent pelfry to her i think she was lying edgar said she knows the whole story maybe bosch said but if she knows the story why keep it secret now that elias is dead pelfry is the key rider said we should run him down right now no bosch said not tonight its late and i dont want to talk to pelfry until weve gone through eliass files and know whats in them we master the files then we brace pelfry about mistress regina and everything else first thing tomorrow what about the fbi rider asked we meet the fbi at eight ill figure something out by then they drove the rest of the way in silence bosch dropped them off at their cars in the hollywood station parking lot and reminded them to be at parker center at eight the following morning he then parked his slickback but didnt turn in the key because the file cartons from eliass office were still in the trunk after locking the car he went to his own car he checked the clock as he was pulling out onto wilcox and saw it was tenthirty he knew it was late but he decided to make one last call before going home as he drove through laurel canyon to the valley he kept thinking about the man in the walkin closet and how he had turned his face away wishing not to be seen working homicide for so many years bosch could not be surprised anymore by the horrors people inflicted on each other but the horrors people saved for themselves were a different story he took ventura boulevard west to sherman oaks it was a busy saturday night on the other side of the hill the city could be a tinderbox of tensions but on the main drag in the valley the bars and coffee shops seemed full bosch saw the redcoated valets running to get cars in front of pinot bistro and the other upscale restaurants that lined the boulevard he saw teenagers cruising with the top down everyone was oblivious to the seething hatred and anger that churned in other parts of the city beneath the surface like an undiscovered fault line waiting to open up and swallow all above at kester he turned north and then made a quick turn into a neighborhood of tract houses sandwiched between the boulevard and the ventura freeway the houses were small and with no distinct style the hiss of the freeway was always present they were cops houses except they cost between four and five hundred thousand dollars and few cops could afford them boschs old partner frankie sheehan had bought early and bought well he was sitting on a quarter of a million dollars in equity his retirement plan if he made it to retirement bosch pulled to the curb in front of sheehans house and left the car running he got out his phone looked up sheehans number in his phone book and made the call sheehan picked up after two rings his voice alert hed been awake frankie its harry my man im out front why dont you come out and well take a drive where to it doesnt matter silence frankie okay give me a couple minutes bosch put the phone away and reached into his coat pocket for a smoke that wasnt there damn he said while he waited he thought about the time he and sheehan were looking for a drug dealer suspected of having wiped out a rivals operation by going into a rock house with an uzi and killing everyone in it six people customers and dealers alike theyd repeatedly pounded on the door of the suspects apartment but no one answered they were thinking about their options when sheehan heard a tiny voice from inside the apartment saying come in come in they knocked on the door once again and called out that it was the police they waited and listened again the voice called out come in come in bosch tried the knob and it turned the door was unlocked assuming combat stance they entered the apartment only to find it empty except for a large green parrot in a cage in the living room and lying right there in full view on a kitchen table was an uzi submachine gun broken down and ready for cleaning bosch walked over to the door and knocked on it once again the parrot called out come in come in a few minutes later when the suspect returned from the hardware store with the gun oil he needed to finish his work on the uzi he was arrested ballistics matched the gun to the killings and he was convicted after a judge refused to throw out the fruits of the search though the defendant claimed the entry of the apartment was without permission and unlawful the judge ruled that bosch and sheehan were acting in good faith when they acted on the invitation from the parrot the case was still winding its way through the nations appellate courts while the killer remained in jail the jeeps front passenger door opened and sheehan got into the car when did you get this ride he asked when they made me start driving a slickback oh yeah forgot about that yeah you rhd bigshots dont have to worry about that shit so whats up you got your ass out in the wind on this case dont you yeah its out there howre margaret and the girls doing theyre all fine what are we doing riding talking what i dont know is that irish place still over on van nuys no that ones gone tell you what go on up to oxnard and go right theres a little sports bar down there bosch pulled away from the curb and started following the directions i was just thinking about the pollywantsanuzi case he said sheehan laughed that one still cracks me up i cant believe its shot the rapids this far i hear the douche bags down to one last shot el supremo court itll make it it woulda got shot down by now if it wasnt going to fly no pun intended well whats it been eight years we got our moneys worth even if they do kick him loose yeah six murders eight years sounds fair six douche bags you still like saying douche bag dont you yeah im partial to it so you didnt come over the hill to talk about parrots and douche bags and old times did you no frankie i need to ask you about the kincaid thing why me why do you think you were lead detective everything i know is in the files you should be able to get them youre lead on elias i got em but the files dont always have everything in them sheehan pointed to a red neon sign and bosch pulled over there was a parking place at the curb right outside the bars door this place is always pretty dead sheehan said even saturday nights i dont know how the guy makes it by must be taking numbers or selling weed on the side frankie bosch said between you and me i gotta know about the fingerprints i dont want to be chasing my tail out there i mean i got no reason to doubt you but i want to know if you heard anything you know what i mean sheehan got out of the cherokee without a word and walked to the door bosch watched him go in and then got out himself inside the place was just about empty sheehan was sitting at the bar the bartender was drawing a beer off the tap bosch took the stool next to his former partner and said make it two bosch took out a twenty and put it on the bar sheehan still hadnt looked at him since he had asked the question the bartender put down the frosted mugs on napkins that advertised a superbowl party almost three months before he took boschs twenty and went down to the cash register in unison bosch and sheehan took long pulls on their drinks ever since oj sheehan said whats that you know what im talking about ever since the juice nothing is solid anymore no evidence no cop nothing you can take anything you want into a courtroom and there still will be somebody who can tear it to shreds drop it on the floor and piss on it everybody questions everything even cops even partners bosch took more of his beer before saying anything im sorry frankie i got no reason to doubt you or the prints its just that weeding through this elias stuff it looks like he was going into court next week with the idea of proving who killed the girl and he wasnt talking about harris somebody who i dont know but im trying to look at it from his side of things if he had somebody other than harris then how the hell did these prints end up on elias was a fucking mutt and as soon as they get him in the ground im gonna go out there one night and do my granddaddys irish jig on his grave then im gonna piss on it and never think about elias again all i can say is that its too fucking bad harris wasnt with him on that train goddamned murderer that would have been hitting the quinella the both of them being put down together sheehan held his glass up in a toast to eliass killer and then took a deep swallow bosch could almost feel the hate radiating from him so nobody fucked with the scene bosch said the prints are legit fuckinga legit the room was sealed by patrol nobody went in until i got there i then watched over everything we were dealing with the kincaid family and i knew what that meant the car czar and heavy contributor to local political coffers i was on the straight and narrow with everything the prints were on her schoolbook a geography book sid got four fingers on one side and a thumb on the other as if he had picked the book up by the binding those prints were perfect the guy mustve been sweating like a pig when he left em because they were grade a perfect he drained his glass and then held it up so the bartender would see he needed a refill i cant believe you cant smoke anymore in a fucking bar in this city sheehan said fucking douche bags yeah anyway we ran everything and harris pops up excon did time for assault burglary hes got about as much a legitimate reason for his prints being in her room as i have a chance of winning the lottery and i dont fucking play so bingo we got our man we go hook him up remember at that time the girls body hadnt turned up we were operating on the belief she might still be alive somewhere we were wrong but we didnt know it at the time so we hook him up bring him downtown and put him in the room only this motherfucker wont tell us the time of day three days and we get nothing we never even took him to a cell at night he was in that room seventytwo straight hours we worked in teams and in shifts and we could not crack his egg never gave us jack shit i tell you what id like to kill the fuck but i gotta respect him for that he was the best i ever went against sheehan took a double gulp from his new beer bosch was still only halfway through his first he was content to let sheehan talk and tell the story at his own pace without interrupting him with questions on the last day some of the guys lost it a little bit did things bosch closed his eyes he had been wrong about sheehan me too harry he said it matter of factly as if it felt good to finally say it out loud he drank more of his beer turned on his stool and looked about the bar as if seeing it for the first time there was a tv mounted in a corner it was tuned to espn were off the record here right harry sure sheehan turned back and leaned toward bosch in a conspiratorial sort of way what harris says happened happened but that doesnt excuse what he did he rapes and strangles that little girl we stick a pencil in his ear big fucking deal he gets off and im the new mark fuhrman a racist cop who planted evidence i just wish somebody could tell me how the fuck i couldve planted those prints he was getting loud luckily only the bartender was noticing i know bosch said im sorry man i shouldnt have asked sheehan went on as if he hadnt heard bosch i guess i always carried around a set of throwdown prints that belonged to a douche bag i wanted to send away i then put them on the book dont ask me how and voilà we got our douche bag only why would i pick harris to pin it on i never knew the mutt or had anything to do with him and theres nobody on this planet that can prove i did because its not there to be proved youre right sheehan shook his head and looked down into his beer i quit caring about shit when that jury came in and said not guilty when they said i was guilty when they believed that man instead of us bosch remained silent he knew that sheehan had to say his piece were losing the battle man i see that now its all a game the fucking lawyers what they can do to you to the evidence i give up harry i really do i already decided its twentyfive and out for me i got eight more months and im counting the fuckers down im gonna punch out move on up to blue heaven and leave this toilet for all the douche bags i think thats a good idea frankie bosch said quietly he couldnt think of what else he could say he was hurt and stunned by his friends lapse into a complete state of hate and cynicism he understood it but was simply surprised by the complete toll it had taken he was also disappointed in himself and privately embarrassed at how wholeheartedly he had defended sheehan to carla entrenkin i remember on that last day sheehan said i was in there with him in the room and i got so fucking angry i just wanted to take my gun out and blow his shit away but i knew i couldnt because he knew where she was he had the girl bosch just nodded we had tried everything and got nothing he broke us before we could break him it got down to where i was just begging him to tell us it was embarrassing harry and what did he do he just stared at me as if i wasnt there he said nothing he did nothing and then then the anger just came over me like like i dont know what like it was a bone caught in my throat like it never had before there was a trash can in the corner of the room i went over and pulled the bag out and just pulled it right down over his fucking head and i grabbed it around his neck and i held it and i held it and sheehan started crying and trying to finish and they they had to pull me off of him he put his elbows on the bar and pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes for a long time he didnt move bosch saw a drop fall from his chin and into his beer he reached over and put his hand on his old partners shoulder its okay frankie without moving his hands away from his face sheehan spoke you see harry i became the very thing that i spent all these years hunting i wanted to kill him right there and then i would have if my guys hadnt come in im never going to be able to forget that its okay man sheehan drank some beer and seemed to recover somewhat after i did what i did that opened the door the other guys they did that thing with the pencil popped his fucking ear drum we all became monsters like vietnam going wild in the villages we probably wouldve killed the guy but you know what saved him the girl stacey kincaid saved him hows that they found the body we got the word and went out to the scene we left harris in a cell alive he was lucky the word came when it did he stopped to take another gulp of beer i went out there just a block from harriss place she was pretty much decomposed the young ones go fast but i remember how she looked like a little angel her arms out like she was flying bosch remembered the pictures from the newspapers stacey kincaid had been a pretty little girl harry leave me alone now sheehan said quietly im going to walk back no let me give you a ride no thanks im walking you sure youre all right im fine just a little worked up thats all this is going to stay between us right till the end man sheehan tried a weak smile but he still didnt look at bosch do me one favor hieronymus bosch remembered when they had been a team they only used their formal names hieronymus and francis when they were talking seriously and from the heart sure francis what when you catch the guy who did elias i dont care if its a cop or not shake his hand for me you tell him hes my hero but tell him he missed a good chance tell him he shouldve gotten harris too a half hour later bosch opened the door to his home he found his bed empty but this time he was too tired to stay awake waiting for eleanor he started stripping off his clothes and thinking about his plans for the next day he finally sat down on the bed ready for sleep and reached for the light the moment he was in darkness the phone rang he turned the light back on and picked up the phone you bastard a womans voice familiar but he couldnt place it who is this carla entrenkin who do you think do you really think i wouldnt know what you did i dont know what youre talking about what happened i just watched channel four your buddy harvey button what did he have oh he blew it up real big lets see if i can quote him correctly a link between elias and an internet prostitution ring was found in eliass office a source close to the investigation says it is believed by this source that elias may have had liaisons with at least one of the women who advertised her services as a dominatrix on the web site i think that about sums it up i hope you are happy i didnt dont bother she hung up bosch sat there a long time thinking about what she had said chastain you asshole he said out loud he turned out the light again and dropped back on the bed he was soon asleep and having the same dream again he was riding angels flight going up only now there was a little blond girl seated across the aisle from him she looked at him with sad and empty eyes chapter bosch had a surprise waiting for him when he pushed the supply cart stacked with file boxes through the door of deputy chief irvings conference room it was quarter to eight on sunday morning there were six fbi agents already crowded into the room and waiting the surprise was the lead agent who stepped over to bosch his hand out and a smile on his face harry bosch the man said roy lindell bosch replied bosch pushed the cart over to the table and took the mans hand youre on this what happened to oc organized crime was getting boring especially after the tony aliso case hard to top that one dont you think yeah a couple of years earlier they had worked the aliso murder the trunk music case according to the local media bosch and lindell had started out as adversaries but by the time the case was concluded in las vegas there was a respect between the two that certainly wasnt shared between the two agencies they worked for bosch immediately took lindells assignment to the elias case as a good sign listen lindell said i think we have a few minutes you want to grab a cup of coffee and talk about things sounds like a plan as they walked down the hall to the elevator they were met by chastain who was heading to the conference room bosch introduced lindell you guys going for coffee ill come with you no thats okay bosch said weve got some stuff to talk about and i dont want it coming out of harvey buttons mouth on the news later know what i mean i dont know what youre talking about bosch bosch said nothing chastain looked at lindell and then back at bosch never mind the coffee he said i dont need artificial stimulants anyway when they were alone at the elevator lobby bosch warned lindell about chastain hes leaking he said you see channel four last night the internet dominatrix thing yeah six people knew about that me my two partners chastain carla entrenkin and deputy chief irving i can vouch for my partners and i doubt entrenkin would leak anything negative about elias either irving or chastain talked to harvey button my bet is on chastain irvings been trying to put a clamp on things from the start well was the story bullshit or what looks that way we cant make a connection whoever leaked it did it to smear elias even things up a bit ill watch him but you know sometimes leaks arent from the obvious source the elevator opened and lindell stepped on leaving bosch standing there thinking about irving and whether it was possible that he was the leak you coming lindell asked bosch stepped onto the elevator and pushed the button for the third floor you check the news this morning lindell asked hows it going out there so far so good a couple fires last night but that was about it no looting and its pretty quiet now supposed to be rain coming in by tomorrow maybe that will help they went into the cafeteria and took their coffees to a table bosch checked his watch and saw it was five before eight he looked at lindell so lindell laughed so what the fuck we going to divvy this up or what yeah i got a deal for you roy a good deal lets hear it you can have it ill step back and let you run the show i just want one thing i want my team to run with the original case stacey kincaid well take the original murder book and review everything rhd did on the case then well take everything elias did and go from there lindells eyes narrowed their focus as he wondered what this meant bosch continued it looks like eliass plan was to go into court this week and try to prove that michael harris didnt kill her he was going to name her killer and who thats the milliondollar question we dont know he was keeping it in his head instead of his files but thats why i want the case because if he had a bead on somebody that somebodys a pretty good suspect for the angels flight murders lindell looked down at his smoking coffee and was quiet a long moment sounds like lawyer bullshit to me grandstanding how was he gonna find the killer if you guys on the pd didnt that is if the killer really wasnt michael harris like every cop and white person in this town believes bosch hiked his shoulders even if he was wrong even if he was going to name somebody as a smoke screen it could have made him a target he purposely wasnt telling lindell everything particularly about the mystery notes he wanted the fbi agent to think that boschs team would be chasing rainbows while he would be commanding the real investigation so you run with that and i chase down bad cops is that the deal pretty much chastain should have a head start for you first of all hes the most familiar with the black warrior thing he handled the iad investigation on it and yeah but he cleared everybody on it maybe he messed up or maybe he was told to clear everybody lindell nodded that he understood the suggestion also his crew was supposedly going through eliass files yesterday and making a list and i just brought in five more boxes of files from all of that youll get a list of guys to talk to i think youre in good shape if im in such great shape why are you giving this side of things to me cause im a nice guy bosch youre holding out i just have a hunch thats all that what harris really was framed i dont know but something wasnt right with the case i want to find out what it was so meantime im stuck with chastain and his crew yup thats the deal well what am i going to do with them you just told me chastains a leak send them out for coffee and then run away and hide lindell laughed this is what i would do bosch then added on a serious note id put two of them on elias and two on perez you know doing the paper managing the evidence taking the autopsies which will probably be today anyway that will keep them busy and out of your way regardless of whether its them or not youve got to put at least one body on perez weve treated her as an alsoran which she obviously was but you gotta do the due diligence on it or it can come back on you if you ever go to court and the lawyer asks why perez wasnt pursued as the primary target right right we gotta cover all the bases right lindell nodded but said nothing further so come on do we have a deal bosch prompted yeah sounds like a plan to me but i want to know what you and your people are doing you keep in touch you got it oh and by the way one of the iad guys is a spanish speaker fuentes put him on perez lindell nodded and pushed back from the table he left his coffee cup there untouched bosch took his with him on his way through the anteroom to irvings conference room bosch noticed that the deputy chiefs adjutant was not at his desk he saw a telephone message pad on the blotter and reached down and grabbed it as he passed by he put it in his pocket and entered the conference room boschs partners and the iad men were now in the conference room irving was there also it was very crowded after some brief introductions the floor was turned over to bosch who briefed the newcomers and irving on the investigation up to that point he left out specific details about the visit to regina lampleys apartment making that part of the investigation appear to be at a dead end he also made no mention at all of his barroom talk with frankie sheehan when he was done he nodded to irving who then took the floor bosch moved over to the wall and leaned next to a bulletin board irving had apparently had installed for the investigators to use irving began speaking of the political tensions surrounding the case like a storm pressure cell he mentioned that protest marches were scheduled that day in front of three of the south end police stations and at parker center he said city councilman royal sparks and reverend preston tuggins were scheduled to be guests that morning on a local meetthepress type of television show called talk of la he said the chief of police had met with tuggins and other south central church leaders the night before to call in markers and urge them to call for calm and restraint from the pulpits during the mornings services we are sitting on a powder keg here people irving said and the way to defuse it is to solve this case one way or the other quickly while he talked bosch took out the phone message pad and wrote on it he then checked the room to make sure all eyes were on irving and quietly tore off the top sheet he reached over and tacked it to the bulletin board and then nonchalantly moved inch by inch down the wall and away from the board the sheet he had put on the board had chastains name on it in the message section it said harvey button called said thanks for the tip will call back later irving wound up his comments with a mention about the channel story someone in this room leaked information to a television reporter yesterday i am warning you people that we will not have this that one story was your grace period one more leak and you people will be the ones under investigation he looked around the room at the lapd faces to make sure the message was clear okay that is it he finally said i will leave you to it detective bosch agent lindell i would like to be briefed at noon on our progress no problem chief lindell said before bosch could respond i will be talking to you then fifteen minutes later bosch was walking down the hallway to the elevators again edgar and rider were following behind harry where are we going edgar asked well work out of hollywood station what doing what who is going to run the show lindell i made a deal he runs the show we do something else suits me edgar said too many agents and too much brass around here anyway bosch got to the elevators and pushed the call button what exactly are we doing harry rider asked he turned and looked at them starting over he said chapter the squad room was completely empty which was unusual even for a sunday under the twelveandtwelve readiness plan all detectives not assigned to timecritical investigations were to be in uniform and out on the street the last time such deployment had been instituted was after a major earthquake had rocked the city in the elias murder was a social rather than a geologic cataclysm but its magnitude was just as great bosch carried the box containing eliass files on the black warrior case to what they called the homicide table a raft of desks pushed up against each other to create a huge boardroomlike table the section that belonged to team one boschs team was at the end near an alcove of file cabinets he put the box in the middle where his teams three desks conjoined dig in he said harry rider said not happy with his lack of direction okay listen this is what i want kiz youre going to be master of the ship jerry and i will work the field rider groaned master of the ship meant that she was to be the keeper of the facts she was to become familiar with all facets of the files a walking compendium of the details of the investigation since they were starting off with an entire carton of files this was a lot of work it also meant she would not be doing much if anything in the way of field investigation and no detective wants to be stuck in a windowless and empty office all day i know bosch said but i think you are best for it weve got a ton of stuff here and your mind and your computer will be best for keeping track of it next time i get the field there might not be a next time if we dont do something this time lets see what we got here they spent the next ninety minutes going through eliass files on the harris case pointing out specific items to each other when they seemed to warrant attention other times tossing files back into the box when their importance was not apparent bosch spent his time with the investigative files that elias had subpoenaed from the lapd he had a copy of the entire rhd murder book reading the daily investigative summaries turned in by sheehan and other rhd detectives bosch noted that the case seemed initially to be lacking a focus stacey kincaid had been taken from her room in the night her abductor jimmying the lock on a bedroom window with a screwdriver and then grabbing the girl while she slept initially suspecting an inside job the detectives interviewed the gardeners the pool man a local maintenance man a plumber who had been in the house two weeks earlier as well as the sanitation men and postal workers who had the route that included the kincaids home in brentwood teachers janitors and even fellow students from staceys private school in west hollywood were interviewed but the wide net being thrown by sheehan and his cohorts was pulled in after the lab came up with the fingerprint match between the missing girls schoolbook and michael harris the case then shifted to a complete focus on locating harris taking him into custody and then attempting to make him confess to what he had done with the girl the second section of the file also dealt with the crime scene investigation and efforts to connect harris to the body through scientific analysis and technology this proved to be a dead end the girls body had been found by two homeless men in a vacant lot the body was naked and badly decomposed after four days it had apparently been washed after her death and therefore was lacking any significant microscopic evidence that could be analyzed and connected to harriss apartment or car though the girl appeared to have been raped no bodily fluids belonging to her attacker were recovered her clothes were never found the ligature that had been used to strangle her had been cut away by her killer and that too was never found in the end the only evidence that connected harris to the crime was his fingerprints on the book in staceys bedroom and the disposal of the body in the vacant lot less than two blocks from his apartment bosch knew that was usually more than enough to win a conviction he had worked cases in which convictions were won with less evidence but that was before oj simpson before juries looked at police in los angeles with suspicious and judging eyes bosch was writing a list of things to do and people to be interviewed when edgar cried out yahtzee bosch and rider looked at him and waited for an explanation remember the mystery notes edgar said the second or third one said license plates prove hes innocent wait a second bosch said he opened his briefcase and took out the file containing the notes the third one license plates prove his innocence came in april five innocence spelled wrong okay heres eliass file on subpoena returns got one here dated april fifteen for hollywood wax and shine thats where harris worked before they arrested him it seeks quote copies of all records and receipts of customer orders and billings containing license plate numbers of said customers between the dates of april one and june fifteen of last year its gotta be what the note was talking about bosch leaned back in his chair to think about this this is a subpoena return right it was approved right well april one and june fifteen thats seventyfive days there seventysix days rider corrected seventysix days that would be a lot of receipts we got none here and there werent any in the office i saw there should be boxes of receipts maybe he returned them edgar said you said he subpoenaed copies edgar hiked his shoulders another thing why those days bosch asked the murder of the girl was july twelve why not subpoena the receipts right up until then because he knew what he was looking for rider said or knew within the parameters of those dates knew what they dropped into silence boschs mind was running the puzzle but coming up empty the license plate clue was still as mysterious as the mistress regina lead then by joining the two mysteries he came up with something pelfry again he said we need to talk to him he stood up jerry get on the phone see if you can run down pelfry and set up an interview for as soon as you can get it im going out back for a few minutes normally when bosch told his partners he was going out back it meant he was going outside the building to have a smoke as he walked toward the rear doorway rider called after him harry dont do it he waved without turning back dont worry im not out in the lot bosch stood and looked around he knew he had done some of his best analytical thinking while standing outside smoking he hoped he could put something together now without the aid of a smoke he looked into the sand jar that the stations smokers used and saw a halfsmoked cigarette protruding from the sand there was lipstick on it he decided he wasnt that desperate yet he thought about the mystery notes he knew because of postmarks and the markings made on the notes by elias that they had numbers two three and four but not the first note the meaning of the fourth note the warning elias was carrying with him was obvious the third note they now had a line on thanks to the subpoena return edgar had come across but the second note dot the i humbert humbert still made no sense to bosch he looked at the cigarette protruding from the sand again but once more dismissed it he remembered he carried no matches or lighter anyway it suddenly occurred to him that the one other piece of the puzzle that seemed to stand out as making no sense at least so far was the mistress regina connection whatever that was bosch turned and quickly headed back into the station edgar and rider had their heads down and into the paperwork when he came to the table bosch immediately began looking through the stacks of files who has the mistress regina file over here edgar said he handed over the file and bosch opened it and took out the photo printout of the dominatrix he then put it down next to one of the mystery notes and tried to make a comparison between the printing on the note and the printing below the photo the web page address it was impossible for him to determine if the same hand had printed both lines he was no expert and there were no obvious anomalies in the printing to make a comparison easy when bosch took his hand off the printout its top and bottom edges rose an inch off the desk telling him that at one time the page had been folded top and bottom as if to be placed in an envelope i think this is the first note he said bosch had often found that when he made a logic breakthrough it was like clearing a clog in a drain the pipe was open and other breaks soon came it happened now he saw what he could have and maybe should have seen all along jerry call eliass secretary right now ask her if he had a color printer in the office we should have seen this i should have seen it seen what just make the call edgar started looking through a notebook for a phone number rider got up from her spot and came around next to bosch she looked down at the printout she was now riding on boschs wave she saw where he was going this was the first one bosch said only he didnt keep the envelope because he probably thought it was crank mail but it probably was edgar said the phone to his ear we were there the woman didnt know the man and didnt know what the hell we he stopped and listened when his line was picked up mrs quimby it is detective edgar from yesterday i have one quick question for you do you know if there was a color printer in the office a printer that could print out stuff from one of the computers in color he waited and listened his eyes on bosch and rider thank you mrs quimby he hung up no color printer bosch nodded and looked down at the printout of mistress regina we should have picked up on this yesterday rider said bosch nodded and started to ask edgar if he had contacted pelfry the private investigator when his pager went off he cut it off and pulled it off his belt it was his home number eleanor yeah i talked to him edgar said hell meet us at noon at his office i didnt mention anything about receipts or this regina i just said we needed to talk okay bosch picked up his phone and punched in his home number eleanor answered after three rings she sounded either sleepy or sad eleanor harry everything all right he slid back into his seat and rider went back to hers im fine i just when did you get in a little while ago did you win i didnt really play after you called me there last night i left bosch leaned forward and put an elbow on the table a hand against his forehead well whered you go a hotel harry i just came back for some clothes and things i eleanor there was a long silence on the phone bosch heard edgar say he was going to get some coffee in the watch office rider said shed go along even though bosch knew she didnt drink coffee she had an assortment of herbal teas she kept in the drawer of her desk harry its not right eleanor said what are you talking about eleanor another long moment of silence went by before she answered i was thinking about that movie we saw last year about the titanic i remember and the girl in that she fell in love with that boy that she only met right there on the boat and it was i mean she loved him so much so much that at the end she wouldnt leave she didnt take the lifeboat so she would be with him i remember eleanor he remembered her crying in the seat next to him and his smiling and not being able to understand how a film would affect her in such a way you cried yes its because everybody wants that kind of love and harry you deserve that from me i no eleanor what you give me is more than she jumped from a lifeboat back onto the titanic harry she laughed a little bit but it sounded sad to bosch i guess nobody can ever top that youre right nobody can thats why it was a movie listen you are all ive ever wanted eleanor you dont have to do anything for me yes i do i do i love you harry but not enough you deserve better eleanor no please i im going to go away for a while think about things will you wait there ill be home in fifteen minutes we can talk about no no thats why i paged i cant do this in person he could tell she was crying well im coming up there i wont be here she said urgently i packed the car before i paged you i knew youd try to come bosch put his hand over his eyes he wanted to be in darkness where will you be im not sure will you call yes ill call are you all right im ill be fine eleanor i love you i know i never said that enough but i she made a shushing sound in the phone and he stopped i love you harry but i have to do this after a long moment during which he felt a deep tearing inside he said okay eleanor the silence that followed was as dark as the inside of a coffin his coffin goodbye harry she finally said ill see you she hung up bosch took his hand away from his face and the phone from his ear in his mind he saw a swimming pool its surface as smooth as a blanket on a bed he remembered a time long before when he had been told his mother was dead and that he was alone in the world he ran to that pool and dove beneath the calm surface into its warm water at the bottom he screamed until his air was gone and his chest ached until he had to choose between staying there and dying or going up and life bosch now longed for that pool and its warm water he wanted to scream until his lungs burst inside him everything okay he looked up it was rider and edgar edgar carried a steaming cup of coffee rider had a look that said she was concerned or maybe even scared by the look she was seeing on boschs face everythings cool bosch said everythings fine chapter they had ninety minutes to kill before the meeting with pelfry bosch told edgar to drive over to hollywood wax amp shine on sunset not far from the station edgar pulled to the curb and they sat there watching business was slow most of the men in orange coveralls who dried and polished the cars for minimum wage and tips were sitting around drying rags draped over their shoulders waiting most of them stared balefully at the slickback as if the police were to blame i guess people arent that interested in having their cars washed when they might end up turned over or torched edgar said bosch didnt answer bet they all wish they were in michael harriss shoes edgar continued staring back at the workers hell id trade three days in an interview room and pencils in my ears to be a millionaire so then you believe him bosch said bosch hadnt told him about frankie sheehans barroom confession edgar was quiet a moment and then nodded yeah harry i guess i sort of do bosch wondered how he had been so blind as to not even have considered that the torturing of a suspect could be true he wondered what it was about edgar that made him accepting of the suspects story over the cops was it his experience as a cop or as a black man bosch assumed it had to be the latter and it depressed him because it gave edgar an edge he could never have im gonna go in talk to the manager bosch said maybe you should stay with the car fuck that they wont touch it they got out and locked the car as they walked toward the store bosch thought about the orange coveralls and wondered if it was coincidence he guessed that most of the men working at the car wash were excons or fresh out of county lockup institutions in which they also had to wear orange coveralls inside the store bosch bought a cup of coffee and asked for the manager the cashier pointed down a hallway to an open door on the way down the hall edgar said i feel like a coke but i dont think i can drink a coke after what i saw last night in that bitchs closet a man was sitting at a desk in the small windowless office with his feet up on one of the open drawers he looked up at bosch and edgar and said yes officers what can i do for you bosch smiled at the mans deduction he knew he had to be part businessman part parole officer if the polishers were excons it was the only job they could get that meant the manager had seen his share of cops and knew how to pick them out either that or he saw them pull up in the slickback were working a case bosch began the howard elias case the manager whistled a few weeks ago he subpoenaed some of your records receipts with license plate numbers on them you know anything about that the manager thought about it for a few moments all i know is that i was the one who had to go through everything and get it copied for his guy his guy edgar asked yeah what do you think a guy like elias comes get the stuff himself he sent somebody i got his card here he lowered his feet to the floor and opened the desks pencil drawer there was a stack of business cards with a rubber band around it he took it off and looked through the cards and chose one he showed it to bosch pelfry edgar asked bosch nodded did his guy say exactly what they were looking for in all that stuff he asked i dont know youd have to ask them or i mean ask pelfry did pelfry come back with the stuff yet no it was copies anyway i mean he came back but not to bring back the receipts then whyd he come back edgar asked he wanted to see one of michael harriss old time cards from when he worked here which one edgar asked a tone of urgency in his voice i dont remember man i gave him a copy you go talk to him and maybe he did he have a subpoena for the time card bosch asked no he just asked for it you know i said sure and got it for him but he gave me the date and you didnt i dont remember it anyway look if you want to ask more about this then maybe you better call our lawyer im not going to get involved in talking about stuff i dont never mind that stuff bosch said tell me about michael harris whats to tell i never had a problem with the guy he was okay then they came in and said he killed that little girl and did things to her it didnt seem like the guy i knew but he hadnt been working here that long maybe five months know where he was before that edgar asked yeah up at corcoran corcoran was a state prison near bakersfield bosch thanked the manager and they left he took a few sips of his coffee but dumped it in a trash can before getting back to the car while bosch waited at the passenger door for it to be unlocked edgar went around to his side he stopped before opening the door goddammit what they wrote shit on the door bosch came around and looked someone had used light blue chalk the chalk used to write washing instructions on the windshields of clients cars to cross out the words to protect and serve on the drivers side front fender then written in large letters were the words to murder and maim bosch nodded his approval thats pretty original harry lets go kick some ass no jerry let it go you dont want to start something it might take three days to end it like last time like florence and normandie edgar sullenly unlocked the car and then opened boschs door were right by the station bosch said after he got in we can go back and spray it off or we can use my car id like to use one of those assholes faces to clean it off after they had the car cleaned up there was still time for them to drive by the lot where stacey kincaids body had been found it was off western and was on the way downtown where they would go to meet pelfry edgar was silent the whole way there he had taken the vandalism of the patrol car personally bosch didnt mind the silence though he used the time to think about eleanor he felt guilty because deep down and despite his love for her he knew that he was feeling a growing relief that their relationship was coming to a head one way or the other this is it edgar said he pulled the car to the curb and they scanned the lot it was about an acre and bordered on both sides by apartment buildings with banners announcing movein bonuses and financing they didnt look like places where people would want to live unless they had no choice the whole neighborhood had a rundown and desperate feel bosch noticed two old black men sitting on crates in the corner of the lot under a sprawling and shadegiving eucalyptus tree he opened the file hed brought with him and studied the map that charted the location of the body he estimated that it was less than fifty feet from where the two men were now sitting he turned pages in the file until he found the incident report which named the two witnesses who reported finding the body im getting out he said im going to go talk to those guys he got out and edgar did too they crossed the lot nonchalantly and approached the two men as they got closer bosch saw sleeping bags and an old coleman camp stove parked against the trunk of the eucalyptus were two supermarket carts filled with clothing bags of aluminum cans and assorted junk are you men rufus gundy and andy mercer depends on whos doin the askin bosch showed his badge i wanted to ask a few questions about the body you guys found here last year yeah what took you so long are you mr gundy or mr mercer im mercer bosch nodded why do you say we took so long werent you interviewed by detectives when you found the body we was interviewed but not by no detectives some weteared patrol boy akst us what we knew bosch nodded he pointed to the sleeping bags and the camp stove you guys live here we runnin a piece of bad luck we just stayin till we on our feet again bosch knew there was nothing in the incident report about the two men living on the lot the report said they were passing through the lot looking for cans when they came across her body he thought about this and realized what had happened you were living here then werent you neither of them answered you didnt tell the cops that because you thought you might get run off still no reply so you hid your sleeping bags and your stove and called it in you told that patrol officer that you were just passing through finally mercer spoke ifn youre so smart how come you aint chief yet bosch laughed because theyre smart enough not to make me chief so tell me something mr mercer and mr gundy if you two were sleeping here during nights back then you probably wouldve found that body a lot sooner if it had been here the whole time she was missing right most likely gundy said so somebody probably dumped that body the night before you found it could be gundy said yeah id say that was so mercer added with you two sleeping what forty fifty feet away this time they didnt verbally agree bosch stepped over and dropped into a catchers squat so he was on their eye level tell me what you men saw that night we didnt see nothin gundy said adamantly but we heard things mercer said heard things what things a car pull up mercer said a door open then a trunk we heard somethin heavy hit the ground then the trunk closed and the door then the car drive off you didnt even look edgar asked quickly he had stepped over and was leaning down hands on his knees a body gets dumped there fifty feet away and you dont look no we dont look mercer retorted people be dumpin their garbage and whatnot in the field most every night we never look we keep our heads down in the morning we look we got some nice items time to time from what people throw away we always wait till mornin to check out what they throw bosch nodded that he understood and hoped edgar would leave the men alone and you never told all of this to the cops nope mercer and gundy said in unison what about anybody else you ever told it to somebody who could verify this has been the true story all along the men thought about it mercer was shaking his head no when gundy nodded yes the only one we told was mr eliass man bosch glanced at edgar and then back at gundy whos that his man the investigator we told him what we told you he said mr elias was gonna use us in court one day he said mr elias would be takin care of us pelfry edgar asked was that his name could be gundy said i dont know mercer didnt say anything you guys read the paper today bosch asked see any tv news on what tv mercer asked bosch just nodded and stood up they didnt even know elias was dead how long ago was that when mr eliass man talked to you be about a month mercer said somewhere around that bosch looked at edgar and nodded that he was done edgar nodded back thanks for your help bosch said can i buy you guys some dinner he reached into his pocket and pulled out his money he gave each man a ten they thanked him politely and he walked away as they sped north on western to wilshire bosch started riffing on what the information from the two homeless men meant harris is clear he said excitedly thats how elias knew because the body was moved it was dumped there three days after she was dead and harris was in custody when it was moved the best alibi in the world elias was going to bring those two old guys into court and put the lie to the lapd yeah but hold on harry edgar said it doesnt clear harris completely it could just mean he had an accomplice you know who moved the body while he was in lockup yeah then why dump it so close to his apartment and further implicate him i dont think theres an accomplice i think it was the real killer he read in the paper or saw on tv that they had harris as a suspect and he moved the body to his neighborhood to be another nail in harriss coffin what about the fingerprints how did harriss prints get into that nice mansion in brentwood are you goin along with them being planted by your buddy sheehan and his team no im not theres an explanation we just dont know it yet its what we ask pel there was a loud explosion as the rear window shattered and glass blasted through the car edgar momentarily lost control and the car swerved into the oncoming lanes there was a chorus of angry horns as bosch reached over and yanked the wheel right bringing the car back across the yellow lines what the fuck edgar cried as he finally got the car under control and put on the brakes no bosch yelled keep going keep going bosch grabbed the radio out of the recharge slot on the floor and depressed the transmit button shots fired shots fired western and olympic he held the button down as he looked over the backseat and out over the trunk his eyes scanned the rooftops and windows of the apartment buildings two blocks back he saw nothing suspect unknown sniper fire on a marked investigative services unit request immediate backup request air surveillance of rooftops east and west sides of western extreme caution is advised he clicked off the transmit button while the dispatch operator repeated most of what he had just said to other units he told edgar that they had gone far enough and that he could stop i think it came from the east side bosch said to edgar those apartments with the flat roof i think i heard it in my right ear first edgar exhaled loudly his hands were gripped so tight on the steering wheel now that the knuckles were as white as boschs you know what he said i think im never going to drive one of these fucking targets again chapter you guys are late i was thinkin about goin home already jenkins pelfry was a big man with a barrel chest and a complexion so dark it was hard to make out the lines of his face he sat on the top of a small secretarys desk in the anteroom of his office suite in the union law center there was a small television on a credenza to his left it was tuned to a news channel the view on the screen was from a helicopter circling a scene somewhere in the city bosch and edgar had arrived forty minutes late for their noon appointment sorry mr pelfry bosch said we ran into a little problem on the way over appreciate you staying lucky for you i lost track of the time i was watching the tube here things are not looking too good at the moment its looking a little testy out there he indicated the television with one of his huge hands bosch looked again and realized the scene that the helicopter was circling was the scene he and edgar had just left the search for the sniper who had taken the shot at their car on the tube bosch could see the sidewalks on western were now crowded with people watching the cops moving from building to building more officers were arriving on the scene and these new officers were wearing riot helmets these guys oughta just get out of there theyre baitin the crowd this isnt good just back the hell out man live to fight another day tried that last time edgar said didnt work the three of them watched for a few more moments in silence then pelfry reached over and turned off the tube he looked at his visitors what can i do for you bosch introduced himself and his partner i suppose you know why were here were working the howard elias case and we know you were doing some work for him on the black warrior thing we could use your help mr pelfry if we find who did this we maybe have a shot at cooling this place off bosch nodded at the blank tube of the television to underline his point you want my help pelfry said yeah i worked for eli i always called him eli but i dont know what i can do for you bosch looked at edgar and his partner made a subtle nod of his head mr pelfry our conversation here has to be kept confidential my partner and i are following an investigative trail that indicates that whoever killed stacey kincaid may have also killed your employer we think elias got too close to the truth if you know what he knew then you could be in danger yourself pelfry laughed at him a short loud snort bosch looked at edgar and then back at pelfry no offense but thats about the worst pickup line i ever heard pelfry said what are you talking about he pointed at the television once more bosch noticed how white the underside of his hand was i told you i been watchin the news channel four says you guys are already measuring a cell for somebody one of your own what are you talking about theyre sweatin a suspect over at parker right now did they have a name they didnt say a name but they knew it they said it was one of the black warrior cops the lead detective in fact bosch was dumbfounded the lead detective was frankie sheehan thats impos can i use your phone help yourself by the way do you know you have glass in your hair bosch brushed his hand through his hair while he stepped to the desk and picked up the phone while he punched in the number of irvings conference room pelfry watched the phone was answered immediately let me talk to lindell this is lindell its bosch whats this on channel four about a suspect i know im checking into it somebody leaked all i can say is that i updated irving and the next thing i know its on tv i think hes your leak not chas i dont care about that what are you saying its sheehan thats im im not saying that thats the leak talking and i think the leak is the goddamned deputy chief have you brought sheehan in yeah we got him in here and were talking to him strictly voluntary at this point he thinks he can talk his way out of the box we got all day and then some well see if he can why sheehan whyd you bring him in i thought you knew he was on top of chastains list this morning elias sued him once before five years ago he shot some asshole while trying to make an arrest on a murder put five holes in him the widow sued and eventually won a hundred grand even though to me it looked like a righteous shoot in fact your buddy chastain was the one who investigated the shoot and cleared him i remember the case it was a righteous shoot but that didnt matter to the jury it was just a little while after rodney king okay well before it went to trial sheehan threatened elias during a depo in front of the lawyers the widow and most important the steno girl she got it down word for word and it was in the depo which was in the file that chastain and his people read yesterday the threat was that sheehan told elias that someday when he least expected it somebody was going to come up from behind and put him down like a dog words to that effect words that describe what happened on angels flight pretty good come on that was five years ago youve got to be kidding me bosch noticed that both edgar and pelfry were watching him intently i know it bosch but then you have this new lawsuit on the black warrior thing and whos the lead detective frank sheehan on top of that he uses a ninemillimeter smith and wesson and one other thing we pulled his file hes qualified eleven straight years at the range as an expert marksman and you know the kind of shooting it took on angels flight you take it all into consideration and it put him at the top of the list of people to talk to so were talking to him the marksman thing is bullshit they give those pins out like candy at the range i bet seven or eight out of every ten cops have that ribbon and eight out of ten cops carry smith nines meantime irving or whoever the leak is is throwing him to the wolves sacrificing him to the media so maybe he can stop the city from burning hes only a sacrifice if he didnt do it there was a cynical casualness in lindells voice that bosch didnt like you better take it slow bosch said because i guarantee you frankie wasnt the shooter frankie you guys friends are you we were partners a long time back well its funny he doesnt seem so fond of you now my guys tell me that the first thing he said when they knocked on his door was fuck harry bosch he thinks you ratted him out man he doesnt know that we have the threat in the deposition or he doesnt remember it bosch put the phone down on its hook he was in a daze frankie sheehan believed that bosch had turned their conversation of the night before against him he believed harry had turned him in to the bureau it made bosch feel worse than the knowledge that his old partner and friend now sat in an interview room fighting for his life sounds like you dont agree much with channel four pelfry said no i dont you know something ima take a wild ass guess here but i think that glass in your hair means youre the two guys they were talkin about on tv getting potshotted over on western yeah what about it edgar asked well thats a few blocks from where that stacey kincaid girl ended up yeah so well if thats where you were comin from then i wonder if you met my two buddies rufus and andy yeah we met em and we know all about the body being dumped three days late youre following my footsteps then some of them we visited mistress regina last night too bosch was finally out of his daze but hung back and watched edgar making progress with pelfry then this isnt all bullshit what you said about who you think hit eli were here arent we then what else you want to know eli kept his cards close most of the time very close to the vest i never knew for sure which corner of the puzzle i was working if you know what i mean tell us about the license plates bosch said ending his silence we know you guys pulled seventyfive days worth of receipts from hollywood wax how come pelfry looked at them a long moment as if deciding something come on back he finally said he led them to the rear office i didnt want you guys back here he said but now he raised his hands to indicate the boxes covering every horizontal surface in the office they were short boxes that normally held four sixpacks of soda stacked in them were bundled receipts with cardboard markers with dates written on them those are the receipts from hollywood wax bosch asked thats right eli was going to bring em all into court as an exhibit i was holding em here till he needed em what exactly was he going to show with them i thought you boys knew were a little behind you mr pelfry jenkins or jenks most people call me jenks i dont know exactly what alla these receipts meant remember what i said about eli not showin me all the cards in his deck but i got an idea see when he supeenied these he gave me a list of license plate numbers on a piece a paper he said i was to look through alla these and see if any of those numbers on the list turned up on the receipts did you yeah took me the better part of a week any matches one match he went over to one of the boxes and stuck his finger into the stack where there was a cardboard marker with the date noted on it this one pelfry pulled out a receipt and took it over to bosch edgar came over and looked as well the receipt was for a daily special it identified the car to be washed as a white volvo wagon it listed the license plate number and the price of the special plus tax this plate number was on the list elias gave you bosch said thats right it was the only match you found thats what i said you know whose car this plate is from not exactly eli didnt tell me to run it but i got a guess who it belongs to the kincaids now youre with me bosch looked at edgar he could tell by his partners face he hadnt made the leap the fingerprints to prove harris was innocent beyond any kind of doubt he had to explain his clients fingerprints on the victims schoolbook if there was no reason or possible legitimate explanation for harris having been in the kincaid house and touching the book then there were two alternative reasons one the prints were planted by the cops two harris touched the book when it was somewhere else outside of the girls bedroom edgar nodded as he understood the kincaids had their car washed at hollywood wax and shine where harris worked the receipt proves it right all elias had to do was put the book in the car bosch turned to the boxes on pelfrys desk and ticked his finger on the cardboard marker june twelve he said thats right around the end of the school year kids clear out their lockers they take all their books home theyre not doing homework anymore so maybe the books lie around in the back of the volvo the volvo goes to the car wash edgar said id bet the daily special includes a vacuum maybe some armorall on the inside the washer the polish man touches the book when hes working inside the car bosch added there are your prints the polish man was harris edgar said he then looked at pelfry and said the manager at the car wash said you came back to look at the time cards pelfry nodded i did i got a copy of a time card that proves harris was working at the time that white volvo came in and got the special eli asked me to go over to the car wash and try to finesse that without a supeenie i figure the time card was the linchpin and he didnt want anybody to know about it even the judge who signed the subpoenas on the case bosch said he must not have trusted anybody looks like with good reason pelfry said while edgar asked pelfry to show him the time card bosch withdrew and tried to think about this latest information he remembered what sheehan had said the night before about the fingerprints being so good because the person who had left them had probably been sweating he understood now that that was not because of nervousness over the crime being committed but because he was working at the car wash vacuuming a car when those prints were left on that book michael harris he was innocent truly innocent bosch had not been convinced until that moment and it was astounding to him he wasnt a dreamer he knew cops made mistakes and innocent people went to prison but the mistake here was colossal an innocent man tortured as cops tried to bully him into confessing to something he had clearly not done satisfied they had their man the police had dropped their investigation and let the real killer slip away until a civil rights lawyers investigation found him a discovery that got the lawyer killed the chain reaction went even further pushing the city once more to the brink of selfdestruction so then mr pelfry bosch said who killed stacey kincaid its jenks and i dont know i know it wasnt michael harris aint no doubt about that but eli didnt tell me the other part if he knew before they got him they bosch asked whatever tell us about mistress regina edgar said whats to tell eli got a tip he passed it to me i checked the broad out and couldnt see any connection shes just a freak a dead end if you guys were there you know what i mean i think eli dropped it after i told him about her bosch thought a moment and shook his head i dont think so theres something there well if there is he didnt tell me about it in the car bosch called rider to check in she said she had completed a review of the files without anything that needed immediate followup catching her eye were going to see the kincaids bosch said how come so soon turns out one of them was harriss alibi what bosch explained the license plate discovery pelfry and elias had made one out of four she said what do you mean we now know what one out of four of the mystery notes means yeah i guess so i was thinking about the first two i think theyre connected and ive got an idea about dot the i im going to go online and check it out you know what a hypertext link is i dont speak that language kiz i still type with two fingers i know ill explain it when you get back here maybe ill know if i have something okay good luck he was about to hang up oh harry what you gotta call from carla entrenkin she said she needed to talk to you i was going to give her your pager but then i thought you might not want that she might start paging you every time she gets a wild hair thats fine did she leave a number she gave it to him and they hung up were going to the kincaids edgar asked yeah i just decided get on the radio and run the plate on that white volvo see what names on it ive got to make a call bosch called the number carla entrenkin had left and she answered after two rings its bosch detective you called yes uh i just wanted to apologize about last night i was upset at what i saw on the television and and i think i spoke too soon ive done some checking and i think i was wrong about what i said you were well im sorry okay inspector i appreciate you calling i better how is the investigation going its going have you talked to chief irving yes i have he told me that they are questioning detective sheehan dont hold your breath on that im not what about what you are pursuing i was told you are reinvestigating the original case the murder of stacey kincaid well we can now prove harris didnt do it you were right about that elias was going to go into court and clear him he didnt do it we now just have to prove somebody else did and my money is still on that somebody being the one who also did elias i have to go now inspector will you call me if you make significant progress bosch thought about this for a few moments dealing with carla entrenkin somehow gave him the feel of consorting with the enemy yes he finally said ill call if there is significant progress thank you detective dont mention it chapter the los angeles car czar and his wife now lived off mulholland drive in an exclusive development called the summit it was a gated and guarded neighborhood of sidebyside millionaires with spectacular homes that looked down from the santa monica mountains and north across the basin of the san fernando valley the kincaids had moved from brentwood to these gated hills after their daughters murder it was a move toward security that was too late for the little girl bosch and edgar had called ahead and were welcomed at the gatehouse there they were given directions along a curving development road to a huge french provincial mansion built on a piece of property that must have been the summit of the summit a latina maid answered the door and led them to a living room that was bigger than boschs entire house it had two fireplaces and three distinct groupings of furniture bosch wasnt sure what the purpose of this could be the long northern wall of the room was almost entirely glass it revealed an expansive view across the valley bosch had a hill house but the difference in views was a couple of thousand feet in altitude and maybe ten million dollars in attitude the maid told them that the kincaids would be with them shortly bosch and edgar stepped to the window which they were meant to do the rich kept you waiting so you could feel free to admire all that they had jetliner views edgar said whats that its what they call it when youre this high up jetliner views bosch nodded edgar had sold real estate as a side job with his wife a few years back until it threatened to turn his police work into a side job bosch could see across the valley to the santa susana mountains he could pick out oat mountain above chatsworth he remembered going there years before on a field trip from the youth hall the overall view however could not be called beautiful a heavy layer of smog especially for april stretched across the valley they were high enough in the kincaid house to be above it or so it seemed i know what youre thinking its a milliondollarview of the smog bosch turned around a smiling man and a blankfaced woman had entered the living room behind them stood a second man in a dark suit bosch recognized the first man from tv sam kincaid the car czar he was smaller than bosch expected more compact his deep tan was real not television makeup and his jetblack hair seemed legitimate on tv it always looked like a wig he was wearing a golf shirt like the ones he always wore on his commercials like the ones his father had worn when he was the one on the commercials a decade earlier the woman was younger than kincaid by a few years about forty and well preserved by weekly massages and trips to the salons down on rodeo drive she looked past bosch and edgar to the view she had a vague expression on her face and bosch immediately realized that katherine kincaid had probably not come close to recovering from the loss of her daughter but you know what sam kincaid continued smiling i dont mind seeing the smog my familys been selling cars in this city for three generations since nineteen hundred and twentyeight thats a lot of years and a lot of cars that smog out there reminds me of that his statement sounded rehearsed as if he used it as an opener with all of his guests he stepped forward with his hand out sam kincaid and my wife kate bosch shook his hand and introduced himself and edgar the way kincaid studied edgar before shaking his hand made bosch think that his partner might have been the first black man to set foot in his living room not counting the ones who were there to serve canapés and take drink orders bosch looked past kincaid to the man still standing beneath the arch of the entryway kincaid noticed and made the last introduction this is dc richter my chief of security kincaid said i asked him to come up and join us if you dont mind bosch was puzzled by the addition of the security man but didnt say anything he nodded and richter nodded back he was about boschs age tall and gaunt and his short graying hair was spiked with gel richter also had a small earring a thin gold hoop on his left ear what can we do for you gentlemen kincaid asked i have to say im surprised by this visit i would have guessed that with everything going on you two would be out on the street somewhere trying to keep down the animals there was an awkward silence kate kincaid looked down at the rug were investigating the death of howard elias edgar said and your daughters my daughters i dont understand what you mean why dont we sit down mr kincaid bosch said sure kincaid led them to one of the furniture groupings two couches faced each other across a glass coffee table to one side was a fireplace bosch could almost walk into to the other was the view the kincaids sat on one couch while bosch and edgar took the other richter stood to the side and behind the couch where the kincaids sat let me explain bosch said we are here to inform you that we are reopening the investigation of staceys death we need to start again both kincaids opened their mouths into small looks of puzzlement bosch continued in the course of investigating the killing friday night of howard elias we have uncovered information that we believe exonerates michael harris we impossible sam kincaid barked harris was the killer his fingerprints were found in the house the old house youre going to tell me that the los angeles police department now believes its own people planted this evidence no sir im not im telling you that we now have what we think is a reasonable explanation for that evidence well id love to hear it bosch took two folded pieces of paper from his jacket pocket and opened them one was a photocopy of the car wash receipt pelfry had found the other was a photocopy of harriss time card also from pelfry mrs kincaid you drive a white volvo station wagon with license plate number onebravohenrysixsixeight correct no thats wrong richter answered for her bosch looked up at him for a moment and then back at the woman did you drive this car last summer i drove a white volvo station wagon yes she said i dont remember the license number my family owns eleven dealerships and parts of six more in this county her husband said chevy cadillac mazda you name it even a porsche store but no volvo franchise and so what do you know thats the car she picks she says its safer for stacey and then she ends up anyway sam kincaid brought a hand up to cover his lip and held himself still bosch waited a moment before pressing on take my word for it about the plate number the car was registered to you mrs kincaid on june twelve last year that car the volvo was washed at hollywood wax and shine on sunset boulevard the person who took the car there asked for the daily special which included interior vacuuming and polish heres the receipt he leaned forward and put it on the coffee table in front of the couple they both leaned down to look at it richter leaned over the back of the couch for a look does either of you remember doing that we dont wash our cars sam kincaid said and we dont go to public car washes i need a car washed i have it taken to one of my stores i dont need to pay to i remember his wife said cutting him off i did it i took stacey to the movies at the el capitan where we parked there was construction a new roof being put on the building next to the garage when we came out the car had something on it like little spots of tar that had blown onto it it was a white car and it was very noticeable when i paid the parking attendant i asked him where a car wash was he told me kincaid was looking at his wife as if she had just belched at the charity ball so you got the car washed there bosch said yes i remember now she looked at her husband and then back at bosch the receipt says june twelve bosch said how long after the end of school for your daughter was that it was the next day it was our way of kicking off the summer lunch and the movies it was a movie about these two guys who cant find a mouse in their house it was cute the mouse got the better of them her eyes were on the memory and on her daughter they then focused on bosch once more no more school bosch said could she have left her books from the last day in the volvo maybe in the back kate kincaid slowly nodded yes i remember having to tell her at one point during the summer to take the books out of the car they kept sliding around when i drove she didnt do it i finally took them out and put them in her room bosch leaned forward again and put the other photocopy down for them michael harris worked at hollywood wax and shine last summer thats his time card for the week including june twelve he worked a full day on the day you brought the volvo in sam kincaid leaned forward again and studied the photocopy you mean all this time weve kincaid began and then stopped youre saying that he harris vacuumed out the volvo and in the process touched my stepdaughters book picked it up or whatever then the book was eventually taken to her bedroom and after she was taken the police found the prints on it bosch finished yes thats now what we think why didnt this come out at the trial why because there was other evidence linking harris to the murder edgar said the girls uh stacey was found less than two blocks from his apartment that was a strong tiein his lawyer decided the tack he had to take was to go after the cops taint the fingerprints by tainting the cops he never went after the truth and neither did the cops bosch said they had the prints and when the body was found in harriss neighborhood that sealed it you remember the investigation was emotionally charged from the beginning it changed at that point when they found the body and it all tied in to harris it changed from a search for a little girl to a prosecution of a specific target in between it never was a search for the truth sam kincaid seemed shellshocked all this time he said can you imagine the hate i have built up inside of me for this man this hate this utter and complete contempt has been the only real emotion ive had for the last nine months i understand sir bosch said but we need to start over now we need to reinvestigate the case that was what howard elias was doing we have reason to believe that he knew what i just told you only he also knew or had a pretty good idea who the actual killer was we think that got him killed sam kincaid looked surprised but the tv said a little while ago that the tvs wrong mr kincaid its wrong and were right kincaid nodded his eyes wandered out to the view and the smog what do you want from us kate kincaid said your help your cooperation i know we are hitting you out of the blue with this so were not expecting you to drop everything but as you can tell if youve been watching tv time isnt something we have a lot of you have our full cooperation sam kincaid said and dc here can do whatever you need him to do bosch looked from kincaid to the security man and then back to kincaid i dont think that will be necessary we just have a few more questions for right now and then tomorrow we want to come back and start the case over of course what are your questions howard elias learned what i just told you because of an anonymous note that came in the mail do either of you know who that could have come from who would have known about the volvo going to that car wash there was no answer for a long time just me kate kincaid said i dont know who else i dont remember telling anyone i went there why would i did you send howard elias the note no of course not why would i help michael harris i thought he was the one who who took my daughter now you tell me he is innocent and i think i believe you but before no i wouldnt have lifted a finger to help him bosch studied her as she spoke her eyes moved from the coffee table to the view and then to her hands clasped in front of her she didnt look at her questioner bosch had been reading people in interviews and interrogations for most of his adult life in that moment he knew she had sent elias the anonymous note he just couldnt figure out why he glanced up again at richter and saw that the security man was also closely studying the woman bosch wondered if he was reading the same thing he decided to move on the house where this crime took place the one in brentwood who owns that now we still own it sam kincaid said were not sure what were going to do with it part of us wants to get rid of it and never think of it again but the other part stacey was there she lived half of her life there i understand what id like boschs pager went off he cut it off and continued id like to take a look at it at her room tomorrow if possible well have a search warrant by then i know youre a busy man mr kincaid maybe mrs kincaid you could meet me there show me around show me staceys room if that wont be too difficult kate kincaid looked as if she dreaded the possibility of returning to the brentwood house but she nodded her head yes in a disengaged sort of way ill have dc drive her sam kincaid announced and you can have the run of the place and you wont need a search warrant we give you our permission we have nothing to hide sir i didnt mean to imply that you did the search warrant will be necessary so there will be no questions later it is more a protection for us if something new in the house is found and leads to the real killer we dont want that person to be able to challenge the evidence on any legal grounds i understand and we appreciate you offering the help of mr richter but that wont be necessary bosch looked at kate kincaidi would prefer it if just you came mrs kincaid what time would be good while she thought about this bosch looked down at his pager the number on it was one of the homicide lines but there was a added after the phone number it was code from kiz rider call immediately uh excuse me bosch said it looks like this call is important do you have a phone i could use i have a cell phone in the car but in these hills im not sure ill be able to get of course sam kincaid said use my office go back out to the entry hall and go left the second door on the left youll have privacy well wait here with detective edwards bosch stood its edgar edgar said im sorry detective edgar as bosch headed to the entry hall another pager sounded this time it was edgars he knew it was rider sending the same message edgar looked down at his pager and then at the kincaids i better go with detective bosch sounds like something big sam kincaid offered hope its not a riot me too edgar said kincaids home office would have been able to accommodate the entire hollywood homicide squad it was a huge room with towering ceilings and bookcases along two walls that went all the way up to the ceiling the centerpiece of the room was a desk that would have dwarfed howard eliass it looked as if you could build a nicesized office inside it bosch came around behind it and picked up the phone edgar came into the room behind him you get one from kiz bosch asked yeah somethings happening bosch punched in the number and waited he noticed that on the desk was a goldframed photo of kincaid holding his stepdaughter on his lap the girl was indeed beautiful he thought about what frankie sheehan had said about her looking like an angel even in death he looked away and noticed the computer set up on a worktable to the right of the desk there was a screen saver on the tube it showed a variety of different cars racing back and forth across the screen edgar noticed it too the car czar edgar whispered more like the smog wog rider answered before the first ring was finished its bosch harry did you talk to the kincaids yet were here now were in the middle of it whats going did you advise them bosch was silent a moment when he spoke again his voice was very low advise them no what for kiz harry back out of there and come back to the station bosch had never heard riders voice with such a serious tone he looked at edgar who just raised his eyebrows he was in the dark okay kiz were on our way you want to tell me why no i have to show you i found stacey kincaid in afterlife chapter bosch couldnt put his finger on the look he saw on kizmin riders face when he and edgar returned to the squad room she sat alone at the homicide table her laptop in front of her the glow of the screen reflecting slightly on her dark face she looked both horrified and energized bosch knew the look but didnt have the words for it she had seen something horrible but at the same time she knew she was going to be able to do something about it kiz bosch said sit down i hope you didnt leave hair on the cake with the kincaids bosch pulled out his seat and sat down edgar did likewise the phrase rider had used referred to making a miscue that tainted a case with constitutional or procedural error if a suspect asks for a lawyer but then confesses to a crime before the lawyer arrives there is hair on the cake the confession is tainted likewise if a suspect is not advised of his rights before questioning it is unlikely anything he says in that conversation can be used against him later in court look neither one was a suspect when we walked in there bosch said there was no reason to advise we told them the case was open again and asked a few basic questions nothing came out of any consequence anyway we told them harris has been cleared and thats it what do you have kiz maybe you should just show us okay bring your chairs around here ill school you they moved their chairs to positions on either side of her bosch checked her computer and saw the mistress regina web page was on the screen first off either of you guys know lisa or stacey oconnor in major fraud downtown bosch and edgar shook their heads theyre not sisters they just have the same last name they work with sloane inglert you know who she is right now they nodded inglert was a member of a new computer fraud unit working out of parker center the team and inglert in particular had gotten a lot of play in the media earlier that year when they bagged brian fielder a hacker of international reputation who headed a crew of hackers known as the merry pranksters fielders exploits and inglerts chase of her quarry across the internet had played in the paper for weeks and were now destined to be filmed by holywood all right rider said well theyre friends of mine from when i worked fraud i called them and they were happy to come in to work this because otherwise theyd have to put on uniforms and work twelve hours tonight they came here bosch asked no their office at parker where the real computers are anyway we talked over the phone once they got there i told them what we had this web address that we knew was important but at the same time didnt make any sense i told them about going to mistress reginas place and i think i pretty much creeped them out anyway they told me there was a good chance that what we were looking for had nothing to do with regina herself just her web page they said the page could have been hijacked and that we should be looking for a hidden hypertext link somewhere in the image bosch raised his hands palms up but before he could say anything rider kept going i know i know talk english i will i just wanted to take you step by step do either of you know anything at all about web pages am i making even any basic sense here nope said bosch nada said edgar okay then ill try to keep this simple we start with the internet the internet is the socalled information superhighway okay thousands and thousands of computer systems all connected by a telnet system it is worldwide on that highway are millions of turnoffs places to go these are whole computer networks web sites so on and so forth she pointed to mistress regina on her computer screen this is an individual web page that is on a web site where there are many other pages you see this on my computer here but its home so to speak is on the larger web site and that web site resides in an actual physical piece of equipment a computer we call the web server do you follow me bosch and edgar nodded so far bosch said i think good now the web server may have many many web sites that it manages and maintains see if you wanted to have a harry bosch web page you would go to a web server and say put my page on one of your web sites do you have one that features morose detectives who never say much of anything to anybody that got a smile from bosch thats how it works often you have likeminded businesses or interests bundled on one site thats why when you look at this site its like sodom and gomorrah on the internet because likeminded advertisers seek the same sites okay bosch said the one thing the web server should provide is security by that i mean security from anyone hacking in and compromising your page altering it or crashing it the problem is there isnt a whole lot of security out there on these web servers and if someone can hack into a server they can then assume siteadministrator capabilities for a web site and hijack any page on the site what do you mean hijack edgar said they can go to a page on the site and use it as a front for their own intentions think of it as it is on my screen here they can come up behind the image you see here and add all kinds of hidden doors and commands whatever they want they can then use the page as a gateway to anything they want and thats what they did with her page bosch asked exactly i had oconnoroconnor run a uniform resource locator in effect they traced this page back to the web server they checked it out there are indeed some firewalls security blocks but the default passwords are still valid they in effect render the firewalls invalid you lost me bosch said when a web server is first set up there are default passwords necessary for first getting inside in other words standard logon names and passwords guestguest for example or administratoradministrator once the server is up and running these should be eliminated to prevent compromise but quite often it is forgotten about and these become back doors ways to sneak in it was forgotten here lisa got in using administratoradministrator and if she was able to do it then any hacker worth his salt could have gotten in and then hijacked the mistress regina page and somebody did what did they do bosch asked they put in a hidden hypertext link a hot button when located and pushed it will take the user to another web site all together in english edgar said rider thought for a moment think of it as a tall building the empire state building you are on one floor the mistress regina floor and you find a hidden button on the wall you push it and an elevator door you didnt even see before opens and you get on the elevator takes you to another floor and opens you step out you are someplace completely new but you couldnt have gotten there if you hadnt been on mistress reginas floor and stumbled onto that hidden button or been told where it was bosch said exactly rider said those in the know can go bosch nodded at her computer show us well remember the first note to elias was the web page address and the image of regina the second one said dot the i humbert humbert the mystery writer was simply telling elias what to do with the web page dot the i in regina edgar asked click the mouse on the dot thats what i thought but oconnoroconnor said a hot button can only be hidden behind an image something about pixel redefinition that i dont need to get into so you dot the eye bosch said pointing to his eye right she turned to her laptop to which she had attached a mouse she now moved it with her hand and bosch watched the arrow on the screen move to mistress reginas left eye rider doubleclicked the mouse button and the screen went blank okay were on that elevator after a few seconds a field of blue sky and clouds appeared on the screen then tiny angels with wings and halos appeared sitting on the clouds then a password template appeared humbert humbert bosch said see harry you get this stuff youre just acting like you dont she typed in the name humbert in the user name and password slots and the screen went blank once again a few seconds later there was a welcome message welcome to charlottes web site below the message a moving cartoon image formed a spider crawled along the bottom of the page and then began weaving a web across the screen shooting back and forth until the web was formed then tiny photographic images of young girls faces appeared in the web as if caught there when the image of the web and its captives was complete the spider took a position at the top of the web this is sick edgar said im getting a bad feeling here its a pedophile site rider said with a fingernail she tapped the screen below one of the photos in the web and that is stacey kincaid you click on the photo you like and you get a full spread of photos and videos it is truly truly horrible stuff that poor little angel she might be better off dead rider moved the arrow to the photo of the blond girl it was too small for bosch to identify the girl as stacey kincaid he wished he could just take riders word for it are you ready for this rider asked i cant run videos on my laptop but the photos give you the idea she didnt wait for a reply and she didnt get one she doubleclicked the mouse and a new screen appeared a photo appeared on the screen it was a young girl standing naked in front of a hedge she was smiling in a forced seemingly unnatural way despite the smile she still had a lostinthewoods look on her face her hands were on her hips bosch could tell it was stacey kincaid he tried to breathe but it felt like his lungs were collapsing he folded his arms across his chest rider started scrolling the screen and a series of photos came up featuring the girl in several poses by herself and then finally with a man only the mans naked torso was shown never his face the last photos were the girl and the man engaged in various sex acts then they came to the final photo it showed stacey kincaid in a white dress with little semaphore flags on it she was waving at the camera the photo seemed somehow to be the worst one even though it was the most innocent okay go back or forward or whatever you do to get that off there bosch said he watched rider move the cursor to a button below the final photo that said home on it it seemed sadly ironic to bosch that clicking home was the way out rider clicked the mouse and the screen went back to the spiders web bosch pulled his chair back to his spot and dropped down into it fatigue and depression suddenly hit him he wanted to go home and go to sleep and forget everything he knew people are the worst animals rider said they will do anything to each other just to indulge their fantasies bosch got up and walked over to one of the other nearby desks it belonged to a burglary detective named mcgrath he opened the drawers and started looking through them harry rider said what are you looking for a cigarette i thought paul kept his smokes in his desk he used to i told him to start taking them home with him bosch looked over at her his hand still holding one of the drawers you told him that i didnt want you slipping harry bosch shoved the drawer closed and came back to his chair thanks a lot kizmin you saved me there wasnt a drop of thanks in the tone he had used youll get through this harry bosch gave her a look you probably havent smoked an entire cigarette in your entire life and youre going to tell me about quitting and how ill get through it sorry im just trying to help like i said thanks he looked over at her computer and nodded what else what are you thinking about how does that tie in sam and kate kincaid to the point we shouldve advised them they had to know about this rider said amazed that bosch didnt see what she saw the man in the photos thats got to be kincaid whoah edgar said how can you say that you couldnt see the guys face we were just talking to the guy and he and his wife are still righteously fuckedup over this it hit bosch then when he had first seen the photos on the computer he had thought they were taken by the girls abductor youre saying these photos are old he said that she was abused before she was abducted im saying there probably wasnt an abduction at all stacey kincaid was an abused child my guess is that her stepfather defiled her and then probably killed her and that doesnt happen without tacit knowledge if not approval by the mother bosch was silent rider had spoken with such fervor and even pain that he couldnt help but wonder if she was talking from some kind of personal experience look rider said apparently sensing the skepticism of her partners there was a time that i thought i wanted to move into child sex crimes this was before i put in for homicide there was an opening on the endangeredchild team in pacific and the job was mine if i wanted it they first sent me to quantico for a twoweek training program the bureau puts on once a year on child sex crimes i lasted eight days i realized i couldnt hack it i came back and put in for homicide she stopped there but neither bosch nor edgar said anything they knew there was more but before i left rider continued i learned enough to know that most often sexual abuse of children comes from inside the family relatives or close friends the boogey monsters who climb through the window and abduct are few and far between its still not evidence in this specific case kiz bosch said gently this could still be the rare exception it wasnt harris who came through the window but this guy he pointed to her computer though the images of the headless mans assault on stacey kincaid were thankfully not on the screen nobody came through the window rider insisted she pulled a file over and opened it bosch saw it contained a copy of the protocol from the autopsy of stacey kincaid she leafed through it until she came to the photos she picked the one she wanted and handed it to bosch while he looked at it she started paging through the protocol the photo bosch held was a shot of stacey kincaids body in situ the position and place where it was found her arms were spread wide sheehan had been right her body was darkening with interior decomposition and the face was gaunt but there was an angelic quality to her in repose his heart ached from looking at the photos of her tortured and now dead look at the left knee rider commanded he did so he saw a round dark spot that appeared to be a scab a scab right the protocol calls it premortem by five to six days it happened before she was abducted so she had that scab on her knee the entire time she was with her abductor if there really was one in the photos on the web site she has no scab i can go back in and show you if you like ill take your word for it bosch said yeah edgar added me too so these photos on the web were taken well before she was supposedly kidnapped well before she was murdered bosch nodded then shook his head what rider asked its just i dont know twentyfour hours ago we were working the elias thing and thinking maybe we were looking for a cop now all of this it changes things all right edgar said wait a minute if thats sam kincaid in those pictures with her why the hell are they still on that web site it doesnt make sense that he would risk that i thought about that rider said there are two possible explanations one being that he doesnt have editing access to the web site in other words he cant take those photos off without going to the site administrator raising suspicions and exposing himself the second possibility and it might be a combination of both is that he felt he was safe harris was fingered as the killer and whether he was convicted or not that was the end of the story its still a risk leaving those photos out there to be seen edgar said whos going to see them rider asked whos going to tell her voice was too defensive she realized this and continued in a calmer tone dont you see the people with access to this site are pedophiles even if someone recognized stacey which is unlikely what were they going to do call the police and say uh yes i like fucking children but i dont stand for murdering them could you get these photos off our web site not in a million years hell maybe keeping the photos on there was a form of bragging we dont even know what we have here maybe every girl on that site is dead her voice was growing sharper as she tried to convince them okay okay bosch said you make good points kiz lets stay on our case for now what is your theory you think elias got this far along and it got him killed absolutely we know it did the fourth note he knows you know elias went onto the secret web site and was found out howd they know he was in there if he had the passwords from the third note edgar asked good question rider replied i asked the oconnors the same thing they did some snooping around after getting into the server they found a cookie jar on the web site what that means is that there is a program that captures data about each user who enters the site it then analyzes the data to determine if someone has entered the site who should not have had access even if they have the passwords their entry is still recorded and a data trail called an internet protocol address is left behind its like fingerprints the ip or the cookie is left on the site you enter the cookie jar program will then analyze the ip address and match it to a list of known users if there is no match a flag is raised the sites manager sees the flag and can trace the intruder or he can set up a tripwire program that waits for a return visit from the intruder when he comes back the program will attach a tracer which will provide the site manager with the intruders email address and once you have that you have the intruder cold you can identify him then if it looks like a cop you close the elevator the page you hijacked and were using as a secret gateway and you go find a new web page to hijack but in this case it wasnt a cop it was a lawyer and they didnt shut down bosch said they sent someone out to kill him right so you think this is what elias did bosch said he got these notes in the mail and followed the clues he stumbled into this web site and set off an alarm a flag they then killed him yes that would be my interpretation of what we know at this point particularly in light of the fourth note he knows you know bosch shook his head confused by his own extrapolations of the story im still not getting this who is the they were talking about here that i just accused of murder the group the users of the site the site administrator which might possibly be kincaid picked up on the intruder realized it was elias and dispatched someone to take care of the problem in order to fend off exposure whether or not he polled all members of the group first doesnt matter they are all guilty because the web site is a criminal enterprise bosch held his hand up to slow her down slow down we can leave the group and the bigger picture for the da to worry about stay focused on the killer and kincaid we are assuming he was involved in all of this and somehow someone knew about it then decided to inform elias instead of the cops does that make sense sure it does we just dont know all the details yet but the notes speak for themselves they clearly indicate someone tipped elias to the site then later warned him that he had been found out bosch nodded and thought about this for a moment wait a minute if he set off a flag then didnt you just do the same no thanks to the oconnors when they were inside the server they added my ip as well as their own to the sites good guy list no alarms the operators and users of the site wont know weve been there unless they actually look at their good guy list and notice it has been altered i think weve got the time to do what we need to do bosch nodded he wanted to ask whether what the oconnors had done had been legal but thought it best not to know so who sent elias the notes he asked instead the wife edgar said i think she got an attack of the guilts and wanted to help elias rip sam the car czar a new asshole she sent the notes it fits rider said whoever sent the notes had knowledge of two separate things charlottes web site and the carwash receipts actually a third thing as well that elias had tripped an alarm so my vote goes with the wife too what was she like today bosch spent the next ten minutes updating her on their activities during the day and thats just our work on the case edgar added harry didnt even tell you how we got the back window of my car shot out what edgar told the story and rider seemed mesmerized by it they catch the shooter not that we heard we didnt wait around you know ive never been shot at she said must be a rush not the kind you want bosch said i still have questions about all of this internet stuff what are they rider said if i cant answer one of the oconnors can no not technical questions logic questions i still dont understand how and why this stuff is still available for us to look at i understand what you said about the users all being pedophiles and their seeming feeling of safety but now we have elias dead if they killed him why the hell didnt they at least move to a new gateway maybe they are in the process of trying to do just that elias hasnt been dead fortyeight hours and what about kincaid we just told him we are reopening the case whether he was in danger of exposure or not it seems he would have gotten on the computer the minute we left and either contacted the site administrator or tried to crash the site and those pictures himself again maybe its in process and even if it is its too late the oconnors backed everything onto a zip drive they can crash the site but we still have it well be able to trace every ip address and take down every one of those people if you consider them people again the fervor and anger in her voice made bosch wonder if something about what she had seen on the web site had touched something personal something deep inside so where do we go from here he asked search warrants yep rider said and we bring in the kincaids fuck their big mansion on the hill we have enough already to bring them in for questioning on the child abuse we separate them and sweat them in the rooms we go for the wife and get a confession get her to waive spousal privilege and give us her husband that rat bastard youre talking about a very powerful and politically connected family dont tell me youre afraid of the car czar bosch checked her look to make sure she was kidding im afraid of moving too fast and blowing it weve got nothing that directly links anybody to stacey kincaid or howard elias if we bring mom down here and dont turn her then we watch the car czar drive away thats what im afraid of okay rider nodded shes dying to be turned edgar said why else send those notes to elias bosch put his elbows on the desk and washed his face with his hands as he thought about things he had to make a decision what about charlottes web site he asked his face still covered by his hands what do we do with that we give that to inglert and the oconnors rider said theyll jump all over it like i said theyll be able to trace the good guy list to the users theyll identify them and take them down were talking multiple arrests of an internet pedophile ring thats just for starters the da might want to try to link them all to the homicides theyre probably all over the country edgar said not just la they might be all over the world but it wont matter our people will work with the bureau on it more silence passed by and bosch finally dropped his hands to the desk hed made his decision okay he said you two stay here and work on the search warrants i want them ready to go tonight in case we decide to move we want all weapons computer equipment you know what to do i want warrants for the old house which they still own as well as the new house all cars and kincaids office also jerry see what you can find out about the security guy dc richter will do what in fact on the warrants write up one for his car whats the pc rider asked bosch thought a moment he knew what he wanted but he needed a legal means of getting there just say that as kincaids director of security it is believed that his vehicle may have been used in the commission of crimes relating to stacey kincaid thats not probable cause harry we stick the warrant in with the other ones he said maybe the judge wont care after hes read what is in them in fact check the judge list lets take these to a woman rider smiled and said arent we sly what are you going to be doing harry edgar asked im going downtown to talk to irving and lindell tell them what we got and see how they want to play it bosch looked at rider and now saw disappointment harry this isnt like you she said you know that if you go to irving hell take the conservative route he wont let us move until weve nailed down every possibility bosch nodded and said normally that would be true but these arent normal times he wants to prevent the city from burning going with this and going fast might be the way irvings smart enough to see that you have too much faith in human nature she said what are you talking about the best way of cooling this city off is to arrest a cop irvings already down there with sheehan in the box he isnt going to want to hear this harry you think that if you arrest the car czar and say he did elias that everybody will believe you and be cool edgar added you dont understand there are people out there who need this to be a cop and they wont listen to anything else irvings smart enough to see that too bosch thought of sheehan downtown at parker center in a room he was being measured as the departments sacrificial lamb just work on the warrants he said ill worry about the rest chapter bosch looked out the window and down at the protesters lining the sidewalks in front of parker center and across los angeles street they moved in orderly lines carrying signs that said justice now on one side and justice for howard elias on the other the duplication of the signs attested to the careful orchestration of the protest for the benefit of the media bosch saw reverend preston tuggins was one of the marchers as he walked reporters walked along with him sticking microphones in front of him and focusing cameras at his face bosch didnt see any signs that said anything about catalina perez detective bosch deputy chief irving said from behind him run it down for us youve told us what information youve accumulated now put it into perspective tell us what you think it means bosch turned around he looked at irving then at lindell they were in irvings office irving was ensconced behind his desk sitting ramrod straight in his full uniform an indication he would be appearing at a press conference later lindell sat in one of the chairs across the desk bosch had just recounted for them what rider had come up with and the steps his team had taken to that point irving now wanted his interpretation of it all bosch composed his thoughts as he stepped back to the desk and took the seat next to lindell i think sam kincaid killed his stepdaughter or had something to do with it there never was an abduction that was the story he cooked up then he got lucky he caught a big break when those fingerprints happened to point to harris after that was discovered he was practically home free start at the start okay you start with kincaid being a pedophile he married kate six years ago probably as a cover and to get at her daughter the girls body was too decomposed for the coroner to determine if there was indication of longterm sexual abuse but im saying there was and at the mother knew i dont know she found out at some point but when that was is the question go on sorry to interrupt something happened last summer maybe the girl threatened to tell someone her mother if she didnt know yet or maybe go to the authorities or maybe kincaid simply grew tired of her pedophiles target a specific age group theyre not interested in children older than their target group stacey kincaid was about to turn twelve she may have been too old for her stepfathers tastes if she was no longer of use to him in that way she was only a danger to him this conversation is turning my stomach detective we are talking about an elevenyearold girl what do you want me to do about it chief its turning mine too ive seen the pictures then move on please so something happened and he killed her he hid the body and jimmied the window he then let events take place in the morning the mother finds her gone and calls the cops the abduction story starts to unfold he then gets lucky lindell said right he catches a nice piece of luck of all the prints collected in the girls room and the rest of the house the computer spits out a match with michael harris exconvict and allaround dirtbag rhd was off to the races then like they were wearing blinders they dropped everything and harris became the only focus they picked him up and did their thing with him only a funny thing happened on the way to a conviction harris didnt confess and there was no other evidence to go with those fingerprints meantime harriss name was leaked to the media it became known that the cops had a suspect kincaid found out where harris lived maybe he got it from a friendly cop who was just keeping the parents of the victim informed however it happened he knew where harris lived he went to the spot where hed hidden the body and moved it my guess is that it was in the trunk of a car all along probably on one of his car lots anyway he took the body to harriss neighborhood and dumped it in a trash lot a couple blocks from the suspects apartment when it was found the next morning the cops finally had another piece of evidence circumstantial as it was to go with the fingerprints but all harris was was a patsy his prints had been left when he washed mrs kincaids car irving said right so what about elias lindell asked how did he get himself killed i think mrs kincaid did that by mistake at some point since she put her daughter in the ground i think she started seeing ghosts she was feeling guilty about her daughter and maybe tried to make it right she knew what her husband was capable of maybe he had even threatened her outright so she tried to do it on the sly she started sending anonymous letters to elias to help him along it did elias was able to get to the secret web site charlottes web once he saw those pictures of the girl he knew who the real killer probably was he was going about it very quietly but he was going to subpoena kincaid and spring it on him in court only he made a mistake and showed his hand he left a trail on the web site kincaid or the operators of the site learned they had been compromised they sent out a gun lindell said i seriously doubt it was kincaid himself but probably somebody working for him hes got a security guy were checking him out they all sat silent for a long moment irving clasped his hands on the desk in front of him there was nothing on top of it it was just polished wood you have to cut sheehan loose bosch said he didnt do it dont worry about sheehan irving said if hes clean he goes home i want to know how we proceed with kincaid it seems so bosch ignored his hesitancy we do what were doing he said we get search warrants signed and ready to go im supposed to meet mrs kincaid tomorrow morning at the old house i go try to play her try to get an admission i think shes fragile maybe ready to be flipped either way we spring the warrants we use everybody and hit all places at once the homes the cars the offices we see what they bring we also have to pull records on his dealerships find out what cars kincaid was using back in july richter too richter hes the security guy irving got up and went to the window this time youre talking about a member of a family that helped build this city he said the son of jackson kincaid i know that bosch replied the guys from a powerful family hes even proprietary about the smog he looks at it like its a family accomplishment but that doesnt matter chief not after what hes done irvings eyes dropped and bosch knew he was looking down at the protest march the citys held together he didnt finish bosch knew what he was thinking that those people down on the sidewalks were expecting news of charges being filed against a cop where are we with detective sheehan irving asked lindell looked at his watch weve been talking to him for six hours now when i left he had yet to say a single selfincriminating word in regard to the murder of howard elias he previously threatened the victim in the manner in which the victim was killed that was a long time ago plus it was said in public in front of witnesses its been my experience that people who make threats like that usually dont carry them out they are blowing off steam most of the time irving nodded his face still to the window what about ballistics he asked nothing yet the autopsy on elias was supposed to start this afternoon i sent detective chastain over theyll dig the slugs out and hell take them over to your firearms people it will take too long to send them to my people in washington but remember chief sheehan volunteered his gun he said do the ballistics yes he carries a nine but i kinda think he wouldnt have offered the gun if he didnt know the gun wouldnt match the bullets and his home we searched it top to bottom again with his permission nothing no other weapons no hate notes about elias nothing alibi only place hes hurting he was home alone friday night what about his wife bosch asked the wife and kids were up in bakersfield lindell said apparently theyve been up there a good long time it was one more surprise about sheehan bosch wondered why sheehan hadnt mentioned it when bosch had asked about his family irving remained silent and lindell continued i guess what im saying is that we can hold him and wait till tomorrow when weve got the ballistics report to clear him or we can hop on harrys wagon and kick him loose now but we keep him overnight and the expectations out on the street will just rise that much further and if we release him without explanation we could touch off a riot irving said irving continued to stare at the window brooding this time lindell waited kick him loose at six irving finally said at the five oclock briefing i will say he is being released pending further investigation i can hear the howls already from preston tuggins and his people thats not good enough chief bosch said you have to say hes clear pending further investigation you might as well say we think he did it but we dont have the evidence to charge him yet irving wheeled from the window and looked at bosch do not dare to tell me what is good enough detective you do your job and i will do mine speaking of which the briefing is in an hour i want your two partners there for it i am not going to stand up there with a bunch of white faces behind me and say we are letting a white cop go pending further investigation i want your people there this time and absolutely no excuse will be acceptable theyll be there good now lets talk about what we will say to the media about the direction the investigation is heading in the press conference was short this time there was no sign of the chief of police it was left to irving to explain that the investigation was continuing and widening he also said that the police officer who had been interviewed for several hours was being released this brought an immediate chorus of shouted questions from the reporters irving raised his hands as if the action might in some way control the crowd he was wrong we are not going to turn this into a shouting match he barked i will take a handful of questions and that is it we have an investigation to get back to we what do you mean by released chief harvey button called out are you saying he has been cleared or you just dont have evidence to hold him irving looked at button for a moment before answering what i am saying is that the investigation is now moving into other areas then detective sheehan has been cleared correct i am not getting into naming people we talk to chief we all know the name why cant you answer the question bosch thought it was amusing in a cynical sort of way to watch this exchange because lindell had convinced him it was irving who had first leaked frankie sheehans name to the media now the deputy chief was trying to act insulted that it was out there all i am saying is that the police officer we have talked to provided satisfactory answers at this time he is going home and that is all i am what other directions is the investigation going in another reporter called out i cannot get into detail irving said suffice it to say we will be turning over every stone can we ask the fbi agent questions irving glanced at lindell who was standing at the rear of the stage next to bosch edgar and rider he then looked back at the crowd of lights cameras and reporters the fbi and the lapd have decided this will best be handled by funneling information through the police department if you have a question ask me are other cops being questioned button called out irving had to think again to make sure he put the right words in the right order yes police officers are being questioned in a routine manner at this point there are no police officers that we would classify as suspects then you are saying sheehan is not a suspect button got him irving knew it he had talked himself into a logic corner but he took the easy if not disingenuous way out no comment chief button continued above the din of other reporters the murders are almost fortyeight hours old are you saying there are no solid suspects at this time were not going to get into what suspects there may or may not be next irving quickly pointed to another reporter in order to steer things away from button the questioning went on for another ten minutes at one point bosch looked over at rider and she gave him a look that said what are we doing here and bosch returned a look that answered we are wasting our time when it was finally over bosch huddled on the stage with edgar and rider they had arrived from hollywood station just as the press conference had begun and he hadnt had time to talk to them so where are we on the search warrants he asked almost done edgar said it didnt help that we had to come down here for the dog and pony show i know harry i thought you were going to steer us clear of this stuff rider said i know it was selfish frankie sheehan is a friend what they did to him leaking his name like that was bullshit i was hoping that having you two here might add some credibility to the announcement that he was being let go so you used us the way irving wanted to yesterday she said you wouldnt let him do it but it was okay for yourself bosch studied her face he could tell she was genuinely angry at being used in such a way bosch knew that it was a betrayal a small one in his mind but a betrayal just the same look kiz we can talk about this later but like i said frankies a friend hes now your friend for this and that could be valuable someday he waited and watched and finally she gave a slight nod it was over for now how much more time do you need he asked maybe an hour edgar said then weve got to find a judge why rider said what did irving say irvings sitting on the fence so i want to have everything ready i want to be able to move tomorrow morning tomorrow mornings no problem edgar said good then you two go back and finish up get to a judge tonight tomorrow well detective bosch bosch turned harvey button and his producer tom chainey were standing there i cant talk to you bosch said we understand that you have reopened the stacey kincaid case chainey said wed like to talk to you about who told you that bosch snapped anger quickly showing on his face we have a source who well tell your source hes full of shit no comment a cameraman came up and poked his lens over buttons shoulder button raised a microphone have you exonerated michael harris button blurted out i said no comment bosch said get that out of here bosch reached to the camera and put his hand over the lens the cameraman shrieked dont touch the camera this is private property so is my face get it away from me the press conference is over bosch put his hand on buttons shoulder and forcefully ushered him off the stage the cameraman followed so did chainey but in a slow calm way as if daring bosch to manhandle him as well their eyes locked watch the news tonight detective chainey said you might find it interesting i doubt that bosch said twenty minutes later bosch was sitting on an empty desk at the mouth of the hallway that led to the rhd interview rooms on the third floor he was still thinking about the exchange hed had with button and chainey and wondering what they had he heard one of the doors open and looked up frankie sheehan came down the hallway with lindell boschs old partner looked drained his face was slack his hair unkempt and his clothes the same ones he had worn the night before in the bar were disheveled bosch slid off the desk and stood up ready to deflect a physical assault if need be but sheehan apparently read his body language and raised his hands palms forward he smiled crookedly its okay harry sheehan said his voice very tired and hoarse agent lindell here gave me the scoop part of it at least it wasnt you who it was myself you know i forgot all about threatening that douche bag bosch nodded come on frankie he said ill give you a ride without thinking too much about it bosch led him to the main elevators and they headed down to the lobby they stood side by side both looking up at the lighted numbers above the door sorry i doubted you buddy sheehan said quietly dont worry about it buddy that makes us even yeah how so last night when i asked about the prints you still doubt them nope not at all in the lobby they went out a side door to the employee parking lot they were about halfway to the car when bosch heard a commotion and turned to see several reporters and cameramen moving toward them dont say anything bosch said quickly dont say a word to them the initial wave of reporters descended quickly and surrounded them bosch could see more coming no comment bosch said no comment but it wasnt bosch they cared about they shoved their microphones and cameras at sheehans face his eyes so tired before seemed wild now even scared bosch tried to pull his friend through the crowd and to the car the reporters shouted their questions detective sheehan did you kill howard elias a woman asked louder than the others no sheehan said i didnt i didnt do anything did you previously threaten the victim look no comment bosch said before sheehan could react to the question do you hear that no comment leave us a why were you questioned tell us why you were questioned detective they were almost there some of the reporters had dropped off realizing they would get nothing but most of the cameras were staying with them they could always use the video suddenly sheehan broke from boschs grip and wheeled around on the reporters you want to know why i was questioned i was questioned because the department needs to sacrifice somebody to keep the peace doesnt matter who it is as long as they fit the bill thats where i came in i fit the bosch grabbed sheehan and yanked him away from the microphones come on frankie forget about them by moving between two parked cars they were able to cut off the clot of reporters and cameramen bosch pushed sheehan quickly to his slickback and opened the door by the time the reporters followed in single file to the car sheehan was inside and safe from the microphones bosch went around to his side and got in they drove in silence until they were on the freeway going north bosch then glanced over at sheehan his eyes were staring ahead you shouldnt have said that frankie youre fanning the fire i dont give a fuck about the fire not anymore silence returned they were on the freeway cutting through hollywood and traffic was light bosch could see smoke rising from a fire somewhere to the south and west he thought about putting kfwb on the radio but decided he didnt want to know what that smoke meant they give you a chance in there to call margaret he asked after a while nope they didnt give me a chance to do anything other than confess im sure glad you rode into town and saved the day harry i never did get told what you told em but whatever it was it sure saved my ass bosch knew what sheehan was asking but he wasnt ready to tell him the medias probably been out to your house he said instead margaret probably got blindsided with this i got news for you harry margaret left me eight months ago took the girls and moved to bakersfield to be near her folks theres nobody at my house sorry frankie i shouldve told you last night when you asked about them bosch drove for a little bit thinking about things why dont you get some stuff from your place and come stay at my house the reporters wont find you until this blows over i dont know harry your house is the size of a box of girl scout cookies im already claustrophobic from being in that room all day besides i never met your wife you know shes not going to want some stranger sleeping on your couch bosch looked at the capitol records building as the freeway cut past it it was supposed to resemble a stack of records with a phonograph stylus on top but like most of hollywood time had passed it by they didnt make records anymore music came on compact discs they sold record albums in secondhand stores now sometimes all of hollywood seemed like a secondhand store to bosch my house got wrecked in the earthquake bosch said its rebuilt now i even have a guest room and frankie my wife left me too it felt strange to say it out loud as if it was some form of confirmation of the death of his marriage oh shit harry you guys only got married a year or so ago when did this happen bosch looked over at him and then back at the road recently there were no reporters waiting outside sheehans home when they got there twenty minutes later bosch said he was going to wait in the car and make some calls while sheehan got his things when he was alone he called his house to check for messages so he wouldnt have to play them in front of sheehan when they got there but there were none he put the phone away and just sat he wondered if his inviting sheehan to stay at his house had been a subconscious effort to avoid facing the emptiness of the place after a while he decided it wasnt he had lived alone most of his life he was used to places that were empty he knew the real shelter of a home was inside yourself light washing across the mirrors caught boschs eyes he checked the side view and saw the lights of a car that was being parked against the curb a block or so back he doubted it was a reporter a reporter would have pulled right into sheehans driveway made no effort at concealment he started thinking about what he wanted to ask sheehan a few minutes later his former partner came out of the house carrying a grocery bag he opened the back door and tossed it in then got in up front he was smiling margie took all the suitcases he said i didnt realize that till tonight they took beverly glen up the hill to mulholland and then took it east to woodrow wilson bosch usually loved driving mulholland at night the curving road the city lights coming in and out of view but along the way they drove by the summit and bosch studied the gate and thought about the kincaids somewhere behind it in the safety of their home with jetliner views frankie i have to ask you something he said shoot back on the kincaid thing during the investigation did you talk to kincaid much sam kincaid i mean yeah sure guy like that you handled with kid gloves him and the old man you be careful else it might come back on you yeah so you were pretty much keeping him informed on what was happening yeah pretty much what about it youre sounding like those bureau guys who were all over me all day harry sorry just asking did he call you a lot or did you call him both ways he also had a security guy who was talking to us staying in touch dc richter yeah thats him harry you going to tell me whats goin on or what in a minute let me ask you something first how much did you tell kincaid or richter about michael harris you remember what do you mean look im not saying you did anything wrong a case like that you keep the principals involved and informed so did you go to them and tell them you had brought harris in on the fingerprints and you know that you were smoking him in the rooms sure we did standard operating procedure right and did you tell them about who harris was and where he came from that sort of thing i suppose i did bosch let it go for a while he turned onto woodrow wilson and drove the winding road down to the house he pulled into the carport hey this looks nice sheehan said bosch put the car into park but paused before getting out did you tell the kincaids or richter specifically where harris lived he asked sheehan looked over at him what are you telling me im asking you did you tell any of them where harris lived i might have i dont remember bosch got out and headed to the kitchen door sheehan got his stuff out of the back seat and followed talk to me hieronymus bosch unlocked the door i think you made a mistake he went inside talk to me hieronymus bosch led sheehan to the guest room and sheehan threw his bag onto the bed back out in the hall bosch pointed into the bathroom and headed back into the living room sheehan was silent waiting the toilet handle in that one is broken bosch said not looking at him you have to hold it down the whole time its flushing he now looked at his former partner we can explain harriss fingerprints he didnt abduct or kill stacey kincaid in fact we dont even think there was an abduction kincaid killed his stepdaughter he was abusing her and killed her then staged the abduction scene he got lucky when the prints on the book tied in harris he then used it we think it was him or his man richter who dumped the body near harriss place because he knew where that place was so think francis i dont want probablys i need to know if you told kincaid or his security man where harris lived sheehan looked dumbfounded and his eyes wandered to the floor youre saying we were wrong about harris you guys had blinders on man once those prints came up you could only see harris sheehan kept his eyes on the floor and slowly nodded his head we all make mistakes frankie sit down and think about what i just asked what did you tell kincaid and at what point did you tell him ill be right back while he left sheehan to ponder what he had just been told bosch went back down the hall to his bedroom he stepped in and looked around it looked the same he opened the door to the walkin closet and hit the light eleanors clothes were gone he looked down at the floor her shoes had been cleared out as well on the rug he saw a little bundle of netting tied with a blue ribbon he bent down and picked it up the netting was wrapped around a handful of rice he remembered that the chapel in las vegas had provided the rice bundles as part of the wedding package for tossing at the happy couple eleanor had kept one as a keepsake now bosch wondered if she had mistakenly left it behind or had simply discarded it bosch dropped the bundle into his pocket and turned off the light chapter edgar and rider had rolled the television out of the lieutenants office and were watching the news when bosch walked into the squad room after leaving sheehan at his house they barely looked up to acknowledge him what bosch asked i guess people didnt like us cutting sheehan loose edgar said sporadic looting and arson rider said nothing like last time i think well make it if we get through this night we got roving platoons out there and theyre coming down on anything that moves no bullshit like last time edgar added bosch nodded and stared at the tv for a few moments the screen showed firefighters aiming threeinch hoses into the balling flames pouring through the roof of another strip mall it was too late to save it it almost seemed as though it was being done for the media urban redevelopment edgar said get rid of all the strip malls problem is they just put strip malls back rider said at least they look better than before edgar said real problem is the liquor stores these things always start in the liquor stores we put a squad out front of every liquor store no riot where are we on the warrants bosch asked were done rider said we just have to take them over to the judge who are you thinking about terry baker i already called and she said shed be around good lets have a look rider got up and walked over to the homicide table while edgar stayed behind and continued to watch the television stacked neatly at her spot were the search warrant applications she handed them to bosch weve got the two houses all cars all offices and on richter we have his car at the time of the killing and his apartment we threw that in too she said i think were set each petition was several pages stapled together bosch knew that the first two pages were always standard legalese he skipped these and quickly read the probable cause statements of each package rider and edgar had done well though bosch knew it was likely riders doing she had the best legal mind of the team even the pc statements on the proposed search of richters apartment and car were going to fly using clever language and selected facts from the investigation the pc statement said the evidence of the case indicated two suspects were involved in the disposal of stacey kincaids body and by virtue of the close employeremployee relationship that existed at the time between sam kincaid and dc richter richter could be considered a second suspect the petition asked permission to search all vehicles operated or accessible by the two men at the time of the crime it was a carefully worded tap dance but it would work bosch believed asking to search all cars accessible by the two men was a masterstroke by rider if approved this essentially would allow them access to any car on any one of the car lots owned by kincaid because he most certainly had access to those cars looks good bosch said when he had finished reading he handed the stack back to rider lets get them signed tonight so tomorrow we can move when we want to a search warrant was good for twentyfour hours following approval from a judge in most cases it could be extended another twentyfour hours with a phone call to the signing judge what about this richter guy bosch asked then we get anything on him yet a little edgar said he finally got up turned the sound down on the television and came over to the table guy was a washout at the academy this is way back fall of eightyone he then went to one of those bullshit private eye academies in the valley got his state license in eightyfour apparently went to work for the kincaid family after that he worked his way up to the top i guess why was he a washout we dont know yet its sunday night harry nobodys over at the academy well pull the records tomorrow bosch nodded you check the computer see if hes got a concealed license oh yeah we did hes got a license to carry hes strapped with what tell me its a nine sorry harry the atf was closed tonight well get that tomorrow too all we know now is that hes got a license to carry a concealed weapon okay remember that you two remember how good the shooter was on angels flight rider and edgar nodded so you think richters doing kincaids bidding rider asked probably the rich dont get themselves dirty like that they call the shots they dont take em right now i like richter he looked at his partners a moment he felt that they were very close to breaking this thing open theyd know in the next twentyfour hours he hoped the city could wait that long what else he asked you get sheehan all tucked in rider asked bosch noted the tone of her voice yeah hes tucked in and uh look i apologize about the press conference irving wanted you there but i probably couldve gotten you out of it i didnt i know it wasnt a good move i apologize okay harry rider said edgar nodded anything else before we go edgar started shaking his head then said oh yeah firearms called with an fyi they took a look at michael harriss gun this morning and it looks clean they said it probably hasnt been fired or cleaned in months judging by the dust buildup in the barrel so hes clear they going to go ahead with it anyway thats what they were calling for they got an asap from irving to do sheehans gun tomorrow morning as soon as they get the slugs from the autopsy they wanted to know if you wanted them to go ahead with harriss piece i told them they might as well good anything else edgar and rider shook their heads okay then bosch said lets go see judge baker and then well call it a day i have a feeling tomorrows gonna be a long one chapter it had started to rain bosch pulled into his carport and shut off his car he was looking forward to a couple of beers to take the caffeine edge off his nerves judge baker had served them coffee while she reviewed the search warrant petitions she had reviewed the search warrants slowly and thoroughly and bosch had drunk two full cups in the end though she had signed every warrant and bosch didnt need the caffeine to feel jazzed the next morning they would be hunting and confronting as kiz rider called it the putup or shutup phase of an investigation the point where theories and hunches culminated in hard evidence and charges or they disintegrated bosch went in through the kitchen door besides the beer he was already thinking about kate kincaid and how he would handle her the next day he was looking forward to it the way a confident quarterback who has digested all the film and known strategies of the opposition looks forward to the next days game the light was already on in the kitchen bosch put his briefcase on the counter and opened the refrigerator there was no beer shit he said he knew there had been at least five bottles of anchor steam in the refrigerator he turned and saw the five bottle caps on the counter he started further into the house hey frankie he called dont tell me you drank everything there was no reply bosch moved through the dining room and then the living room the place appeared as he had left it earlier that evening as if sheehan had not made himself at home he checked the rear deck through the glass doors the light was off outside and he saw no sign of his former partner he walked down the hallway and leaned close to the closed door of the guest room he heard nothing he looked at his watch it wasnt yet eleven frankie he whispered no reply only the sound of the rain on the roof he knocked lightly on the door frankie he said louder still nothing bosch reached to the knob and slowly opened the door the lights were off in the room but light from the hallway cut across the bed and bosch could see it was not occupied he flicked the wall switch and a bed table lamp came on the bag sheehan had carried his belongings in was empty on the floor his clothes had been dumped onto the bed in a pile boschs curiosity turned into a lowgrade concern he quickly moved back into the hallway and made a quick search of his own bedroom and the bathrooms there was no sign of sheehan back in the living room bosch paced about for a few moments wondering what sheehan might have done he had no car it was unlikely he would have tried to walk down the hill into the city and where would he be going anyway bosch picked up the phone and hit redial to see if by chance sheehan had called a cab it sounded like more than seven tones to bosch but the redial was so fast he wasnt sure after one ring the phone was answered by the sleepy voice of a woman yes uh who is this please who is this im sorry my name is detective harry bosch of the lapd i am trying to trace a call that was made from harry its margie sheehan oh margie he realized he should have guessed sheehan would have called her whats wrong harry nothing margie nothing im trying to find frankie and i thought maybe he called a cab or something im sorry to what do you mean find him he could read the rising concern in her voice its nothing to worry about margie he was staying with me tonight and i had to go out i just got home and he isnt here im just trying to figure out where he went he talked to you tonight earlier howd he seem okay he told me what they did to him how theyre trying to blame him no not anymore thats why hes staying with me we got him out of there and hes going to hide out here a few days till it blows over im really sorry that i woke he said theyd come back for him what he doesnt believe theyre going to let him go he doesnt trust anybody harry in the department except you he knows youre his friend bosch was silent he wasnt sure what to say harry find him would you then call me back i dont care what time it is bosch looked through the glass doors to the deck and from this angle saw something on the deck railing he stepped over to the wall and flipped on the outside light he saw five amber beer bottles lined up on the railing okay margie give me your number he took the number and was about to hang up when she spoke again harry he told me you got married and divorced already well im not divorced but you know yes i know take care harry find francis and then one of you call me back okay he put down the phone opened the slider and went out onto the deck the beer bottles were empty he turned to his right and there lying on the chaise lounge was the body of francis sheehan hair and blood were splattered on the cushion above his head and on the wall next to the slider jesus bosch whispered out loud he stepped closer sheehans mouth was open blood had pooled in it and spilled over his bottom lip there was a saucersized exit wound at the crown of his head rain had matted the hair down exposing the horrible wound even more bosch took one step back and looked around the deck planking he saw a pistol lying just in front of the lounges front left leg bosch stepped forward again and looked down at his friends body he blew his breath out with a loud animallike sound frankie he whispered a question went through his mind but he didnt say it out loud did i do this bosch watched one of the coroners people close the body bag over frankie sheehans face while the other two held umbrellas they then put the umbrellas aside and lifted the body onto a gurney covered it with a green blanket and began wheeling it into the house and toward the front door bosch had to be asked to step out of the way as he watched them head to the front door the crushing weight of the guilt he was feeling took hold again he looked up into the sky and saw there were no helicopters thankfully the notifications and call outs had all been made by landline no radio reports meant the media had yet to pick up on the suicide of frankie sheehan bosch knew that the ultimate insult to his former partner would have been for a news chopper to hover over the house and film the body lying on the deck detective bosch bosch turned deputy chief irving beckoned from the open slider bosch went inside and followed irving to the dining room table agent roy lindell was already standing there let us talk about this irving said patrol is outside with a woman who says she is your neighbor adrienne tegreeny yes yes what she lives next door she said she heard three or four shots from the house earlier tonight she thought it was you she did not call the police bosch just nodded have you fired weapons in the house or off the deck before bosch hesitated before answering chief this isnt about me so lets just say that there could be reason for her to have thought it was me fine the point im making is that it appears detective sheehan was drinking drinking heavily and firing his weapon what is your interpretation of what happened interpretation bosch said staring blankly at the table accidental or intentional oh bosch almost laughed but held back i dont think theres much of a doubt about it he said he killed himself suicide but there is no note no note just a lot of beers and wasted shots into the sky that was his note that said all he had to say cops go out that way all the time the man had been cut loose why do this well i think its pretty clear then make it clear for us would you please he called his wife tonight i talked to her after she said he might have been cut loose but he thought that it wouldnt last the ballistics irving asked no i dont think thats what he meant i think he knew that there was a need to hook somebody up for this a cop and so then he kills himself that does not sound plausible detective he didnt kill elias or that woman right now that is only your opinion the only fact we have is that it appears this man killed himself the night before the day we would get the ballistics and you detective talked me into cutting him loose so that he could do it bosch looked away from irving and tried to contain the anger that was building inside the weapon irving said an old baretta twentyfive serial number acidburned untraceable illegal a throwdown gun was it your weapon detective bosch bosch shook his head are you sure detective i would like to handle this now without the need for an internal investigation bosch looked back at him what are you saying i gave him the gun so he could kill himself i was his friend the only friend he had today its not my gun okay we stopped by his house so he could get some things he mustve gotten it then i might have helped him do it but that didnt include giving him the gun bosch and irving held each others stares youre forgetting something bosch lindell said interrupting the moment we searched sheehans place today there was no weapon found there bosch broke away from irving and looked at lindell then your people missed it he said he came here with that gun in his bag because it wasnt mine bosch moved away from them before he let his anger and frustration get the better of him and he said something that might bring departmental charges he slid down into one of the stuffed chairs in the living room he was wet but didnt care about the furniture he stared blankly out the glass doors irving stepped over but didnt sit down what did you mean when you said you helped him bosch looked up at him last night i had a drink with him he told me things told me about how he got carried away with harris how the things harris claimed in his lawsuit the things he said the cops did to him were true all of it was true you see he was sure harris had killed the girl there was no doubt in him about that but it bothered him what he had done he told me that in those moments in the room with harris he had lost it he said he became the very thing he had hunted all these years a monster it bothered him a lot i could see it had been eating at him then i come along tonight and drive him home bosch felt the guilt rising up like a tide in his throat he had not been thinking he had not seen the obvious he had been too consumed with the case with eleanor and his empty house with things other than frankie sheehan and irving prompted and i knocked down the one thing he believed in all these months the one thing that kept him safe i told him we had cleared michael harris i told him he was wrong about harris and that we could prove it i didnt think about what it would do to him i was only thinking about my case and you think that put him over irving said something happened to him in that room with harris something bad he lost his family after that he lost the case i think the one thread he held on to was his belief that hed had the right guy when he found out he was wrong when i stumbled into his world and told him it was bullshit the thread snapped look this is bullshit bosch lindell said i mean i respect you and your friendship with this guy but you arent seeing what is right here in front of us the obvious this guy did himself because hes the guy and he knew wed come back to him this suicide is a confession irving stared at bosch waiting for him to come back at lindell but bosch said nothing he was tired of fighting it i find myself agreeing with agent lindell on this the deputy chief finally said bosch nodded he expected as much they didnt know sheehan the way bosch did he and his former partner had not been close in recent years but they had been close enough at one time for bosch to know that lindell and irving were wrong it would have been easier for him to agree it would lift a lot of the guilt off him but he couldnt agree give me the morning he said instead what irving asked keep this wrapped up and away from the press for half a day we proceed with the warrants and the plan for tomorrow morning give me time to see what comes up and what mrs kincaid says if she talks shell talk shes dying to talk let me have the morning with her see how things go if i dont come up with a connection between kincaid and elias then you do what you have to do with frankie sheehan you tell the world what you think you know irving thought about this for a long moment and then nodded i think that would be the most cautious route he said we should have a ballistics report by then as well bosch nodded his thanks he looked out through the open doors to the deck again it was starting to rain harder he looked at his watch and saw how late it was getting and he knew what he still needed to do before he could sleep chapter bosch felt the obligation to go to margaret sheehan in person and tell her what frankie had done to himself it didnt matter that the couple had been separated she and frankie had been together a long time before that happened she and their two girls deserved the courtesy of a visit from a friend instead of a strangers dreadful phone call in the middle of the night irving had suggested that the bakersfield police department be prevailed upon to send an officer to the house but bosch knew that would be just as clumsy and callous as a phone call he volunteered to make the drive bosch did prevail upon the bakersfield cop shop but only to run down an address for margaret sheehan he could have called her to ask for directions but that would have been telling her without telling her an old cops trick for making the job easier it would have been cowardly the northbound golden state freeway was almost deserted the rain and the hour of night having cleared out all but those motorists with no choice but to be on the road most of these were truckers hauling their loads north toward san francisco and even further or returning empty to the vegetable fields of the midstate to pick up more the grapevine the steep and winding stretch of the freeway up and over the mountains lying north of los angeles was littered with semis that had slid off the roadway or whose drivers had chosen to pull over rather than risk the already treacherous run in the pounding rain bosch found that once he cleared this obstacle course and came down out of the mountains he was finally able to pick up some speed and lost time as he drove he watched branches of lightning spread across the purple horizon to the east and he thought about his old partner he tried to think about old cases and the irish jokes that sheehan used to tell anything to keep from thinking about what he had done and boschs own guilt and culpability he had brought a homemade tape with him and played it on the car stereo it contained recordings of saxophone pieces bosch particularly liked he fastforwarded until he found the one he wanted it was frank morgans lullaby it was like a sweet and soulful funeral dirge to bosch a goodbye and apology to frankie sheehan a goodbye and apology to eleanor it went well with the rain bosch played it over and over as he drove he got to the house where margaret sheehan and her two daughters were living before two there was an outside light still on and light could be seen through the curtains of the front windows bosch got the idea that margie was in there waiting for his call or maybe for him to show up he hesitated at the door wondering about how many times he had made this kind of call then finally knocked when margie answered the door bosch was reminded of how there was never any planning for these things she stared at him for a moment and he thought she didnt recognize him it had been a lot of years margie its harry harry bosch we just she stopped and put it together usually they did oh harry no oh no not francis she brought both hands up to her face her mouth was open and she looked like that famous painting of someone on a bridge screaming im sorry margie i really am i think maybe i should come in she was stoic about the whole thing bosch gave her the details and then margie sheehan made coffee for him so he wouldnt fall asleep on the ride back that was a cops wife thinking in the kitchen bosch leaned against a counter as she brewed the coffee he called you tonight he said yes i told you tell me how he seemed bad he told me what they did to him he seemed so betrayed is that the right word i mean his own people fellow cops had taken him in he was very sad harry bosch nodded he gave his life to that department and this is what they did to him bosch nodded again did he say anything about he didnt finish about killing himself no he didnt say that i read up on police suicide once long time ago in fact back when elias sued him the first time over that guy he killed frankie got real depressed then and i got scared i read up on it and what i read said that when people tell you about it or say theyre going to do it what they are really doing is asking you to stop them bosch nodded i guess frankie didnt want to be stopped she continued he didnt say anything about it to me she pulled the glass coffeepot out of the brewer and poured some into a mug she then opened a cabinet and took down a silver thermos she started filling it this is for the road home i dont want you falling asleep on the clothesline what i mean the grapevine im not thinking straight here bosch stepped over and put his hand on her shoulder she put the coffee pot down and turned to him to be hugged this last year she said things things just went haywire i know he told me she broke away from him and went back to filling the thermos margie i have to ask you something before i head back bosch said they took his gun from him today to run ballistics he used another do you know anything about that one no he only had the one he wore on the job we didnt have other guns not with two little girls when frankie would come home hed lock his job gun up in a little safe on the floor of the closet and only he had the key i just didnt want any more guns than were required in the house bosch understood that if it was her edict that there be no more weapons than the one sheehan was required to carry then that left a hole he could have taken a weapon in and hidden it from her in a spot so obscure even the fbi didnt find it when they searched his house maybe it was wrapped in plastic and buried in the yard sheehan also could have gotten the weapon after she and the girls moved out and up to bakersfield she would never have known about it okay he said deciding not to pursue it why harry are they saying it was your gun are you in trouble bosch thought a moment before answering no margie im fine dont worry about me chapter the rain continued through monday morning and slowed boschs drive into brentwood to a frustrating crawl it wasnt heavy rain but in los angeles any rain at all can paralyze the city it was one of the mysteries bosch could never fathom a city largely defined by the automobile yet full of drivers unable to cope with even a mild inclemency he listened to kfwb as he drove there were far more reports of traffic tieups than incidents of violence or unrest during the night unfortunately the skies were expected to clear by midday he arrived twenty minutes late for his appointment with kate kincaid the house from which stacey kincaid had allegedly been kidnapped was a sprawling white ranch house with black shutters and a slategray roof it had a broad green lawn stretching back from the street and a driveway that cut across the front of the house and then back around to the garage in the side yard when bosch pulled in there was a silver mercedes benz parked near the covered entryway the front door of the house was open when he got to the threshold bosch called out a hello and he heard kate kincaids voice telling him to enter he found her in the living room sitting on a couch that was covered in a white sheet all the furniture was covered in this way the room looked like a meeting of big heavy ghosts she noticed boschs eyes taking in the room when we moved we didnt take a single piece of furniture she said we decided just to start over no reminders bosch nodded and then studied her she was dressed completely in white with a silk blouse tucked into tailored linen pants she looked like a ghost herself her large black leather purse which was on the couch next to her seemed to clash with her outfit and the sheets covering the furniture how are you mrs kincaid please call me kate kate then i am very fine thank you better than i have been in a long long time how are you im just soso today kate i had a bad night and i dont like it when it rains im sorry to hear that it does look like you havent slept do you mind if i look around a little bit before we start talking he had a signed search warrant for the house in his briefcase but he didnt want to bring it up yet please do she said staceys room is down the hall to your left first door on the left bosch left his briefcase on the tiled entryway floor and headed the way she had directed the furniture in the girls room was not covered the white sheets that had covered everything were in piles on the floor it looked like someone probably the dead girls mother had visited here on occasion the bed was unmade the pink bedspread and matching sheets were twisted into a knot not as if by someone sleeping but maybe by someone who had lain on the bed and gathered the bedclothes to her chest it made bosch feel bad seeing it that way bosch stepped to the middle of the room keeping his hands in the pockets of his raincoat he studied the girls things there were stuffed animals and dolls a shelf of picture books no movie posters no photos of young television stars or pop singers it was almost as if the room belonged to a girl much younger than stacey kincaid had been at the end bosch wondered if the design was her parents or her own as if maybe she had thought by holding on to the things of her past she could somehow avoid the horror of the present the thought made him feel worse than when he had studied the bedclothes he noticed a hairbrush on the bureau and saw strands of blond hair caught in it it made him feel a little easier he knew that the hair from the brush could be used if it ever came to the point of connecting evidence possibly from the trunk of a car to the dead girl he stepped over and looked at the window it was a slider and he saw the black smudges of fingerprint powder still on the frame he unlocked the window and pulled it open there were splinter marks where the latch had supposedly been jimmied with a screwdriver or similar tool bosch looked out through the rain at the back yard there was a lima beanshaped pool that was covered with a plastic tarp rainwater was collecting on the tarp again bosch thought of the girl he wondered if she ever dove into the pool to escape and to swim to the bottom to scream past the pool he noticed the hedge that surrounded the back yard it was ten feet high and insured backyard privacy bosch recognized the hedge from the computer images he had seen on the charlottes web site bosch closed the window rain always made him sad and this day he didnt need it to feel that way he already had the ghost of frankie sheehan in his head he had a crumbled marriage he didnt have time to think about and he had haunting thoughts about the little girl with the lostinthewoods face he took his hand from his pocket to open the closet door the girls clothes were still there colorful dresses on white plastic hangers he looked through them until he found the white dress with the little semaphore flags he remembered that from the web site too he went back out into the hallway and checked the other rooms there was what looked like a guest bedroom which bosch recognized as the room from the photos on the web page this was where stacey kincaid had been assaulted and filmed bosch didnt stay long further down the hall were a bathroom the master suite and another bedroom which had been converted into a library and office he went back out to the living room it did not look as though kate kincaid had moved he picked up his briefcase and walked into the room to join her im a little damp mrs kincaid all right if i sit down of course and its kate i was thinking that id rather keep things on a formal basis for the moment if you dont mind suit yourself detective he was angry at her angry at what had happened in this house and how the secret had been locked away he had seen enough during his tour of the place to confirm in his own mind what kizmin rider had fervently believed the night before he sat down on one of the covered chairs across from the couch and put his briefcase on his knees he opened it and started going through some of the contents which from her angle kate kincaid could not see did you find something of interest in staceys bedroom bosch stopped what he was doing and looked over the top of the briefcase at her for a moment not really he said i was just getting a feel for the place i assume it was thoroughly searched before and there isnt anything in there that i could find did stacey like the pool he went back to his work inside the briefcase while she told him what a fine swimmer her daughter had been bosch really wasnt doing anything he was just following an act he had rehearsed in his head all morning she could go up and back without having to come up for air kate kincaid said bosch closed the case and looked at her she was smiling at the memory of her daughter bosch smiled but without any warmth mrs kincaid how do you spell innocence excuse me the word innocence how do you spell it is this about stacey i dont understand why are you indulge me for a moment please spell the word im not a good speller with stacey i always kept a dictionary in my purse in case she asked about a word you know one of those little ones that go ahead try it she paused to think the confusion was evident on her face idouble n i know theres two idouble nocense she looked at him and raised her eyebrows in a question bosch shook his head and reopened the briefcase almost he said but theres two cs no s darn i told you she smiled at him he took something out of the briefcase closed it and put it down on the floor he got up and walked across to the couch he handed her a plastic document envelope inside it was one of the anonymous letters that had been sent to howard elias take a look he said you spelled it wrong there too she stared at the letter for a long time and then took a deep breath she spoke without looking up at bosch i guess i should have used my little dictionary but i was in a hurry when i wrote this bosch felt a lifting inside he knew then that there would be no fight no difficulty the woman had been waiting for this moment maybe she knew it was coming maybe that was why she had said she felt better than she had in a long long time i understand bosch said would you like to talk to me about this mrs kincaid about everything yes she said i would bosch put a fresh battery into the tape recorder then turned it on and put it down on the coffee table the microphone pointed up so that it would capture his voice as well as kate kincaids are you ready he asked yes she said he then identified himself and said who she was noted the date time and location of the interview he read off a constitutional rights advisement from a printed form he had taken from his briefcase do you understand these rights as i have just read them yes i do do you wish to talk with me mrs kincaid or do you wish to contact an attorney no no what no attorney an attorney cant help me i want to talk this gave bosch pause he was thinking about how best to keep hair off the cake well i cant give you legal advice but when you say an attorney cant help me im not sure that that is going to constitute a waiver you see what i mean because it is always possible that an attorney could detective bosch i dont want an attorney i fully understand my rights and i dont want an attorney okay then i need you to sign this paper at the bottom and then sign again where it says that you do not request an attorney he put the rights form down on the coffee table and watched her sign it he then took it back and made sure she had signed her own name he then signed it himself as the witness and put it in one of the slots of the accordion file in the briefcase he sat back down in the chair and looked at her he thought for a moment about talking to her about a spousal waiver but decided that could wait hed let the district attorneys office handle that when and if the time came then i guess this is it he said you want to start mrs kincaid or do you want me to ask you questions he was using her name frequently on purpose in case the tape was ever played before a jury there would be no misunderstanding of whom the voices belonged to my husband killed my daughter i guess thats what you want to know first thats why you are here bosch froze for a moment and then slowly nodded how do you know this for a long time it was a suspicion then it became my belief based on things i had heard eventually he actually told me i finally confronted him and he admitted it what exactly did he tell you he said that it was an accident but you dont strangle people by accident he said she threatened him said that she was going to tell her friends what he what he and his friends did to her he said he was trying to stop her to talk her out of doing it he said things got out of hand this occurred where right here in the house when she gave the date of her daughters reported abduction she seemed to understand that bosch had to ask some questions that had obvious answers he was building a record your husband had sexually abused stacey yes he admitted this to you yes she started to cry then and opened her purse for a tissue bosch let her alone for a minute he wondered if she was crying because of grief or guilt or out of relief that the story was finally being told he thought it was probably a combination of all three over how long a period was she abused he finally asked kate kincaid dropped the tissue to her lap i dont know we were married five years before before she died i dont know when it started when did you become aware of it i would rather not answer that question if you dont mind bosch studied her her eyes were downcast the question was at the foundation of her guilt its important mrs kincaid she came to me once she got a fresh tissue from her purse for a fresh torrent of tears about a year before she said that he was doing things she didnt think were right at first i didnt believe her but i asked him about it anyway he denied it of course and i believed him i thought it was an adjustment problem you know to a stepfather i thought maybe this was her way of acting out or something and later she didnt say anything she looked down at her hands she pulled her purse onto her lap and held it tightly mrs kincaid and later there were things little things she never wanted me to go out and leave her with him but shed never tell me why looking back it is obvious why it wasnt so obvious then one time he was taking a long time in her room saying good night i went to see what was wrong and the door was locked did you knock on the door she sat frozen for a long moment before shaking her head no is that a no bosch had to ask it for the tape yes no i did not knock bosch decided to press on he knew that mothers of incest and molestation victims often didnt see the obvious or take the obvious steps to save their daughters from jeopardy now kate kincaid lived in a personal hell in which her decision to give up her husband and herself to public ridicule and criminal prosecution would always seem like too little too late she had been right a lawyer couldnt help her now no one could mrs kincaid when did you become suspicious of your husbands involvement in your daughters death during michael harriss trial you see i believed he did it harris i mean i just didnt believe that the police would plant fingerprints even the prosecutor assured me that it was unlikely that it could be done so i believed in the case i wanted to believe but then during the trial one of the detectives i think it was frank sheehan was testifying and he said they arrested michael harris at the place where he worked the car wash right he gave the address and the name of the place and it hit me then i remembered going to that same car wash with stacey i remembered her books were in the car i told my husband and said we should tell jim camp he was the prosecutor but sam talked me out of it he said the police were sure and he was sure that michael harris was the killer he said if i raised the question the defense would find out and use the information to twist the case like with the oj case the truth meant nothing wed lose the case he reminded me that stacey was found right near harriss apartment he said he probably saw her with me at the car wash that day and started to stalk us stalk her he convinced me and i let it go i still wasnt sure it wasnt harris i did what my husband told me and harris got off yes bosch paused for a moment believing the break was needed before the next question what changed mrs kincaid he finally asked what made you send those notes to howard elias my suspicions were never far away then one day a few months ago i overheard part of a conversation my husband was having with his his friend she said the last word as if it was the worst thing you could ever say about anybody richter yes they thought i wasnt home and i wasnt supposed to be i was supposed to be at lunch with my girlfriends at the club mountaingate only i stopped going to lunches with my girlfriends after stacey well you know lunches and that sort of thing didnt interest me anymore so i would tell my husband i was going to lunch but instead id go visit stacey at the cemetery okay i understand no i dont think you could understand detective bosch bosch nodded im sorry youre probably right go on mrs kincaid it was raining on that particular day just like today hard and sad so i only visited with her for a few minutes i got back to the house early i guess they didnt hear me come in because of the rain but i heard them they were in his office talking id had my suspicions so i went to the door i didnt make a sound i stood outside the door and listened bosch leaned forward this was the payoff hed know in a moment how legitimate she was he doubted two men involved in the killing of a twelveyearold girl would sit around reminiscing about it if kate kincaid said that was the case then bosch would have to think she was lying what did they say they werent talking in sentences do you understand they were just making short comments i could tell they were talking about girls different girls it was disgusting what they said i had no idea how organized this all was i had deluded myself into thinking that if something had happened with stacey it was a weakness on his part something he struggled with i was wrong these men were organized predators so you were at the door listening bosch said by way of getting her back on track they werent talking to each other it was like they were commenting i could tell by how they spoke that they were looking at something and i could hear the computer the keyboard and other sounds later i would be able to use the computer and find what it was they were looking at it was young girls ten eleven okay well get back to the computer in a couple of minutes but lets go back to what you heard how did this these comments lead you to conclude or know something about stacey because they mentioned her i heard richter say there she is and then my husband said her name the way he said it almost with a longing it wasnt the way a father or a stepfather would have said it and then they were quiet i could tell they were looking at her i knew bosch thought about what he had seen on riders computer screen the night before it was hard for him to imagine kincaid and richter sitting in an office together watching the same scenes and with decidedly different responses to them and then richter asked my husband if hed heard from detective sheehan my husband said about what and richter said for the payoff for putting harriss prints on staceys book my husband laughed he said there was no payoff he then told richter what i had told him during the trial about my having been to that car wash when he was done telling it they both laughed and my husband said and i remember this so clearly he said ive been lucky like that all my life and thats when i knew he did it that they did it and you decided to help howard elias yes why him why didnt you go to the police because i knew theyd never charge him the kincaids are a powerful family they believe they are above the law and they are my husbands father put money into the pockets of every politician in this town democrat republican it didnt matter they all owed him and besides that didnt matter i called jim camp and asked him what would happen if they ever found somebody else besides harris that they thought took stacey he told me theyd never be able to try him because of the first case all the defense would have to do was point to the first trial and say that last year they thought it was somebody else that was enough for reasonable doubt right there so theyd never go ahead with a case bosch nodded he knew she was right going to trial against harris put hair on the cake forever after this might be a good point to take a break for a couple minutes he said i need to make a phone call bosch turned the tape recorder off he got his cell phone out of his briefcase and told kate kincaid that he was going to check out the other side of the house while he made his call as he walked through the formal dining room and then into the kitchen bosch called lindells cell phone the fbi agent answered immediately bosch spoke quietly hoping his voice wouldnt carry into the living room this is bosch its a go weve got a cooperating witness on tape on tape she says her husband killed her daughter what about elias havent gotten there yet i just wanted to get you people going ill put out the word anybody been seen yet not yet it looks like the husband is still at home what about richter hes involved shes giving me stuff on him were not sure where he is if hes at his home he hasnt come out yet but well find him happy hunting after disconnecting he stood in the kitchen doorway and looked at kate kincaid her back was to him and she seemed to be staring at the spot where he had been sitting across from her she didnt move okay bosch said as he came back into the room can i get you something a glass of water no thank you im fine he turned the tape recorder on and once again identified himself and the subject of the interview he gave the exact time and date as well you have been advised of your rights correct mrs kincaid yes i have would you like to continue the interview yes you mentioned earlier that you decided to help howard elias why is that he was suing on behalf of michael harris i wanted michael harris completely exonerated and i wanted my husband and his friends exposed i knew the authorities probably wouldnt do it but i knew howard elias was not part of that establishment he wouldnt be controlled by money and power only the truth did you ever speak with mr elias directly no i thought my husband might be watching me after that day when i heard them when i knew it was him it was impossible for me not to be completely repulsed by him i think he realized i had come to a conclusion i think he had richter watch me richter or people working for him bosch realized that richter could be nearby having followed her to the house lindell had said the security mans whereabouts were currently unknown he looked at the front door and realized he had left it unlocked so you sent elias notes yes anonymous i guess i wanted him to expose these people but leave me out of it i know it was selfish i was a horrible mother i guess i had this fantasy that the bad men would be shown to the world without it happening to the bad woman bosch saw a lot of pain in her eyes as she said it he waited for the tears to start again but it didnt happen i just have a few more questions at this point he said how did you know the web page address and about how to get to the secret site you mean charlottes web my husband is not a smart man detective bosch he is rich and that always gives the appearance of intellect he wrote the directions down so he wouldnt have to memorize them and he hid them in his desk i found them i know how to use a computer i went to that awful place i saw stacey there again no tears bosch was puzzled kate kincaid had dropped her voice into a monotone she was reciting the story it seemed out of duty but whatever impact it personally had on her was done with and compartmentalized put away from the surface do you believe that to be your husband on the images with stacey no i dont know who that was how can you be sure my husband has a birthmark a discoloration on his back i said he wasnt smart but he was at least smart enough not to appear on that web site bosch thought about this though he did not doubt kate kincaids story he also knew that hard evidence backing it up would be needed to prosecute kincaid for the same reason she felt she could not bring her story to the authorities bosch needed to be able to go into the district attorneys office with sam kincaid solidly locked down by the evidence right now all he had was a wife saying evil things about her husband the fact that kincaid apparently was not the man in the web site images with his stepdaughter was a major loss of corroborative evidence he thought about the searches teams were descending on kincaids home and office at that moment it was boschs hope that they would find evidence that would prove his wifes story your last note to howard elias he said you warned him you said your husband knew did you mean your husband knew that elias had found the secret web site at the time yes why because of the way he was acting on edge suspicious of me he asked me if i had been on his computer it made me think that they must have known someone was poking around i sent the message but now im not so sure why is that howard elias is dead im not sure he did that he would have told me what bosch was thoroughly confused by her logic he would have told me he told me about stacey why wouldnt he tell me about elias as well and the fact that you know about the web site if they thought elias knew wouldnt they have closed it down or hidden it somewhere else not if they were just going to kill the intruder instead she shook her head she didnt see it the way bosch obviously did i still think he wouldve told me still confused bosch said wait a minute are you talking about the confrontation you mentioned at the start of this interview boschs pager went off and he reached down and silenced it without taking his eyes off kate kincaid yes well when was this confrontation last night last night bosch was shocked he had jumped to the conclusion that the confrontation she had mentioned had been weeks or even months earlier yes after you left i knew by the questions you asked that you had probably found my notes to howard elias i knew you would find charlottes web it was a matter of time bosch looked down at his pager the number belonged to lindells cell phone the emergency code was printed on the little screen after it he looked back up at kate kincaid so i finally summoned the courage i didnt have for all those months and years i confronted him and he told me and he laughed at me he asked me why i cared now since i didnt care while stacey was alive now boschs cell phone began to ring inside his briefcase kate kincaid slowly stood up ill let you take that in private as he reached to his briefcase he watched her pick her purse up and walk across the room in the direction of the hallway to her dead daughters bedroom bosch fumbled with the briefcases release but eventually got it open and got to the phone it was lindell im at the house the fbi agent said his voice tight with adrenaline and excitement kincaid and richter are here its not very pretty tell me theyre dead and it doesnt look like it was an easy ride for them they were kneecapped both of them shot in the balls you still with the wife bosch looked in the direction of the hallway yes just as he said it he heard a single popping sound from down the hallway he knew what it was better bring her over here lindell said right bosch closed the phone and placed it back in the briefcase his eyes still on the hallway mrs kincaid there was no answer all he heard was the rain chapter by the time bosch cleared the scene in brentwood and got up the hill to the summit it was almost two oclock driving through the rain on the way he could think only of kate kincaids face he had gotten to staceys room less than ten seconds after hearing the shot but she was already gone she had used a twentytwo and placed the muzzle in her mouth firing the bullet up into her brain death was instant the kick of the gun had knocked it out of her mouth and onto the floor there was no exit wound often the case with a twentytwo she simply appeared as though she was sleeping she had wrapped herself in the pink blanket that had been used by her daughter kate kincaid looked as though she was serene in death no mortician would be able to improve on that there were several cars and vans parked in front of the kincaid residence bosch had to park so far away that his raincoat was soaked through by the time he got to the door lindell was there waiting for him well this certainlys turned all to shit the fbi agent said by way of greeting yeah should we have seen it coming i dont know you never can tell what people are going to do howd you leave it over there the coroner and sid are still there a couple rhd bulls theyre handling it lindell nodded i saw what i needed to see show me what you have here they went into the house and lindell led the way to the huge living room where bosch had sat with the kincaids the afternoon before he saw the bodies sam kincaid was in the same spot on the couch where bosch had last seen him dc richter was on the floor below the window that looked out across the valley there was no jetliner view now it was just gray richters body was in a pool of blood kincaids blood had seeped into the material covering the couch there were several technicians working in the room and lights were set up bosch saw that numbered plastic markers had been put in place wherecaliber shells had been located on the floor and other furniture you have the twentytwo over in brentwood right yeah thats what she used you didnt think about searching her before you started talking huh bosch looked at the fbi agent and shook his head slightly in annoyance are you kidding me it was a voluntary q ampa man maybe youve never done one over there at the bureau but rule number one is you dont make the subject feel like a suspect before you even start i didnt search and it would have been a mistake if i know i know sorry i asked its just that he didnt finish but bosch knew what he was getting at he decided to change the subject the old man show up jack kincaid no we sent people to him i hear he is not taking it well hes calling every politician he ever gave money to i guess he thinks maybe the city council or the mayor will be able to bring his son back he knew what his son was probably knew all the time thats why hes making the calls he doesnt want that to come out yeah well well see about that weve already found digital video cameras and editing equipment well tie him to charlottes web i feel confident of that it wont matter wheres chief irving on the way bosch nodded he stepped close to the couch and bent over his hands on his knees to look closely at the dead car czar his eyes were open and his jaw was set in a final grimace lindell had been right when hed said it had not been an easy ride down he thought of kincaids expression in comparison to his wifes death look there was no comparison how do you think it went down he asked howd she get the two of them he continued to stare at the body while lindell spoke well you shoot a man in the balls and hes going to be pretty docile from the blood on them id say that was where they got it first once she got past that point i think she had pretty good control of the situation bosch nodded richter wasnt armed nope anybody find a ninemillimeter around here yet no not yet lindell gave bosch another we fucked up look we need that nine bosch said mrs kincaid got them to admit what they did with the girl but they didnt say anything about elias we need to find that nine to tie them in and end this thing well were looking if anybody finds the nine well be the first to know you have people on richters home office and car im still putting my money on him being the shooter yeah were on it but dont count on anything there bosch tried to read the fbi agent but couldnt he knew that something was not being said what edgar pulled his file from the police academy this morning right he was a washout way back how come turned out the guy was blind in one eye the left eye he was trying to make it through with nobody noticing he did all right until the weapons course he couldnt shoot for shit on the range thats how they found out then they washed him out bosch nodded he thought of the expert shooting that had taken place on angels flight and he knew this new information on richter changed things he knew it was unlikely richter could have been the shooter his thoughts were disrupted by the muted roar of a helicopter he looked up at the windows and saw a helicopter from channel drifting down and hovering outside the house about fifty yards away through the rain bosch could barely make out the cameraman in the open sliding door fucking vultures lindell said youd think the rain would keep them inside he stepped back to the doorway where there was a panel of light switches and other electronic controls he pushed a round button and kept his finger on it bosch heard the whine of an electric motor and watched an automatic window shade drop down over the windows they cant get near this place on the ground bosch said because of the gates so the airs their only shot i dont care lets see what they get now bosch didnt care either he looked back down at the bodies judging by the coloring and the slight odor already apparent in the room he guessed that the two men had been dead for several hours he wondered if this meant that kate kincaid had been in the house all that time with the bodies or had gone to brentwood and spent the night in her daughters bed he guessed the latter anybody come up with a tod he asked yeah coroner puts time of death at sometime last night anywhere from nine to midnight he said the blood flow indicates they could have been alive as long as a couple hours from first to last bullet it looks like she wanted some information from them but they didnt want to give it up at first her husband talked i dont know about richter she probably didnt care about him but her husband told her everything about stacey then i guess she finished him finished them both it wasnt her husband with the girl on the site images you should get the coroner to take torso photos of richter and do a comparison it might have been him lindell gestured toward the bodies will do so what do you think she did this last night and then what went up to bed probably not i think she spent the night in the brentwood house it looked to me like the girls bed had been slept in she had to see me and tell the story before she could finish her plan the finish being her suicide right thats hardcore man living with her daughters ghost what she let happen to her that was even more hardcore suicide was the easy way out not if you ask me like i keep thinking about sheehan man and wondering i mean how dark out could it have been for him to do that just hope you never know where are my people down the hall in the office theyre handling that ill be in there bosch left lindell then and went down the hall to the office edgar and rider were silently conducting a search the items they wished to seize were being piled on top of the desk bosch nodded his hello and they did the same a quiet pallor hung over the investigation now there would be no prosecution no trial it would be left to them to explain what had happened and they all knew the media would be skeptical and the public might not believe them bosch approached the desk there was a lot of computer equipment with connecting wires there were boxes of thick disks used for data storage there was a small video camera and an editing station weve got a lot harry rider said we would have had kincaid cold on the pedo net hes got a zip drive with all the images from the secret web site on it hes got this camera we think its what was used to take the videos of stacey rider who was wearing gloves lifted the camera up to show him its digital you take your movie plug the camera into this dock here and download what you want then you upload it on your computer and put it out on the pedo net all from the privacy of your home its literally as easy as she didnt finish bosch turned to see what the distraction was and saw deputy chief irving standing in the doorway of the room behind him stood lindell and irvings adjutant lieutenant tulin irving moved into the office and handed his wet raincoat to tulin he told him to take it and to wait in another room of the house which room chief any room irivng closed the door after tulin left that left him lindell and boschs team in the office bosch had an idea what was coming the fixer was here now the investigation was about to go through the spin cycle where decisions and public pronouncements would be made based on what best served the department not the truth bosch folded his arms and waited i want to finish this up now irving said take what you have found and clear out chief rider said we still have a lot of the house to cover i do not care i want the bodies removed and then i want the police removed sir she persisted we still havent found the weapon we need that weapon to and you are not going to find it irving stepped further into the room he looked around and when his eyes finally came to boschs face they stopped i made a mistake listening to you i hope the city does not have to pay for it bosch paused a moment before responding irving never took his eyes off him chief i know that you are thinking in political terms about this but we have to continue our searches of this house and other locations related to the kincaids we need to find the weapon in order to prove that i just told you you are not going to find the weapon not here or anywhere else related to the kincaids all this was detective was a diversion a diversion that caused three deaths bosch didnt know what was going on but he felt defensive he gestured toward the equipment on the desk i wouldnt call this a diversion kincaid was involved in a major pedophile ring and we your assignment was angels flight i obviously gave you people too much latitude and now here we are this is angels flight thats why we need the weapon it will tie it all damn it man we have the weapon we have had it for twentyfour hours we had the killer as well had we let him go and now we will never get him back bosch could only stare at him irvings face had turned the deep red of anger the ballistics analysis was completed less than an hour ago irving said the three slugs taken from the body of howard elias were matched unequivocally to bullets testfired in the firearms lab from detective francis sheehans ninemillimeter smith and wesson pistol detective sheehan killed those people on that train end of story there are those of us who believed in that possibility but were talked out of it the possibility is now fact but detective sheehan is long gone bosch was speechless and had to work hard to keep his jaw from dropping open you he managed to say youre doing this for the old man for kincaid you are rider grabbed bosch by the arm to try to stop him from committing career suicide he shrugged off her grip and pointed in the direction of the living room where the bodies were selling out one of your own to protect that how can you do that how can you make that kind of a deal with them and with yourself you are wrong irving yelled back at him then quietly he said you are wrong and i could crush you for saying what you just said bosch said nothing he continued to hold the deputy chiefs stare this city expects justice for howard elias irving said and for the woman killed with him you took that away detective bosch you allowed sheehan a cowards way out you took justice away from the people and they are not going to be happy about that heaven help us all for that chapter the plan was to hold the press conference quickly while the rain was still falling and could be used as a tool to keep people angry people off the streets the entire investigative team was assembled and lined along the wall at the rear of the stage the chief of police and the fbis gilbert spencer were to lead the briefing and answer all questions this was standard operating procedure in highly sensitive situations the chief and spencer knew little more than what was on the press release therefore questions about the details of the investigation could be easily and honestly deflected with the i am not aware of that or not to my knowledge sort of answer orourke from press relations did the warmup telling the mob of reporters to act responsibly and that the briefing would be short with further information furnished in the days to come he then introduced the chief of police who took a spot behind the microphones and read from a carefully prepared statement during my short tenure as chief of police i have had the responsibility of presiding over the funeral of police officers who have fallen in the line of duty i have held the hands of mothers who have lost their children to the senseless violence of this city but my heart has never been heavier than right now i have to announce to the people of this great city that we know who killed howard elias and catalina perez and it is with deep deep regret that i report that it was a member of this department earlier today ballistics tests and analysis matched the bullets that killed howard elias and catalina perez to the service weapon used by detective francis sheehan of the robberyhomicide division bosch looked out across the sea of reporters faces and saw shock on many of them the news gave even them pause for they knew the consequences the news was the match they the gasoline the rain probably wouldnt be enough to put out this fire a couple of reporters probably wire service men pushed through the standingroomonly crowd and went out the door to be the first to spread the word the police chief pressed on as many of you know sheehan was one of several officers being sued by howard elias on behalf of michael harris the investigators on this case believe sheehan became overwrought with emotions relating to this case and the dissolution of his marriage in recent months he may have become unbalanced we may never know because detective sheehan took his own life last night as he understood that it was only a matter of time before he was revealed as the killer as a police chief you hope never to have to make a statement such as this but this department hides nothing from its citizens the bad must be aired so that we can fully celebrate the good i know the eight thousand good people of this department join me in apologizing to the families of these two victims as well as to every citizen in this city and we ask that the good citizens in return react responsibly and calmly to this truly horrible turn of events now i have other announcements but if there are questions relating specifically to this investigation i can take a few at this time immediately there was a chorus of unintelligible shouts and the chief simply pointed to one of the reporters in the front center bosch didnt recognize him how and where did sheehan kill himself he was at a friends home last night he shot himself his service weapon had been confiscated for the ballistics exam he used another weapon the source of which is still under investigation it was the investigators belief that he did not have a weapon at his disposal they obviously were wrong the cacophony began again but it was coming in behind the booming voice of harvey button his question was clear and it had to be answered why was this man free he was a suspect yesterday why was he released the chief looked at button for a long moment before answering you just answered that yourself he was a suspect he was not under arrest we were awaiting the results of the ballistics examination and there was no reason to hold him at that time at that time there was no evidence with which to charge him we got that evidence with the ballistics report of course we got it too late chief we all know that the police can hold suspects up to fortyeight hours before charging them why wasnt detective sheehan held in custody frankly because we were pursuing other avenues of investigation he was not a fullfledged suspect he was one of several people we were looking at we felt there was no reason to hold him he had satisfactorily answered our questions he was a member of this department and we did not believe he was going anywhere we also didnt believe he was suicidal a followup button yelled above the ensuing din are you saying that his status as a police officer got him the privilege of being released so that he could go home and kill himself no mr button that is not what i am saying i am saying we didnt know for sure it was him until it was too late we knew today he was released and he killed himself last night if he had been a regular citizen say a black man like michael harris would he have been allowed to go home last night im not going to dignify that with a response the chief held his hands up to fend off the shouts of other reporters i have other announcements here the reporters continued to shout out questions and orourke stepped forward and shouted louder threatening to end the news conference and clear the room if there was not quiet it did the trick the chief took it from there this announcement is indirectly related to the events i just mentioned i have the grim duty of also announcing the deaths of sam kincaid kate kincaid and donald charles richter a security specialist who worked for the kincaids he went on to read from another sheet of paper that described the double murder and suicide couching the events as the actions of a distraught kate kincaid who had let mounting grief over the loss of her daughter get the better of her no mention was made of her husbands defilement of that daughter or his ongoing pedophilia or involvement in a secret web site dedicated to that perversion there was also no mention of the ongoing investigation of that site by the bureau and the departments computer fraud team bosch knew it was the old man at work the original car czar at work pulling strings to save his family name bosch guessed that markers were being called in all over the city jackson kincaid would not allow his sons reputation to be destroyed along with his own it might cost him too much business when the chief had finished reading from the page there was a smattering of questions if she was distraught why did she kill her husband asked keisha russell of the times well never know that and what about the security man richter why would she kill him if it was about her daughter again were not sure we are looking into the possibility that he happened to be in the house or happened by when mrs kincaid took out the gun and announced the intention of killing herself there is a strong possibility that both of the men were killed while trying to prevent mrs kincaid from doing that she then left the house and went to their previous home where the couple had lived with their daughter she killed herself in the bed where her daughter had slept it is a very sad situation and our hearts go out to the family and friends of the kincaids bosch was disgusted he almost shook his head but knew that since he was standing against the wall behind the chief that such a gesture would be picked up by the cameras and reporters now if there is nothing further i would ask that chief button cut in inspector general carla entrenkin has scheduled a press conference at howard eliass office in an hour do you know what she is going to say and do you have any comment on it no inspector entrenkin operates independently of this department she does not answer to me and therefore i have no idea what shell be saying but by the tone of the chiefs voice it was clear that he did not expect whatever entrenkin was going to say to be positive for the department i want to end now the chief said but before i do i want to thank the fbi and particularly special agent spencer for the help that was provided if there is any solace to be found in all of this it is that the citizens of this community can rest assured that this department is dedicated to weeding out the bad apples no matter where they might be this department is also willing to place and accept responsibility for its members action without coverup no matter what the cost to our pride and reputation i hope the good citizens of los angeles will remember that and accept my sincerest apology i hope the good citizens of los angeles will act calmly and responsibly in reaction to these announcements his last words were drowned out by the scraping of chairs and equipment as the reporters began to get up en masse and move toward the exit doors there was a story to get out and another press conference to go to detective bosch bosch turned irving had come up close to him any problems with what was announced any problems for you or your team bosch studied the deputy chiefs face the implication was clear make any waves and your boat will be the one that gets swamped and sinks and youd be taking others down with you go along to get along the company motto thats what it should say on the side of the cop cars forget about to protect and serve bosch slowly shook his head when what he wanted to do was put his hands around irvings throat no no problem at all he said through a tight jaw irving nodded and instinctively knew it was time to step away bosch saw the exit doors were now clear and headed that way his head down he felt that he didnt know anything his wife his old friend his city everybody and everything was strange to him and in that feeling of aloneness he thought he began to understand what it was that kate kincaid and frankie sheehan were thinking about at the end of the line chapter bosch had gone home to watch it all on television he had his portable typewriter on the coffee table and was leaning over it typing out the final reports on the investigation with two fingers he knew he could have given it to rider to do on her laptop and it would be done in a tenth of the time but bosch wanted to write this case summary himself he had decided to write it exactly the way it had happened everything not protecting anyone the kincaid family or even himself he would turn the final package over to irving and if the deputy chief wanted to rewrite it edit it or even shred it then it was up to him bosch felt that as long as he told it like it was and put it down on paper there was still a small degree of integrity in that he stopped typing and looked at the television when the broadcast broke away from the street reports of sporadic unrest and violence to recap the days events there were several outtakes from the press conference bosch saw himself standing against the wall behind the police chief his face giving the lie to everything that was being said and then the report cut to carla entrenkins press conference in the lobby of the bradbury she announced her immediate resignation as inspector general she said that after she had conferred with the widow of howard elias it was decided and agreed upon that she would take over the law practice of the slain attorney i believe that it is in this new role that i can have the most positive effect on reforming this citys police department and rooting out the bad seeds within she said carrying on howard eliass work will be an honor as well as a challenge when questioned by the reporters about the black warrior case entrenkin said that she planned to continue the case with minimal delay she would ask the presiding judge in the morning to reschedule the start of the trial for the following monday by then she would be up to speed on the intricacies of the case and the strategy howard elias had been planning to follow when a reporter suggested that the city would likely go out of its way to settle the case in light of the days developments entrenkin demurred like howard i dont want to settle this she said looking right at the camera this case deserves a full airing before the public we will go to trial great bosch thought as the report ended it wont rain forever if a fullblown riot is avoided now carla im thinkin would be sure to deliver it the following week the broadcast switched to a report on reaction from community leaders to the days events and the announcements by the chief of police when bosch saw the reverend preston tuggins appear on the screen he picked up the remote and switched channels he caught reports on peaceful candlelight vigils on two other channels and councilman royal sparks on a third before finally finding a broadcast that showed a helicopter shot from above the intersection of florence and normandie the same spot where the riots flared was packed with a large crowd of protesters the demonstration if it could be called that was peaceful but bosch knew it was only a matter of time the rain and the dimming light of the day were not going to hold back the anger he thought about what carla entrenkin had said to him on saturday night about anger and violence filling the void left when hope is taken away he thought about the void that was inside himself now and wondered what he would fill it with he turned the sound down and went back to his report when he was done he rolled it out of the typewriter and put it in a file folder he would drop it off the next morning when he got the chance with the end of the investigation he and his partners had been assigned to twelveandtwelve status like everybody else in the department they were to report in uniform at six oclock the next morning at the south bureau command center theyd be spending the next few days at a minimum on the streets riding the war zone in twocar eightcop patrols bosch decided to go to the closet to check out the condition of his uniform he hadnt worn it in five years since the earthquake and the last use of the departments emergency response plan while he was taking it out of its plastic wrap the phone rang and bosch hurried to answer it hoping that it might be eleanor checking in from someplace to say she was safe and okay he grabbed the phone off the night table and sat down on the bed but it wasnt eleanor it was carla entrenkin you have my files she said what the files the black warrior case im taking the case i need the files back oh right yeah i just saw that on the tv there was a silence then that made bosch uncomfortable there was something about the woman that bosch liked though he seemed to care so little for her cause i guess that was a good move he finally said you taking his cases you worked that out with the widow huh i did and no i didnt tell her about howard and me i didnt see the need to spoil the memories she will have shes had it rough enough that was noble of you detective what nothing i just dont understand you sometimes join the club more silence i have the files here the whole box i was just typing out my final report ill pack it all up and try to drop it off tomorrow but i cant be held to it im on patrol until things calm down on the south side that will be fine are you taking over his office too is that where i should bring everything yes thats the plan that would be fine bosch nodded but he knew she couldnt see this well he said thanks for your help i dont know if irving has said anything but the lead to sheehan came out of the files one of the old cases i guess you heard about that actually no but youre welcome detective bosch im curious though about sheehan he was your former partner yes he was does all of this seem plausible that he would first kill howard and then himself that woman on the train too if you asked me that yesterday i would have said never in a million years but today i feel like i couldnt read myself let alone anybody else we have a saying when we cant explain things the evidence is what it is and we leave it at that bosch leaned back on the bed and stared up at the ceiling he held the phone to his ear after a long moment she spoke but is it possible that there is another interpretation of the evidence she said it slowly concisely she was a lawyer she chose her words well what are you saying inspector its just carla now what are you saying carla what are you asking me you have to understand my role is different now i am bound by attorneyclient ethics michael harris is now my client in a lawsuit against your employer and several of your colleagues i have to be care is there something that clears him sheehan something you held back before bosch sat up and now leaned forward he was staring wideeyed at nothing he was all internal trying to remember something he could have missed he knew entrenkin had held back the trial strategy file there must have been something in there i cant answer your the strategy file bosch cut in excitedly it was something in there that puts the lie to this it he stopped what she was suggesting or the suggestion he was reading in her words did not make sense sheehans service weapon had been linked to the angels flight shootings there was a ballistics match three bullets from the body of howard elias three matches end of argument end of case the evidence is what it is that was the hard fact he was up against yet his gut instinct still told him sheehan was all wrong for this that he wouldnt have done it yes he would have gladly danced on eliass grave but he wouldnt have put the lawyer in that grave there was a big difference and boschs instincts though abandoned in light of the facts were that frankie sheehan no matter what he had done to michael harris was still too good a man at his core to have done the latter he had killed before but he was not a killer not like that look he said i dont know what you know or think you know but youve got to help me i cant its there she said if you have the files its there i held something back that i was bound to hold back but part of it was in the public files if you look youll find it im not saying your partner is clear im just saying there was something else here that probably should have been looked at it wasnt and thats all you are going to tell me thats all i can tell you and even that i shouldnt have bosch was silent for a moment he didnt know whether to be angry with her for not telling him specifically what she knew or just happy that she had given him the clue and the direction all right he finally said if its here ill find it chapter it took bosch nearly two hours to make his way through the black warrior case files many of the folders he had opened previously but some had been viewed by edgar and rider or left to others on the squad irving had put together at angels flight less than seventytwo hours earlier he looked at each file as if he had never seen it before looking for the thing that had been missed the telling detail the boomerang that would change his interpretation of everything and send it in a new direction that was the problem with gangbanging a case putting multiple investigative teams on it no single pair of eyes saw all of the evidence all of the leads or even all of the paperwork everything was split up though one detective was nominally in charge it was rare that everything crossed his radar screen now bosch had to make sure it did he found what he believed he was looking for and what carla entrenkin had hinted at in the subpoena file the folder where receipts from the process server were stored these receipts were received by howard eliass office after the subject of the subpoena had been served with the summons to appear for a deposition or as a witness in court the file was thick with the thin white forms the stack was in chronological order of service the first half of the stack consisted of subpoenas for depositions and these dated back several months the second half of the stack consisted of witness subpoenas for the court case that had been scheduled to start that day these were summonses to the cops being sued as well as other witnesses bosch remembered that edgar had looked through this file earlier he had come across the subpoena for the car wash records but that discovery must have distracted him from other things in the file as bosch looked through the subpoenas another filing caught his eyes as being worthy of a second look it was a subpoena for detective john chastain of the internal affairs division this was surprising because chastain had never mentioned any involvement in the lawsuit chastain had headed the internal investigation of michael harriss allegations that had cleared the rhd detectives of any wrongdoing so the fact that he had been called wasnt unusual it would stand to reason that he would be called as a witness in defense of the detectives accused of wrongdoing by michael harris but the fact that chastain had not told anyone he was a subpoenaed witness for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit was if that had been known he might have been disqualified from the team investigating the murders for the same reason that the rhd bulls had been removed there was a clear conflict the subpoena needed explanation and boschs interest in it increased further when he saw that the date of service was thursday the day before eliass murder but curiosity turned to suspicion when bosch saw the note handwritten by the process server at the bottom of the subpoena det chastain refused acceptance at vehicle server placed under wiper the note made it very clear that chastain didnt want any part of the case and it turned boschs attention into a sharp focus the city could have been burning from dodger stadium to the beach and he probably wouldnt have noticed the television now he realized as he stared at the subpoena that the subject chastain had been given a specific date and time to appear in court to give testimony he shuffled through the court subpoenas and realized that they were placed in the file in order of service not in the order that those summoned would appear in trial he knew then that by placing them in order according to the appearance dates and times he would have the chronological order of eliass case and a better understanding of how he planned the trial it took him two minutes to put the subpoenas in the proper order when he was done he looked at the documents one by one envisioning the process of the trial first michael harris would testify he would tell his story next would come captain john garwood head of rhd garwood would testify about the investigation giving the sanitized version the next subpoena was for chastain he would follow garwood reluctantly he had tried to refuse service he would follow the rhd captain why bosch put the question aside for the moment and began going through the other subpoenas it became clear that elias was following an ageold strategy of alternating positive and negative witnesses he was planning to alternate the testimony of the rhd men the defendants with witnesses who would obviously benefit michael harris there was harris the doctor who treated his ear jenkins pelfry his boss at the car wash the two homeless men who had found stacey kincaids body and finally kate kincaid and sam kincaid it was clear to bosch that elias was going to attack the rhd case expose the torture of michael harris and establish his defense of having done nothing wrong he would then blow the rhd completely out of the water by bringing in kate kincaid to detail the car wash connection and the explanation for the fingerprints then most likely it would be sam kinkaids turn elias would use him to expose the charlottes web site and the horror of stacey kincaids young life it was clear that the case elias was going to present to the jury followed the same line of investigation bosch and his team had followed that harris was innocent that there was an explanation for his fingerprints and that sam kincaid or someone connected to him and the pedo net killed his stepdaughter bosch knew it was a good strategy he believed elias would have won the case he flipped back to the front of the court subpoenas chastain was third in line putting him on the positive side of the alternating strategy coming after garwood and before one of the rhd defendants he was going to be a positive witness for elias and harris but he had attempted to refuse being served the subpoena bosch read the name of the service company off the form and called information it was late but process serving was an oddhours job people werent always served nine to five a man answered the phone and bosch reading from the chastain subpoena asked for steve vascik hes not here tonight hes home bosch identified himself and explained that he was conducting a homicide investigation and needed to talk to vascik immediately the man on the other end of the line was reluctant to give out vasciks phone number but agreed to take boschs number and contact vascik with the message after disconnecting the call bosch got up and paced around his house he wasnt sure what he had but he had the fluttering feeling in his stomach that often came when he was on the edge of a breakthrough to something hidden he was flying on instinct and his instinct told him he was close to something he would soon be able to wrap his hands around the phone rang and he grabbed it off the couch and pushed the connect button mr vascik harry its me eleanor hey how are you are you all right im fine but im not the one in a city about to burn ive been watching the news yeah it looks bad im sorry it turned out that way harry you told me about sheehan once i know you guys were close bosch realized that she didnt know that the friends home where sheehan had killed himself was theirs he decided not to say anything he also wished he had call waiting service on his line eleanor where are you im back in vegas she gave an unhumorous laugh the car barely made it at the flamingo no im somewhere else she didnt want to tell him where and that hurt is there a number i can call you at im not sure how long im going to be here i just wanted to call and make sure you were okay me dont worry about me are you okay eleanor im fine bosch didnt care about vascik anymore do you need anything what about your car no im fine now that im here im not worried about the car there was a long moment of silence bosch heard one of the electronic sounds that he had once heard somebody call digital bubbles well he finally said can we talk about this i dont think this is a good time lets think about things for a couple of days and then well talk ill call you harry be careful do you promise to call i promise okay eleanor ill wait goodbye harry she hung up before he could say goodbye bosch stood there next to the couch for a long time thinking about her and what had happened to them the phone rang while still in his hand yes detective bosch i got a message to call you mr vascik yes from triple a process my boss shelly said you yes i called bosch sat down on the couch and pulled a notebook onto his thigh he took a pen out of his pocket and wrote vasciks name on the top of a page vascik sounded young and white to him he had some midwest in his voice how old are you steve im twentyfive you been with triple a very long a few months okay last week on thursday you served paper on an lapd detective named john chastain do you remember that sure he didnt want to be served most cops ive done dont really care theyre used to it right thats what i wanted to ask you about when you say he didnt want to be served what do you mean exactly well the first time i tried to serve him he refused to take the subpoena and walked away then when wait a minute go back when was the first time it was thursday morning i went to the lobby at parker center and had the cop at the desk call him and tell him to come down i didnt say what it was for it said on the paper he was iad so i just said i was a citizen with something for him that he needed he came down and when i said who i was he just backed off and went back to the elevator what youre saying is that it was like he knew you had a subpoena and even what case it was right exactly bosch thought about what he had read in eliass last notebook his feuding with a source named parker okay then what well then i went and did some other jobs and i came back about threethirty and watched the employee lot at parker i saw him come out to go home i guess and i cut between some cars and ducked down and sort of came up just as he was opening his door i had my spiel all worked out and told him he was served and said the case number and all of that he still wouldnt take the paper but that didnt matter because under california law all you right i know you cant refuse a subpoena once you have been advised that it is a legal courtordered subpoena so what did he do well first he scared the shit out of me he put his arm under his coat like he was going for his gun or something then what then he sort of stopped i guess he thought about what he was doing he relaxed a little bit but he still wouldnt take the paper he told me to tell elias to fuck off he got in his car and started pulling out i knew he was served so i just put the paper under his windshield wiper he drove off with it like that i dont know what happened to it after that couldve blown off but it doesnt matter he was legally served bosch thought for a moment while vascik went on about the intricacies of process serving he finally cut him off did you know elias got killed friday night yes sir sure he was our client we did all his cases well did you ever think to call the department after he was killed and tell someone about this thing with chastain i did vascik answered defensively i called you called whod you call i called parker center and said i had information i was transferred to an office and told the guy who answered who i was and that i had some information he took my name and number and said someone would call me back nobody ever did no somebody called in like five minutes maybe less right away i told him when was this sunday morning i was out climbing all day saturday up at vasquez rocks i didnt hear about mr elias until i read the times on sunday morning do you remember the name of the cop you told this to i think his name was edgar but i dont know if that was his first or last name what about the person who took your call in the first place did he give a name i think he said his name but i forget it but he did say he was an agent so maybe it was an fbi guy steve think for a minute what time did you make this call and when did edgar call you back do you remember vascik was quiet while he thought about it well i didnt get up till about ten cause my legs were killing me from the climb i then kind of lazed around and read the paper it was all over the front page so i probably read it right after the sports and then i called so maybe about eleven thereabouts and then that edgar guy called back pretty quick thanks steve bosch clicked the phone off he knew there was no way edgar had taken a call at parker center on sunday morning at eleven edgar had been with bosch all sunday morning and most of the rest of the day and they were on the road not working out of parker someone had used his partners name a cop someone inside the investigation had used edgars name he looked up lindells cell phone number and called lindell still had it turned on and he answered its bosch you remember sunday morning after you and your people came into the case you spent most of the morning in the conference room with the files right yeah right who was answering the phones me mostly a couple of the others did you take a call from a guy said he was a process server sounds familiar but we were getting lots of calls that morning reporters and people thinking they knew something people threatening the cops a process server named vascik steve vascik he said he had some information that might be important like i said its familiar what about it bosch i thought this case was over it is im just checking some loose ends whod you give the call to i gave those kind of calls you know info off the street to the iad guys to keep them busy which one did you give the process server to i dont know probably chastain he was in charge of that group he mightve taken it or told one of the others to call the guy back see irving set up some shitty phones in there we couldnt transfer one to the other and i wanted the main line free so we took numbers and passed them on okay thanks man have a nice night hey what is bosch disconnected before he had to answer any questions he thought about the information from lindell he believed there was a high probability that the call from vascik had been routed to chastain himself who then called back probably taking the message to his own office for privacy and posed as edgar bosch had one more call to make he opened his phone book and found a number that he had not used in many years he called captain john garwood head of robberyhomicide division at home he knew it was late but he doubted very many people were sleeping in los angeles tonight he thought about what kiz rider had said about garwood reminding her of boris karloff and only coming out at night garwood answered after two rings its harry bosch we need to talk tonight about john chastain and the black warrior case i dont want to talk on the phone fine name the place frank sinatra how soon give me half an hour ill be there chapter in the long run frank sinatra got ripped off decades ago when the hollywood chamber of commerce put his star down on the sidewalk they put it on vine street rather than on hollywood boulevard the thinking probably was that the sinatra star would be a draw people would come down from the boulevard to see it to take a picture but if that was the plan it didnt work frank was alone in a spot that probably saw more hypes than tourists his star was at a crosswalk between two parking lots and next to a residence hotel where you had to convince the security guard to unlock the lobby door if you wanted to go in when bosch had been in rhd years before the sinatra star had often been a meeting spot between detectives in the field or between detectives and their snitches it hadnt surprised bosch that garwood had suggested it for their meeting it was a way of meeting on neutral ground by the time bosch got to the star garwood was already there bosch saw his unmarked ford ltd in the parking lot garwood flashed his lights bosch pulled to the curb in front of the hotel and got out he crossed vine to the parking lot and got in the front passenger seat garwood was wearing a suit even though called from home bosch realized that he had never seen garwood in anything other than a suit the tie always pulled tight the top button of his shirt never undone again bosch thought of riders boris karloff comment those fucking cars garwood said looking across the street at boschs slickback i heard about you getting potshotted yeah that wasnt fun so what brings you out tonight harry how come youre still investigating a case that the chief of police and everybody else has already closed because i have a bad feeling about it cap there are loose ends things can unravel when you have loose ends you never could leave things alone i remember that from when you worked for me you and your fucking loose ends so tell me about chastain garwood said nothing just stared ahead through the windshield and bosch realized that his former captain was unsure about things were off the record here captain like you said the case is closed but something about chastain and frankie sheehan bothers me you should know a couple nights ago frankie told me everything about how he and some of the guys lost it did things to michael harris he told me all the black warrior stuff was true and then i made a mistake i told him that i had cleared harris that i could prove he didnt take that girl and that put the hex on frankie and later on he did what he did so when they came up with the ballistics today and said that frankie did it all including angels flight i went along to get along now im not so sure now i want all the loose ends tied up and chastain is one of them he was subpoenaed for the trial nothing unusual about that he handled the internal investigation of harriss complaint but he was subpoenaed by elias and he didnt tell us he also tried to duck the service and that makes it all the more unusual that tells me he didnt want to be in that courtroom he didnt want to be on the stand and have elias asking him questions i want to know why theres nothing in eliass files at least the files i have access to that says why i cant ask elias and i dont want to ask chastain yet so im asking you garwood reached into his pocket and took out a package of cigarettes he got one out and lit it then offered the pack to bosch no thanks im still off i decided that im a smoker and thats that somebody a long time ago told me that it was like destiny or fate you were a smoker or you werent there was nothing you could do about it you know who that was yeah me garwood snorted a little and smiled he took a couple of deep drags and the car filled with smoke it kicked off the familiar craving in bosch he remembered giving garwood the smoking sermon years before when someone in the squad complained about the cloud of smoke that always hung over the bullpen he lowered his window a couple of inches sorry garwood said i know how you feel everybody smoking and you cant its no problem you want to talk about chastain or not one more drag chastain investigated the complaint you know that before harris could sue us he had to file a complaint that went to chastain and from what i understood at the time he made the guys case he confirmed it fucking rooker had a pencil in his desk the tip was broken off and there was blood on it kept it like a souvenir or something chastain got it with a search warrant and was going to match the blood to harris bosch shook his head at both the stupidity and the arrogance of rooker of the whole department yeah garwood said seeming to know what he was thinking so the last thing i heard was that chastain was going to file departmentals against sheehan rooker couple of the others then go to the da for criminal charges he was going all the way with this one because that pencil and the blood were hard evidence he had rooker at least in the bag okay so what happened what happened was that the next thing is we get the word that everybodys clear chastain filed the case as unfounded bosch nodded somebody reached down you got it who irvings my guess but maybe higher the case was too volatile if the charges were sustained and there were suspensions firings da charges whatever then we start a whole new round of kick the lapd in the press and in the south end with tuggins and sparks and everywhere else remember this was a year ago the new chief had just come on board it wouldnt be a good way to start out so somebody reached down irvings always been the department fixer it was probably him but for something like this he might have enlisted the chiefs okay thats how irving survives he hooks the chief in then he cant be touched because he has the secrets like j edgar hoover and the fbi but without the dress i think bosch nodded what do you think happened to that pencil with the blood on it he asked who knows irvings probably using it to write personnel evaluations though im sure hes washed the blood off it they were silent for a moment as they watched a group of a dozen young men walking north on vine toward the boulevard they were mostly white in the streetlight bosch could see the tattoos covering their arms headbangers probably going up to the stores on the boulevard to replay a quick memory of fredericks of hollywood being looted flashed through his mind the group slowed as they passed boschs car they considered whether to do something to the car and then decided against it and moved on lucky we didnt meet in your car garwood said bosch didnt say anything this place is going to come apart tonight garwood continued i can feel it pity the rain stopped chastain bosch said getting back on track somebody put a cork in him complaint unfounded then elias files his suit and eventually subpoenas chastain chastain doesnt want to testify why maybe he takes the oath seriously he didnt want to lie theres got to be more than that ask him elias had a source inside parker a leak i think it was chastain i dont mean just on this case i mean a longtime leak adirect conduit inside to records everything i think it was chastain its funny a cop who hates cops yeah but if he was eliass big important conduit why would elias put him on the stand and expose him like that that was the question and bosch had no answer he was silent for a while thinking about this he finally put together the thin beginnings of a theory and said it out loud elias wouldnt have known chastain had been corked unless chastain had told him right right so just by putting chastain on the stand and asking him about it would be revealing chastain as his source garwood nodded i can see that he said yeah even if chastain sat up there and denied every question elias could ask the questions in a way that they would still get the point and in this case the truth across to the jury it would also make the point at parker center garwood said chastain would be exposed question is why would elias expose his source somebody who had been helping him a hell of a lot over the years why would he give that up because this was eliass home run case the big one that would put him on the national map it would put him on court tv sixty minutes larry king and everything else it would make him he would be willing to burn his source for that any lawyer would i see that too yeah the next part was left unsaid that being the question of what chastain would do to prevent being publicly burned on the stand to bosch the answer was obvious if he were exposed not only as eliass source but as the investigator who compromised the internal investigation of michael harriss complaint he would be vilified both inside and outside the department there would be nowhere for him to go and that would be untenable for a man like chastain for any man bosch believed chastain would be willing to kill to prevent that from happening thanks captain he said ive got to go it doesnt matter you know bosch looked over at him what doesnt matter the press releases have been made the press conferences given the storys out and the city is ready to go like kindling you think the people in the south end care which cop killed elias they dont give a shit they already have what they want chastain sheehan doesnt matter what matters is that a badge did it and if you go making noise youll just be adding more fuel to the fire you bring up chastain and you bring up the coverup a lot of people might get hurt lose their jobs all because they wanted to head this off in the first place you better think about that harry nobody cares bosch nodded he understood the message go along to get along i care he said is that enough of a reason what about chastain then garwood had a thin smile on his face bosch could see it behind the glowing point of his cigarette i think chastain deserves whatever he gets and someday hell get it now there was a new message and bosch thought he understood that as well and what about frankie sheehan what about his reputation theres that garwood said nodding frankie sheehan was one of my guys but hes dead and his family doesnt live here anymore bosch said nothing but that answer wasnt acceptable sheehan was his friend and partner tainting him tainted bosch himself you know what bothers me garwood asked and maybe you might be able to help me being that you and sheehan were partners at one time what what bothers you the gun sheehan used it wasnt yours now was it i know they asked you that no not mine we had gone by his house on the way to mine to get clothes and things he mustve picked it up then the fbi mustve missed it when they searched his place garwood nodded i heard you made notification to his wife did you ask her about that you know about the gun i asked she said she didnt know about any gun but that doesnt no serial number garwood said cutting in a throwdown gun everybody knows thats what that was yeah and thats what bothers me i knew sheehan a lot of years he worked for me a long time and you get to know your guys i never knew him to be the kind of guy who would have a throwdown i asked some of the other guys especially the ones that partnered with him since you went to hollywood they never knew about a throwdown what about you harry you worked with him the longest did he ever carry an extra piece it hit bosch then like a punch in the chest the kind where you have to keep perfectly still and silent and wait it out until you slowly get your breath back he had never known frank sheehan to carry a throwdown on the job he was too good for that and if you were too good to carry one on the job why have one hidden at home that question and its obvious answer had been there right in front of him all along but he had missed it bosch remembered sitting in his car outside sheehans house he remembered the set of headlights he saw in the mirror and the car pulling to the curb down the block chastain he had followed them to chastain sheehan alive was the only loose end that could cause things to unravel he thought of his neighbors reports of three to four shots being fired at his house in his mind a drunken cops suicide was now a calculated murder motherfucker bosch whispered garwood nodded he had successfully led bosch down the road to where he apparently already was now do you see how it could have been done he asked bosch tried to slow his thoughts and let it come to him finally he nodded yes i see now good ill make a call ill have whoever is on duty in the basement let you have a look at the signout log no questions asked that way youll be sure bosch nodded he reached over and opened the door he got out without another word and started back toward his car he was running before he got there he didnt know why there was no hurry it was no longer raining he just knew he had to keep moving to keep from screaming chapter outside of parker center there was a candlelight vigil and a funeral procession two cardboard caskets one marked justice the other marked hope were being carried aloft by the crowd as they marched back and forth across the front plaza others carried signs that said justice for people of all colors and justice for some is justice for none above news helicopters circled and on the ground there were at least six news crews that bosch could see it was getting close to eleven and all of them were getting ready to put out live reports from the protest front at the front door a phalanx of cops in uniforms and riot helmets stood ready to defend the police headquarters if the crowd turned from peaceful demonstration to violence in a peaceful demonstration had turned violent and the mob roamed downtown destroying everything in its path bosch hurried toward the lobby doors skirting behind the procession of protesters and through a crack in the human defense line after holding his badge up high over his head inside he passed the front counter which had four cops behind it also wearing helmets and went through the elevator lobby and took the stairwell he went down to the basement level and then followed the hallway to the evidence storage center he realized as he went through the door into evidence that he hadnt passed a soul since the front counter the place seemed empty under the emergency response plan all available hands of the a shift were out on the street bosch looked through the wiremesh window but didnt recognize the man on duty he was an old vet with a white mustache on a face flushed with gin blossoms they moved a lot of the old brokendown ones to the basement this one got off his stool and came to the window so whats the weather like outside i dont have no windows in here the weather its partly cloudy with a chance of riots i figured tuggins still got his crowd out front theyre there yeah the mutts wonder howd theyd like it if there were no coppers around see how theyd like life in the jungle then thats not their point they want police they just dont want cops that are killers can you blame em for that yeah well some people need killing bosch had nothing to say to that he didnt even know why he was parrying with this old dog he looked down at his nameplate it said howdy bosch almost laughed something about seeing the unexpected name cracked through the tension and anger that had been twisting him all night fuck you its my name sorry im not laughing at its something else sure howdy pointed over boschs shoulder at a little counter with forms on it and pencils tied to strings you want something you gotta fill out the form with the case number i dont know the case number well we must have a couple million in here why dont you take a wild guess i want to see the log the man nodded right you the one garwood sent over thats right why didnt you say so bosch didnt answer howdy reached below the window to someplace bosch couldnt see then he came up with a clipboard and put it into the passthrough slot beneath the wire mesh how far back you want to look he asked im not sure bosch said i think just a couple days will do it theres a week on there thats all the sign outs you want sign outs not sign ins right right bosch took the clipboard over to the forms counter so he could look at it without howdy watching what he was doing he found what he was looking for on the top page chastain had checked out an evidence box at seven that morning bosch grabbed one of the signout forms and a pencil and started filling it out he noticed as he wrote that the pencil was a black warrior no the first choice of the lapd he took the clipboard and form back to the window and slid them through the slot that box might still be on the goback cart he said it was just checked out this morning no it will be back in place we run a tight ship he looked down at the form and the name bosch had filled out detective friendly bosch nodded and smiled i know you do howdy walked over and got on a golf cart and then drove away into the bowels of the huge storage room he was gone less than three minutes before the cart came back into view and he parked it he carried a pink box with tape on it over to the window unlocked the mesh window gate and passed the box over to bosch detective friendly huh they send you around to the schools to talk to the kids tell em to say no to drugs stay out of the gang shit like that something like that howdy winked at bosch and closed the window gate bosch took the box over to one of the partitioned cubicles so he could look through its contents privately the box contained evidence from a closed case the investigation of the shooting of wilbert dobbs five years earlier by detective francis sheehan it had fresh tape sealing it having just been signed out that morning bosch used a little knife he kept on his key chain to cut the tape and open the box the process of unsealing the box actually took longer than it did for him to find what he was looking for inside it bosch opened his briefcase after getting to his car and looked through all the paperwork until he found the callout sheet hed had put together on saturday morning he called chastains pager and punched in the number of his cell phone he then sat in the car for five minutes waiting for the callback and watching the protest march as he watched several of the television crews broke away from their positions and hurried with their equipment toward their vans and he realized that the helicopters were already gone he sat up straight in his seat his watch said ten minutes to eleven he knew that if the media were leaving all at once and before making their broadcasts then something must have happened something big he flipped on the radio which was already tuned to kfwb and caught the middle of a report being delivered in an urgent quavering voice out of the truck then the beating began several bystanders attempted to stop the attack but initially the angry mob of youths held them back the firefighters were pulled into separate knots of attackers and were being assaulted until a platoon of lapd units stormed the intersection and rescued the victims who were pulled into the patrol cars and then driven away to receive medical attention we assume at nearby daniel freeman hospital the fire engine left behind had been set ablaze after the mob unsuccessfully tried to turn it over the police quickly established a perimeter in the area and calmed things while some of the attackers were arrested several escaped into the residential neighborhoods bordering normandie boul boschs phone began ringing he cut off the radio and flipped the phone open bosch its chastain what do you want bosch could hear lots of voices and radio squawking in the background chastain wasnt at home where are you we have to talk not tonight im on duty twelve and twelves remember where are you in wonderful south la youre a shift i thought all detectives were b shift all except iad we got the shaft night shift listen bosch id love to talk about the schedule but where are you ill come to you bosch turned the cars ignition and started backing out of his spot im at the seventyseventh im on my way meet me out front in fifteen minutes forget it bosch ill be swamped im on arrest processing and i hear theyre bringing in a dozen mooks who just attacked a fire truck for chrissakes these guys were trying to put out a fire in their neighborhood and these animals go after them i tell you its unfucking believable it never is believable be out front in fifteen minutes chastain youre not listening to me bosch things are going to hell out there and big blue is about to put down the boots on it i dont have time to talk i have to get ready to put people in jail you want me to stand out front like a target for some mook with a gun what is this about bosch frank sheehan what about him fifteen minutes be out there chastain or ill come find you you wont want that chastain started another protest but bosch closed the phone chapter it took bosch twentyfive minutes to get to the seventyseventh street division station he was delayed because the freeway had been closed in all directions by the california highway patrol the freeway was a conduit from downtown to the south bay area directly through south la in the last riot snipers had fired on cars passing through and concrete blocks had been dropped from pedestrian overpasses onto cars below the chp was not taking any chances motorists were advised to take the circuitous route of the santa monica freeway to the san diego freeway and then south it would take twice as long but it was safer than a run through the expected war zone bosch took surface streets the whole way almost all of them were deserted and he never stopped once for a traffic light or stop sign it was like driving through a ghost town he knew there were hot spots of looting and arson but he never passed through them he thought about the picture the media was projecting compared to what he was seeing most of the people were inside locked down and waiting for this to pass they were good people waiting out the storm staring at the television and wondering if that was really their city that was being shown on fire the front of the seventyseventh station was also strangely empty when bosch finally pulled up a police academy bus had been pulled across the entranceway as a guard against driveby shots and other attacks but there were no protesters out front and no cops as bosch pulled to the noparking curb in front chastain stepped out from the rear of the bus and approached he was in uniform his weapon holstered on his hip he came to boschs window and bosch lowered it where you been bosch you said fif i know what i said get in no bosch im not going anywhere with you until you tell me what the hell youre doing here im on duty remember i want to talk about sheehan and the ballistics about the wilbert dobbs case he noticed chastain take a slight step back from the car mentioning dobbs had landed a punch bosch noticed the sharpshooter ribbon on chastains uniform below the badge i dont know what youre talking about but the case on sheehan is closed hes dead elias is dead everybodys dead thats it now we have this the whole city coming apart again and whose fault is that chastain stared at him trying to read him youre not making sense bosch you need to get some sleep we all do bosch opened the door and stepped out chastain moved back another step and drew his right hand up a little until he hooked his thumb on his belt near his gun there were unwritten rules of engagement that was one of them bosch was now on deadly ground he understood this he was ready bosch turned and swung his car door closed while chastains eyes involuntarily followed that movement bosch swiftly reached inside his coat and pulled his pistol out of his holster he had it pointing at chastain before the iad detective could make a move all right we do it your way put your hands on the roof of the car what the hell are you put your hands on the car chastains hands went up okay okay easy bosch be easy he moved to the car and put his hands flat on the roof bosch came up behind him and took his gun from its holster he stepped back and put it into his own holster i guess i dont have to check you for a throwdown you already used yours on frankie sheehan right what i have no idea what you are talking about thats okay keeping his right hand pressed against chastains back bosch reached around and took the handcuffs off the mans belt he pulled one of chastains arms behind his back and cuffed his wrist he then pulled the other arm back and completed the handcuffing bosch walked him around and sat him in the backseat of the slickback opposite the drivers side he then got back behind the wheel he took chastains gun out of his holster put it into his briefcase and reholstered his own weapon bosch adjusted the rearview mirror so he could quickly see chastain at a glance and flicked the lock switch which rendered the rear doors inoperable from the inside you stay right there where i can see you at all times fuck you what the hell do you think youre doing where are you taking me bosch put the car in drive and headed away from the police station he headed west until he could turn north on normandie almost five minutes went by before he answered chastains question were going to parker center he said when we get there youre going to tell me about killing howard elias catalina perez and frankie sheehan bosch felt anger and bile back up in his throat he thought about one of the unsaid messages he had received from garwood he wanted street justice and at that moment so did bosch fine well go back chastain said but you dont know what youre talking about you are full of shit the case is closed bosch live with it bosch started reciting the list of constitutional rights against selfincrimination and then asked chastain if he understood them fuck you bosch pressed on glancing up at the mirror every few seconds thats okay youre a cop no judge in the world would say you didnt understand your rights he waited a moment and checked his prisoner in the mirror one last time before going on you were eliass source all these years you were the guy giving him whatever he needed on whatever case he had you wrong sold out the department you are the lowest of the low chastain isnt that what you called it before the lowest of the low that was you man a bottom feeder a scumbag a motherfucker bosch saw police barricades across the street ahead two hundred yards beyond them he saw flashing blue lights and fire he realized they were heading toward the hot spot where the firefighters had been attacked and their truck set ablaze at the blockade he turned right and started looking north at each intersection he passed through he was out of his element here he had never worked an assignment at any of the departments south central divisions and didnt know the geographic territory well he knew he could become lost if he strayed too far from normandie he gave no indication of this when he checked chastain in the mirror again you want to talk to me chastain or play it out there is nothing to talk about you are enjoying your last precious moments with a badge what youre doing here is pure suicide like your buddy sheehan youre killing yourself bosch bosch slammed on the brakes and the car swerved to a stop he drew his weapon and leaned over the seat pointing it at chastains face what did you say chastain looked genuinely scared he clearly believed that bosch was on the edge of losing it nothing bosch nothing just drive lets go to parker and well get this all straightened out bosch slowly dropped back into the drivers seat and started the car moving again after four blocks he turned north again hoping to run parallel to the disturbance spot and cut back onto normandie after they were clear i just came from the basement at parker he said he glanced in the mirror to see if that had changed anything in chastains face it hadnt i pulled the package on wilbert dobbs and i looked at the signout log you pulled the package this morning and you took the bullets you took the bullets from sheehans service nine the bullets he shot dobbs with five years ago and you turned three of them in to ballistics saying they were the bullets from the howard elias autopsy you set him up to take the fall but its your fall chastain he checked the mirror chastains face had changed the news bosch just delivered had hit like the flat side of a shovel in the face bosch moved in for the finish you killed elias he said quietly finding it hard to pull his eyes away from the mirror and back onto the road he was going to put you on that stand and expose you he was going to ask you about the true findings of your investigation because you had told him the true findings only the case was too big he knew how high he could go with it and you became expendable he was going to burn you in order to win the case you lost it i guess or maybe youve always been cold in the blood but on friday night you followed him home and when he was getting on angels flight you made your move you put him down and then you looked up and there was the woman sitting there shit that mustve shocked the hell out of you i mean after all the train car had been sitting there it was supposed to be empty but there was catalina perez on that bench and you had to put one in her too how am i doing chastain i have the story right chastain didnt answer bosch came to an intersection slowed and looked left he could see down to the lighted area that was normandie he saw no barricades and no blue lights he turned left and headed that way you lucked out he continued the dobbs case it fit perfectly you came across sheehans threat in the files and took it from there you had your patsy a little research on the case and a little maneuvering here and there and you got to handle the autopsy that gave you the bullets and all you had to do was switch them of course the coroners id markings on the bullets would be different but that discrepancy would only come up if there was a trial if they took sheehan to trial bosch shut up i dont want to hear anymore i dont i dont care what you want to hear youre going to hear this douche bag this is frankie sheehan talking to you from the grave you understand that you had to put it on sheehan but it wouldnt work if sheehan ever went to a trial because the coroner would testify and hed say wait a sec folks these arent my marks on these bullets theres been a switch so you had no choice you had to put sheehan down too you followed us last night i saw your lights you followed us and then you did frankie sheehan made it look like a drunken suicide lots of beers lots of shots but i know what you did you put one in him then you fired a couple more with his hand wrapped around the gun you made it all fit chastain but its coming apart now bosch felt his anger overtaking him he reached up and slapped the mirror so he wouldnt have to look at chastains face he was coming up to normandie now the intersection was clear i know the story bosch said i know it i just have one question why did you snitch to elias all those years was he paying you or did you just hate cops so much that youd do whatever you could to nail them any way you could again there was no answer from the backseat at the stop sign bosch looked to his left and could see the blue lights and the flames again they had circumnavigated the police perimeter the barricades started a block down and he paused with his foot on the brakes and took in the scene he could see a line of police cruisers behind the barricades there was a small liquor store on the corner with the windows shattered and jagged pieces of glass still hanging in the frames outside its doors the ground was littered with broken bottles and other debris left by the looters you see that down there chastain all of that you bosch did that thats you didnt go far enough all on you picking up on the fear in chastains voice bosch began turning to his right in that instant the windshield shattered as a chunk of concrete crashed through it and hit the seat through the falling glass bosch saw the crowd moving toward the car young men with dark angry faces their individualities lost inside the mob he saw a bottle in midair coming at the car he saw it all so clearly and with seemingly so much time that he could even read the label southern comfort his mind began registering some kind of humor or irony in that the bottle came through the opening and exploded on the steering wheel sending a blast of glass and liquid into boschs face and eyes his hands involuntarily came up off the wheel to cover himself too late his eyes began burning from the alcohol he heard chastain begin screaming from the backseat go go go and then there were two more explosions of glass as other windows in the car were shattered by missiles of some sort there was a pounding on the window next to him and the car began to rock violently right to left he heard someone yanking on the door handle and more glass being shattered all around him he heard shouts from outside the car the angry unintelligible sounds of the mob and he heard shouts from the backseat from chastain hands grabbed at him through the broken windows pulling at his hair and clothes bosch slammed his foot down on the gas pedal and yanked the wheel to the left as the car jerked forward fighting against the involuntary instincts of his eyes to stay closed he managed to open them enough to allow a small slice of blurred and painful vision the car jumped into the deserted lanes of normandie and he headed toward the barricades he knew there was safety at the barricades he kept his hand on the horn all the way and when he got to the barricades he crashed through and only then did he hit the brakes the car slid into a tailspin and stopped bosch closed his eyes and didnt move he heard footsteps and shouts but he knew they were cops coming for him this time he was safe he reached forward and put the car into park he opened his door and quickly there were hands there to help him out and the comforting voices of the blue race are you okay man you need paramedics my eyes okay hold still well get somebody here just lean here against the car bosch listened as one of the officers barked orders into a rover announcing he had an injured officer needing medical attention he demanded that attention right now bosch had never felt safer than at that moment he wanted to thank every one of his rescuers he felt serene and yet giddy for some reason like the times he had emerged unscathed from the tunnels in vietnam he brought his hands up to his face again and was trying to open one of his eyes he could feel blood running down the bridge of his nose he knew he was alive better leave that alone man it doesnt look too good one voice said what were you doing out there alone demanded another bosch got his left eye open and saw a young black patrolman standing in front of him a white officer was standing to the right i wasnt he ducked and looked into the backseat of the car it was empty he checked the front and it was empty too chastain was gone boschs briefcase was gone he straightened up and looked back down the street at the mob he reached up and cleared the blood and booze from his eyes so that he could see better there were fifteen or twenty men down there all gathered in a tight group all looking inward at what was at the center of their undulating mass bosch could see sharp violent movements legs kicking fists raised high and then brought down out of sight and into the center jesus christ the patrolman next to him yelled is that one of us they got one of us he didnt wait for boschs reply he brought the rover back up and quickly called for all available units for an officerneedsassistance call his voice was frantic infected with the horror of what he was seeing a block away the two officers then ran to their patrol cars and the vehicles stormed down the street toward the crowd bosch just watched and soon the mob changed its form the object of its attention was no longer on the ground but was rising being brought up soon bosch could see chastains body raised above their heads and held aloft like a trophy being passed by the hands of the victors his shirt was now badgeless and torn open his arms were still bound by the handcuffs one shoe and the accompanying sock were gone and the ivorywhite foot stood out like the white bone of a compound fracture through the skin it was hard to tell from where he stood but bosch thought chastains eyes were open he could see that his mouth was wide open bosch heard the start of a sharp shrieking sound that at first he thought might be the siren of one of the patrol cars racing to the rescue then he realized it was chastain screaming just before he dropped back into the center of the mob and out of sight chapter bosch watched from the barricades as a platoon of patrol officers flooded the intersection and attempted to chase down members of the mob the body of john chastain remained sprawled in the street like a sack of laundry that had fallen off a truck they had checked him and left the body alone once it was determined that the rescue was too late soon the media helicopters were overhead and paramedics came and tended to bosch he had lacerations on the bridge of his nose and left eyebrow that needed cleaning and stitches but he refused to go to the hospital they removed the glass and closed the wounds with butterfly bandages then they left him alone bosch spent the next period of time he wasnt sure how long wandering behind the barricades until a patrol lieutenant finally came to him and said he would have to return to seventyseventh street division to be interviewed later by the detectives coming in to handle the investigation the lieutenant said he would have two officers drive him bosch numbly nodded and the lieutenant started issuing orders for a car into his rover bosch noticed the looted store across the street and behind the lieutenant the green neon sign said fortune liquors bosch said he would be ready in a minute he stepped away from the lieutenant and walked across the street and into the store the store was long and narrow and prior to that night had had three aisles of merchandise but the shelves had been cleared and overturned by the looters who had stormed through the debris on the floor was a foot high in most places and the smell of spilled beer and wine was heavy in the place bosch carefully stepped to the counter which had nothing on it but the plastic rings of a liberated sixpack he leaned over to look behind the counter and almost let out a scream when he saw the small asian man sitting on the floor his knees folded up to his chest and his arms folded across them they looked at each other for a long moment the entire side of the mans face was swelling up and coloring bosch guessed it had been a bottle that had hit him he nodded at the man but there was no response you okay the man nodded but didnt look at bosch you want the paramedics the man shook his head no they take all the cigarettes the man did not respond bosch leaned further over and looked under the counter he saw the cash register the drawer open lying on its side on the floor there were brown bags and matchbooks scattered all over the place empty cigarette cartons too placing his body on the counter he was able to reach down and weed through the debris on the floor but his hunt for a smoke was fruitless here bosch raised his eyes to the man sitting on the floor he was pulling a softpack of camels out of his pocket he shook the pack and held it out the last soldier in it protruding nah man its your last one thats okay no you have bosch hesitated you sure please bosch took the cigarette and nodded he reached down to the floor and picked up a pack of matches thank you he nodded again to the man and left the store outside bosch put the cigarette in his mouth and sucked air through it tasting it savoring it he opened the matches and lit the cigarette and drew the smoke fully into his lungs and held it there fuck it he said he exhaled deeply and watched the smoke disappear he closed the matchbook and looked at it one side said fortune liquors and the other said fortune matches he thumbed open the cover again and read the fortune printed on the inside above the red match heads happy is the man who finds refuge in himself bosch closed the matchbook and put it in his pocket he felt something in there and pulled it out it was the small bag of rice from his wedding he threw it up into the air a couple of feet and then caught it he squeezed it tightly in his fist and then put it back into his pocket he looked out across the barricades to the intersection where chastains body was now covered with a yellow rain poncho from the trunk of one of the patrol cars a perimeter had been set up within the larger perimeter and an investigation of the death was just beginning bosch thought about chastain and the terror he must have felt at the end when the hands of hate reached in and grabbed him he understood that terror but felt no sympathy those hands had begun reaching for him long ago a helicopter came down out of the dark sky and landed on normandie doors opened on either side of the craft and deputy chief irvin irving and captain john garwood climbed out ready to take control and direct the investigation they walked briskly toward the clot of officers near the body the air wash from the helicopter had blown a flap of the poncho off the body bosch could see chastains face staring up at the sky an officer stepped over and covered him again irving and garwood were at least fifty yards away from bosch but they seemed to know of boschs presence and at the same time they both looked toward him he looked back and didnt flinch in his stare garwood still in his perfect suit gestured toward bosch with a hand holding a cigarette there was a knowing smile on his face irving finally looked away and focused his attention on the yellow poncho he was walking toward bosch knew the score the fixer was on the job now he knew how it would be handled and what the official story would be chastain would become a department martyr pulled out of a patrol car by the mob bound with his own handcuffs and beaten to death his murder the justification for whatever else happened at the hands of the police this night in an unspoken way he would become the trade chastain for elias his death broadcast from the mechanical vultures above would be used to end the riot before it started but no one would know outside of a few that it had been chastain who also started it bosch knew he would be coopted irving could get to him because he held the only thing that bosch had left that he still cared about his job he knew irving would trade that for his silence and he knew he would take the deal chapter boschs thoughts kept returning to that moment in the car when he had been blinded and he felt the hands reaching and grabbing for him through the terror a lucid calmness had come over him and he now found himself almost cherishing the moment for he had been strangely at peace in that moment he had found an essential truth he knew somehow that he would be spared that the righteous man was beyond the grasp of the fallen he thought about chastain and his final scream a wail so loud and horrible as to be almost inhuman it was the sound of fallen angels in their flight to hell bosch knew he could never allow himself to forget it
