the sharing knife volume two legacy lois mcmaster bujold maps d ag had been married for a whole two hours and was still lightheaded with wonder the weighted ends of the wedding cord coiling around his upper arm danced in time with the lazy trot of his horse riding by his side fawnmy new bride now there was a phrase to set a mans mind meltingmet his smile with happy eyes my farmer bride it should have been impossible there would be trouble about that later trouble yesterday trouble tomorrow but no trouble now now in the light of the loveliest summer afternoon he ever did see was only a boundless contentment once the first half dozen miles were behind them dag found both his and fawns urgency to be gone from the wedding party easing they passed through the last village on the northern river road after which the wagon way became more of a tworut track and the remaining farms grew farther apart with more woods between them he let a few more miles pass till he was sure they were out of range of any potential retribution or practical jokers then began keeping an eye out for a spot to make camp if a lakewalker patroller with this much woods to choose from couldnt hide from farmers something was wrong secluded he decided was a better watchword still at length he led fawn down to the river at a rocky ford then upstream for a time till they came to where a clear creek gurgling down from the eastern ridge joined the flow he turned copperhead up it for a good quarter mile till he found a pretty glade all mossy by the stream and surrounded by tall trees and plenty of them and his groundsense guaranteed no other person for a mile in any direction of necessity he had to let fawn unsaddle the horses and set up the site it was a simple enough task merely laying out their bedrolls and making just enough of a fire to boil water for tea still she cast an observant eye at him as he lay with his back against a broad beech bole and plucked irritably at the sling supporting his right arm with the hook replacing his left hand you have a job she told him encouragingly youre on guard against the mosquitoes ticks chiggers and blackflies and squirrels he added hopefully well get to them food did not have to be caught or skinned or cooked just unwrapped and eaten till they couldnt hold any more although fawn tried his limits dag wondered if this new mania for feeding him was a bluefield custom no one had mentioned or just a lingering effect of the excitement of the day as she tried to find her way into her farmwifely tasks without actually a farm in which to set them but when he compared this to many a cold wet hungry lonely exhausted night on some of the more dire patrols in his memory he thought perhaps hed wandered by strange accident into some paradise out of a song and bears would come out tonight to dance around their fire in celebration he looked up to find fawn inching nearer without for a change provender in her hands its not dark yet she sighed he cast her a slow blink to tease and dark is needed for what bedtime well i admit its a help for sleeping are you that sleepy its been a tiring day we could just roll over and she caught on and poked him in reproof ha are you sleepy no chance despite the sling he managed a pounce that drew her into his lap the prey did not precisely struggle though it did wriggle enchantingly once she was within kissing range they found occupation for a little but then she grew grave and sat up to touch the cord wrapping her left wrist how odd that this all should feel harder now he kissed her hair beneath his chin theres a weight of expectation that wasnt there before i suppose i didnt he hesitated hm i rode into west blue onto your familys farm last week thinkingi dont know that i would be a clever lakewalker persuader and get my way i expected to change their lives i didnt expect them to change my life right back i didnt used to be fawns patroller still less fawns husband but now i am thats a ground transformation in case you didnt realize it doesnt just happen in the cords it happens in our deep selves he gave a nod toward his left sleeve hiding the loop binding his own arm maybe the hard feeling is just shyness for the two new people weve become hm she settled down briefly reassured but then sat up again biting her lip the way she did when about to tackle some difficult subject usually headon dag about my ground i love your ground her lips twitched in a smile but then returned to seriousness its been over four weeks sincesince the malice im healing up pretty good inside i think i think so too do you suppose we couldi mean tonight becausewe havent ever yetnot that im complaining mind you erm that pattern in their ground you said women get when they can have babies do i have it tonight not yet i dont think itll be much longer till your bodys back to its usual phases though so we could i mean do it in the usual way tonight tonight spark we can do it any way you want within the range of the physically possible that is he added prudently she snickered i do wonder how you learned all those tricks well not all at once absent gods forfend you pick up this and that over the years i suspect people everywhere keep reinventing all the basics theres only so much you can do with a body successfully and comfortably that is leaving aside stunts stunts she said curiously were leaving them aside he said definitely one broken arm is enough one too many i think her brows drew down in new worry um i was envisioning you up on your elbows but really i think maybe not it doesnt exactly sound comfortable and i wouldnt want you to hurt your arm and have to start healing all over and besides if you slipped you really would squash me like a bug it took him a moment to puzzle out her concern ah not a problem we just switch sides top to bottom if you can ride a horse which i note you do quite well you can ride me and you can squash me all you want she thought this through im not sure i can do this right if you do something really wrong i promise ill scream in pain and let you know she grinned if with a slight tinge of dismay kissing blended into undressing and again to his mixed regret and entertainment fawn had to do most of the work he thought she was much too brisk and businesslike in getting her own clothes off although the view when she finished was splendid the setting sun reached fingers of golden light into the glade that caressed her body as she flickered in and out of the leaf shadows she might well have been one of those legendary female spirits who were supposed to step out of trees and beguile the unwary traveler the way her sweet breasts moved not quite in time with the rest of her was fair riveting to his eye too she folded up his astonishing wedding shirt with fully the care he would have wished tucking it away he lay back on his bedroll and let her pull off his trousers and drawers with all her considerable determination she folded them up too and came and sat no plunked again beside him the afterwobble was delightful arm harness on or off hm off i think dont want to risk jabbing you in a distracted moment the disquieting memory of her bleeding fingers weaving her wedding cord flitted through his mind and he became conscious again of it wound around his upper arm and the tiny hum of its live ground her live ground with practiced hands she whisked the hook harness away onto the top of the clothes pile and he marveled anew at how easy it was all becoming with her except for blight it all again having no working hand the sling had gone west just before the shirt and he shifted his right arm and attempted to wriggle his fingers ouch no not enough useful motion there yet inside his splints and wrappings his skin damp from the sweat of the warm day was itching he couldnt touch all right there was a certain amount he could do with his tongueespecially right now as she returned and nuzzled up to himbut getting it to the right place at the right time was going to be an insurmountable challenge in this position she withdrew her lips from his and began working her way down his body it was lovely but almost redundant it had been well over a week after all andit used to be years and i scarcely blinked he tried to relax and let himself be made love to relaxation wasnt exactly what was happening his hips twitched as fawns full attention arrived at his nether regions she swung her leg over turned to face him reached down and began to try to position herself stopped urk he inquired politely some such noise anyway her face was a little pinched this should be working better oil he croaked i shouldnt need oil for this should i not if i had a hand to ready you nicely hang should do what works you shouldnt have that uncomfortable look on your face either hm she extracted herself padded over to his saddlebags and rummaged within good view from the back too as she bent overa mutter of mild triumph ah she padded back pausing to frown and rub the sole of one bare foot on her other shin after stepping on a pebble was this a time to stop for pebbles back she came sliding over him small hands slicked him which made him jolt he did not allow himself to plunge upward let her find her way in her own time she attempted to do so she was getting a very determined look again maidenheads dont regrow do they shouldnt think so i didnt think it was supposed to hurt the second time probably just unaccustomed muscles not in condition need more exercise it was driving him just short of mad to have no hands to grasp her hips and guide her home she blinked taking in this thought is that true or more of your slick patroller persuasion cant it be both she grinned shifted her angle then looked brighter and said ah there we go indeed we do he gasped as she slid slowly and very very tightly down upon him yesthatsverynice she muttered they get whole babies through these parts surely its supposed to stretch more time give it blight it at this point in the usual proceedings she would be the one who couldnt form words anymore they were out of rhythm tonight he was losing his wits and she was getting chatty fine now her brows drew down in puzzlement should this be like taking turns or not uhthink he swallowed to find speech hope its good for you suspect its better for me s exquisite for me right now oh thats all right then she sat for a moment adjusting it would likely not be a good idea at this point to screech and convulse and beg for motion that would just alarm her he didnt want her alarmed she might jump up and run off which would be tragic he wanted her relaxed and confident andthere she was starting to smile again she observed you have a funny look on your face ill bet her smile widened too gently and tentatively she at last began to move absent gods be praised after all she said continuing a line of thought of which he had long lost track mama had twins and she isnt that much taller than me though aunt nattie said she was pretty alarmin toward the end what said dag confused twins run in mamas side of the family which made it really unfair of her to blame papa aunt nattie said but i guess she wasnt too reasonable by then which remark of course immediately made his reeling mind jump to the previously unimagined idea of spark bearing twins his which made his eyes cross further he really hadnt even wrapped his mind around the notion of their having one child yet considering just what youre doing right now perhaps you should old patroller whatever this peculiar digression did to himhis spine felt like an overdrawn bow with its string about to snapit seemed to relax fawn her eyes darkening she commenced to rock with more assurance her ground blocked earlier by the discomfort and uncertainty began to flow again finally but he wasnt going to last much longer at this rate he let his hips start to keep time with hers if i only had a working hand to get down there we would share this turn his fingers twitched in frustration another good reason to leave it be to heal faster she gasped put that poor busted arm back on the blanket ngh he wanted to touch her so much groundwork a mosquitos worth was not likely to be enough lefthanded groundwork he remembered the glass bowl sliding and swirling back together that had been no mere mosquito would she find it perverse frightening horrifying to be touched so could he even this was her wedding night she must not recall it with disappointment he laid his left arm down across his belly pointed at their juncture consider it a strengthening exercise for the ghost hand beats scraping hides all hollow doesnt it justthere oh her eyes shot wide and she leaned forward to stare into his face what did you just do experiment he gritted out surely his eyes were as wide and wild as hers think the broken right has been doing something to stir up my left ground like not like not sure more oh yeah oh yeah thats good her only reply was a wordless huff and a rocking that grew frantic then froze which was fine because now he did drive up as that bowstring snapped at last and everything unwound in white fire he didnt think hed passed out but he seemed to come to with her draped across his chest wheezing and laughing wildly dag that was that wascould you do that all along were you just saving it for a wedding present or what i have no idea he confessed never done anything like that before im not even sure what i did do well it was quitequite nice she sat up and pushed back her hair to deliver this in a judicious tone but then dissolved into helpless laughter again im dizzy feel like im about to fall down you are lying down very fortunate she tumbled down into the cradle of his left arm and snuggled in for a wordless time dag didnt quite nap but he wouldnt have called it being awake either bludgeoned perhaps eventually she roused herself enough to get them cleaned up and dressed in clothes to sleep in because the blue twilight shadows were cooling as night slid in seeping through the woods from the east by the time she cuddled down again beside him under the blanket this time he was fully awake staring up through the leaves at the first stars her slim little fingers traced the furrows above his brows are you all right im all right he managed a smile and kissed the fingers in passing i admit ive unsettled myself a bit you know how shaken i was after that episode with the glass bowl oh you havent made yourself sick again with this have you no in fact although this wasnt near such a draining effort pretty um stimulating actually thing isthat night i mended the bowl that was the first time i experienced that that call it a ghost hand i tried several times after secretly to make it emerge again but nothing happened couldnt figure it out in the parlor you were upset i was upset i wanted to i dont know fix things i wasnt upset just now but i sure was in um a heightened mood flying your aunt nattie called it except now ive fallen back down and the ghost hands gone again he glanced over to find her up on one elbow looking at him with the same interested expression as ever happy eyes not shocked or scared or repelled he said you dont mind that its well strange you think this is just the same as all the other things i do dont you her brows rose in consideration well you summon horses and bounce mosquitoes and make firefly lamps and kill malices and you know where everyone is for a country mile all around and i dont know what you did to reed and rush last night but the effect was sure magical today and what you do for me i cant hardly begin to describe not decently anyhow how do you know it isnt he opened his mouth then closed it squinting at his question turned upside down she cocked her head and continued you said lakewalker folks groundsense doesnt come in all at once and not at all when theyre younger maybe this is just something you should have had all along that got delayed or maybe its something you should have now growing right on time theres a new thought he lay back frowning at the blameless evening sky his life was full of new things lately some of them were new problems but he had to admit a lot of the tired dreary old problems had been thoroughly shaken out he began to suspect that it wasnt only the breaking of his right arm that was triggering this bizarre development the farmer girl was plowing his ground it seemed what was that phrase breaking new land a very literal form of ground transformation he blinked to chase away these twisting notions before his head started to ache so thats twice said fawn pursuing the thought so it can happen um more than once anyhow and it seems you dont have to be unhappy for it to work thats real promising im not sure i can do it again thatd be a shame she said in a meditative tone but her eyes were merry so try it again next time and well see eh and if not as it seems you have no end of ingenuity in a bedroll well just do something else and thatll be good too she gave a short decisive nod well he said in a bemused voice thats settled she flopped down again nestling in close hugging him tight youd best believe it to fawns gladness they lingered late in the glade the next morning attempting to repeat some of last nights trials some were successful some not dag couldnt seem to induce his ghost hand againmaybe he was too relaxed which appeared to leave him someplace between disappointment and relief as fawn had guessed he found other ways to please her although she thought he was trying a bit too hard which made her worry for him which didnt help her relax she fed him a right fine breakfast though and they mounted up and found their way back to the river road by noon in the late afternoon they at last left the valley dag taking an unmarked track off to the west they passed through a wide stretch of wooded country sometimes in single file on twisty trails sometimes side by side on broader tracks fawn was soon lostwell if she struck east shed be sure to find the river again sometime so she supposed she was only out of her reckoning for going forward not backbut dag seemed not to be for two days they pushed through similar woodland pushed might be too strong a term with their early stops and late starts twice dag persuaded his ghost hand to return to her startled delight twice he didnt for no obvious reason either way which plainly puzzled him deeply she wondered at his spooky choice of name for this ground ability he worried over it equally afterwards whether or not he succeeded and fawn finally decided that it had been so long since he hadnt known exactly what he was doing all the time hed forgotten what it felt like to be blundering around in the dark which made her sniff with a certain lack of sympathy she gradually became aware that he was dragging his feet on this journey despite his worries about beating his patrol back to hickory lake and not only for the obvious reason of extending their bedroll time together fawn herself was growing intensely curious about what lay ahead and inclined to move along more briskly but it wasnt till the third morning that they did so and that only because of a threatened change in the weather the high wispy clouds that both farmers and lakewalkers called horsefeathers had moved in from the west last night making fabulous pink streaks in the sunset indigo and the air today was close and hazy both signs of a broad storm brewing when it blew through it would bring a sparkling day in its wake but was like to be violent before then dag said they might beat it to the lake by late afternoon around noon the woods opened out in some flat meadowlands bordering a creek with a dual track and fawn found herself riding alongside dag again you once said youd tell me the tale of utau and razi if you were either more drunk or more sober you look pretty sober now he smiled briefly do i well then whenever i can get you to talk about your people it helps me form up some better idea what im heading into im not sure utaus tale will help much that way maybe not but at least i wont say something stupid through not knowing any better he shrugged though he amended unknowing maybe never stupid either way id still end up redfaced you blush prettily but i give you the point well utau was stringbound for a good ten years to sarri otter but they had no children it happens that way sometimes and even lakewalker groundsense cant tell why both his family and hers were pressuring them to cut their strings and try again with different mates wait what people can cut their marriage strings what does that mean and how does it work fawn wrapped a protective right hand around her left wrist then put her palm hastily back on her thigh kicking graces plump sides to encourage her to step along and keep up with copperheads longer legs what leads up to a stringcutting varies pretty wildly with the couple but lack of children after a good long time trying is considered a reason to part without dishonor to either side more difficult if only one partner assents to the cutting then the argument can spread out to both their families tents and get very divisive or tedious if you have to listen to them all go on but if both partners agree to it the ceremony is much like stringbinding in reverse the wedding cords are taken off and rewrapped around both partners arms only with the opposite twist and knotted but then the stringblesser takes a knife and cuts the knot apart and each takes back the pieces of their own fawn wondered if that knife was carved of bone the grounds drain out back to their sources and well its done people usually burn the dead strings after he glanced aside at her deepening frown dont farmer marriages ever come apart i think sometimes but not often the land and the families hold them together and theres considered to be a shame in the failure people do up and leave sometimes men or women but its more like chewing off your leg to escape a trap you have to leave so much behind so much work so much hope too i suppose she added though i heard tell of one marriage down south of the village that came apart again in two weeks the bride and all her things just got carted right back to her family being hardly settled in yet and the entry was scratched out in the family book nobody would ever explain to me why although the twins and fletch were snickering over it so i suppose it might have had to do with bed problems though she wasnt pregnant by someone else or anything it was all undone right quick with no argument though so someone must have had something pretty big to apologize for id guess sounds like his brows rose as he considered this in curiosity possibly of the more idle sort anyway utau and sarri loved each other despite their sorrow and didnt want to part and they were both good friends with utaus cousin razi im not just sure who persuaded who to what but one day razi up and moved all his things into sarris tent with the pair of them and a few months later sarri was pregnant and to top the matter not only did razi get stringbound with sarri razi and utau got stringbound with each other so the circle went all the way around and each ended up wearing the strings of both the others all otters now and everyones families went around for a while looking like their heads ached but then there came this beautiful girl baby and a while after this bright little boy that all three just dote on and everyone else pretty much gave up the worrying although not the lewd speculation naturally fawn laughed naturally her mind started to drift off in a little lewd speculating of its own abruptly jerked back to attention when dag continued in his thoughtfulvoice ive never made a child myself i was always very careful if not always for the same reasons theres not a few who have trouble when they switch over from trying to miss that target to trying to hit it all their prior care seeming a great waste of a sudden the sort of useless thing you wonder about late at night had dag been doing so staring up at the stars fawn said youd think with that pattern showing in womens grounds it would be easier rather than harder to get a baby just when you wanted she was still appalled at how easy it had been for her so you would yet so often people miss and no one knows why kauneo and i his voice jerked to a halt in that nowfamiliar way she held her peace and her breath heres one i never told anyone ever you need not she said quietly some people are in favor of spitting out hurts but poking at them too much doesnt let them heal either this ones ridden in my memory for a long long time maybe it would look a different size if i got it outside my head rather than in it for once then im listenin was he about to uncork another horrortale indeed he stared ahead between copperheads ears wed been stringbound upwards of a year and i felt i was getting astride my duties as a company captain and we decided it was time to start a child this was in the months just before the wolf war broke we tried two months running and missed third month i was away on my duties at the vital time for the life of me i cant now remember what seemed so important about them i cant even remember what they were riding out and checking on something or other and in the fourth month the wolf war was starting up and we were both caught up in the rush he drew a long long breath but if i could have made kauneo pregnant by then she would have stayed in camp and not led out her patrol to wolf ridge and whatever else had happened she and the child would both have lived if not for that lost month fawns heart felt hot and strange as if his old wound were being shared through the very ground of his words not a good secret to lug around that one she tried the obvious patch you cant know that i know i cant i dont think theres a second thought i can have about this that i havent worn out by now maybe kauneos leadership down at the anchor end of the line was what held the ridge that extra time after i went down maybea patroller friend of mine his first wife died in childbed i know he harbors regrets just as ferocious for the exact opposite cause there is no knowing you just have to grow used to the not knowing i guess he fell quiet for a time and fawn daunted said nothing though maybe the listening had been all hed needed she wondered suddenly if dag was doubting whether he could sire children fiftyfive years was a long time to go without doing so for a man although she had the impression that it wasnt that hed been with so many women before or after kauneo as that hed paid really good attention when he had in the light of her own history if no child appeared when finally wanted it would seem clear who was responsible did he fear to disappoint but his mind had turned down another path now apparently for he said my immediate familys not so large as yours just my mother my brother and his wife at present all my brothers children are out of the tent on patrol or apprenticed to makers one sons stringbound so far dags nephews and nieces were just about the same age range as fawn and her brothers from his descriptions she nodded he went on i hope to slip into camp quietly im of two minds whether to report to fairbolt or my family first its likely rumors have trickled back about the glassforge malice kill ahead of maris return in which case fairbolt will want the news in full and i have to tell him about the knife but id like to introduce you to my brother and mother in my own way before they hear anything from anyone else well which one would be less offended to be put second asked fawn hard to say he smiled dryly mama can hold a grudge longer but fairbolt has a keen memory for lapses as well i should not like to begin by offending my new mamainlaw spark im afraid some people are going to be offended no matter what you and i do what weve doneisnt done though it was done in all honor well she said trying for optimism some people are like that among farmers too no pleasing them you just try or at least try not to be the first to break she considered the problem makes sense to put the worst one first then if you have to you can get away by saying you need to go off and see the second he laughed good thinking perhaps i will but he didnt say which he believed was which they rode on through the afternoon without stopping fawn thought she could tell when they were nearing the lake by a certain lightness growing in the sky and a certain darkness growing in dag at any rate he got quieter and quieter though his gaze ahead seemed to sharpen finally his head came up and he murmured the bridge guard and i just bumped grounds only another mile they came off the lesser track theyd been following onto a wider road which ran in a sweeping curve the land here was very flat the woods mixed beech and oak and hickory gave way to another broad meadow on the far side someone lying on the back of what looked to be a grazing cart horse his legs dangling down over the horses barrel sat up and waved he kicked the horse into a canter and approached the horse wore neither saddle nor bridle and the young man aboard it was scarcely more dressed he wore boots some rather damplooking linen drawers a leather belt with a scabbard for a knife and his sundarkened skin as he approached he yanked the grass stem hed been chewing from his mouth and threw it aside dag youre alive he pulled up his horse and stared at the sling and at fawn trailing shyly behind arent you a sight now nobody said anything about a broken bone your right arm too absent gods how have you been managing anything at all dag returned an uninformative nod of greeting although he smiled faintly ive had a little help is that your farmer girl the guard stared at fawn as though farmer girls were a novelty out of song like dancing bears mari redwing thought youd been gelded by a mob of furious farmers fairbolts fuming your mama thinks youre dead and blames mari and your brothers complaining he cant work in the din ah said dag in a hollow voice maris patrol get back early did it yesterday afternoon lots of time for everyone to get home and gossip i see youre the talk of the lake again the guard squinted and urged his horse closer which made copperhead squeal in warning or at least in ill manners the man was trying to get a clear look at fawns left wrist she realized all day people have been giving me urgent messages to pass on the instant i saw you fairbolt mari your mamadespite the fact she insists youre dead mindand your brother all want to see you first thing he grinned delivering this impossible demand dag came very close fawn thought to just laying his head down on his horses mane and not moving welcome home dag he muttered but he straightened up instead and kicked copperhead around head to tail beside grace he leaned over leftward to fawn and said roll up my sleeve spark looks like its going to be a hot afternoon t he bridge the young man guarded was crudely cut timber long and low wide enough for two horses to cross abreast fawn craned her neck eagerly as she and dag passed over the murky water beneath was obscured with lily pads and drifting pond weed farther along a few greenheaded ducks paddled desultorily in and out of the cattails bordering the banks is this a river or an arm of the lake a bit of both said dag one of the tributary creeks comes in just up the way but the water widens out around both curves welcome to two bridge island are there two bridges really three but the third goes to mare island the other bridge to the mainland is on the western end about two miles thataway this is the narrowest separation like a moat in summer very like a moat all of the island chain backing up behind could be defended right here if it wanted defending after the hard freeze this is more like an ice causeway but the most of us will be gone to winter camp at bearsford by then which while it does have a ford is mostly lacking in bears camps set on some low hills as much as we have hills in these parts people who havent walked out of this hinterland think theyre hills were you born here or there here very late in the season we should have been gone to winter camp but my arrival made delays the first of my many offenses his smile at this was faint flat land and thin woods gave little to view at first as the road wound inward although around a curve copperhead snorted and pretended to shy as a flock of a dozen or so wild turkeys crossed in front of them the turkeys returned apparent disdain and wandered away into the undergrowth around the next curve dag twitched his horse aside into the verge and fawn paused with him as a caravan passed a grayheaded man rode ahead following him on no lead were a dozen horses loaded with heavy basket panniers piled high with dark round lumpy objects covered in turn with crude rope nets to keep the loads from tumbling out a boy brought up the rear fawn stared i dont suppose thats a load of severed heads going somewhere but it sure looks like it at a distance no wonder folks think youre cannibals dag laughed turning to look after the retreating string you know youre right that my love is a load of plunkins on their way to winter store this is their season in late summer it is every lakewalkers duty to eat up his or her share of fresh plunkins you are going to learn all about plunkins from his tone fawn wasnt sure if that was a threat or a promise but she liked the wry grin that went alongwith i hope to learn all about everything he gave her a warmly encouraging nod and led off once more fawn wondered when she was going to at last see tents and especially dags tent a shimmering light through the screen of trees mostly hickory marked the shoreline to the right fawn stood up in her stirrups trying for a glimpse of the water she said in surprise cabins tents dag corrected cabins with awnings she gazed avidly as the road swung nearer half a dozen log buildings in a cluster hugged the shore most seemed to have single central fireplaces probably doublesided judging from the fieldstone chimneys she saw jutting from the roof ridgelines windows were few and doors nonexistent for most of the log houses were open on one side sheltered by deerhide canopies raised on poles seeming almost like long porches she glimpsed a few shadowy people moving within and crossing the yard a lakewalker woman wearing a skirt and shepherding a toddler so did only patrolling women wear trousers if its missing one full side its still a tent not a permanent structure and therefore does not have to be burned down every ten years dag sounded as if he was reciting fawns nose wrinkled in bafflement what you could call it a religious belief although usually its more of a religious argument in theory lakewalkers are not supposed to build permanent structures towns are targets so are farms for that matter so is anything so big and heavy or that youve invested so much in you cant drop it and run if you have to farmers would defend to the death lakewalkers would retreat and regroup if we all lived in theory instead of on two bridge island that is the only buildings that seem to get burned in the tenyear rededication these days are ones the termites have got to certain stodgy parties predict dire retribution for our lapses in my experience retribution turns up all on its own regardless so i dont worry about it much fawn shook her head i may have more to learn than i thought they passed a couple more such clusters of near buildings each seemed to have a dock leading out into the water or perhaps that was a raft tied to the shore one had a strange boat tied to it in turn long and narrow smoke rose from chimneys and fawn could see homely washing strung on lines to dry kitchen gardens occupied sunny patches and small groves of fruit trees bordered the clearings with a few beehives set amongst them how many lakewalkers are there on this island here about three thousand in high summer there are two more island chains around the lake too separated to connect to us by bridge with maybe another four thousand folks total if we want to visit we can either paddle across two miles or ride around for twenty probably another thousand or so still back maintaining bearsford same as about a thousand folks stay here all winter hickory lake camp is one of the largest in oleana with the biggest territory to patrol as a penalty for our success we still send out twice as many exchange patrollers as we ever get in return a hint of pride tinged his voice even though his last remarks ought to have sounded more complaint than brag he nodded ahead toward something fawn did not yet see and at a jingle of harness and thud of many hooves gestured her into the weeds to make way turning copperhead alongside it was a patrol trotting in double file very much as fawn had first seen mari and dags troop ride into the wellhouse farm what was beginning to seem a lifetime ago this bunch looked fresh and rested and unusually tidy however so she guessed they were outward bound on their way to whatever patch of hinterland they were assigned to search for their nightmare prey most of them seemed to recognize dag and cried surprised greetings with his reins wrapped around his hook and his other arm in a sling he could not return their waves but he did nod and smile they didnt pause but not a few of them turned in their saddles to stare back at the pair baries lot said dag looking after them twentytwo hed counted them is that good or bad twentytwo not too bad for this time of year its a busy season he chirped to copperhead and they took to the road once more fawn wondered anew what the shape of her life was going to be tucked in around dags on a farm a couple might work together or apart long hours and hard but they would still meet for meals three times a day and sleep together every night dag would not presumably take her patrolling therefore she must stay here in long scary separations punctuated by brief reunions at least till dag grew too old to patrol or too injured or didnt come back one day but her mind shied from thinking too hard about that one if she was to be left here with these people and no dag shed best try to fit in hardworking hands were needed everywhere all the time surely hers could win her a place dag pulled up copperhead and hesitated at a fork in the road the rightward eastern branch followed the shoreline and fawn eyed it with interest she could hear voices echoing over the water farther along it a few cheery shouts and calls and some singing too distant to make out the words dag straightened his shoulders grimaced and led left instead half a mile on the woods thinned again and the distinctive silvery light reflecting from the water glimmered between the shaggy boles the road ended at another that ran along the northern shore unless it was just rejoining the same one circling the perimeter of the island dag led left again a brief ride brought them to a broad cleared section with several long log buildings many of which had walls all the way around with wooden porches and lots of rails for tying horses no kitchen gardens or washing although a few fruit trees were dotted here and there broad apple and tall graceful pear on the woodland side of the road was an actual barn if built rather low the first fawn had seen here and a couple of splitrail paddocks for horses though only a few horses idled in them at the moment a trio of small lean black pigs rooted among the trees for fallen fruit or nuts on the lakeside a larger dock jutted out into the water dag edged copperhead up to one of the hitching rails outside a log building dropped his reins and stretched his back he cast fawn an afterthought of a smile well here we are fawn thought this a bit too closemouthed even for dag in a mood this isnt your house is it ah no patroller headquarters so were seeing fairbolt crow first if hes in if im lucky he will have gone off somewhere dag dismounted and fawn followed tying both horses to the rail she trailed him up onto the porch and through a plank door they entered a long room lined with shelves stuffed with piles of papers rolled parchments and thick books and fawn was reminded at once of shep sowers crammed house at a table at one end a woman with her hair in irongray braids but wearing a skirt sat writing in a large ledger book she was quite as tall as mari but more heavily built almost stout she was looking up and setting aside her quill even as their steps sounded her face lit with pleasure wooee look what just dragged in dag gave her a wry nod how de massape is umfairbolt here oh aye is he busy dag asked in a most unpressing tone hes in there talking with mari about you i expect judging from the yelps fairbolts been telling her not to panic she says she prefers to start panicking as soon as youre out of her sight just to get beforehand on things looks like theyre both in the right what in the world have you done to yourself this time she nodded at his sling then sat up her eyes narrowing as they fell on the braid circling his left arm she said again in an entirely altered tone dag what in the wide green world have you done fawn awash in this conversation gave dag a poke and a look of desperate inquiry ah he said fawn meet massape crow who is captain to third companybaries patrol that we passed going out is in her charge among others shes also fairbolts wife massape this is missus fawn bluefield my wife his chin did not so much rise in challenge as set in stubbornness fawn smiled brightly clutched her hands together making sure her left wrist showed and gave a polite dip of her knees how de maam massape just stared her lower lip drawn in over her teeth you she held up a finger for a long uncertain moment drawling out the word then swung and pointed past the rooms fireplace central to the inner wall to a door beyond see fairbolt dag returned her a dry nod and shepherded fawn to the door opening it for her from the room beyond fawn heard maris voice saying if hes stuck to his route he should be somewhere along the line here a mans rumbling tones answered if hed stuck to his route would he be three weeks overdue you havent got a line there youve got a huge circle and the edges run off the blighted map if youve no one else to spare ill go you just got back cattagus would have words with me till he ran out of breath and turned blue and then youd be mad look well put out the call to every patroller who leaves camp to keep groundsense and both eyes peeled both patrollers fawn realized must have their groundsenses locked down tight in the heat of their argument not to be flying to the door by now noshe glanced at dags stony faceall three she grabbed dag by the belt and pushed him through ahead of her peeking cautiously around him this room was a mirror to the first at least as far as the shelving packed to the ceiling went a plank table in the middle its several chairs kicked back to the wall seemed to be spread with maps a thickset man was standing with his arms crossed a frown on his furrowed face ironcolored hair was drawn back from his retreating hairline into a single plait down his back he wore patrollerstyle trousers and shirt but no leather vest only one knife hung from his belt but fawn noticed a long unstrung bow propped against the cold fireplace together with a quiver of arrows mari similarly clad had her back to the door and was leaning over the table pointing at something the man glanced up and his gray brows climbed toward what was left of his hairline his leathery lips twisted in a half grin got that coin mari she looked up at him exasperation in the set of her neck what coin the one you said wed flip to see who got to skin him first mari taking in his expression wheeled dag you finally where have you been her eyes raking him up and down caught as usual first on the sling ye gods dag offered a short apologetic nod seemingly split between both officers i was a bit delayed he motioned with his sling by way of indicating reasonable causes sorry for the worry i left you in glassforge pretty near four weeks ago said mari you were supposed to go straight home shouldnt have taken you more than a week at most no dag said in a tone of judicious correction i told you wed be stopping off at the bluefield farm on the way to put them at ease about fawn here i admit that took longer than id planned though once the arm was busted there seemed no rush as i figured i wouldnt be able to patrol again for nigh on six weeks anyway fairbolt scowled at this dodgy argument mari said that if your luck was good youd come to your senses and dump the farmer girl back on her family but if it ran to your usual form theyd beat you to death and hide the body did her kin bust your bone if id been her kin id have broken more of them mari muttered you still got all your parts boy dags smile thinned i had a runin with a sneak thief in lumpton market actually got our gear back for the price of the arm my visit to west blue went very pleasantly fawn decided not to offer any adjustment to this baldfaced assertion she didnt quite like the way the patrollersall three of themkept looking right at her and talking right over her but they were on dags land here she waited for guidance or at least a hint though she thought he could stand to speed up in that regard conscious of the officers eyes upon herfairbolt was leaning sideways slightly to get a view around dagshe crept out from behind her husband she gave mari a friendly little wave and the camp captain a respectful kneedip hello again mari how de do sir dag drew breath and repeated his blunt introduction fairbolt meet missus fawn bluefield my wife fairbolt squinted and rubbed the back of his neck his face screwed up the silence stretched as he and mari looked over the wedding cords with fawn felt more than just their eyes both officers had their sleeves rolled up in the heat of the day and both had similar cords winding around their left wrists worn thin and frayed and faded her own cord and dags looked bright and bold and thick by comparison the gold beads anchoring the ends seeming very solid fairbolt glanced aside at mari his eyes narrowing still further did you suspect this this no this isnthow couldbut i told you hed likely done some fool thing no one could anticipate you did fairbolt conceded and i didnt i thought he was just he focused his gaze on dag and fawn shrank even though she was not at its center i wont say thats impossible because its plain you found a way i will ask what lakewalker maker helped you to this none sir said dag steadily none but me fawns aunt nattie who is a spinner and natural maker and fawn together though not so tall as dag fairbolt was still a formidably big man he frowned down at fawn she had to force her spine straight lakewalkers do not recognize marriages to farmers did dag tell you that she held out her wrist thats why this i understood she gripped the cord tight for courage if they couldnt be bothered to be polite to her she neednt return any better now i guess you could look at this with your fancy groundsense and say we werent married if you wanted but youd be lying wouldnt you fairbolt rocked back dag didnt flinch if anything he looked satisfied if a bit fey mari rubbed her forehead dag said quietly did mari tell you about my other knife fairbolt turned to him not quite in relief but tacitly accepting the shift of subject backing off for the moment fawn was not sure why fairbolt said as much as you told her i suppose congratulations on your malice kill by the way what number was that and dont tell me you dont keep count dag gave a little conceding nod it would have been twentyseven if it had been my kill it was fawns it was both ours fawn put in dag had the knife i had the chance to use it either of us would have been lost without the other huh fairbolt walked slowly around fawn as if looking really looking at her for the first time excuse me he said and reached out to tilt her head and study the deep red scars on her neck he stepped back and sighed lets see this other knife then fawn fished in her shirt after the scare at lumpton market she had fashioned a new sheath for the blade single and of softer leather with a cord for her neck to carry it the way lakewalkers did it was undecorated but shed sewn it with care hesitantly she pulled the cord over her curls glanced at dag who gave her a nod of reassurance and handed it over to the camp captain fairbolt took it and sat down in one of the chairs near a window drawing the bone blade out he examined it much the way dag and mari had even to touching it to his lips he sat frowning a moment cradling it in his thick hands who made this for you dag not dar no a maker up in luthlia a few months after wolf ridge kauneos bone yes yes did you ever have reason before to think the making might be defective no i dont think it was but if the making was sound no one but you should have been able to prime it i am very aware of that and if the making was unsound no one should have been able to prime it at all but there it sits that it does so tell me exactly what happened in that cave again first dag and then fawn had to repeat the tale for fairbolt each in their own words they touched but lightly on how dag had come upon fawn kidnapped off the road by bandits in the thrall of the malice how hed tracked her to the malices cave and comedag bit his lipjust too late to stop the monster from ripping the ground of her twomonthschild from her womb fawn did not volunteer nor did fairbolt ask how she came to be alone pregnantand unwedon the road in the first place perhaps mari whod had the tale from fawn back in glassforge had given him the gist fairbolts attention and questions grew keener when they described the mixup with dags malicekilling sharing knives how dag going down under the malices guard of mudmen had tossed the knife pouch to fawn how shed stuck the monster first with the wrong unprimed knife then with the right one shattering it in its use how the terrifying creature had dissolved leaving the first knife so strangely charged with the mortality of fawns unborn daughter by the time they were halfthrough mari had pulled up a chair and dag leaned against the table fawn found she preferred to stand though she had to lock her knees against an unwelcome trembling fairbolt did not to fawns relief inquire into the messy aftermath of that fight his interest seemed to end with the mortal knives you are planning to show this to dar fairbolt said when theyd finished nodding to the knife still in his lap from his tone fawn wasnt sure if this was query or command yes let me know what he says he hesitated assuming the other matter doesnt affect his judgment he jerked his head toward dags left arm i have no idea what dar will think of my marriagedags tone seemed to add nor do i care but he didnt say it aloudbut i would expect him to speak straight on his craft regardless if i have doubts after i can always seek another opinion there are half a dozen knife makers around this lake of lesser skill said fairbolt watching him closely thats why im going to dar first or at all fairbolt started to hand the knife back to dag but at dags gesture returned it to fawn she put the cord back over her head and hid the sheath away again between her breasts fairbolt almost eye to eye with her watched this coolly that knife doesnt make you some sort of honorary lakewalker you know girl dag frowned but before he could say anything fawn despite the heat flushing through her replied calmly i know that sir she leaned in toward him and deepened her voice im a farmer girl and proud of it and if thats good enough for dag the rest of you can go jump in your lake just so you know this thing i have slung around my neck wasnt an honorary death she nodded curtly and stood straight a little to her surprise he did not grow offended merely thoughtful if that was what rubbing his lips that way signified he stood up with a grunt that reminded her of a tired dag and strode across the room to the far side of the fireplace covering the whole surface between the chimney stone and the outer wall and nearly floor to ceiling was a panel made of some very soft wood it was painted with a large grid pattern each marked with a place name fawn realized looking at the names she recognized that it was a sort of map if lines on a map could be pulled about and squared off of parts of the hinterlandall the parts she suspected to the lefthand side was a separate column of squares labeled two bridge island heron island beaver sigh bearsford and sick list and above them all a smaller circle in red paint labeled missing about a third of the squares had hard wooden pegs stuck in them most of them were in groups of sixteen to twentyfive and fawn realized she was looking at patrolssome squares were full of little holes as though they might have been lately emptied each peg had a name inked onto the side in tiny meticulous writing and a number on its end some of the pegs had wooden buttons like coins with holes bored in the middle hung on them by twisted wires one or two or sometimes more threaded in a stack the buttons too were numbered oh she said in surprise these are all your patrollers there must have been five or six hundred pegs in all she leaned closer to search for names she recognized fairbolt raised his brows thats right a patrol leader can keep a patrol in mind but once you get to be a company or camp captain well one head cant hold them all or at least mine cant thats clever you can see everything all at once pretty nearly she realized she needed to look more closely at two bridge island for names ah theres mari and razi and utau theyre home with sarri oh good wheres dirla beaver sigh said dag watching her pore over the display thats another island mm oh yes there she is too i hope shes happy does she have a regular sweetheart or sweethearts what are the little buttons for mari answered for the patrollers who are carrying sharing knives not everyone has one but every patrol that goes out needs to have two or more oh yes that makes sense because it wouldnt do a bit of good to find a malice and have no knife on hand and you might find another malice after or have an accident dag had spoken with a shudder of the ignominy of accidentally breaking a sharing knife and now she understood she hesitated thinking of her own spectacular if peculiar sharing knife accident why are they numbered dag said the camp captain keeps a book with records of the owners and donors for if a knife is used to send the acknowledgments to the kinfolk or know where to send the pieces if they chance to be recovered fawn frowned is that why the patrollers are numbered too very like theres another set of books with all the names and next of kin and other details someone might want to know about any particular patroller in an emergency or when the emergency is over mm said fawn her frown deepening as she pictured this she set her hands on her hips and peered at the board imagining all those livesand deathsmoving over the landscape do you connect the pegs to peoples grounds like marriage cords could you no said dag does she always go on like this asked fairbolt she glanced up to find him staring at her rather as shed been staring at the patroller board more or less yes said dag im sorry fawn clapped her hand to her mouth in apology did i ask too many questions fairbolt gave her a funny look no he reached up and took a peg out of the missing circle one of two jutting there he held it out at arms length squinting briefly at the fine print on the side and grunted satisfaction i suppose this comes off now with surprising delicacy his thick fingers unwound its wire and teased off one numbered button the second he frowned at but twisted back into place i never met the luthlia folks never got up that way you be taking care of the honors on this one dag yes good thanks he held the peg in his palm as if weighing it dag reached up and touched the remaining peg in the red circle still no word of thel it didnt sound like a question no sighed fairbolt its been near two years fairbolt mari observed dispassionately you could likely take it down its not like the boards out of room up there now is it fairbolt sniffed stared unreadably at dag gave the peg in his hand a toss and bent down and thrust it decisively into the square marked sick list he straightened up and turned back to dag stop in at the medicine tent let me know what they say about the arm come see me after you have that talk with dar he made a vague gesture of dismissal but then added where are you going next dar dag added more reluctantly mother mari snorted what are you going to say to cumbia about that she nodded at his arm cord dag shrugged whats to say im not ashamed im not sorry and im not backing down shell spit likely he smiled grimly want to come watch mari rolled her eyes i think i want to go back out on patrol fairbolt you need volunteers always but not you today go along home to cattagus your stray has turned up youve no more excuse to loiter here harassing me eh she said whether in agreement or disagreement fawn could not tell she cast a vague sort of salute at fairbolt and dag murmured good luck child at fawn in a rathertooironical voice and took herself out dag made to follow but stopped with a look of inquiry when fairbolt said dag sir eighteen years ago said fairbolt you persuaded me to take a chance on you i never had cause to regret it till now fawn wondered if he meant to imply i dont care to defend this in the camp council see that it doesnt boil up that high eh ill try not said dag fairbolt returned a provisional sort of nod and fawn followed dag out missus captain crow was gone from the outer room outside the sky had turned a flat gray the water of the lake a pewter color and the humidity had become oppressive as they made their way down the porch steps to where the horses were tied dag sighed well that could have gone worse fawn recognized her own words tossed back to her and remembered dags really his lips twitched it wasnt much of a smile but at least it was a real one and not one of those grimaces with the emphasis on the grim hed mostly had inside really fairbolt could have pulled my peg and chucked it in the fire then all my problems would have been not his problems anymore what he could have made you not a patroller thats right fawn gasped oh no and i said all those mouthy things to him you should have warned me but he made me mad talking over the top of my head she added after a moments reflection you all three did mm said dag he pulled her into his left arm and rested his chin on her curls for a moment i imagine so things were moving pretty fast there for a while she wondered if the patrollers had all been saying things to one another through their groundsenses that she hadnt caught for sure she felt there was a good deal back there she hadnt caught as for fairbolt you wont offend him by standing up to him even if youre wrong but especially if youre right his backs broad enough to bear correction he doesnt much care for folks who go bellyup to him to his face then whine about it behind his back though wellstands to reason that indeed you didnt make a bad impression on him spark in fact judging from the results you made a pretty good impression well thats a relief she paused in puzzlement what results he put my peg in the sick box still a patroller the camp council deals with any arguments the families cant solve or arguments that come up between clan heads but any active patroller the council has to go through the camp captain to deal with its like hes clan head to all of us i wont say fairbolt will or even can protect me from any consequences of thishe shrugged his left arm to indicate his marriage cordbut leastways hes keeping that possibility open for now fawn turned to untie the horses considering this the tailpiece seemed to be that it was dags joband hers to keep the consequences from getting too out of hand as she scrambled up on grace she saw under some pear trees at a little distance mari sitting on a trestle table swinging her legs and massape crow on the bench beside her mari seemed to be talking heatedly by the way she was waving her arms and massape had her head cocked in apparent fascination fawn didnt think she needed groundsense to guess the subject under discussion even without the curious glances the pair cast their way dag had wrapped copperheads reins around his hook now he led the horse beside the porch and used the steps for a mounting block settling into the saddle with a tired grunt he jerked his chin by way of a comealong gesture and led them onto the shore road heading back east f awn turned in her saddle to look as they passed the woodland road theyd come in on and turned again as the shore road bent out toward a wooden bridge spanning a channel about sixty feet across the next island spread west bounding the arm of the lake across from the patroller headquarters past the bridge its farther shoreline curved north and the lake beyond opened out for a square mile in the distance she could see a few narrow boats being paddled and another with a small triangular sail the island reached by the bridge had only a scattering of trees between them horses and goats and a few sheep grazed and beneath them more black pigs dozed mare island fawn guessed yep it and foal island which you cant see beyond the far end over theredag waved vaguely northwestare our main pastures no need to build fences you see i do clever is there a stallion island dag smiled more or less most of the studs are kept over on walnut islandhe pointed to a low green bump across the open lake patchwhich works fine until one of the fellows gets excited and ambitious and tries to swim across in the night then theres some sorting out to do the shore road swung back into the trees passing behind the clusters of log buildings along the lake bank after a scant quarter mile dag pulled up copperhead and frowned at a clearing enclosing just two buildings the lake glimmered dully beyond in the hot afternoons flat light tent redwing dag said wellfawn took a breaththis is it i guess not quite everyone seems to be out but leastways we can drop off our saddles and bags and take the horses back to pasture they rode into the clearing the two buildings were set facing each other at an angle opening toward the lake both with long sides gaping under deerhide awnings other deerhide rolls along the eaves looked as though they could be dropped down to provide more wall at need houses and porches seemed to be floored with planks not dirt at least fawn tried to think simple not squalid a stonelined fire pit lay in the clearing between the two structuresfawn still could not make herself think of them as tentsin addition to the central fireplaces that could apparently heat both the outer and the enclosed inner chambers seats of stumps or sawnoff logs were dotted about in summer no doubt almost all work was done outdoors she hopped down and helped unsaddle dealing with the straps and buckles dag with his hook hauled the gear from the horses backs and dumped it on the plank porch of the house on the right he scratched the back of his head gently not sure where mamas got off to dars likely at the bone shack and if ombas not out on mare island itll be a first dig down in the bottom of my saddlebags spark and find those strings of horseshoes fawn did so discovering two bunches of new horseshoes tied together a dozen each my word no wonder your bags were so heavy how long have you been carting these around in there since we left glassforge present for omba hickory lakes a rich camp in some ways but we have few metals in these parts except for a little copperworking near bearsford all our iron has to be traded for from other camps mostly around tripoint though weve been getting more from farmer sources in the hills beyond glassforge lately he grinned briefly when a certain young exchange patroller from tripoint walking the hinterlands arrived at massape crow and said thats far enough its told his bridegift string of horses came in from back home staggering under loads of iron it made the crows rich and fairbolt famous back in the day fawn led grace to a log seat and climbed up bareback and dag hooked her up the horseshoe bundles which she twisted about each other and laid over her lap he climbed up on copperhead in turn and they went back out to the road and returned to the bridge at the far end of the span he dismounted again to unhook a rope loop from the board gate open it for fawn and shut it again behind them he did not bother remounting but led them instead toward a long shed that lay a hundred paces or so away fawn slid off grace managing not to drop the horseshoes and dag hooked off both bridles flopping them over his shoulder copperhead scooted away at once and after a moments doubt grace followed soon putting her head down to crop grass of all of his relatives dag had talked most freely about his brothers wife the waterstrider sister whod changed her name for her motherinlaws sake in order of increasing reticence came his grandfather remembered with nostalgia from scenes of dags youth dar of whom dag spoke with cool respect his father tinged with distance and regret and in a pool of silence at the center his mother every conversation fawn had tried to lead toward her dag had led away about ombahorse trainer mare midwife maker of harness and it appeared farrierthere had been no such problem as they rounded the corner of the shed and stepped under its wooden overhang fawn had no trouble recognizing omba for she came striding out of a door crying dag finally she was not so thin as mari and quite a bit shorter though still as tall as any man in fawns family fawn would have guessed her age at fifty or so which meant she was likely fifteen years older than that she was dressed much like a patroller woman and fawn finally decided that the trousers were just lakewalker riding garb period her skin though tanned and weathered was paler than dags and her eyes a pretty silvery blue her dark hair shot with a few white streaks ran down her back in a single swift plait without ornament she caught sight of the sling planted her hands on her hips and said absent gods brother what have you done to your right arm and then after a momentary pause absent gods dag what have you done to your left arm dag gave her a nod of greeting his smile lopsided hello omba brought you something he gestured fawn forward she held out the horseshoes ombas face lit and she pounced on the prize do i need those she came to a dead halt again at the sight of the cord on fawns wrist and made a choked noise down in her throat her gaze rose to fawns face her eyes widening in something between disbelief and dismay youre a farmer youre that farmer for an instant fawn wondered if there was some lakewalker significance to dags tricking omba into accepting this gift from fawns hands but she had no time or way to ask she dipped her knees and said breathlessly hello omba im fawn dags wife she wasnt about to make some broader claim such as im your new sister that would be for omba to decide omba wheeled toward dag her eyebrows climbing and what does that make you dag redwing hickory besides head down in the slit trench fawns husband dag bluefieldtobedetermined at this point or would the effect instead be to make dag not ombas brother anymore lakewalker tent customs continued to confuse fawn you seen fairbolt yet asked omba just came from there saw mari there too you told him about this she jerked her head toward fawn certainly what did he do to you put me on sick list dag wriggled his sling that was the tobedetermined part or so i took it omba blew out her breath in unflattering wonder but not fawn thought in hostility she hung on tight to that realization it did not seem as though dag had taken her advice to start with the hardest ones first by later today not hostile might yet look pretty good what did mari say to you all last night asked dag oh there was a scene she came in asking if wed heard from you which was a jolt to start since you were supposed to be with her then she said shed sent you home from glassforge weeks ago and everyone was worried youd been injured but she said not is that right she stared at the sling was at the time i collected this on the way go on then she had this wild tale about some cutie farmer girl being mixed up in your latest malice killher eyes went curiously to fawnwhich i barely believed but now hm and that youd jumped the cliff with her which your mama hotly denied the possibility of while simultaneously yelling at mari for letting it happen i kept my mouth shut during that part though i did wish you well of it thank you said dag blandly ha though i never imaginedanyway mari said that youd gone off with the farmer girl supposed to deliver her home or something she was afraid youd met some mishap at the hands of her kinshe said she was picturing gelding that must have been some cliff when mari and your mama got down to arguing over lapses from twentyfive years back i slipped out but mari took dar down to the dock after to talk private he wouldnt say what shed added except that it was about bone craft which even your mama knows by now is the sign shell get no more from him it seemed mari was still keeping the tale of the accident to the second sharing knife close nor had the term pregnant turned up in relation to fawn at least in front of dags mama fawn felt suddenly more charitable to mari oh dag sighed omba this is going to top anything youve done ever look on the bright side nothing you can do ever after will top this the effect might even be retroactive she gave a bemused nod ill grant you that she slung the horseshoes onto some pegs on the nearest post and held up her hands palm out in a warding gesture i think ill just stay out of this one altogether if you dont mind youre welcome to try said dag amiably we were just over to the tent to drop our things but it was empty where is everyone dar went to the shack to work or hide out mari was worried sick for you and that shook him more than he was willing to let on i think she actually said im sorry to your mother at one point last night and mama said dag out on raft duty rationing plunkins dag snorted ill bet they tried to convince her to stay ashore with her bad back but she denied the back and went there will be no vile plunkin ear chucking today now fawn was lost rationing plunkins is there a shortage no said dag this time of year theyre worse than in seasontheyre in glut omba grinned dar still waxes bitter about how shed nurse her supply through the bearsford camp like there was some sort of prize for arriving at spring with the most winter store still in hand and then make you all eat up the old ones before allowing any fresh ones dags lips quirked oh yeah did she ever go through a famine fawn asked that makes people funny about food i hear tell not as far as i know said omba shes speaking to me oh good though people wishful to vent about their inlaws would bend the ear of anyone whod listen so it might not signify much not that the choices dont get a bit narrow for everyone by late winter omba continued shes just like that always has been i still remember the first summer dar and i were courting when you grew so tall dag we thought you were going to starve half the camp conspired to slip you food on the sly dag laughed i was about ready to wrestle the goats for the splits and the mishaps those are feed plunkins he added to fawn aside cant think why i didnt i wouldnt be so shy nowadays it is a known fact that patrollers will eat anything omba twitched a speculative eyebrow at fawn that made her wonder if she ought to blush to quell that thought fawn asked instead plunkin ear chucking dag explained when the plunkin heads are dredged up out of the lake bottom they have two to six little cloves growing up the sides about half the size of my hand these are broken off and put back down in the mud to become next years crop plunked in hence the name there are always more ears than needed so the excess gets fed to the goats and pigs and there are always a lot of youngsters swimming and splashing around the harvesting rafts and well excess plunkin ears make good projectiles in a reasonably nonlethal sort of way especially if you have a good slingshot he added in a suddenly warmly reminiscent tone he paused and cleared his throat the grownups disapprove of the waste of course well some do said omba some remember their slingshots someone should have given one to your mother when she was a girl maybe at her age shes not going to change youve made a change dag shrugged and asked instead howre swallow and darkling ombas face brightened wonderful well that black colts going to be fit to go for a stud when hes grown i think hell fetch you a good price or if you finally want to trade in snakebrain over there for dog meat you could ride him yourself id train him up for you you twod look mighty fine patrolling mm thanks but no sometime tomorrow or the next day soon as i have a chance i want to pull them out of the herd ill get a packsaddle for swallow and darkling can trot at her heels send them down to west blue with my bridegifts to fawns mama which i am fearsome late presenting your best horses said omba in dismay dag smiled a slow smile why not they gave me their best daughter but im their only daughter said fawn saves argument there eh said dag omba caught up her braid and rubbed the end to farmers what do they know about lakewalker horses what if they try to make swallow pull a plow or cut darkling or her face screwed up as she evidently pictured even worse farmer misuse of the precious horses my family takes good care of our horses said fawn stiffly of all our animals they wont understand said omba i will said dag he gave her a nod see you at dinner whos cookin cumbia you might want to grab a plunkin off the goats on the way to fortify yourselves thanks but i guess well survive he gestured fawn away she gave omba another kneedip and smile by way of farewell the lakewalker woman just shook her head and returned a sardonic wave but not hostile fawn reminded herself as they reached the bridge again dag held the gate aside for a girl leading a couple of horses with pannier baskets piled high with plunkins she gave him a nod of thanks these plunkins did indeed seem to be mostly broken or weirdly misshapen or with odd discolorations fawn glanced back to see her walking along chirping and tossing out plunkins along her path and a general movement among the goats and pigs toward this feast lakewalker animals eat plunkins too do they horses and cows and sheep cant the pigs and goats chomp them down so will dogs i havent seen many dogs id think youd have more for hunting and such for hunting malices even we dont keep many dogs are more hazard than help on patrol the malices snap them right up and they have no defense except us and if youre trying to bring down a malice itd be no use to be distracted trying to protect a dog especially if its turning on you itself as they strolled back along the shore road fawn asked curiously was your mother ever a patroller i think she had the training way back when all the youngsters at least get taken out on short trips around the camps patrollers are chosen for two things mainly general health and strength and groundsense range not everyone can project their groundsense out far enough to be useful on patrol the lacks not considered a defect necessarily manys the quite competent maker who cant reach out much beyond his arms length is dar like that no his range is almost as long as mine hes just even better at what he does with bones what my mother always wanted now he trailed off volunteering useful information at last no evidently not fawn sighed and prompted was what more children just didnt work out that way for her whether because father was out on patrol too much or they were just unlucky or what i dont know i should have been a girl that was my immediate next lapse after arriving late or been eight other children or had eight other children in a pinch and not off in luthlia or someplace but here at hickory camp my mother had a second chance with dar and ombas children she kind of commandeered them from omba to raise which i gather caused some friction at first till omba gave up and went to concentrate on her horses theyd worked it all out by the time i got back from luthlia minus the hand anyway theres still just a littlei wont call it bad feeling but feeling there over that motherinlaw versus daughterinlaw friction was common coin in fawns world she had no trouble following this she wondered if cumbias thwarted thirst for daughters would extend itself to a little farmer girl dragged in off patrol like some awkward souvenir she had taken in one daughterinlaw quite against custom after all some hope there dag she said suddenly where am i going to live he looked over and raised his eyebrows at her with me yes but when youre gone on patrol silence it stretched rather too long dag he sighed well just have to see spark they were nearly back to his family tentcabins when dag paused at a path leading into the woods if he was checking anything with his groundsense fawn could not tell but he jerked his chin in a comealong gesture and led right the high straight boles mostly hickory gave a pale green shade in the shadowless light as though they were walking into some underwater domain the scrub was scant and low on the flat terrain fawn eyed the poison ivy and stuck to the center of the welltrodden path lined here and there with whitewashed rocks about a hundred paces in they came to a clearing in the center was a small cabin a real one with four sides and to fawns surprise glass windows even the patrol headquarters had only had parchment stretched on window frames more disturbingly human thighbones hung from the eaves singly or in pairs swaying gently in the air that soughed in the papery hickory leaves overhead she tried not to imagine ghostly whispering voices in the branches dag followed her wide gaze those are curing those folks look well beyond cure to me she muttered which at least made his lips twitch if dars busy with something dont speak till he speaks to us dag warned in a quiet voice actually the same applies even if it looks like hes doing nothing fawn nodded vigorously putting the picture together from dags oblique descriptions she figured dar was the closest thing to a real lakewalker necromancer that existed she could not picture being foolish enough to interrupt him in the midst of some sorcery a hickory husk falling from above made a clack and a clatter as it hit the shingle roof and rolled off and fawn jumped and grabbed dags left arm tightly he smiled reassuringly and led her around the building on the narrower south side was a porch shading a wedgedopen door but the man they sought was outside at the edge of the clearing working a simple sapling lathe so ordinary and unsorcerouslooking as to make fawn blink dar was shorter and stockier than dag a solid middleaged build with a more rectangular face and broader jaw he had his shirt off as he labored his skin was coppery like dags but not so varied in its sunburnishing his dark hair was drawn back in a lakewalkerstyle mourning knot which made fawn wonder who for since his wife ombas hadnt been if there was gray in it she wasnt close enough to see one leg worked the lathe the rope to the sapling turned a clamp holding a greenwood blank both hands held a curved knife and bore it inward and pale yellow shavings peeled away to join a kickedabout pile below two finished bowls sat on a nearby stump in the shavings pile lay discarded a partially carved cracked blank and another finished bowl that looked to fawn perfectly fine his hands most drew her eye strong and longfingered like dags quick and careful and what a very odd thing it was that it should feel so odd to see them in a pair working together that way he glanced up from his carving his eyes were a clear bronzebrown he looked back down evidently trying to keep working but after another spin muttered something short under his breath and straightened up with a scowl allowing the blank to wind down then unclamped it and dropped it into the shavings pile he tossed the knife in the general direction of the stump and turned to dag sorry to interrupt said dag nodding to the half bowl i was told you wanted to see me immediately yes dag where have you been been getting here i had a few delays he made the slinggesture for once it did not divert his interrogators eye dars voice sharpened as his gaze locked on his brothers left arm what fool thing have you gone and done or have you finally done something right he let his breath out in a hiss as his eyes raked over fawn no too much to hope for his brow wrinkled as he frowned at her left wrist how did you do that very well said dag earning an exasperated look dar walked closer staring down at fawn in consternation so there really was a farmerpiglet actuallydags voice suddenly went bone drythat would be my wife missus fawn bluefield fawn meet dar redwing fawn attempted a tremulous smile her knees felt too weak to dip dar stepped half a pace back ye gods youre serious about this dags voice dropped still further deadly they locked eyes for a moment and fawn had the maddening sense that some exchange had passed or was passing that once again she hadnt caught although it had seemed to spin off the rather insulting term piglet or from the heated look in dags eye very insulting term although she couldnt see exactly why chickie and filly and piglet and all such babyanimal terms being used interchangeably for little endearments in fawns experience perhaps it was the tone of voice that made the difference whatever it was it was dar who backed down not apologizing but changing tack fairbolt will explode ive seen fairbolt i left him in one piece mari too you cant tell me hes happy about this i dont but neither was he stupid another hint of warning that perhaps for dar ceased his protests although with a frustrated gesture dag continued omba says mari spoke to you alone last night after the others oh and wasnt that an uproar mama always pictures you dead in a ditch not that she hasnt been close to right now and then just by chance but i dont expect that of mari did she tell you what happened to my sharing knife yes i didnt believe half of it which half well that would be the problem to decide now wouldnt it dar glanced up did you bring it along thats why we came here to dars work shack or to hickory lake camp generally the meaning seemed open you seen mama yet that will be next i suppose dar sighed id best see it here then before the real din starts thats what i was thinking too dar gestured them toward the cabin steps fawn sat beside dag scrunching up to him for solace and dar took a seat near the steps on a broad stump give dar the knife said dag at her troubled look he dropped a reassuring kiss atop her head which made dars face screw up as though he was smelling something rank fawn frowned but fished the sheath out of her shirt once more she would have preferred to give it to dag to hand to his brother but that wasnt possible reluctantly she extended it across to dar who almost as reluctantly took it dar did not unsheathe it immediately but sat with it in his lap a moment he took in a long breath as though centering himself somehow half the expression seemed to drop from his face since it was mostly the sour disapproving half fawn didnt altogether mind what was left seemed distant and emotionless dars examination seemed much like that of the other lakewalkers cradling the knife holding it to his lips but also cheek and forehead eyes open and closed in turn he took rather longer about it he looked up at last and in a colorless voice asked dag to explain once again the exact sequence of events in the malices cave with close guesses as to the time each movement had taken he did not ask anything of fawn he sat a little more then the distant expression went away and he looked up again so what do you make of it asked dag what happened dag you cant expect me to discuss the inner workings of my craft in front of some farmer no i expect you to discuss themfullyin front of that donors mother dar grimaced but counterattacked unexpectedly speaking to fawn directly for the very first time yes and how did you get pregnant did she have to confess the whole stupid episode with stupid sunny she looked up beseechingly at dag who shook his head slightly she gathered her courage and replied coolly in the usual way i believe dar growled but did not pursue the matter instead he protested to dag she wont understand then you wont actually be giving away any secrets will you begin at the beginning she knows what ground is for starters i doubt that said dar sourly dag shifted his splinted hand to touch his marriage cord dar she made this the other as well she couldnt dar went quiet for a time brow furrowing all right flukes happen but i still think she wont understand try she might surprise you dag smiled faintly you might be a better teacher than you think all right all right all right dar turned his glower on fawn a knifethat is a dying body thatagh go all the way back ground is in everything you understand that fawn nodded anxiously living things build up ground and alter its essence concentrate it they are always making but they are making themselves man eats food the foods ground doesnt vanish it goes into the man and is transformed when a manor any living thingdies that ground is released the ground associated with material parts dissipates slowly with the decaying body but the nonmaterial part the most complex inner essence it goes all at once are you following this he demanded abruptly fawn nodded his look said i dont think so but he went on anyway thats how living things help a blight recover by building up ground slowly around the edges and constantly releasing it again thats how blight kills by draining ground away too fast from anything caught away from the edge too long a malice consumes ground directly ripping it out of the living like a wolf disemboweling its prey dag did not wince at this comparison although he went a little stony actually that was a brief nod of agreement fawn decided she shivered and concentrated on dar because she didnt think hed respond well to being stopped for questions at least not by her sharing knives he touched the curve of hers the inner surface of a thighbone has a natural affinity for blood which can be persuaded to grow stronger by the maker shaping the knife thats what i do in addition toto encouraging it to dwell on its fate i meet with the pledged heartsdeath donor and he or she shares their blood into the knife in the making because their live blood bears their ground oh said fawn in a voice of surprise then closed her mouth abruptly oh what said dar in aggravation she looked at dag he raised an unhelpful eyebrow should i say she asked certainly she glanced sideways at the frowning andeven shirtlessthoroughly intimidating maker maybe youd better explain dag dag smiled a trifle too ironically at his brother fawn reinvented the technique herself to persuade her ground into my marriage cord took me by surprise in fact when i recognized it i nearly fell off the bench so id say she understands it intimately you used a knifemaking technique on a marriage cord dar sounded aghast dag hitched up his left shoulder worked the only clue i gave her was to mentiondays earlier in another conversation altogetherthat blood held a persons ground for a while after leaving the body fluke muttered dar though more faintly craning anew at the cord yeah thats life with spark just one fluke after another seems no end to them you were halfway through explaining a making go on dag fawn realized had been through the process from the donors side at least once if with some maker up in luthlia and not with dar in addition to whatever he had learned from being around his brother however intermittently dar took a breath and went on so at the end of the knifemaking we have a little of the pledged donors ground in the knife and that ground iswell you could say its hungry for the rest it wants to be reunited with its source and the other way around so then we come to the priming itself his face was stern contemplating this for reasons that had nothing to do with her fawn thought when the knife ishe hesitated then chose the plain worddriven into the donors heart killing him his essential ground begins to break up at this very point of dissolution the ground is drawn into the knife and held there why doesnt it just all dissolve then fawn couldnt help asking then mentally kicked herself for interrupting thats another aspect of my making if you can fluke it out good luck to you im not just a bonecarver you know his smile was astringent when someonelike dag for examplethen manages to bring the primed knife up to a malice and plunge it in the malice which eats ground and cannot stop doing so draws in the dissolving ground released by the breaking of the knife you could say the mortal ground acts as a poison to the malices ground or as a stroke of lightning to a tree orwell there are a number of ways to say it all slightly wrong but the malices ground shares in the dissolution of the mortal ground and since a malice is made of nothing but ground all the material elements it is holding in place fall with it fawn touched the scars on her neck that ive seen dars brows drew down how close were you really fawn held out her arm and squinted about half my arms length maybe and her arms werent all that long dar said dag gently if you havent grasped this ill say it again she drove my primed knife into the glassforge malice and i speak from repeated personal experience when i tell you thats way way closer than any sane person would ever want to be to one of those things dar cleared his throat uncomfortably staring down at the knife in his lap it popped out before she could help herself why cant you just use dying animals grounds to poison malices dag smiled a little but dar scowled in deep offense dar said stiffly they havent the power only the ground of a lakewalker donor will kill a malice couldnt you use a lot of animals no has it been tried dar frowned harder animals dont work farmers dont work either his lips drew back unkindly ill leave you to make the connection fawn set her teeth beginning to have an inkling about the piglet insult dag gave his brother a grim warning look but put in its not just a question of power although thats part of it its also a question of affinity affinity fawn wrinkled her nose never mind what happened to myto dags other knife she nodded to it dar sighed as if he was not quite sure of what he was about to say you have to understand a malice is a mage it comes out of the ground sessile and still in its first molt a more powerful mage than any of us alone will ever be and just gets stronger after so first this malice snatched the ground of your unborn child fawns spirits darkened in memory yes mari said no one had known malices could do that separately is that important it would be consoling if that horror had at least bought some key bit of knowledge that might help someone later dar shrugged its not immediately clear to me that it makes any practical difference why do malices want babies he held out his hand and turned it over its the inverse of what the sharing knives share children unborn and to a lesser extent young are in the most intense possible period of selfmaking of the most complex of grounds malices building up to a moltto a major selfmaking or selfremakingseem to crave that food couldnt it steal from pregnant animals dar raised a brow if it wanted to molt into an animal body instead of a human one perhaps they can and do dag put in the wolf ridge malice couldnt get enough humans so it partly used wolves as well i was told by patrollers who were in on the knifing of it that its form was prettypretty strange at the end and it was well past its first molt fawn made a disturbed face so she noticed did dar dar continued anyway secondly you drove dags unprimed knife into the thing fawn nodded its thigh he said anywhere i didnt know thenleaving that knife in place right yes that was when the boglethe malicepicked me up the second time by the neck i thought it was going to shake me apart like a chicken dar glanced at her scars and away then you drove in the actual primed knife i figured id better be quick it broke fawn shivered in the remembered terror and dags left arm tightened around her i thought id ruined it but then the malice dropped me andand sort of melted it stank simplest explanation said dar crisply a person carrying something very valuable to them who trips and falls tries to fall so as to protect their treasure even at the cost of hurting themselves malice snatches rich ground seconds later before the malice has assimilated or stored that ground its hit with a dose of mortality in its fall it blindly tries to shove that ground into a safe spot for it the unprimed knife a malice certainly has the power to do so by force and not persuasion end result one dissolved malice one knife with an unintended ground jammed into it dar sucked his lip more complicated explanations might be possible but i havent heard anything in your testimony that would require them hm said dag so will it still work as a sharing knife or not the ground in it isstrange it was caught and bound at a point of most intense selfmaking and most absolute selfdissolution simultaneously but still only a farmers ground after all he glanced up sharply unless theres something about the child no one is telling me mixed blood for example his look at his brother was coolly inquiring and not especially respectful it was a farmer child fawn said quietly looking at the soil it was bare at the base of the steps with a few broken hickory husks flattened into the old mud dags arm tightened silently around her again then it will have no affinity and is useless an unprimed knife that gets contaminated can be boiled clean and rededicated sometimes but not this my recommendation is that you break it to release that worthless farmer ground burn itor send the pieces back to kauneos kin with whatever explanation you can concoct that wont embarrass youand start over with a new knife his voice softened im sorry dag i know you didnt carry this for twenty years for such a futile end but you know it happens that way sometimes fawn looked up at dar ill have that back now she said sturdily she held out her hand dar gave dag an inquiring look found no support and reluctantly handed the sheathed knife back to fawn a lot of knives never get used said dag in a wouldbe casual tone i see no special need of rushing to dispose of this one if it serves no purpose intact it serves no more destroyed dar grimaced what will you keep it for then a wall decoration a gruesome memento of your little adventure dag smiled down at fawn she wondered what her own face looked like just now it felt cold he said it had one use leastways it brought us together all the more reason to break it said dar grimly fawn thought back on dags offer of the same act way back at the horsefords farmhouse we could have saved a lot of steps how could two such apparently identical suggestions feel like utter opposites trust and untrust she hoped she could get dag alone soon and ask him whether he accepted his brothers judgment or only some part of it or none or if they should seek another maker there was no clue in his face she hid the knife away again in her shirt dag stood and stretched rolling his shoulders its about dinnertime i expect you want to come watch dar or hide out here fawn began to wish she and dag could hide out here wellshe eyed the bones hung from the eaves swinging in the freshening breezemaybe not just here but somewhere oh ill come said dar rising to collect his carving knife and the finished bowls and take them inside might as well get it over with optimist said dag stepping aside for him as he trod up the steps fawn caught a glimpse of a tidy workroom a very orderly bench with carving tools hung above it and a small fieldstone fireplace in the wall opposite the door dar came back out fastening his shirt entirely insensible of the ease with which his buttons cooperated with his fingers latched the door and passed efficiently around the shack closing the shutters the green light of the woods was growing somber as scudding dark clouds from the northwest filled the sky above the staccato pop of falling nuts sounded like dags joints on a bad morning fawn clung to dags left arm as they started back up the path his muscles were tight she lengthened her steps to match his and was surprised to find she didnt have to lengthen them very much b eyond the clearing with the two tentcabins the gray of the lake was darkening waves starting to spin off white tails of spume fawn could hear them slapping the shore beneath the nearby bank where a stand of cattails bent and hissed in the rising wind only a single narrow boat was still in view with two men paddling like mad for a farther shore in the slatecolored air to the north dazzling forks of lightning snaked from sky to earth their thunder still laggard in arriving the pearl of the sun sinking toward mare island disappeared behind a darker cloud even as she watched turning the light gloomy under the awning of the cabin on the right a thin straight rigid figure in a skirt stood beside their piles of saddles and gear watching anxiously up the path they were descending omba in her riding trousers lurked in the shadows behind leaning against a support post with her arms crossed what are you going to say fawn whispered urgently to dag depends on what on what she says if the rumors have run ahead of me shell have had time to get over being happy im alive and move on to other concerns depending on who all sides omba got to her with the rumors she could be pretty well stirred up you left our gear in plain sightshed have to know youre back even without omba there is that did he even have a plan fawn was beginning to wonder as they neared the woman in the skirt stood bolt upright her hands twitched out once then she planted them firmly on her hips cumbia redwing wore her silverygray hair pulled back in the simple mourning knot her skin had less of the burnished copper in it than dagsdarker more leathery more wornif striking in contrast with the hair fawn might have guessed her age as a healthy seventy though she knew she was two decades beyond that her eyes were the clear tea color narrowing under pinchedin streaks of silver brows as they swept over fawn in a better light fawn suspected they would be bright gold like dags as they came up to the edge of the awning cumbia thrust out her chin and snapped dag redwing hickory im speechless behind them dar muttered bet not dags brows barely twitched acknowledgment of this proving dar right she went on whatever you patrollers do out on the road the rule is you dont bring it home you cant be bringing your farmer whore into my tent as if he hadnt heard her dag pulled the shrinking fawn forward and said mama this is my wife fawn bluefield how de do maam fawn dipped her knees frantically searching amongst the hundred rehearsed speeches in her mind for something to follow she hadnt imagined doing this in a thunderstorm she hadnt imagined most of this dag forestalled her now standing behind her he slid his hook carefully turned downward under her left wrist and elevated it see wife he shrugged his left shoulder to display his own marriage cord cumbias eyes widened in horror you cant have with a hiccough of breath she choked out cut those things no maam said dag in a weirdly affable tone flying fawn thought off in that other place he went to when things turned deadly sour when action moved too fast for thought and he turned it all over to some other part of himself that could keep up or not dag if you do not burn those abominations and take that girl right back where you found her you are never entering my tent again had cumbia been rehearsing too coached by excited rumormongers there seemed something deeply awkward about her as if her mouth and eyes were trying to say two different things dag might know with his groundsense if he hadnt obviously closed it down as hard as a hickory shell dag smiled or at any rate his mouth curved sunnily though his eyes stayed tight making him look for a moment oddly like his mother very good maam he turned to his stunned listeners omba dar good to see you again fawn get your bags and bedroll well send someone back for the saddles tomorrow omba if she throws them out in the rain could you put them under cover for me omba staring wideeyed nodded wait what but dag he bent and hooked up fawns saddlebags and handed them to her then hooked his own over his shoulder she clutched the heavy load awkwardly to her chest as he put his arm around her back and turned her toward the clearing the first big raindrops spattered down batting the hickory leaves and hitting the dirt with audible plops but dag no oneshe hasnti havent reversing herself abruptly cumbia said dag you cant go out there now its coming on to storm come along spark he hustled her out a few fat drops plunked onto the top of her head like hard fingertaps soaking cold down to her scalp but dag shes not hardlyi didnt even get a chance to fawn turned back to dip her knees again and call a desperate nice to meet you maam over her shoulder where are you going cried cumbia echoing fawns thoughts exactly come back out of the rain you fool keep walking dag muttered out of the corner of his mouth dont look back or itll be all to do over again as they passed a big basket leaning against a stump piled high with dark round shapes he thunked his hook into one snatching it up in passing his stride lengthened fawn scurried to keep up as they reached the road dag hesitated and fawn panted where are we going he glanced over his shoulder through the trees the far shore of the lake had disappeared behind a thick gray curtain of rain fawn could hear the oncoming hiss of it i have some folks who owe me favors but thatll best be for tomorrow i think right now we just need shelter this way to fawns considerable dismay he turned down the path leading to the bone shack she grappled her saddlebags around over her shoulder and trotted after the fat raindrops gave way in a cold gust to little hailstones slicing down through the leaves and bouncing off the path and more painfully off her the pebblesized ice triggered a heavier and even more alarming hail of hickory husks as the trees creaked in the wind and fawn pictured heavy branches coming down on them like huge hammers both she and dag ducked and ran through the ominous shadows she was gasping and even dag was out of breath when they arrived back at dars workcabin along the eaves the bones spun and knocked against one another in the gusts like dreadful wind chimes hail and hickory husks rattled off the roof shingles sometimes sailing up again in high arcs before plopping to earth that was rapidly turning to mud she and dag thumped up the steps and huddled under the little porch roof with his wet hair plastered to his forehead and his jaw set dag attempted to free his hook from the plunkin by grasping the round root under his slingarm which made his saddlebags in turn slide off his shoulder and land on his feet he cursed here said fawn in exasperation let me she dumped her own bags wriggled the plunkin free of his hook set it down then turned to pluck the latchstring out of its slot and pull the door open the shuttered cabin was dark and she peered in doubtfully dag bent down to hook futilely at his bootlaces undo these for me would you spark he muttered dar doesnt like his floor dirtied she knocked the hook aside before he could snarl the laces into inextricable wet knots undid first his then hers and set both pairs beside the door she wiped her hands in aggravation on her riding trousers and followed him inside he bent over a workbench a welcome light flared from a good beeswax candle in a clay holder he lit a second from the first and with that and the faint gray light leaking through the shutters and from the door she was finally able to see clearly the space was a bare dozen feet long by ten or so wide lined with shelves and a couple of scarred but clearedoff workbenches stools of various heights made from upended logs cut away beneath for legs and above for short backrests were thrust under the benches the space smelled of old wood and fresh wood herbs and solvents the honeyed warmth of the candles oil leather and time and under it all something undefinable she tried not to think death dag dragged their bags just inside the door rolling the plunkin along after with his foot he closed the door against the gusts minus the rattling of bones and clatter of ice and nuts on the roof the threatening creak of the trees in the wind the howling storm the interminable day the harrowing scene or half scene theyd just been through and both their moods it might have been almost cozy as it was fawn would have burst into tears if she hadnt been so close to just bursting so she said tightly what happened to all your smooth lakewalker persuadin back there dag sighed and stretched his back there were only two ways it could go spark slow and excruciating or fast and excruciating like yanking a tooth i prefer my pain to go fast you didnt even give her a chance to say her piece he cocked an eyebrow at her fewest unforgivable things we had the time to say to each other the better id say i didnt get a chance to say my piece i didnt even get to try with her im not saying i would have got anywhere either but at least id have known i tried i know that trying spark it wouldve near broke my heart to watch you turning yourself inside out with it i couldnt have stood it he turned to attempt to undo their bedroll strings with his hook after watching him for a frustrated moment fawn reached past and plucked the knots apart helping him unroll their blankets across the floor he sat down on his with a weary grunt she sat down opposite crosslegged frowning up at him and raked her hands through her damp distracted curls sometimes once folks have a chance to vent theyll calm down and talk more reasonable cumbia had already advanced as far as promoting fawn from farmer whore to that girl just in the short time shed been given scarcely worse than the that fellow that was dags common name in west blue who knew where they might have ended up if theyd just kept at it a bit he shrugged she won its done if she won what was her prize fawn demanded i dont see how anyone won anything much back there looki didnt leave she threw me out either she means it and shell never speak to me again or else itll be up to her to apologize so what youre actually saying is you won some tactics dag he grimaced learned em at my mothers knee what has got into you ive seen you in some moods but i never saw you in a mood like this one cant say as i much like it he lay back and stared up at the peeledlog ridgepole none of the support timbers for the roof were squared off or dressed being just slim bare trunks of the right length fitted into triangles i dont much like the way i get here either its like i lose myself when i get mixed up with my closest kin dar and mama mostlymy father when he was alive less so but some mari i can stand its part of why i touch down here lightly or not at all if i can help it a mile away or better yet a hundred i can go back to being me huh said fawn mulling this over she didnt find it nearly as inexplicable as she might once have remembering how vast new possibilities had seemed to open for her in glassforge and close down chokingly when she returned to west blue it was just that at dags age she figured folks ought to be long over that sort of thing or maybe theyd just had more time to work down into a rut deep deep rut funny sort of exile indeed it is but he wasnt laughing the air was chilling fast as the storm rumbled through the small stone fireplace was clearly there more for warming pots of work supplies than for heating the far from tight building presumably not used in winter but dag bestirred them to lay a fire have to replace that in the morning he muttered at the neat pile of deadfall standing ready on the porch just outside the door but once the flames caughtdag did seem to have a peculiar lucky knack for getting fires goingthe yellow light the scent of woodsmoke and the occasional orange spark popping out onto the slate hearth lent some muchneeded cheer to the room their hair and clothes began to dry and fawns skin lost its clamminess fawn set a pot of rainbarrel water on an iron hook to boil for tea swung it over the fire and poked at the new coals with a stick pushing more underneath her pot so she said in what she hoped did not sound too desperate a tone where do we go tomorrow i figure to draw our own tent from stores they owned a tent where will we set it up i have an idea or two if they dont work out ill find a third which seemed to be all she was going to get right now was this clash with his family over or not it wasnt that she thought dag was lying to her so much as that she was beginning to suspect his idea of a comfortable outcome did not match hers if lakewalkers didnt marry farmersor at least didnt do so and then take the farmers homeshe wouldnt expect the feeling here against her to be trifling or easily set aside if this was something no one had successfully done before her faith that dag will know what to do wasif not misplaced more hope than certainty she wasnt afraid of hard but when did hard shade over into insurmountable her stomach growled if dag was half as fatigued as she was it was no wonder nobody seemed able to think straight food would help everything she rolled the mysterious plunkin across in front of the hearth and stared at it it still looked disconcertingly like a severed head what do we do with this dag sat crosslegged and smilednot much of a smile but a start lots of choices they all come down to plunkin you can eat it raw in slices peel it and cut it up and cook it alone or in a stew boil it whole wrap it in leaves and cook it in campfire coals stick a sword through it and turn it on a spit or very popular feed it to the pigs and eat the pigs its very sustaining some say you could live forever on plunkin and rainwater others say it would just seem like forever he gestured to her belt knife one of his spares that hed insisted she wear since theyd left west blue try a slice dubiously she captured the rolling globe between her knees and stabbed it the brown rind was rather hard but once opened revealed a dense pale yellow fruit solid all the way through without a core or pit or seeds she nibbled out a bite as if from a melon slice it was crunchy not as sweet as an apple not as starchy as a raw potatoa bit parsnippy actually quite a bit nicer than parsnip huh it seemed the problem was not in the quality but in the quantity for simplicity and because she really didnt feel comfortable cooking over dars fireplace used for who knew what sorcerous processes they ate it raw in slices although fawn did draw the line at dags attempt simply to stab his portion with his hook and gnaw around the edges she peeled his piece and made him get out his forkspoon the plunkin was surprisingly satisfying hungry as they both were they only disposed of half a head or root or whatever it was why dont farmers have this fawn wondered food gets around flowers too animals too really we could grow it in ponds dag gestured with his slice stuck on his forkspoon all right so the official eating tool hadnt made that much difference it still made it all seem more like a real meal the ears need a little tickle in their grounds to germinate if farmers planted them theyd just go down in the mud and rot its a trick most every lakewalker here learns i hated raft duty when i was young thought it was the dullest thing possible now i understand why the old patrollers didnt mind taking their turns and laughed at me soothing yknow fawn crunched valiantly and tried to picture a young impatient dag sitting out on a raft mostly undressed coppery skin gleaming in the sun grouchily tickling plunkin ears one after another after another she had to smile with two hands scarless and unmarred her smile faded they say the old high lords of the lake league made wonderful magical plants and animals too dag said thoughtfully not many seemed to have survived the disasters plunkins have tricky growing conditions not too deep not too shallow mud bottoms they wont take in those deep clear rockybottomed lakes east or north makes them a regional er delicacy and of course they need lakewalkers year after year after year makes me wonder how far back this camp goes really fawn considered the continuity of plunkins when all their world was falling apart around them some lakewalker ancestors must have kept the crop going for hope for habit for sheer stubbornness eyeing dag she was inclined to bet on stubbornness they burned the rinds on the fire and fawn set the spare half aside for breakfast outside the green dark of the storm had given way to the blue dark of night and the rain had slowed to a steady drizzle dag hooked their bedrolls closer together fawn felt her knife sheath shift between her breasts as she crawled across to sit again on her blanket and reached up to touch it do you think dar was telling the truth about the knife dag leaned back against his saddlebags damp bare feet to the fire and frowned thoughtfully i think everything dar said was truth as far as it went sowhat does that mean do you think he was holding something back not sure its not thatid say the knife is a problem he wants to have go away not explore if hes as good a knife maker as you say id think hed be more curious dag shrugged folks are at first like saun the sheep or me at sauns ageits all new and exciting but then it becomes the same task over and over and the new becomes rare whether you then find novelty to be exciting or something to resentthing is dar has spent thirty and more years all day most every day making weapons for his relatives and best friends to go kill themselves with whatever dar is doing that lets him go on im not inclined to fool with it maybe we should ask after a younger knife maker then fawn shoved her own saddlebags around trying for a more comfortable prop and lay down next to dag sowhat did heand youmean when you said the ground had to have affinity you used that word two or three times like it meant something special ah hm dag rubbed his nose with his hook his features were outlined in the orange glow from the fire lapped by the light with the rest of him falling into shadow the walls of the shack seemed to recede into a fathomless darkness well simply that malice ground takes up lakewalker mortality readily as the ground of bone takes up that of blood fawn frowned you have to figure bones take up blood because they were once both together thats right so she suddenly wasnt sure she liked where this was going so legend would have itlegend is just like they say only more dried up you know she nodded cautiously in fact no one alive now knows for sure those who knew died in the knowing one two thousand years ago chronicles were lost time was lostwas it two centuries or five or ten that dropped out how many generations disappeared in the dark they kept the plunkins going anyhow his lips curved briefly there is that so what is this thing thats known or not known well there is more than one version of how malices came into the world we know they didnt used to be here youve seen what twentyseven of them up close i dont want to know what other people say what do you believe he sighed they say is all i have to go on for most of it they say the old lords of the lake league worked great magics in great groups they combined up under the mastery of the high king one king the last king greater and more cunning than any before at the apex of the greatest array of mages ever assembled reached beyond the bounds of the world forsomething some say immortality some say power the king stories mostly assume evil intent because of evil resultsif there is punishment there must have been a crime they blame pride and selfishness or whatever vice theyre especially miffed with im not so sure maybe he was attempting to capture some imagined good to share and it all went horribly wrong you know i said the old lords used their magic to alter plants animals and themselves and their children he tapped his temple with the backside of his hook and fawn realized he thought his eye color was a relic of those efforts extended life improved groundsense and ability to move the world through its ground he glanced briefly and uneasily at his left arm held up and she knew he was thinking about his ghost hand again he let it drop again to his side we lakewalkers we think are the descendants of lesser hinterland lordswhat must the great ones have been like anyway in their attempt to enhance themselves the high lords drew in something from outside the world god demon other if theyd kidnapped a god it would explain why the gods shun us and the king combined with it or it with him and became something that was neither vast distorted powerful insane and consuming ground instead ofof whatever theyd intended wait are you saying your own king became the first malice fawn rolled up on her elbow to stare in astonishment dag tilted his head in doubt he became something some lords fell under his powerlegend saysand some broke away a war of matter and magic followed which sank the lakes and left the dead lake and the western levels whether the malicekings enemies discovered how to destroy him or it was another accident any who knew died in the finding out someone back then must have discovered how to share mortality it must have been a great sharing is all i can say our malices came from some cataclysmic ground transformation when he or it was at last destroyed and blew up into those ten thousandor however manyshards or seeds or eggs but thats what we think the malices are all trying to do clumsily when they come out of the ground become kings again henceto return roundabout to your original questionaffinity malices take up lakewalker mortality because they are or were partly us along the eaves bones clanked in a breath of night wind fawn found herself trying to shrink under her blankets which had crept during this reciting from her feet to her waist to her nose this was worse than any tall tale her brothers had ever tormented her with are you saying all those malices are your relatives he lay back and infuriatingly laughed dont you just hate those family squabbles absent gods the chuckles died down before she got up the nerve to poke him in reproof collateral ancestors at most spark but i suggest you not share that insight around some folks are like to be offended what have i married into really the revelations dismayed her she thought back to her malices tormented merciless eyes they might have been teabrown with a certain nowfamiliar iridescence he let out the last of his black humor in a sigh if not relatives they are certainly our legacy our joint inheritance not sure what my share is his hook drifted up to touch his heart one i reckon a chill shook fawn at this vision of his mortal fate and you all so proud riding by us like lords and yet lakewalkers lived at home in worse poverty than most farmers unless the bearsford camp was any more elaborate than this she was beginning to suspect not noble grandeur was sadly lacking all around squalid scramble seemed a more apt description dag shrugged we have to tell ourselves some flattering stories to keep ourselves going day after year after decade what else lie down and die for the endless despair of it all she lay back and followed his stare up into the dim rafters is there an end perhaps if we just keep on we think there were not an infinite number of malices planted they dont come up under water or ice or above the tree line or on old blight our maps of the lairs weve destroyed show them thicker toward the dead lake but fewer and farther apart going out and we say they are immortal but in fact all that have hatched have been slain so maybe they wouldnt live forever but what they destroy betimes is more than enough maybe theyll stop hatching out someday just for sheer age but thatd be a bad hope to count on or dwell on like to make a man impatient and this is no war for the impatient yet if all things end even despair must too not in my lifetime but sometime he blinked up into the shadows i dont believe in much but ill believe that that despair must end or not in his lifetime both likely he sat up and stretched his back wincing and after a desultory futile prod at his armharness buckles with his splinted hand extended it to fawn to free him for the night she unbuckled it and set it aside as usual decided they werent going to do better than to sleep in their clothes and after a brief hesitation cuddled down in her accustomed spot under his left arm where she could press her ear to his heart she pulled the blanket up over them both dag did not by word or gesture suggest lovemaking here tonight and relieved neither did she the fire died to embers before either of them slept d ag left on a mumbled errand soon after it was light leaving fawn to pack up she had the bags and bedrolls stacked tidily on the porch the cabin swept out and even the fireplace ashes hauled away and scattered in the wet woods with no sign of his return she collected from the abundant new deadfall to replace the pile theyd burned last night and then some and finally sat on the porch steps with her chin in her hand waiting the flock of wild turkeysor another flock as there seemed to be a lot more of them this morning upwards of fortystalked through the clearing and fawn and they eyed each other gloomily a figure appeared on the path and the turkeys ambled off fawn sat up eagerly only to slump in disappointment it was dar not dag he glowered at her without approval but without surprise likely his groundsense had told him where she and dag had gone to hole up last night morning she tried cautiously she received a grunt and a grudging nod in return wheres dag he asked he went off she added warily he told me to wait here for him till he got back another grunt dar inspected his lathe wet but undamaged by the storm and went around the cabin fastening open the shutters he trod up the steps stared down at her slipped off his muddy shoes and went inside he came back out in a few minutes looking faintly frustrated perhaps because shed left nothing to complain of he asked abruptly you didnt couple in there last night did you fawn stared up in offense no but what business is that of yours id have to do a ground cleansing if you did he stared at the firewood stack did you collect that or dag i did of course he looked as though he was reaching for a reason to reject it but couldnt come up with one fortunately at that point dag came striding up the path he looked reasonably cheerful perhaps his errand had prospered ah he paused when he saw his brother they exchanged equally laconic nods dar waited a moment as if for dag to speak then when nothing was forthcoming said that was a clever retreat last night you didnt have to listen to the complaints you couldve gone for a walk in the rain anyway i thought that was your trickpatroller dag lowered his eyelids as you say he nodded to fawn and hooked his saddlebags and hers up over his shoulder come along spark gday dar fawn found herself trotting at his heels casting a farewell nod over her shoulder at dar who by the opening and tight closing of his mouth clearly had wanted to say more were you all right dag asked as soon as they were out of earshot with dar i mean i guess except that he asked one really rude question which was fawn flushed he asked if wed made love in his cabin ah well he actually does have a legitimate reason for wanting to know that but he should have asked me if he really couldnt trust me to know better i hadnt worked round yet to asking him if your mama had softened any overnight didnt you want to ask if she had dag said distantly im sure dar was able to stiffen her up again fawn asked more quietly looking down at her feet pacing along the muddy leafandstickstrewn path did thismarrying memess things up any between you and your brother no because he seems pretty angry at you at us hes always annoyed at me for something its a habit dont worry about it spark they reached the road and turned right dag barely glanced aside as they passed his familys clearing he made no move to turn in there the road followed the shoreline around the island and curved south running between the woods and more groups of cabins hugging the bank the dripping trees sparkled in the morning light and the sun now well up above the farther shore sent golden beams between the boles through the cool moist air which smelled of rain and moss not a quarter mile along dag turned left into a clearing featuring three tentcabins and a dock much like all the others it was set a little apart from its neighbors by a stand of tall black walnut trees to its north and an orchard of stubbier fruit trees to its south fawn could see a few beehives tucked away among the latter on a stump in front of one of the cabins sat an aging man dressed only in trousers cut off above the knees and held up by a rope belt and leather sandals his gray hair was knotted at his nape he was carving away with long strokes on what looked to be some sort of oar or paddle in the making but when he saw them he waved the knife in amiable greeting dag dumped their saddlebags atop another stump and led fawn over to the fellow by his gnarly feet she suspected he was an old patroller hed clearly been a big man once now going a little stringy with age except around hisfor a lakewalkerample middle he eyed fawn as curiously as she eyed him dag said fawn this is cattagus redwing maris husband making him dags uncle then so this marriage hadnt estranged dag from quite all his family fawn dipped her knees and smiled anxiously looking around covertly for mari it would be wonderful to see a familiar face she saw no one else but heard cheery voices coming from down over the bank cattagus tilted his head in dry greeting so this is what all the fuss is about cute as a kitten ill grant you that his voice was wheezy with a sharp whistling running through it he looked her up and down a little smile playing around his lips shook his head wryly drew breath again and added absent gods boy id never have got away with something like this not even when i was thirty years younger dag snorted sounding more amused than offended course not aunt mari wouldve have had your hide for a tent flap cattagus chuckled and coughed thats a fact he waved aside with his knife the girls from stores brought your tent by already said dag that was quick fawn tracked their gazes to a large handcart set at the side of one cabin piled high with what appeared to be old hides with a stack of long poles sticking out the back they said bring back their cart soon as you get it empty that i can do where do mari and sarri want me to set up better go ask em cattagus gestured toward the shore fawn followed dag to peek over the bank to the left of the dock at which two narrow boats were tied a sort of wooden cradle lay in the water perhaps ten feet long and six feet wide a woman wearing long black hair to her hips and nothing else and a blackhaired girlchild were tromping vigorously up and down in it marching with them razi equally nude was clapping his hands and calling to the little girl who looked to be about four jump tesy jump she squealed with laughter and hopped like a frog splashing the woman who ducked and grinned the cradle was apparently for retting some sort of longstemmed plant and the treaders were engaged in kicking off the rotting matter to clean the fibers beyond them utau standing in water to his waist was supporting the clutching fists of a small boy of perhaps two whose fat little legs kicked up a fountain of foam mari dressed in only a simple sleeveless shift hemmed at the calf and sandals like her husbands stood on the dock with her hands on her hips watching them smiling she seemed to be halfway through either loading or unloading a couple dozen coils of roughlooking rope from one of the boats much like the rope netting fawn had seen on the plunkin panniers dag called down over the bank hey mari were back indicating that hed been here once already this morning likely to arrange this fawn wondered if this had been his first idea or his third and just how he had gone about explaining his needs his ability to persuade had not entirely deserted him it seemed mari waved back be right with you steps laid from flat stones made a stairway down the steep bank to the dock in a few moments fawn was treated to the somewhat startling sight of a whole family of nude wet lakewalkers climbing up from the shore they seemed quite unconscious of their undress fawn who had never done more than wade in the shallows of the river with her skirts rolled up supposed it made sense given that these people were likely in and out of the water a dozen times a day for various purposes she was nonetheless relieved when they streamed past her with only the briefest greetings and emerged a few minutes later from the cabin on the north of the clearing dressed if simply razi and utau in truncated trousers like cattaguss and sarri and her daughter in shifts the little boy escaping streaked past still in his skin in a beeline for the water only to be scooped up and tickled into distraction from his purpose by utau mari followed up the steps and stopped by dag morning fawn her expression today was ironic but not unsympathetic dag sarri thought you could set up under the apple tree over there theres a bit of rising ground there though you can hardly see it itll be the driest spot utau with the boy now riding atop his shoulders small hands pulling his hair from its knot came up with the longhaired woman to fawns eyes she looked to be about thirty fawn added the accustomed fifteen years to her guess hello fawn utau greeted her without surprise clearly hed been given the whole tale by now this is our wife sarri otter a nod at razi who had been inspecting the cart and now strode over to join them confirmed the other part of that our fawn had twigged that they were on sarris territory and maybe maris she gave her kneedip and said to the women thank you for having us here sarri folded her arms and nodded shortly face not unfriendly eyes curious dagwell dag she said as if that explained something dag razi utau and mari with cattagus following along and supplying wheezing commentary then turned their attention to the alleged tent the men hauled the cart to the orchard and swiftly unloaded it the bewildering mess of poles and ropes was transformed with startling speed into a square frame with hides over its arching top and hanging down for walls neatly staked to the earth it had a sort of miniature porch more hides raised up on poles for an awning in front which they arranged facing the lakeshore canted so that the rising sun would not shine in directly they rolled up and tied the front walls beneath the awning leaving the little room open to the air much like the more solid structures there said dag in a satisfied voice standing back and regarding the results tent bluefield fawn thought it looked more like puptent bluefield it made the other cabins seem positively palatial she ventured near and peered in dubiously its all right im just temporary the tent seemed to say of itself but temporary on the way to what dag followed looking down at her a shade anxiously manys the young couple who starts with no more he said likely but you arent young mm said fawn and nodded to show willing there was space inside for a double bedroll and a few possessions but little else at least the stubby apple tree was not likely to drop lethal branches atop dont lay anything out in it yetlet the ground dry a while more said dag well get reeds for bedding rocks for a fire pit maybe do something for flooring he strode back to the clearing and collected a pair of short logs hooking up the smaller and rolling the larger along with his foot and set them upright beneath the awning for seats there excited by this novelty the little girl tesy went inside and pranced and danced about singing to herself truly the tent seemed more playhousesized than dagsized though the curved roof would allow him to stand upright barely sarri made to call her daughter back out but fawn said nolet her its a sort of house blessing i guess which earned her a grateful and suddenly shrewd look from sarri if i might borrow your husbands once more said dag to sarri i thought wed go get my things before i take the cart back sure thing dag marihis gaze seemed to test his patrolleaderandrelatives willingnessmaybe you could show fawn around while were gone implying among other things that fawn was not invited on this expedition but mari nodded readily enough it seemed fawn was to be accepted by this branch of dags family at least if temporarily like the tent the three men went off with the cart not altogether unloaded as both children immediately scrambled atop for the ride or rather tesy scrambled up and her little brother wailed in dismay till razi popped him aboard with her its normally a bit livelier than this mari told fawn who was gazing around the clearing but as soon as i got back from patrol and could take charge of cattagus my daughter took her family across to heron island to visit with her husbands folks theyre building a new boat for her a wave of her hand indicated the third cabin as belonging to this absent family was the daughter maris nameheiress what else did lakewalkers inherit if they did not own land besides their fair share of malices was this site apportioned out like tents and horses from some camp pool mari with sarri trailing in silent curiosity took fawn out back and showed her where the privy was hidden among the trees not a shed but a slit trench with a hide blind very tentlike water was drawn from the lake and kettles kept permanently on the hob to boil that intended for drinking inside maris cabin fawn saw that the fireplace had a real oven which she eyed enviously lakewalker women were not limited to pan bread cooked over an open fire evidently though it seemed futile to ask to borrow the oven when fawn owned no flour baking pans lard butter eggs milk or yeast against the wall in sarris cabin stood a simple vertical loom loaded with work in progress some toughlooking tightwoven fabric fawn recognized from lakewalker riding trousers fawn wondered at the thread sarri explained it was from the everuseful plunkin the stems of which when retted yielded up a long strong durable fiber which accounted for the retting cradle in the lake fawn didnt see a spinning wheel little furniture met her eye apart from some trestle tables and the common upendedlog seats there were no bed frames inside at all by the bundles of bedding stacked along a wall it seemed lakewalkers slept in bedrolls even at home and fawn realized why dag had taken so happily to the floor of aunt natties weaving room they went outside again to find that dag and the cart had returned besides their saddles and bridles a sword in a worn leather sheath and a spear it held only one trunk is this all you have fawn asked him as he set it all in a pile beside the tent for later stowage the trunk hardly seemed large enough to contain for example surprise kitchen tackle it barely seemed large enough for spare boots dag stretched his back and grimaced my winter gears in storage at bearsford fawn suspected it amounted to little more he added i also have my camp credit youll see tomorrow how that works and he was off again dragging the emptied cart with his hook what shall i do fawn asked rather desperately after him take a rest he called unhelpfully over his shoulder and turned onto the road rest shed been resting or at least traveling which while not restful was certainly not useful work her hand traced her wrist cord and she looked up at the two lakewalker women looking downdubiously at her sarris cord she saw was two cords wrapped around each other i aim to be a good wife to dag fawn said resolutely then her voice wavered but i dont know what that means here mama trained me up if this were a farm i could run it i could make soap and candles but i have no tallow or anything to make lye in i can cook and preserve but theres no jars and no storage cellars if i had a cow i could milk her and make cheese and butter if i had a churn aunt nattie gave me spindles and knitting needles and scissors and needles and pins never saw a man more in need of socks than dag and i could make good ones but i have no fiber i can keep accounts and make a fair ink but theres no paper nor anything to record although those turkeys she considered could be forced to yield up quills i have knowing hands but no tools there must be more for me to do here than sit and eat plunkin mari smiled let me tell you farmer child when you come back from weeks out on patrol youre right glad to sit and eat plunkin for a time even dag is she added after a moments reflection for about three days then hes back badgering fairbolt for a place in the next patrol going out fairbolt figures that the reason he has three times the malice kills of anyone else is that he spends twice the time looking for em sarri said curiously what accounts for the rest fairbolt wishes he knew mari scratched her head and regarded fawn in bemusement yeah dag said youd get restytesty if anyone tried to make you sit still you two may have more in common than you look fawn said plaintively can you show me how to go on please ill do anything ill even crack nuts one of her most hated tedious chores back home were a bit between on that one said sarri with a lopsided smile the old falls are rotten and the new ones are too green we leave em for the pigs to clean up just this season in a month now when the elderberries and the fruit trees come on well all be busy cattagus and his winemaking and nuts in plenty rope and baskets now thats for doing i know how to make baskets said fawn eagerly if i had something to make them of when that next batch of rettings done ill be glad for help with the spinning said sarri judiciously good when next week fawn sighed razi and utau were just finishing digging a fire pit in front of their tent and tesy and her brother were being kept usefully busy hauling stones to line it maybe fawn could at least go gather more deadfall for their future fire while her back was turned she noticed a splitwood basket with three fresh plunkins in it had appeared under her awning go along fireeater said mari sounding amused take a rest till dag gets back from the medicine tent go for a swim fawn hesitated in that big lake naked mari and sarri stared at each other where else said sarri its safe to dive off the end of the dock the waters well over your head there this sounded the opposite of safe to fawn mari added dont dive off the sides though or well have to pull your head out of the mud like a plunkin i um fawn swallowed and continued in a much smaller voice dont know how to swim maris brows shot up sarri pursed her lips both of them gazed at fawn as though she were a freak of nature like a twoheaded calf that is even more than most lakewalkers looked at her that way fawn reddened does dag know this demanded sarri ii dont know would being so readily drownable disqualify one from being a lakewalkers spouse when shed said she wanted to be taught how to go on here she hadnt imagined swimming lessons being at the top of anyones list dag said mari in a definite voice needs to know this and added to fawns increasing alarm right away the two bridge island medicine tent was in fact three cabins with its own dock a few hundred paces past patroller headquarters it seemed not very busy this morning dag saw as he neared after dropping the cart at stores only a couple of horses were hitched to the rails out front good no pestilence this week no patrols dragging home too many smashedup comrades as he mounted the porch to the main building he met saun coming out ah one smashedup comrade thenif clearly on the path to recovery the boy looked well standing up straight and moving only a little stiffly although he was looking down and touching his chest gingerly sauns face lit with delight as he glanced up and saw dag which turned to the usual consternation as he took in the sling dag man they said you were missing then there was a crazy rumor going around youd come back with the little farmer girlmarried if you can believe some people his voice trailed off in an oh as he took in the cord wrapping dags left arm just visible below his rolledup sleeve and above his armharness strap we got back yesterday afternoon said dag letting the last remark pass and you last i saw you were bundled up in a wagon heading south from glassforge when i could ride again one of the log hollow fellows brought me up to rendezvous with maris patrol and they brought me home medicine maker says i can go out again when the patrol does if i rest up good the next couple of weeks im still a little ouchy but nothing too bad his stare returned to dags left arm how did youi mean fawn was cute and all and she sure cheered you up butall right there was the malice maybe shedag is your family going to accept this no oh saun fell silent in dismay ifwhatwhere will you go thats to be seen weve set up our tent at maris place for the moment i suppose that makes sense maris bound to defend her ownum saun shook his head looking wary and confused i never heard tell of anything like this well there was a fellow they told me about down at log hollow he got into big trouble a few years back for secretly passing goods and coin along to his farmer lover and her halfblood child or childreni guess it had been going on for some time when they caught up with him he argued the goods were his but the camp council maintained they were the camps and it was theft he wouldnt back down and they banished him dag tilted his head it was no joke dag saun said earnestly they stripped him to his skin before they turned him out in the middle of winter nobody seemed to know what had happened to him after that if he made it back to her oror what he was staring at dag in deep alarm as if picturing his mentor so used was sauns hero worship of dag finally to be called into question dag thought it a good thing if so but not for this reason hardly the same situation saun for one thing its summer in any case ill handle it taking this heavy hintanything lighter would not have penetrated dag thoughtsaun managed an embarrassed laugh yeah i suppose you will after a moment he added in a more chipper tone turning the subject im something in the same line myself well of course not with aim thinking of asking fairbolt for a transfer to log hollow this fall reelasauns voice went suddenly shysaid shed wait for me dag recognized that sappy look hed seen it in his own shaving mirror congratulations nothing is fixed yet you understand saun said hastily some people think im too young to be well thinking about anything permanent but how can you not whenyou know dag nodded sympathetically because either snickering or pity would be a tad hypocritical coming from him just now was i ever that feckless dag was very much afraid the answer was yes possibly even without the rider at his age saun brightened still further well looks like you need the makers more than i did i wont hold you up maybe ill stop by and say hi to fawn later on i expect shed be glad for a familiar face dag allowed shes had a rough welcome im afraid saun gave a short nod and took himself off when in camp saun stayed with a family farther down the shore who had a couple of their own children out on exchange patrol at present dag gathered that the boy away from home for the first time did not lack for mothering dag pushed open the door and made his way into the anteroom the familiar smell of herbssharp musty deep pungentwas strong today and he glanced through the open door to the next room on this side to see two apprentices processing medicines pots bubbled on the fire piles of dried greenery were laid out on the big table in the rooms center and one girl busied herself with a mortar they were making up packets for patrols or to be sold to farmers for coin or trade goods dag didnt doubt that some of what he smelled would end up in that shop at lumpton market at double the price the lakewalkers received for them another apprentice looked up from the table crammed up to the anterooms window where he was writing he smiled at the patroller regarding dags sling with professional interest but before he could speak the door to the other chamber opened and a slight middleaged woman stepped out her summer shift cinched at the waist by a belt holding half a dozen tools of her trade she was rubbing her chest and frowning the medicine maker looked up ah dag ive been expecting you hello hoharie i saw saun coming out just now is he going to be all right yes hes coming along nicely thanks to you he says i understand you did some impressive emergency groundwork on him she eyed dag in speculation but at least she refrained from comment on his marriage cord nothing special in and out for a quick match at a moment he needed it was all her brows twitched but she didnt pursue the point further well come on in lets have a look at this she gestured at his sling how in the world have you managed ive had help dag followed her into her workroom closing the door behind them a tall bed onto which hed helped lift more than one hurt comrade over the years stood out in the rooms center but hoharie gestured him to a chair beside a table taking another around the corner from it he slipped his arm out of its sling and laid it out and she pulled a pair of sharp scissors from her belt and began undoing the wrappings upon inquiry he favored her with a muchshortened tale of how hed come by the injury back in lumpton market she ran her hands up and down the bared forearm and he could feel the press of her ground on his own more invasive than the long probing fingers well this is a clean break and a straight setting she reported doing well for what two weeks nearer three it seemed a lot more than that if not for thatshe nodded at his hookid send you home to heal on your own but youd like these splints off sooner id imagine oh yes she smiled at his heartfelt drawl ive done all the groundwork i can for today on your young friend saun but my apprentice will be pleased to try dag gave this the grimace it deserved she grinned back unrepentantly come dag they have to practice on someone youth to experience experience to youth she tapped his arm cuff hows the stump giving you any trouble no wellno she sat back eyeing him shrewdly in other words yes off with the harness let me see not the stump itself he said but let her unbuckle the harness and lay it aside and run her experienced hands down his arm and over its callused end well its sometimes a little sore but its not bad today ive seen it worse so go on he said cautiously have you ever heard of a missing limb still havingground she rubbed her bony nose phantom limbs yes just like that he said eagerly itching pain sensations ive heard of it its apparently very maddening to have an itch that cant be scratched no not that i knew about that met a man up in luthlia once must be twentyfive years back whod lost most of both feet to frostbite poor fellow used to complain bitterly about the itching and his toes that he didnt have anymore cramping a little groundwork on the nerves of his legs usually cleared it right up i mean the ground of missing limbs if something doesnt exist it cant have a ground i dont know if someone could have an illusion of ground like the illusion of an itch folks have hallucinations about all sorts of bizarre things though so i dont see why not a hallucination shouldnt be able to do real groundwork of course not well mine did i did whats this tale she sat back staring he took a breath and described the incident with the glass bowl in the bluefield parlor leaving out the ruckus that had led up to it and concentrating on the mending itself the most of it was done i swear with the ground of my left hand he thumped his left arm on the table which isnt there i was deathly sick after though and cold all through for an hour she scowled in thought it sounds as though you drew ground from your whole body which would be reasonable why it should take that form to project itself well your theory about your right arm being lost to use forcing a umshe waved her handssome sort of compensation seems like a fair one sounds like a pretty spectacular one i admit has it happened again couple of times dag wasnt about to explain the circumstances but i cant make it happen at will its not even reliably driven by my own tension its just random or so it seems to me can you do it now dag tried concentrating so hard his brow furrowed nothing he shook his head hoharie bit her lip a funny form of ground projection yes maybe ground without matter no dag finally said what he hadnt wanted to say even to himself malices are pure ground ground without matter the medicine maker stared at him youd know more about that than i would ive never seen a malice all a malices material appearance is pure theft they snatch ground itself and matter through its ground to shape at will or misshape i dont know dag she shook her head ill have to think about this one i wish you would imhe cut off the word afraidvery puzzled she nodded shortly and rose to fetch her apprentice from the anteroom introducing him as othan the lad looked thrilled whether at being allowed to do a ground treatment upon the very interesting patroller or simply at being allowed to do one at all dag couldnt quite tell hoharie gave up her seat and stood observing with her arms folded the apprentice sat down and determinedly began tracing his hands up and down dags right arm hoharie he said after a moment i cant get through the patrollers ground veil ease up dag hoharie advised dag had held himself close and tight ever since hed crossed the bridge to the island yesterday he really really didnt want to open himself up here but it was going to be necessary he tried othan shook his head still cant get in the lad was starting to look distressed as though he imagined the failure was his fault he looked up maybe youd better try maam im spent wont be able to do a thing till tomorrow at the earliest ease up dag i cant you are in a mood today she circled the table and frowned at them both the apprentice cringed all right try swapping it around you reach dag that should force you open he nodded and tried to reach into the lads ground the strain of his own distaste for the task warred with his frantic desire now that the opportunity was so provokingly close of getting the blighted splints off for good the apprentice was looking at him with the air of a whipped puppy bewildered but still eager to please he held his arm lightly atop dags face earnest ground open as any gate on impulse dag shifted his stump across and slammed it down beside both their arms something flashed in his groundsense strong and sharp othan cried out and recoiled oh said hoharie a ghost hand said dag grimly a ground hand like that his whole forearm was hot with new ground snatched from the boy his ghost hand so briefly perceptible was gone again he was shaking but if he put his arms out of sight below the table it would only draw more attention to his trembling he forced himself to sit still the apprentice was holding his own right arm to his chest rubbing it and looking wideeyed ow he said simply what was that i meani didnt dodid i do anything sorry im sorry mumbled dag i shouldnt have done that that was new new and disturbing and far too much like malice magic for dags comfort although perhaps there was only one kind of groundwork after all was it theft to take something someone was trying with all his heart to press upon you my arm is cold complained othan butdid it help did i actually do any healing hoharie hoharie ran her hands over both her apprentices arm and dags her frown replaced by an oddly expressionless look yes theres an extremely dense ground reinforcement here othan looked heartened although he was still chafing his own forearm dag wriggled his fingers his arm barely ached i can feel the heat of it hoharie watching them both with equal attention talked her apprentice through a light resplinting of dags arm othan gave the flaking smelly skin a wash first to dags intense gratitude the boys own right arm was decidedly weak he fumbled the wrappings twice and hoharie had to help him tie off the knots is he going to be all right dag asked cautiously nodding at othan in a few days i expect said hoharie that was a much stronger ground reinforcement than i normally let my apprentices attempt othan smiled proudly although his eyes were still a trifle confused hoharie dismissed him with thanks closed the door behind him and slid back into the seat across from dag she eyed him narrowly hoharie said dag plaintively whats happening to me not sure she hesitated have you ever been tested for a maker yes ages ago id no knack nor patience for it but my groundsense range was a mile so they let me go for a patroller which was what id desperately wanted anyway what was that nigh on forty years ago have you been tested lately no interest no point such talents dont change after youthdo they nothing alive is unchanging her eyes had gone silvery with interestor was that covetousness i will say that was no ghost dag that was one of the liveest things ive ever seen could it do shaped reinforcements i wonder did she think of training him as a medicine maker in the sort of subtle groundwork that she herself did dag was taken aback dars the maker in my family so her shrewd look that went with this made him shift uncomfortably i dont control this its more like it works me what you cant remember how wobbly you were when your groundsense first came in some days my apprentices are all over the map some days i still am for that matter fiftyfives a bit old for an apprentice dont you think hoharie herself was younger than dag by a decade he could remember when shed been an apprentice and any roada maker needs two good hands he waved his left by way of a reminder she started to speak but then sat back frowning over this last patrollings what i do always have im good at it a shiver of fear troubled him at the thought of stopping which was odd since hunting malices should be the scariest task there was but he remembered his own words from glassforge none of us could do the job without all of us so all of us are owed makers and patrollers alike all were essential all essential all expendable hoharie shrugged surrender and said in any case come back and see me tomorrow i want to look at that arm again she added after a moment both of them id take it kindly he gestured with his sling do i really still need this splint now yes to remind you not to try anything foolish speaking of experience you patrollers are all alike in some ways give that ground reinforcement some time to work and well see dag nodded rose and let himself out conscious of hoharies curious gaze following him d ag returned from the medicine tent reluctant to speak of the unsettling incident with the makers apprentice but in any case no one asked instead five persons took the chance to tell him that he needed to teach his wife to swim dag thought the idea fine but fawn seemed to find the fact that he still wore splints and a sling to be a great relief to her mind well you certainly cant go swimming with that rig on she said firmly when will you have it off did they say soon she relaxed and he did not clarify that soon could well mean tomorrow sarris little boy having been coaxed earlier into hauling rocks for their fire pit and warmly praised for his efforts by his fathers had crept back to the task toddling across the clearing with stones as big as his little fingers could clutch and flinging them in with great determination it set off a small crisis when his excess offerings were removed his outraged tears were diverted by a treat from fawns dwindling store of farm fare and dag grinning hauled him back to his assorted parents that evening dag and fawn boiled tea water on their first home fire even if supper was cold plunkin again fawn looked as though she was finally beginning to understand all the plunkin jokes they burned the rinds and sat together by the crackling flames watching through the trees as the sunset light faded on the farther shore for all his weary unease dag still found it a pleasure just to look at the play of light and shadow across fawns features the shine and spring of her hair the gleam of her dark eyes he wondered if gazing upon her face through time would be like watching sunsets never quite the same twice yet unfailing in joy as the shadows deepened the tree frogs in the woods piped a raucous descant to the deep croaking of bullfrogs hidden in the rushes at last it was time to wave good night across the campsite at the others turning in and drop the tent flap by the light of a good beeswax candle a gift from sarri they undressed and lay down in their bedroll a few hours in fawns company had soothed dags strained nerves but he must still have looked tense and absent for she ran her hand along his face and said you look tired do youwant to i could grow less tired he kissed her curls away from her face and let his ground ease open a trifle hm hm your ground is very pretty tonight glittery i think your days of fertility are starting up oh she sat up on one elbow am i getting better then yes but he sat halfup as well from what mari said you should be healing up inside at about the same rate as outside ground and flesh are still deepdamaged and will recover slowly from thesehe touched his lips to the carmine dimples in her neckmy guess is your wombs not ready to risk a child yet nor will be for some months no nor is the rest of me really she rolled back and stared up at their hide roof i never thought to have a baby in a tent though i suppose lakewalker ladies do were not prepared for winter or anything really not enoughher hands waved uncertainlythings we travel lighter than farmers i saw the inside of sarris cabin tent she doesnt travel all that light not with children well thats so when all of dar and ombas children were home shifting camp in season was a major undertaking i usually tried to be out on patrol he admitted ruefully fawn sighed in uncertainty and continued its past midsummer time to be making and saving getting ready for the cold and the dark believe me there is a steady stream of plunkins on their way to winter stores in bearsford even as we speak i used to ride that route as a horse boy in the summers before i was old enough to go for patroller though in this season its easier to move the folks to the food than the food to the folks only plunkin the fruit and nuts will be coming on soon a lot of the pigs we eat here one per tent per season so with four tents on this site that makes four pigroasts fish turkey of course and the hunters bring in venison from the woods on the mainland i used to do that as a boy too and sometimes i go out with them between patrols ill show you how stores works tomorrow she glanced up at him catching her lower lip with her white teeth dagwhats our plan here one small hand reached out to trace over his splinted arm what happens to me when you go back out on patrol because mari and razi and utaueveryone i knowwill all be gone then too he hardly needed groundsense to feel the apprehension in her by then i figure youll be better acquainted with sarri and cattagus and maris daughter and her family cattagus is sarris uncle by the wayhes an otter by birth as if you couldnt tell my plan is to lie up quiet get folks used to the idea of you they will in time i figure like they grew used to sarris having two husbands and yetnormally when patrollers went out they could be sure their spouses would be looked after in their absences first by their families then by their patrol comrades then by the whole community it was a trust dag had always taken for granted as solid as rock under his feet it was deeply disturbing to imagine that trust instead cracking like misjudged ice he went on in a casual voice i think i might skip the next patrol going out and take some of my unused camp time plenty to do here sometimes between patrols i help omba train her young horses get them used to a big man up she mostly has a flock of girls for apprentices see fawn looked unconvinced do you suppose dar and your mama will be speaking to you again by then dag shrugged the next move is up to them its plain dar doesnt like this marriage but he detests rows hell let it pass unless hes pressed to act mamahad her warning she has ways of making me crazy and i suppose the reverse is true but shes not stupid and shed be the last person on the lake to invite the camp council to tell her what to do shell keep it in the family all we need do is let time go by and not borrow trouble she eased back in reassurance but there remained a dark streak in her spirit interlaced with the fresh brightness from her recovering body dag suspected the strangeness of it all was beginning to accumulate hed seen homesickness devastate young patrollers far less dislocated than fawn and he resolved to find familiar tasks for her hands tomorrow yes let her be as busy as she was used to being till her balance grew steadier meanwhilehere inside tent bluefieldthe task to hand was surely growing less frantic and more familiar but no less enchanting for all of that back to taking turns he sought her tender lips in a kiss opening his heart to all the intricacy of her ground dark and light together dag vanished for a couple of hours the next morning but returned for lunchplunkin again but he didnt seem to mind then as promised he took fawn to the mysterious stores this proved to be a set of long sheds tucked into the woods down the road past the patroller headquarters inside one they found what appeared to be a woman clerk at any rate she sat at a table scratching in a ledger with a quill surrounded by shelves crammed with more ledgers a toddler lay asleep in a sort of wooden pen next to her more sets of shelves ceilinghigh marched back in rows the length of the building the dim air smelled of leather and herbs and lessidentifiable things while fawn walked up and down the rows of shelves staring at the goods with which they were crammed dag engaged the woman in a lowvoiced consultation which involved dragging out several more ledgers and marking off and initialing lists therein at one point dag said you still have those in a voice of surprise laughed and dipped the quill to mark some more his splints fawn noticed hardly seemed to slow him down today and he was constantly taking his arm out of the sling dag then led fawn up and down the rows and had her help him collect furs and other leather goods according to some scheme of his own a half dozen beautiful dark brown pelts looking like the coats of some extraordinary ferretshaped creature he explained as coming from mink small woodland predators from north of the dead lake an exquisite white pelt soft as whipped cream was from a winter fox but it was like no fox fur fawn had ever seen or touched these he said could be bridegifts for mama and aunt nattie and fawn had to agree they were marvelously better than the local hides theyd rejected back at lumpton market every patrol usually brings back something dag explained it varies with where theyve been and what opportunities theyve found whatever part of his or her share a patroller doesnt want or cant use is turned over to stores and the patroller gets a credit for them either to draw the equivalent item out later or trade for something of use excess accumulations are taken down to farmer country to trade for other things we need after all my years of patrolling i have a long credit at stores you be thinking about what you want spark and chances are we can find something like cooking ware she said hopefully next building over he promised one at a time he pulled three more folded hides from dusty back shelves and fawn staggered under the weight of each as they took them to the clerks table to be signed out he also after judicious study selected a sturdy packsaddle in good condition from a rack of such horse gear they hauled it all out through the double doors onto the end porch dag prodded the three big bundles with his toe now these he said are actually my own bit surprised to still find them here two were sent down from luthlia after i came home and the other i picked up about three years back during a winter season i spent patrolling in the far south this one i figure for your papa go ahead and unroll it fawn picked apart the stiff dry rawhide cords and unfolded what appeared to be an enormous wolf skin my word dag this thing must have been as big as a horse very nearly she frowned you cant tell me that was a natural beast no mud wolf the very one they found me under at wolf ridge im told my surviving tentbrothersyoud say brothersinlawskinned and tanned it for me never had the heart to tell them i didnt want it i put it in stores thinking someone would take it off but there its sat ever since she wondered if this same beast had savaged his left hand it would make a rug for our whole parlor back in west blue but it would be rather horrible knowing how you came by it i admit ive no desire to look at it depending on how your papa feels about me by now he might wish it hadnt stopped gnawing on me so soon but on the whole i think i wont explain its history the other two are worth a look as well fawn unfolded the second big pelt and recoiled heavy black leather in a shape altogether too human was scantily covered with long ratty gray hair the mask of the thing which had a manlike look still had the fanged jaw attached another mud wolf different version fast and vicious and they moved like shadows in the dark that one for reed and rush i think said dag dag thats evil fawn thought it through good choice dag chuckled give them something to wonder about i figure itll give them nightmares i should imagine or was that i hope did you kill it and for pitys sake how dag squinted at the mummified horror probably if not that one plenty like it fawn refolded and bound up both old hides and undid the third it was thinner and more supple and hairless she unrolled and kept unrolling her brows rising in astonishment until fully nine feet ofof whatever it was lay out on the porch floor the fine leather had a beautiful pattern almost like snakeskin magnified and gleamed smoothly under her hand bronze green shading to rich redbrown for all that the animal was as long as a horse it seemed to have had short stubby legs wicked black claws still dangled from their ends the jaws of this one too had been set back in place after tanning and were frankly unbelievable like a stretchedout bear trap made of teeth what kind of malice made that and what poor creature was it made from not a mudman at all its an alligatora southern swamp lizard a real natural animal we think unless one of our ancestormages got really drunk malices do not thank all the absent gods emerge too often so far south of the dead lake but what happens when they do get hold of these fellows is scarcely to be imagined the southern wetlands are one of the places you want to do your patrolling in winter because cold makes the alligators and the alligatormen sluggish that one we just caught on an ordinary hunting and trapping run though ordinary it looks as if it could eat a man in two bites theyre a danger along the shores of the channels they lie in the water like logs but they can move fast when they want they clamp onto their prey and drag it down into the water to drown and rip it up later after it rots a bit he bent and ran his fingers along the shiny hide i should think your papa and whit could both get a pair of boots out of this one and belts and something for your mama as well dag said fawn curiously have you ever seen the sea oh yeah couple of times the south shore that is around the mouth of the gray river ive not seen the eastern sea whats it like he sat back squatting fingers still caressing the swamplizard skin and a meditative look came over his face first time was almost thirty years ago never forget it west of the gray between the river and the levels the land is flat and mostly treeless all mounted patrols in that widesky country our company commander had us all spread out half a mile or more apart in one long linethat sweep must have been fifty miles across we rode straight south day after day spring it was the air all soft and blue and new green coming up all around and flowers everywhere best patrolling i ever did in my life we even found one sessile and did for it without hardly pausing the rest was just riding along in the sunshine dangling our feet out of the stirrups scanning the ground just barely keeping touch with the patrollers to the right and left end of the week the color of the sky changed got all silvery and light and we came up over these sand dunes and there it was his voice trailed off he swallowed the rollers were foaming in over the sand grumbling and grumbling never stopping i never knew there were so many shades of blue and gray and green the sea was as wide and flat as the levels but alive you could feel with your groundsense how alive it was as if it was the mother of the whole wide green world i sat and staredwe all dismounted and took off our boots and got silly for a while running in and out of that salty water warm as milk and then what happened fawn asked almost holding her breath dag shrugged camped for the night on the beach turned the line around and shifted it fifty miles and rode back north it turned cold and rained on the way back though and we found nothing for our pains he added after a moment wood washed up on the beach burns with the most beautiful strange colors never saw anything like his words were simple and plain as his words usually were fawn scarcely knew why she felt as though she were eavesdropping on a man at prayers or why water blurred her eyes dag she said whats beyond the sea his brows twitched up no ones sure could there be other lands oh that yes or there were once the oldest maps show other continents three of them the original charts are long gone so its anyones guess how accurate the copies are but if any ships have gone to see whats still there they havent come back that i ever heard people have different theories some say the gods have interdicted us and that anyone who ventures out too far is destroyed by holy curses some guess the other lands got blighted and are now all dead from shore to shore and no ones there anymore im not too fond of that picture but youd think if there were other folks across the seas and they had ships some might have got blown off course sometime in the last thousand years and ive never heard tell of any such maybe the people over there have interdicted us till our task is done and alls safe again that would be sensible he paused gazing into some time or distance fawn could not see and continued legend has it there is or once was another enclave of survivors on our continent to the west of the levels and the great mountains that were supposed to be beyond them maybe well find out if thats true someday if anyone us or them ever tries to sail all around the shore of this land wouldnt need such grand ships for hugging the coast with silver sails fawn put in he smiled i think thats got to happen sometime dont know if ill live to see it if if if we can keep the malices down long enough for folks to get ahead the river men are bold enough to try but it would risk a lot of resources as well as lives youd need a rich man a prince or a great lord to fund such a voyage and theyre extinct or a bunch of welloff men fawn suggested or a whole big bunch of quite ordinary men and one fasttalking lunatic to coax the money out of their pockets well maybe he smiled thoughtfully considering this vision but then shook his head and rose fawn carefully rerolled the astonishing swamplizard skin dag went back inside to cadge paper ink and quills from the clerk then they both sat at the nearest trestle table in the dappled shade to write their letters to west blue fawn didnt miss west blueshed longed to get away and she hadnt changed her mind on thatbut she couldnt say her feet were planted in their new soil yet given the way lakewalkers kept moving around maybe home would never be a place it would be dag she watched him across the table scribbling with his quill clutched in his right fingers and holding down the paper lifting in the warm breeze with his hook she bent her head to her own task dear mama papa and aunt nattie we got here day before yesterday had it only been two days i am fine the lake is very she brushed the quill over her chin and decided she really ought to say more than wet she wrote large instead we met up with dags aunt mari again she has a nicefawn scratched out the start of cabin and wrote tent dags arm is getting better and onward in that vein till shed filled half the page with unexceptionable remarks too much blank space left she decided to describe sarris children and their campsite which filled the rest with enough cheery word pictures to grow cramped toward the end there so much left out patroller headquarters and fairbolt crows pegboard dar the unnerving bone shack dags angry mama the futility of the sharing knife after all this journey dags dark nervy mood the threat of swimming lessons naked swimming lessons at that some things were best left out dag finishing handed his letter across for her to read it was very polite and plain almost like an inventory making clear which gifts were for which family members both horses and the packsaddle were to be mamas as well as some of the fine furs the mudman skin for the twins was blandly described entirely without comment fawn grinned as she pictured the three alarming hides being unpacked at west blue dag stepped inside and returned the quills and ink to the clerk coming out with the letters folded and sealed just in time to greet a girl who rode up bareback on a tall elegant dappled gray mare a dark foal about four months old pranced after flicking his fuzzy ears he had the most beautifully shaped head and deepest liquid eyes fawn had ever seen on a colt and she spent the time while dag and the girl organized the packsaddle trying to make up to him he flirted with her in turn yielding at last to ear scratching just there fawn couldnt imagine her mother riding that mare nor any of her family maybe the dappled beauty could be broken to harness and pull the light cart to the village though that would turn a few heads a man dressed as a patroller came riding from the direction of the headquarters building he turned out to be a courier on his way south apparently a trusted comrade exactly what old favor dag was calling in was not clear to fawn but however dubiously he greeted the farmer bride or raised his brows at dag he had undertaken to deliver the bridegifts he stopped with them long enough to get a clear description of the bluefield farm and how to find it and then he was off with the silvery mare following meekly on a lead and the colt capering and scampering the horse girl trudging back to mare island looked after them with a downright heartbroken expression dag then led fawn off to the next storehouse where they found some lightly used cooking gearnot a proper kitchens worth but at least a few things to permit more elaborate meals over an open fire than sliced raw plunkin and tea and to fawns joy several pounds of cotton from south of the grace river cleaned and combed an equally generous bag of washed wool and three hanks of good flax the tools aunt nattie had given fawn for a wedding present would find their proper use despite her burdens her steps were lighter turning back toward their campsite and she made plans for getting dag to hold still long enough to measure his gnarly feet for socks the following day dag returned from the medicine tent with no sling or splints but with a smile on his face that would hardly go away he flexed and stretched his hand gratefully he reported hed been instructed to take it easy for another week which he interpreted liberally as no weapons practice yet everything else he embraced immediately including fawn to her muffled alarm the next thing he did that afternoon was make her put down her spindle and go with him for her first swimming lesson she was distracted from her fear of the water only by her embarrassment at their lack of clothes but somehow dag made both better they picked their way past the bending cattails into water to his waist and her chest at least the lakes murkiness gave them a more decent cloak its greenygold translucence turning opaque just a short way down the top foot of the water was as warm in the sun as a bath beneath that it grew cooler the soft mud squelched between fawns curling toes they were accompanied by a dizzy escort of water bugs flocks of little black ovals that whirled merrily like beads on a string and agile water striders their thin legs making dimples in the brown surface as they skated along dag promptly made the beadshaped bugs an example to fawn inviting her to spin them down in little whirlpools with her hands and watch them bob right back to the surface dag insisted she was naturally more buoyant than he taking the opportunity to pat her most buoyant parts fawn thought his assertion that it doesnt matter how deep the water is spark youre only going to use the top two feet overly optimistic but under the influence of his confidence and unfailing good cheer she gradually began to relax in the water by the second day to her own astonishment she floated for the first time in her life on the third afternoon she achieved a dog paddle of several yards even dag had to admit that the lakes muddiness made hickory lake residents all tend to smell a bit green by the end of the summersooner than that fawn did not say aloudbut sarri took fawn into the woods and showed her where a clear spring ran that not only allowed her to give lakescrubbed clothes a final rinse but also to draw water that didnt need to be boiled before drinking fawn managed her first laundry day and sniffed their clothes drying on a line strung between two trees with satisfaction at a job well done that afternoon dag came in with a small turkey to pluck fawn happily started a bag to save feathers looking ahead to pillows and ticks they roasted the bird over their fire and invited mari and cattagus to help eat it up fawn ended the evening casting on her first cotton yarn to her doubleended needle set for dags socks and feeling that this place might become home after all two days later instead of a swimming lesson dag took her out in one of the narrow boats he had a specially shaped hook for his wrist cuff that allowed him to manage his paddle fawn after a brief lesson on the dock was placed in the front with a paddle of her own she felt nervous and clumsy at first looking over all that expanse of water with dag out of sight behind her but she soon fell into the rhythm of the task around behind walnut island winking water gave way to a surface that was downright glassy and fawn relaxed still more they paused to admire a dead tree reflected in the water its bare white branches startling against the green of the woods it was a roosting place for broadwinged hawks a few circling gracefully overhead or perching on the branches and fawn smiled to remember the day theyd been startled by that big redtail near glassforge any larger predators fawn had gathered were kept off the islands by lakewalker magic up the back channel the air grew still and hot and the water clear huge elderberry bushes leaned over the banks their branches heavy with thick clusters of green fruit slowly acquiring a promising rosy blush in another month the berries would be black and ripe and fawn could easily see how a boy might gather them from a boat like this one a shiny sunfish jumped right into their boat at dags feet dag laughing at fawns startled squeal scooped the flopping creature gently back into the water and denied that he had enticed it by lakewalker persuasion much too small spark rounding a tangle of wrack and cattails where redwinged blackbirds traded barking chirps and hoarse whistles they came at last upon a broad open space crowded with flat lily pads their white flowers wide to the sun thin iridescent blue dragonflies and thicker scarlet ones stitched the air above the marsh and rows of turtles sunned themselves on logs yellowstriped necks stretched out brown backs gleaming like polished stones a blue heron stalked slowly along the farther shore it froze briefly then darted its long yellow beak into the water a silvery minnow flashed as the heron twisted its neck around gulped then stood folded for a moment looking smug fawn hardly knew whether it made her happier to watch the flowers or the contented look on dags face dag sighed in satisfaction but then frowned i thought this was the same place but it seems smaller this water is a lot shallower too i remember it as being well over my head did i take a wrong turn somewhere it looks plenty deep to me umhow old were you again first time you found this place eight and how tall dag began to open his mouth then grinned sheepishly shorter than you spark well then well indeed he laid his paddle across his lap and just gazed around the water lilies though beautiful were the same common variety fawn had sometimes seen in quiet backwaters around west blue she decided she had seen cattails dragonflies turtles blackbirds and herons before there was nothing new here and yetthis place is magical the silence in the warm moist air broken only by the little noises of the marsh seemed holy in her ears as if she were hearing a sound beneath all sound this is what having groundsense must be like all the time the thought awed her they sat quietly in the narrow boat beyond all need of words until the heat of the sun began to grow uncomfortable with a sigh dag took up his paddle once more and turned them around his stroke left a glossy whirlpool spiraling down into the clear water and fawns eye followed it this is where his heart is anchored i can see why they had almost rounded the corner into the main arm of the lake when dag paused again fawn twisted around he held his finger to his lips and grinned at her his eyes halflidded he sat there with an absentminded sleepy look on his face that didnt reassure her a bit so she didnt quite fall out of the boat when a sudden splash and movement resolved into a huge black bass twisting in the air and trailing sparkling drops it fell into the bottom of the narrow boat with a resounding thud flopped and flapped like mad then at last lay still bright gills flexing theres a better size for dinner said dag in satisfaction and thrust his paddle into the water once more now thats persuasion is that how you folks fish all the time asked fawn in amazement i wondered why i didnt see any poles or lines lying around something like that actually we usually use handnets you ever see old cattagus lying on the dock looking as if hes dozing with one hand trailing over the side thats what hes likely doing it seems almost like cheating why are there any fish left in this lake well not everyone has the knack as they pulled into the dock sunburned and happy fawn made plans for begging some herbs from sarris garden and grilling dags catch worthily she managed to clamber onto the weathered gray planks from the wobbly boat without taking an inadvertent swimming lesson and let dag hand her up his prize before he tied off the boats lines clutching the bass she turned her face up to dag for a quick kiss and hug and they climbed the stone steps up the steep bank his arm around her waist gave her an abrupt squeeze then fell away she looked up to follow his glance dar waited in the shade at the top of the bank frowning like a bit of rainy dark detached from winter and walking around as they crested the rise he said to dag i need to talk to you do you why dag inquired but he gestured toward their tent and the log seats around their fire pit alone if you please dar said stiffly mm said dag without enthusiasm but he gave his brother a short nod he saw fawn back to the tent and left her to deal with the fish fawn watched uneasily as the pair strolled away out of the campsite and turned onto the road leaning a little away from each other t hey turned left onto the shady road between the shore campsites and the woods dag was tired enough not to need to shorten his steps to match his brothers and not yet annoyed enough to lengthen them to his full patrollers stride and make dar hurry to keep up on the whole he wouldnt bet on that remaining the case what is he about it didnt take groundsense to see that although dar had come to dag conciliation and apology were not strong in his mood and so dag prodded although it would have been better tactics to wait dar out make him start this isnt supposed to be a war youre the talk of the lake you know dar said curtly talk passes there will be some other novelty along soon enough dag set his jaw to keep himself from asking what are they saying he was glumly sure dar was about to tell him anyway its a pretty unsavory match not only is that girl you dragged home a farmer shes scarcely more than an infant dag shrugged in some ways fawns a child in others not in grief and guilt shes fully grown and i am surely qualified to judge in knowing how to go on id call her an apprentice adult basic tasks arent yet routine for her but when all that energy and attention get freed up at last watch out shes ferociously bright and learns fast main thing about the age difference i reckon is that it hands me a special burden not to betray her trust his eyebrows pinched except that the same is true of anyone at any age so maybe its not so special after all betrayal youve shamed our tent mamas become a laughingstock to the ill willed over this and she hates it you know how she values her dignity dag tilted his head huh well im sorry to hear it but i suspect she brought that on herself im afraid what she calls dignity others see as conceit on the other hand perhaps it was the accident of cumbias having so few children that made her insist on their particular value to hold her head up against women friends who could parade a more numerous get although it was plain fact that dars skills were rare and extraordinary remembering to placate dag added some of it is pride in you to be fair it could have been in you too if youd bestirred yourself dar grumbled still just a patroller after forty years you should have been a commander by now anything that mama and mari agree on must be true or the skys like to fall dag gritted his teeth and did not reply his familys ambition had been a plague to him since hed returned from luthlia and recovered enough to begin patrolling again his own fault perhaps for letting them learn hed turned down patrol leadership despite or perhaps because of the broad hint that it could soon lead to wider duties repeatedly till fairbolt had stopped asking or had that leaked out through massape reflecting her husbands plaints at this range he could no longer remember dars lips compressed then he said its been suggestedi wont say who bythat if we just wait a year the problem will solve itself the farmer girls too small to birth a lakewalker child and will die trying have you realized that dag flinched fawns mama is short too and she did just fine but her papa wasnt a big man either he fought the shiver that ran through him by the reflection that the size of the infant and the size of the grown person had little relation cattagus and maris eldest son who was a bear of a fellow now was famous in the family for having been born little and sickly thats more or less what i saiddont count on it farmers are fecund but have you even thought it through dag if a child or children survived let alone their mother whats the fate of halfbloods here they couldnt make they couldnt patrol all they could do would be eat and breed theyd be despised dags jaw set there are plenty of other necessary jobs to do in camp as i recall being told more than once ten folks in camp keep one patroller in the field fairbolt says they could be among that ten or do you secretly despise everyone else here and i never knew dar batted this dart away with a swipe of his hand so youre saying your children could grow up to be servants of mine and youd be content with that we would find our way we dar scowled so already you put your farmer get ahead of the needs of the whole if that happens it wont be by my choosing would dar hear the warning in that dag continued we actually dont know that all crossbloods lack groundsense if anything the opposite ive met a couple who have little less than some of us ive been out in the world a good bit more than you ive seen raw talent here and there amongst farmers too and i dont think its just the result of some passing lakewalker in a prior generation leaving a present dag frowned by rights we should be sifting the farmers for hidden groundsense just like the mages of old must have done and while were diverting ourselves in that who fights the malices dar shot back nearly good enough to patrol isnt going to do the job we need the concentration of bloodlines to reach the threshold of function were stretched to the breaking point and everyone knows it let me tell you its not just mama who is maddened to see you wasting the talent in your blood dag grimaced yeah ive heard that song from aunt mari too he remembered his own reply and yet i might have been killed anytime these past four decades and my blood would have been no less wasted pretend im dead if itll make you feel better dar snorted declining to rise to that bait they had reached the point where the road from the bridge split to cut through the woods to the islands north shore at dars gesture they turned onto it the earth was dappled goldengreen in the late sun leaf shadows barely flickering in the breathing summer air their pacing sandals kicked up little spurts of dirt in the stretches between drying puddles dar gathered himself and continued its not just your own family you put to shame this stunt of yours creates disruption and a bad example in the patrol as well youve a reputation there i dont deny youngsters like saun look up to you how much harder will this make it for patrol leaders to prevent the next illfated farmer romance i swear youre thinking only of yourself yes said dag and added meditatively its a new experience a slow smile turned his lips i kind of like it dont make stupid jokes snapped dar i wasnt absent gods help me in fact it grew less funny the longer he thought about it dag took a long breath what are you after dar i married fawn for truemind body and ground that isnt going to change sooner or later youll have to deal with it dealing with it is just what im trying to avoid dars scowl deepened the camp council could force a change theyve ruled on stringcuttings before only when the couple was divided and their families couldnt negotiate an agreement no one can force a stringcutting against the will of both partners and no one of sense would tolerate the precedent if the council tried it would put everyones marriage at riskit would fly against the whole meaning of stringbinding dars voice hardened then youll just have to be forced to will it eh dag let ten steps pass in silence before he replied im stubborn my wife is determined youll break your knife on that rock dar have you grasped what you risk shunningbanishment no more patrolling ive a lot of patrol years left in me were stretched you sayand yet youd throw those years away into a ditch for mere conceit im trying for exactly the reverse dar swiped an angry hand across his brow youre the one who seems to be galloping blindly for the ditch not by my will nor fairbolts hell stand up for me actually fairbolt had said only that he didnt care to defend this before the camp councilnot whether he would overcome his understandable distaste if he had to but dag was disinclined to confide his doubts to dar at this point what scoffed dar with all the trouble this will make for patrol discipline think again had dar and fairbolt been talking dag began to be sorry he had held himself aloof from camp gossip these past days even though it had seemed wiser not to present his head for drumming on or let himself be drawn into arguments he countered fawns a special case anyway shes not just any farmer shes the farmer girl who slew a malice as contrasted with for example your malice count what was it again oh yesnone dars lips thinned in an unfelt smile if you like brother or maybe the count is every malice that any knife of my making slew without a sharing knife no patroller is a malice killer youre just malice food walking around dag drew breath through his nostrils and tried to get a better grip on his temper true and without hands to wield them your knives are justwhat did you call them wall decorations i think we need to cry truce on this one dar nodded shortly they paced beside each other for a time when he could trust himself to speak again dag went on without fawns hand i would be dead now and maybe a good part of my patrol with me and youd have spent the past weeks having memorial rites and making tender speeches about what a fine fellow i was dar sighed almost better that would be simpler at least i appreciate that almost almost dag gathered his wits or attempted to in any case your bird wont fly fairbolts made it clear hell tolerate this for the sake of need and wont take it to the council and neither will mama get used to us dar he let his voice soften to persuasion almost plea fawn is her own sort of worthy youd see it if youd let yourself look at her straight give her a chance and you wont be sorry youre besotted dag shrugged and the sun rises in the east youre not going to change either fact give up the gloom and set your mind to some more open view aunt mari was a feckless fool to let this get by she made all the same arguments that you just did rather better phrased but dar had never been a diplomat dar let it ride itll work out in time folks will get used to it fawn and i may always be an oddity but we wont start a stampede any more than sarri did with her two husbands hickory lake will survive us life will go on dar inhaled staring straight ahead i will go to the camp council dag covered the chill in his belly with a slow blink will you now what will mama say i thought you hated rows i do but its come down to me someone has to act mama cries you know it has to be done and it has to be done soon dar grimaced omba says if we wait till you get your farmer girl pregnant youll never be shifted shes right said dag far more coolly than he felt dar bore the look of a man determined to do his duty however repugnant yes dar would stiffen cumbia even against her better judgment did both imagine dag would cave in to these threatsor did they both realize he wouldnt or was it one of each so said dag im a sacrifice youre willing to make am i is mama so willing mama knowswe all knowyour passion for patrolling how hard you fought to get back in after you lost your hand is dipping your wick in this farmer girl worth casting away your whole life dar was remembering the brother from eighteen years back dag thought agonized exhausted seeking only to deal death in turn to that which had made him the walking corpse hed felt himself to be and then with luck to be reunited in death with all that hed lost because no other course seemed possible or even imaginable something strange and new had happened to that dag in the malice cave near glassforge orsomething that had been happening below the surface had finally been brought to light im not who you think i am anymore dar you look at me yet dont see me dar seemed curiously like fawns kin in that way so who am i for the first time in a long time dag wasnt sure he knew the answer and that was a lot more disturbing than dars old assumptions dar misinterpreted dags uneasy look yeah thats got you thinking about time im not going to back off on this this is your warning dag touched the cord below his rolledup left sleeve neither am i thats yours they both maintained a stony silence as they reached the shore road again and turned right dar managed a nod when he turned off at the redwing campsite but he spoke no word of farewell of further meetings or of any other indication of his intent dag fuming returned an equally silent nod and walked on on the mere physical level dag thought he need have no fear for either fawn or himself it wasnt dars style to gather a bunch of hotheads like sunny and his friends to deliver violent rebuke a formal charge before the camp council was precisely what dar would do no question there his was no idle threat dag felt a curious blankness within himself at the thought in a way like the familiar empty moment before falling into attack on a malice lair he considered the current makeup of the camp council there were normally a representative and an alternate from each island chosen yearly by rotation from the heads of the various clans and other elders plus the camp captain as a permanent member on behalf of the patrol and its needs cumbia had been on the council herself once and dags grandfather before hed grown too fragile had been an alternate twice dag had scarcely paid attention to who was in the barrel on council this year or to tell the truth any other year and suddenly it mattered the council resolved most conflicts by open discussion and binding mediation only in matters involving banishment or a death sentence did they make their votes secret and then the quorum was not the usual five but the full seven there had only been two murders in hickory lake camp in dags lifetime and the council had settled the more ambiguous by ordering a payment between the families only one had led to an execution dag had never yet witnessed a banishment like the one at log hollow that saun had gossiped about dag couldnt help feeling that there must have been a more unholy mess backing up behind that incident than sauns short description suggested like mine maybe not dag had deliberately steered clear of camp gossip in the past days if only to avoid the aggravation keeping to himself with fawnand healing dont forget thatbut in any case he doubted very many of his friends would repeat the most critical remarks to his face he could think of only one man he could trust to do so without bias in either direction he made plans to seek fairbolt after supper fawn glanced up from the perfect coals in the fire pit to see dag stride back into the clearing his scowl black she had never seen so much quiet joy in dag as this afternoon out in the lily marsh and she set her teeth in a moment of fury for whatever his brother had done to wreck his happiness she also bade silent goodbye to her hope however faint that dar had come as a family peacemaker dismissing the little fantasy she had started to build up about maybe a dinner invitation from dags mama and what fawn could bring and how she could act to show her worth to that branch of the redwings at her eyebrows raised in question dag shook his head adding an unfelt smile to show his scowl was not for her he sat on the ground picked up a stick and dug it into the dirt his face drawn in thought so what did dar want fawn asked is he coming around to us she busied herself with the bass gutted cleaned stuffed with herbs begged from sarris garden and ready to grill it sizzled gently as she laid it on the rack above her coals and she stirred the pot of mashed plunkin with onions shed fixed to go with dag looked up at the enticing smells pretty soon his eyes growing less pinched although he was still a long time answering not yet anyway dag said at last fawn pursed her lips if theres some trouble dont you think i need to know yes he sighed but i need to talk to fairbolt first then i can say more certainly say what sounds a little ominous maybe not spark attracted by his supper he got up and sat again by her giving her neck a distracting nuzzle as she tried to turn the fish she smiled back to show willing but thought maybe so dag if something wasnt a problem he usually said so with direct vigor if it was a problem with a solution hed cheerfully explain it at whatever length necessary this sort of silence she had gradually learned betokened unusual uncertainty her vague conviction that dag knew everything about everythingwell possibly not about farmsdid not stand up to sober reflection as shed hoped feeding him did brighten him up considerably his mood lightened still further to a genuine grin when she came out from their tent after supper with her hands behind her back and then with a flourish presented his new cotton socks you finished them already i used to have to help make socks for my brothers i got fast try them under your boots she said eagerly see if they help he did so at once walking experimentally around the dying fire looking pleased if a little mismatched in the boots with the truncated trousers that lakewalker men seemed to wear here in hot weather when they werent called on to ride these should be better in summer than those awful lumpy old wool things you were wearingmore darns than yarn i swear theyll keep your feet dryer help those calluses so fine such little smooth stitches ill bet my feet wont bleed with these your feet bleed she said appalled eew not often just in the worst of summer or the worst of winter ill spin up some of that wool for winter later but i thought you could use these first indeed he sat again and removed his boots drawing the socks off carefully and kissed her hands in thanks fawn glowed im going to help sarri start to spin her plunkin stem flax tomorrow now the rettings all done she said these women need a wheel to speed things up they really do surely a little one wouldnt be so hard to cart back and forth and we could all share it around the camp i could teach them how to use it give something back for all the help sarri and mari have been giving me do you think you could bring one back next time you patrol around lumpton or glassforgeor west blue for that matter mama and nattie could make sure you got a good one she added in a burst of prudence i could sure try spark and won her heart anew by not protesting a bit about the sight he would present hauling such an unwieldy object atop copperhead she drew him into a promissory sort of cuddle for a time but at length he recalled whatever dar had brought to trouble him and stood up with a sigh will you be gone long she asked depends on where fairbolts got off to she nodded struggling to be content with the vague answer and what all it left out the dark mood seemed to settle over his shoulders again like a cloak as he strode out to the road and vanished beyond the trees dag tracked fairbolt down at last at the end of a string of several campsites devoted to the extensive crow clan on the western side of the island fairbolt took one look at his face and led him away from the noisy group of tents crowded with his and massapes children and grandchildren and down to the dock they sat crosslegged on the boards fairbolts leathery skin was turned to bloodcopper by the sunset light which painted the silky wavelets lapping the shore purple and gleaming orange his eyes were dark and unrevealing dag drummed his fingers on the wood and began i spoke with dar a bit ago or rather he spoke to me hes threatening to go to the camp council what he thinks they can do i cant imagine they cant force a stringcutting he faltered he speaks of banishment fairbolt scarcely reacted dag continued youre on the council has he talked to you yes some i told him that was a bad plan though i suppose there could be worse ones dag braced himself what are folks saying behind my back fairbolt hesitated whether embarrassed to repeat the gossip or just organizing his speech dag wasnt sure perhaps the latter for when he did begin it was blunt enough massape says some are cruelly amused to see cumbias pride crack idle talk said dag maybe id discount that whole line except the more they make your mother squirm the more she leans on dar ah and are there other lines naming no names several fairbolt shrugged in a whatwouldyou gesture you want a list naming no names yes well no butyes fairbolt drew breath to start anyone whos ever been part of a patrol that came to grief relying on farmer aid or who endured ingratitude rescuing farmers whose panic resulted in unnecessary patroller injuries or deaths dag tilted his head halfconceding halfresisting farmers are untrained the answer is to train them not to scorn them fairbolt passed on this with a quirk of his lips and continued ticking off his fingers anyone who has ever had a relative or friend harassed or ambushed and beaten or killed by farmers over misguided fears about lakewalker sorcery if we kept less to ourselves there wouldnt be such misunderstandings folks would know better fairbolt ignored this too more closely still any patroller or expatroller who has ever been made to give up a farmer lover themselves some pretty bitter anger there a few wish you well but more wonder how youre getting away with it those who have had the ugly job of enforcing the rules arent best pleased with you either these people have made real sacrifices and feel justifiably betrayed dag rubbed his fingers gently back and forth along the wood grain polished smooth by the passage of many feet fawn slew a malice she shared a death shesdifferent i know you think so thing is everyone thinks their own situation was special too which it was to them if the rules arent for everyone a system for finishing arguments turns into a morass of argument that never ends and we dont have the time dag looked away from fairbolts stern gaze and into the orange disk of the sun now being gnawed by the blacksilhouetted trees across the lake i dont know what dar imagines he can make me do i made an oath in my ground aye said fairbolt dryly in conflict with your prior duty and known responsibilities you sure did i swear you look like a man trying to stuntride two horses standing with one foot on the back of each fine if he can keep em together but if they gallop up two separate paths he has to choose fall or be torn apart i meantmeanto keep my duties yoked if i can and if you cant where will you fall dag shook his head fairbolt frowned at the shimmering water gone luminous in the twilight to match the sky a few last swallows swooped and wheeled then made away for their nests the rules issue cuts another way if its seen that even so notable a patroller as dag redwing cant evade discipline it makes it that much easier to block the next besotted idiot am i notable fairbolt cast him a peculiar look yes dag bluefield dag corrected belatedly mm dag sighed and shifted to another tack you know the council will they cooperate with dar how much has he put to them privately already was his talk today a first probing threat or my final chance fairbolt shrugged i know hes been talking to folks how fast would you think hell move dag shook his head once more he hates disputes hates getting his knifework interrupted it takes all his concentration i know by choice i dont think hed involve himself at all but if he has to hell try to get it all over with as quickly as possible so he can get back to work hell be furiousnot so much with me but about that hell push i read him that way as well has he spoken to you fairbolt dont let me get blindsided here this won another fishy look and would you have me repeat my confidential talks with you to him um dag trusted the fading light concealed his flush he leaned his back which was beginning to ache against a dock post another question then is anyone but dar like to try to bring this to a head formally with the council i can think of a few theyll leave it to your family if they can but if the redwing clan fails in its task they might be moved to step forward so even if i smooth down dar it wont be over another challenge and another will pop up like malices fairbolt raised his eyebrows at this comparison but said nothing dag continued slowly that suggests the road to go down is to settle it publicly and soon once the council has ruled the same charge cant be brought again stop em all one way or another he grimaced in distaste you and your brother are more alike than you seem said fairbolt turning wry dar doesnt think so dag said shortly he added after a thoughtful pause he hasnt been out in the world as much as i have i wonder if banishment seems a more frightening fate to him fairbolt rubbed his lips hows the arm much better dag flexed his hand splints have been off near a week hoharie says i can start weapons practice again fairbolt leaned back im planning to send maris patrol back out soon a lot of time lost at glassforge to make up plus her patrol isnt the only one thats run late this season when will you be ready to ride again dag shifted unfolding his legs to disguise his unease actually i was thinking of taking some of my unused camp time till fawns more settled in so when will that be leaving aside the matter of the council dag shrugged for her part alone not long i dont think theres a camp task she cant do if shes properly taught i have no doubt in her his hesitation this time stretched out uncomfortably i have doubt in us oh he said quietly betrayal cuts two ways as well fairbolt sure when you go out on patrol you worry for your family in campsickness the accidents of daily life maybe even a malice attacktheres a residue of danger but not notuntrust but once you start to wonder it spreads like a stain who can i trust to stand by my wife in her need and who will fold and leave her to take the brunt alone my mother my brother clearly not cattagus sarri cattagus is weak and ill and sarri has her own troubles you he stared hard at fairbolt to fairbolts credit he did not drop his gaze i suppose the only way youll find out is to test it yeah but it wont exactly be a test of fawn now will it youll have to sooner or later unless you mean to quit the patrol the look that went with this remark reminded dag of hoharies surgical knives dag sighed theres soon and theres too soon you can cripple a young horse which would have done fine with another year to let its bones grow into themselves by loading it too soon young patrollers too and young wives fairbolt after a long pause gave a nod at this so when is nottoosoon dag i need to know where i can put your peg and when you do dag conceded can you give me a bit more time to answer because i dont think i can leave the council aside fairbolt nodded again mind i can only answer for myself and fawn i dont control the acts of anyone else you can persuade said fairbolt you can shape you can dare i suggest not be a stubborn fool too late for that this man dag was reminded had six hundred other patrollers to track enough for tonight the frogs were starting their serenade the mosquitoes were out in companies and the fat doublewinged dragonflies darting over the lake were giving way to the night patrol of flitting bats he levered himself to his feet bade fairbolt a polite good evening and walked into the gathering dark t hey were making ready to lie down in their bedroll before dag reported his conversations with his brother and fairbolt to fawn from the brevity of his descriptions compared to the time hed been gone fawn suspected he was leaving a good bit out more than these clipped essentials had cast him into his dark mood brothers can do that but his explanation of the camp council was frightening enough in the light of their candle stub atop dags trunk which did for their bedside table fawn sat crosslegged and said seven people can just vote youusto be banished just like that not quite they have to sit and hear arguments from both sides and theyll each speak with other folks around their islands gather opinions before delivering a ruling of thisthis gravity huh she frowned somehow i thought your people not liking me being here would take the form ofi dont know leaving dead rotten animals outside our door to step on in the morning nasty tricks like that fellows in masks setting fire to our tent or sneaking from the bushes and beating you up or shaving my head or something dag raised quizzical brows is that the form it would take in farmer country sometimes sometimes worse from tales shed heard a mask wont hide who you are from groundsense anyone wants to do something that ugly around here they sure cant do it in secret that would slow em up some i guess allowed fawn yes andthis isnt a matter for boys tricks our marriage cords if nothing else draw it up to another level altogether serious dilemmas take serious thought from serious folks shouldnt we be making a push to talk to those serious folks too dar shouldnt have it all his own way seems to me yesnoblight dar he added in a burst of aggravation this shoves me into exactly the worst actions to ease you in here smoothly drawing attention forcing folks to choose sides i wanted to lie low and while everyone was waiting for someone else to do something let the time for choosing just slip on by i figured a year would do it fawn blinked in astonishment at his timetable perhaps a year didnt seem like such a long time to him this isnt exactly your favorite sort of arguin is it he snorted not hardly its the wrong thing at the wrong time andand im not very smooth at it anyway fairbolt is twenty minutes talking with him and your heads turned around good camp captain but hes made it clear this is my own bed to lie in he added in a lower voice and i hate begging for favors figured i used up a lifes supply long before this a slight thump of his left arm on the bedroll indicated what favors he was thinking of which made fawn huff in turn whatever special treatment had won him his arm harness and let him back on patrol must it seemed to her have been paid back in full a good long time ago nevertheless dag began the next morning to show their presence more openly by taking fawn out in the narrow boat for plunkin delivery duty the first step was to paddle out to a gathering raft which over the season had worked its way nearly to the end of their arm of the lake and would shortly start back up the other side a dozen lakewalkers of various ages sexes and states of undress manned the tenfootsquare lashing of tree trunks which seemed to be munching its way down a long stretch of water lilies this variety had big almost leathery leaves that stuck up out of the water like curled fans and small simple unappealing yellow flowers which also stood up on stalks the crew worked steadily to dig then trim and separate the stems roots and ears and then replant churnedup mud and plant bits left a messy trail in the rafts inching wake dag saluted an older woman who seemed to be in charge a couple of naked boys rolled a load of plunkins into the narrow boat that made it ride alarmingly low in the water and after polite farewells dag and fawn paddled off again a good bit more sluggishly fawn was intensely conscious of the stares following them delivery consisted of coasting along the lakeshore pulling up to each campsite in turn and tossing plunkins into big baskets affixed to the ends of their docks which at least showed fawn where their daily plunkins had been coming from all this time she hated the way the boat wobbled as she scrambled around at this task and was terrified of dropping a plunkin overboard and having to go after it especially in water over her head but at length theyd emptied their boat out again and then went back for another load and did it all over again twice dag waved or called a how de to folks in other boats or along the shore seemingly the custom here and exchanged short greetings with anyone working on the docks as their boat pulled up introducing fawn to enough new folks that she quickly lost track of the names no one was spiteful though some looked bemused but few of the return stares or greetings seemed really warm to her after a while she thought she would have preferred rude or at least blunt questions to this silent appraisal but the little ordeal came to an end at noon when they climbed wearily back up the bank to tent bluefield where lunch fawn reflected glumly would be plunkin they repeated the exercise on the next four mornings until the raftfolk and dockfolk stopped looking at them in surprise in the afternoons fawn began to help sarri with the task of spinning up her new plunkin flax and for more novelty aid cattagus with his ropebraiding one of his several sittingdown camp chores that did not strain his laboring lungs his breathing he explained between wheezes was permanent damage left from a bad bout of lung fever a few years back that had nearly led him to share and had forced him finally to give up patrolling and grow he claimed fat fawn found she liked working with cattagus more than with any other of the campsites denizens sarri was stiff and wary or distracted by her children and mari wryly dubious but cattagus seemed to regard dags farmer girl with grim amusement it was daunting to reflect that his detachment might stem from how close he stood to deathmari for one was very worried about leaving him come bad weatherbut fawn finally decided that hed likely always had a rude sense of humor further though not as patient a teacher as dag he was nearly as willing introducing her to the mysteries of arrowmaking he produced arrows not only for his patroller wife but for razi and utau as well it was very much a twohanded chore dar it seemed had used to make dags for him in his spare time it didnt need nor did cattagus make any comment that dag now needed a new source fawn found in herself a knack for balance and a sure and steady hand at fletching and shortly grew conversant with the advantages and disadvantages of turkey hawk and crow quills dag trudged off several times to as he said scout the territory returning looking variously worried pleased or headdown furious fawn and cattagus were sitting beneath a walnut tree having a fletching session when he stalked back from one of the latter sort ducked into the tent without a word returned with his bow and quiver grabbed a plunkin from the basket by the tent flap and set it up on a stump in the walnut grove within fifteen minutes he had reduced the plunkin to something resembling a porcupine smashed by a boulder and was breathing almost steadily again as he tried to unwedge his deeply buried near misses from the tree behind the stump there were no wider misses to retrieve from the grove beyond that one sure aint gettin away cattagus observed with a nod at the remains of the plunkin anybody i know dag treading over to them smiled a bit sheepishly doesnt matter now he sat down with a sigh unlatched and set aside his short bow then picked up one of the new arrows and examined it with a judicious eye better and better spark she decided this was deliberate diversion you know you keep saying i shouldnt come with you sos folksll talk frank and free but it seems to me you might get further with some if they were to talk a little less frank and free thats a point he conceded maybe tomorrow but the next morning ended up being dedicated to some overdue weapons practice with an eye to the fact that maris patrol would be going out again soon saun turned up invited by razi and utau and fawn grew conscious for the first time of how few visitors had come to the campsite if she and dag were indeed a wonder of the lake she would have thought curiosity if not friendliness should have brought a steady stream of neighbors making excuses to get a peek at her she wasnt sure how to interpret their absence politeness or shunning but saun was as nice to her as ever the session began with archery and fawn fascinated made herself useful trotting into the walnut grove after misses or tossing plunkin rinds up into the air for moving targets her arrows seemed to work as well as her mentors she saw with satisfaction cattagus sat on a stump and appraised the archers skills as freely as his breathlessness would allow saun was inclined to be daunted by him but mari gave him back as good as she got dag just smiled the five patrollers moved on to blade practice with wooden knives and swords mari was clever and fast but outmatched in strength and endurance not a surprise in a woman of seventyfive and soon promoted herself to a seat beside cattagus to shrewdly critique the others the action grew hotter then with what seemed to fawn a great many very dirty moves not to mention uncertainty of whether she was watching sword fighting or wrestling the clunk and clatter of the wooden blades was laced with cries of ow blight it or to sauns occasional gratification good one dag pushed the others on far past breathlessness on the gaspedout but convincing theory that the real thing didnt come with rest breaks sos youd better know how to move when you couldnt hardly move at all the sweatsoaked and filthy combatants then took a swim in the lake emerging smelling no worse than usual and assembled in the clearing to munch plunkin and try without success to persuade cattagus to uncork one of his last carefully hoarded jugs of elderberry wine from the prior fall dag slouched against a stump and smiling at the banter suddenly frowned and sat up his head turning toward the road what is it fawn sitting beside him asked quietly fairbolt not happy about something she lowered her voice further think its our summons from the camp council finally she had lived in increasing dread of the threat could beno im not sure dags eyes narrowed by the time fairbolts trotting horse swung into the clearing all the patrollers had quieted and were sitting up watching him he was riding bareback and his face was as grim as fawn had ever seen she found her heart beating faster even though she was sitting still fairbolt pulled up his horse and gave them all a vague sort of salute good youre all here im looking for saun first saun startled stood up from his stump me sir yep courier just rode in from raintree sauns home hinterland bad news from there sauns face drained and fawn could imagine his thoughts suddenly racing down a roster of family and friends theyve got themselves a bad malice outbreak north of farmers flats and are calling for help everyone straightened in shock at this even fawn knew by now that to call for aid outside ones own hinterland was a sign of things going very badly indeed seems the blighted thing came up practically under a farmer town and grew like crazy before it was spotted fairbolt said sauns gnawed plunkin rind fell from his hand ill ridei have to get home at once he said and lurched forward he caught himself breathless and looked beseechingly at fairbolt sir may i have leave to go no saun flushed but before he could speak fairbolt went on i want you to ride with the rest tomorrow morning as pathfinder oh yes of course saun subsided but stayed on his flexing feet like a dog straining on the end of a chain being the high season almost threequarters of our patrols are out right now fairbolt continued his gaze sweeping over the suddenly grave patrollers in front of him for our first answer i figure i can pull up the next three patrols due to go out which includes yours mari mari nodded cattagus scowled unhappily his right hand rubbing on his knee but he said nothing being out of the hinterland its on a volunteer basis as usualyou folks all in of course murmured mari razi and utau after a glance at each other nodded as well fawn hardly dared move her breath felt constricted dag said nothing his face oddly blank saun wheeled to him youll come wont you dag i know you meant to sit out our next patrol in camp and youve earned some time off your feet but but i want to speak to dag privatelike said fairbolt watching him the rest of you can start to collect your gear i figure to send the first company west at dawn couldnt we start tonight if everyone pulled themselves together said saun earnestly timeyou never know how much difference a little time could make dag grimaced at that one not fawn thought in disagreement fairbolt shook his head although his glance was sympathetic folks are spread all over the lake right now itll take all afternoon just to get the word out you cant outpace the company youre leading pathfinder saun gulped and nodded fairbolt gave a gesture of dismissal and everyone scattered razi and utau for their tent where sarri had come to the awning post with her little boy on her hip staring hard at the scene mari and cattagus to theirs saun waved and started jogging up the road back to his own campsite on the islands other end fairbolt slid down from his horse and left it to trail its reins and browse dag motioned toward tent bluefield sheltered in the orchard and fairbolt nodded fawn hurried after their matched patrollers strides fairbolt eyed her neither inviting nor excluding so when each man took a seat on an upended log in the shade of her tent flap she did too dag gave her an acknowledging nod before turning his full attention on his commander with three patrols sent out in a bunch theyre going to need an experienced company captain fairbolt began rig crow or iwassa muskrat said dag watching him warily my first two choices exactly fairbolt said if they werent both a hundred and fifty miles away right now ah dag hesitated surely youre not looking to me for this youve been a company captain further youre the only patroller in camp right now whos been in on a real largegroup action and so successfully too murmured dag sourly just ask the survivors oh thats rightthere werent any thatll give folks lots of confidence in my leadership sure enough fairbolt made an impatient chopping motion your habit of picking up extra duty means youve worked at one time or another with almost every other patroller in camp no problem with unfamiliar grounds or not knowing your people pretty much through and through weaknesses strengths who can be relied on for what dags slow blink didnt deny this fairbolt lowered his voice another angle i shouldnt be saying this but your summons to stand before the camp council is due out in a very few more days but they cant set a hearing if youre not here to receive the order you wanted delay heres your chance do a good job on this and if youre still called to stand before the council youll do so with that much more clout and if i do badly dag inquired his voice very dry fairbolt scratched his nose and grinned without humor then we are all going to be having much more pressing problems than one patrollers personal lapses and if im killed in the field the problem goes away too said dag with false brightness now youre thinking like a captain said fairbolt affably knew you could dag huffed a very short laugh patroller humor fawn realized yeep fairbolt sat back more seriously not my first pick of solutions though dag when it comes to malices youre known as about the most volunteerin fellow in camp this is your chance to show em all nothings changed dag shook his head i dont know whats changed changing more thani sometimes think his hand touched his left arm and while fairbolt might take it to mean his marriage cord fawn wondered how much the gesture was for his ghost hand fairbolt glanced at fawn aye its a hard thing to ask a patroller newly stringbound to go out in the field under any circumstances but this ones bad dag i didnt want to give more details in front of saun right off but word from the courier is that theyve already lost hundreds of people farmers and lakewalkers both the malice has shifted from its first lair under that poor farmer town to attack bonemarsh camp most everyone got away but theres no question the malice captured some once our first company is dispatched im going to start scraping up a secondabsent gods know from wherebecause i have an ugly hunch theyll be wanted dag rubbed his brow raintree folks will be offbalance then focusing on the wrong things defense and refugees and the wounded people will get frantic for each other and lose sight of the main chance get a knife in the malice everything else is a distraction an outsider might be better at keeping his head said fairbolt suggestively not necessarily its been thirty years since i patrolled in north raintree but i still remember friends and the terrain some dag admitted reluctantly exactly never been out that way myself i figured by the by that ill pair saun as pathfinder with the company captain dag did not respond directly to this but touched his throat i dont have a primed knife right now first time ive walked bare in decades i usually carried two sometimes three you wondered how i took out so many malices besides the extra patrolling folks gave me more knives it was that simple not the captains job to place the knife its his job to place the knifewielders i know dag sighed and i know you know so fairbolt stood up im going to finish passing the word up this side of the island ill ride back this way you can give me your answer then he didnt say talk it over with each other but the invitation was plain he stared a moment at fawn as if thinking of making some plea to her but then just shook his head his horse came wandering over in a way that she suspected was not by chance and he stepped up on his log seat and swung his leg over he was back on the road in moments setting the animal into a lope dag had risen when fairbolt had he stood staring after him but his face was drawn and inwardlooking as if contemplating quite another view her own face feeling as stiff and congealed as cold dough fawn rose too and went to him they walked into each others arms and held on tight too soon whispered dag he set her a little from him looking down in anxiety fawn wondered whatever was the use of putting on a brave face when he could see right through to whatever wild roil her ground was in right now she stiffened her spine anyhow fighting to keep her breathing even and her lips firm fairbolts right about the experience though he continued his voice finding its volume again this sort of thing is different from hunting sessiles or even from that mess we had near glassforge i run down the patrol lists in my head and think they dont know especially the youngsters how far north of farmers flats was that town anyway farmer settlements arent supposed to be allowed above the old cleared line he shook his head abruptly and grasped her hands his gold eyes glittered with an expression shed never seen in them before she thought it might be frantic she swallowed and said you did this once so the question isnt can you do it but can you do it better than someone doing it for the first time ever noyesmaybeits been a while stillif not me who am i condemning to go in my place someone has to she reached up and pressed her fingers to his lips which stilled she said simply who are you arguin with dag he was silent for the space of several heartbeats though at length a faint wry smile turned his mouth just a little fawn took a deeper breath when i married a patroller instead of a farmer i figured i must be signing up for something like this you for the leavingme for the being left his hand found her shoulder and tightened its come on sooner than we thought butthere has to be a first time she raised her arms to catch his beloved cheekbones between her hands pressing hard and gave his head a stern little shake just you make sure its not the last you hear he gathered her in she could feel his heartbeat slow the scent of him as she turned and buried her face in his shirt overwhelmed her sweat and summer and sun and just plain dag she opened her mouth and widened her nostrils as though she could breathe him in and store him up forever and a day well there wasnt any forever then ill take the day youre not afraid to be left alone here he murmured into her curls on the list of things im afraid of that ones just dropped down quite a ways she could feel his smile you have to grant ive always come back so far yeah the other patrollers in glassforge said you were like a cat that way but they all went out looking for you anyhow papa used to say to me when i got all upset about one of our barn cats that had got its fool self in a fix and was crying all woeful lovie you ever seen a cat skeleton in a tree that deep chuckle she so loved too seldom felt lately rumbled through his chest they stood there wrapped in each other until the unwelcome sound of trotting hoofbeats echoed from the road right then muttered fawn she backed off and stared up he was looking down with a curious smile he returned her nod squeezed and released her all but her hand turned to face fairbolt looking down from his horse fairbolt didnt speak merely raising his brows in question ill want to talk to that courier said dag and have a fresh look at whatever largescale maps we have of the northern raintree region fairbolt accepted this with no more comment than a short jerk of his chin get up behind me then ill give you a lift to headquarters he kneed his horse around and dag stepped up on a stump and slid aboard the burdened beast took to the road again at a rapid walk fawns eyes were hot but dry mostly blinking she ducked inside her tent flap to see what she could do to help get dags saddlebags in order i t was midnight before dag returned to tent bluefield fawn raised her head at the sound of his steps falling slower than usual out of the dark and poked up their campfire coals with a stick lighting their candle stub from it in the weak flare of golden light his lips gave her a smile but his eyes seemed abstracted i was wonderin if you were going to get any chance to sleep she said quietly rising some not much well be saddling the horses just before dawn thats no way to start out all tired should i stay awake to get you up it wouldnt be that many more hours at this point no someone will come for me ill try to go out quiet dont you dare go sneaking off without waking me she said a little fiercely and led him inside where the contents of his saddlebags were laid out in neat stacks his bow lay next to them its quiver stuffed with arrows i was going to pack up your gear but then i thought id better have you check first see if i got everything right he nodded knelt and began handing her stacks briefly inspected she tucked them into the bags as tidily as she could the only thing he set aside was his tambourine in its leather case fawn wanted to ask wont you need that to celebrate the kill but then thought perhaps he wanted to protect it this ridingout being out of the routine the other possibilities she refused to contemplate she closed the flaps buckled them and turned to pick up the last item laid out on the trunk beside the flickering stub youve got no sharing knife you want to take this one she held hertheirknife out to him tentatively his face grew grave still kneeling he took it from her and drew it from its sheath frowning at the faded writing on the bone blade dar thinks it wont work he said at last i wasnt thinking of it for your first pick only to keep by you justjust in case if there were no other choices there will be a dozen and more other knives among my company how many patrollers are going seventy will it be enough who knows one is enough but it can take all the rest to get that one to the right place at the right time fairbolt will hold all the regular patrols going out and fold in the ones coming home but he has to think not only of sending help but of defense id think sending help would be the best defense to a point things might go badly in raintree but also another malice could pop up here in oleana since this commotion will put everyone behind scheduleagainits just that more likely thats the problem with malices emerging so randomly nice when we go months and months at a time without one but when they come up in a bunch we can get overwhelmed his brows drew in slowly he resheathed the knife handing it back to her with a somewhat apologetic grimace better not i have an old bad habit of jumping into things feetfirst and thats not my job this time she accepted his words and the knife with a little nod although her heart ached i have some ideas he went on his mind clearly elsewhere or perhaps several elsewheres but im going to need more recent news than what that courier brought she near rode her horse to death but she was still two days getting here part of what went wrong at wolf ridge was due to hm not so much bad as old information though for whatever consolation im not sure but what wed have done just the same if we had known what was coming down on us if wed spared a few more to the ridge it would just have been that many more dead and a few was all we had his mouth set in irony the help from out of the hinterland not having arrived yet fawn didnt think dags company would be dawdling on their road tomorrow there seemed so little she could do for him socks arrows packing it all felt so trivial all things he had accomplished perfectly well for himself for years before shed come along to so disrupt his life she might help by putting him to bed and sitting on him maybe it was clear his body needed its rest and equally clear his mind would scarcely allow it she raised her hands and began tenderly unbuttoning his shirt as her wrist moved her eye was caught by the gold beads of her marriage cord he needs to be thinking about his task not about me but time was growing desperately short dag mm spark his fingers in turn gently twisted themselves in the curls of her hair letting the locks flow over and between them you can feel me through your wedding cord right and all the other married lakewalkers mari and cattagus and all they can do the same for each other he nodded she drew his shirt off that long strappymuscled torso folding it up atop his clean and mended riding trousers for morning later in the night whatever that grim predawn hour was she went on well i cant ive taken your word that our cords work the same as everyone elses but i cant feel it for myself others can tell and tell you yeah well except i cant be all the time asking twenty times a day cattagus for one doesnt take to being pestered and besides hell have his own worries about mari true he conceded eyeing her she slipped out of her own shirt his hand helping not so much for need as to trail over her skin in passing the light touch made her shiver i want to know in my own heart isnt there anything at all you can do to to make me feel you the way all the others can he said after a moment not the way the others can no youre no lakewalker nor ever would be but his wording caught her attention some other way let methink about that for a little spark it would take some unusual groundwork stripped for sleep he was altogether unaroused if he felt half as distracted as she did right now that was no surprise she felt obscurely that she ought to send him off having been thoroughly made love to but for the first time ever such intimacy felt forced and unhappy that was no good either youre all tense how if you lie down and i give you a back rub might help you sleep spark you dont have to and a real good foot rub she added prudently he rolled over into their bedroll with a muffled noise indicating abject surrender and she smiled a little she started at his neck his muscles there were plenty hard and tense though this seemed poor compensation for the limpness elsewhere the corded unease gave itself up but slowly as her hands pressed slid caressed unhurriedly she worked her way from tousled top to gnarly toe not making love just loving perhaps the lack of expectation paid off in any case when he at length rolled over again a more alert interest had clearly returned to him there might yet be sleep for him tonight if the long way around she slid down against him to capture his mouth in a deep kiss his own hand snaked around her shoulder and began tracing lazily over her she tried to soak up every sensation hold them like painted patterns on her skin but racing time washed them constantly beyond her reach he arched above her like a clouded night sky lowering entering her if not easily far more easily than their first urgent fumbles on their wedding night exercise indeed she thought and smiled in memory she felt a pang of regret that tonight was bound to be futile for trying to catch a child both too late for this month and too soon for her healing in these hurried frightening circumstances she might have been tempted to take a chance on the healing stillsurely it would be ill omened to conceive their first child out of fear and despair dagll come back he must come back he slipped his left arm behind her back clutched her and heaved them both over she adjusted herself with a wriggle and sat up looking down at him curiously his face held a different abstraction and she feared for a moment that they would again lose their intimate impetus to the creeping chill of tomorrows worries no evidently not but he watched her though halflidded eyes as his left arm began a peculiar circuit briefly touching the cord bound on her left wrist then her forehead heart belly groin and wrist again what are you doing not sure something by feel a little lefthanded groundwork maybe what hed called his lefthanded groundwork hadnt appeared in their lovemaking since hed recovered the use of his right hand she had missed his eerie caresses though she supposed it wasnt to her credit that theyd made her feel so downright smug for marrying a black sorcerer instead of a mere farmer but that seemed not to be what he was about this time im trying to patch a bit of ground reinforcement into you that will dance with my ground in your cord shaped inside your own groundpretty ground if youas yougrow open to me i think i can coax it in through natural channels not sure exactly what the effect will be just she opened eyes heart and body to him wide and vulnerable need blood she asked breathlessly she wasnt sure if his huff was a laugh or a sob dont think so justjust love me she found their rhythm again taking over the lovemaking abandoning the magicmaking to him his eyes were as wide and black as shed ever seen them pools of night with liquid stars in their depths his left arm continued its rounds more slowly but somehow more intensely it ended laid diagonally across his belly just as his back began to arch her eyes squeezed shut as the wonderful increasingly familiar wave of sensation coursed up from her heated loins stopping her breath a stranger sharper wave of sweet warmth wound with it rising up through her heart and down her arm in time with the pulse of her blood oh oh then as he sank beneath her the ecstatic shudders in his own body damping out she said oh in quite another voice of surprise she clapped her right hand to the cord encircling her left wrist itit tingles it feels like winter sparks too much does it hurt he wheezed anxiously opening his eyes again no not at all strangeoh its fading a bit am i losing you should be able to call it up to you when you wish try she bit her lip and concentrated the warm sensation faded nono oh dear am i not doing it right instead of concentrating try relaxing make yourself open that she said after a minute is a lot harder than concentrating yes not force but persuasion enticement she sat astride him with her eyes closed right hand wrapping her wrist and tried again she imagined herself smiling wordlessly trying to attract dag over to her for a kiss and a cuddle i love you so much a prickling heat around no inside her wrist seemed like an answering whisper yes im here thats you in the cord thats a bit of me thats been in the cord since that night in your aunt natties weaving room said dag smiling up at her and you can feel a bit of me in your cord like this too yep he added in caution it may not last more than a few weeks as you absorb the ground reinforcement itll do fine she vented a long elated sigh and slumped down across his chest but since he couldnt kiss any more of her than the top of her head in this position she roused herself and reluctantly parted from him they cleaned up briefly and lay back down just as the candle guttered out dag was asleep before she was she woke in the dark and rolled over to clutch an empty bedroll her heart lurched in panic feeling around frantically she found dags dented pillow still warm she gripped her cord calmed her breathing and tried to sense him alive of course the reassuring prickle told her just overthataway hes just gone out to the slit trench you fool girl she scolded herself in relief she rolled on her side bringing her hands up to her breasts and bent her head to kiss the heavy twiceblessed braid the tent flap lifted in a few minutes the shadows outside were nearly as inky as in here dag slipped his bare chilled body into their bedroll again they wound their arms around each other and fawn did her best to share heat through her skin so that he might ease swiftly into whatever space of sleep was left to him this night but before his breathing slowed a slap sounded on the leather of their tent flap and a low voice called dag utau fawn thought im awake dag groaned ombas girls just brought our horses around right be right with you from the middle distance sounded a muffled equine snort and copperheads familiar irritable squeal fawn slipped her shift on in the dark and went out to coax a bit of flame from the gray ashes of their fire trying to get a last few minutes of light from the melted candle stub in the bottom of its clay cup back inside she found dag dressed already running his hand over his gear as if in final inventory there would be no turning back for forgotten items this trip his face looked tired and strained but not she thought from fear at leastnot physical fear they shared slices of plunkin gnawed down quickly and without ceremony or in fawns case appetite now what said fawn the company will assemble at the headquarters tent most folks say goodbye at home right then he hooked up his saddle fawn tottered after with the saddlebags and they went out to where the horses were tied razi utau and mari were saddling theirs in the light of a torch held aloft by cattagus sarri stood ready to hand things up in the east across this arm of the lake the black shapes of the trees were just growing distinguishable from the graying sky mist shrouded the water and the grass and weeds underfoot were damp with dew cattagus handed the torch to sarri long enough to hug mari muttering into her knotted gray hair mind your steps you fool old woman to which she returned you just mind yourself you fool old man despite his wheezing he gave her a leg up his hand lingering a moment on her thigh as she settled into her saddle dag gave copperhead a knee to the belly ducked the return snap of yellow teeth and tightened his girth for a second time he turned to grip fawns hands then embraced her as she flung her arms around him and held hard he put her from him with a kiss not on her lips but on her forehead not farewell but blessing the tenderness and terror of it wrenched her heart as nothing else had this anxious morning and then he was heaving himself up on copperhead the gelding clearly refreshed by his holiday in pasture signified his displeasure at being put back to work so early in the morning by sidling and some halfhearted bucking firmly checked by his rider the four patrollers angled onto the road and vanished in the shadows fawn saw a few more mounted shapes trotting to catch up those left behind turned back silently to their tents though cattagus gave his niece sarri a hug around the shoulders before he went in fawn was entirely unable to contemplate falling back to sleep she went into her tent and straightened her few belongingshousekeeping was a short task with so little house to keepand tried to set her mind to the work of the day spinning was endless of course she was helping sarri with her weaving in return for share of the tough cloth she was presently making and for teaching fawn how to sew a pair of lakewalker riding trousers but it was too early to go over there she wasnt hungry enough yet to eat more plunkin instead she traded her shift for a shirt and skirt put on her shoes and walked down the shore road toward the split to the bridge the gray light was growing with the faintest tinge of blue only a few pricking stars still shone down through the leaves she was not she discovered the only person with this notion a dozen or more lakewalkers men and women old and young had collected along the main road in small groups scarcely talking she tried nodding to some neighbors she recognized from the plunkin delivery chore at least some nodded back though none smiled but nobody was smiling much patience was rewarded in a few minutes by the sound of hoofbeats coming from the woodland road the cavalcade had already broken into the groundeating trot of the longlegged patrol horses dag was in the lead riding alongside saun listening with a thoughtful frown as the young man spoke but he swiveled his head and flashed a smile at fawn in passing and saun looked back and managed a surprised salute others along the road craned their necks for a glimpse of their own exchanging a few last waves one woman ran alongside a young patroller and handed up something folded in a cloth that fawn thought might be a forgotten medicine kit in any case the girl grinned gratefully and twisted in her saddle to thrust it away in her bags fawn wasnt sure how seventy patrollers could seem at once so many and so few but every one had been well kittedup good sturdy gear fine weapons good horses good wishes and what shed just seen was only a tenth of fairbolts patrollers it wasnt hard to see where the wealth of this straitened island community was being spent as the tail of the company vanished around the bend the onlookers broke up and began walking back to their tents almost at the last an angular figure emerged from the cover of some straggling sunstarved honeysuckle bushes across the road fawn startled recognized cumbia at the same moment the lakewalker woman saw her she gave a nod and a polite kneedip to her motherinlaw wondering for a moment if this was a good chance to begin speaking with her again it occurred to fawn that this task might actually be easier without dag and his nervywell prickliness seemed an inadequate word for it pigheadedness came closer she mustered up a smile to follow but cumbia abruptly turned her head and began walking rapidly down the woodland road back stiff it dawned on fawn that the preparations for such dark morning departures had for long been cumbias task and cumbia had once had a husband who hadnt returned from patrol or only in the form of a deathly bone blade was this the first time her son had ridden out without bidding her farewell fawn wasnt sure if cumbia had tried to show herself or hide herself over there on the other side of the road but she knew dag hadnt glanced that way dar fawn noted had not come with his mother and she wondered what it meant face pinched fawn turned back onto the shore road she held her hand over her marriage cord trying for that reassuring tingle come on girl hes not even over the bridge yet but there the little prickling answered her silent query nonetheless thataway she took a deep breath and walked on in the inadequate light of their half dozen campfires flickering across this roadside clearing dag walked down the horse lines inspecting but not with his eyes alone three horses lame not bad for three days of hard pushing the company had traveled with several packhorses carrying food and precious grain patrol horses were normally grassfed except now and then in farmer country where grain was easier to come by but grazing took time and grain gave better strength the loads of provender were rapidly dwindling tomorrow morning they could cache three emptied packsaddles and trade out animals and leave no one slowing the rest by going doublemounted yet dag had led his company miles north from hickory lake to pick up the straight road west despite sauns pleas that he could guide them once theyd passed the borders of oleana into raintree on a shorter swifter route they were now by dags reckoning a half days ride due north of bonemarsh camp not a direction from which reliefor from the malices point of view attackmight be expected according to the shaken party of lakewalker refugees mostly women with children that they had encountered and questioned late this afternoon the malice had holed up at bonemarsh temporarily dag had been waiting for such intelligence now he had it it was time to commit his company to his plan no excuses no delays he sighed and began a roundabout stroll through the settling camp touching this patroller or that on the shoulder meet by my campfire in a few minutes razi and utau were both among them and to dags deeper regret mari and dirla others from other patrols all with skills known to him not of bow or sword or spear though all were proficient enough but of groundsense control a few were partnered but most would be leaving their usual partners behind they wont like that he wished that might prove the worst of their worries the night sky was misty only a few stars showing through and the ground was sodden the company had ridden through miserable rain all day yesterday blowing east into their faces as they pressed west the next few days should prove fair though dag wondered if that would be more to their advantage or to their quarrys hauling logs to keep their haunches out of the damp the patrollers hed tapped collected quietly around the dwindling fire watching attentively as dag came up in all sixteen his twelve chosen the other two patrol leaders saun and himself all righthe drew breaththis is what were going to do tomorrow were facing a malice not only at its full strength and mobile but who now certainly knows what sharing knives are getting close enough to kill it will be a lot trickier saun stirred and subsided on his log and dag gave him an acknowledging nod i know you werent too happy about not sending word ahead saun but a courier could barely have outpaced us and i wasnt keen to send a rider alone into woods maybe full of mudmen we are several days ahead of any other possible reinforcements from the east and also well ahead of any return messengers no one knows were coming no one knows were hereincluding the malice dag controlled an urge to pace grasping his hook behind his back and rocking slightly instead i haveone timeseen a malice this advanced taken down at wolf ridge in luthlia the younger patrollers around the fire blinked and sat up a few older ones nodded knowingly gazes growing more intent the strategy had two pieces though the way it played out was partly accidental while the most of us held the malices mudmen and slavesand attentionin open battle up on the ridge by way of diversion a small group of patrollers good at veiling their grounds slipped up on the lair there were eight pairs in that group and each pair carried a sharing knife orders were if anyone went down their partner didnt stay by them but was to take the knife and go on if any pairs went down the same with their linking pairs the reverse dag and everyone listening to him was aware of the usual patrol procedure to leave no one behind when enough patrollers got close enough to the malice to risk a rush they did it had been down to four survivors by then dag had been told later and that was the end of that malice but not of the cleanup which had gone on for months thereafter with a malice that strong didnt they risk getting their grounds ripped asked dirla and if it was in fear none could tell for her voice did not quaver and she had her groundsense well locked down some did said dag bluntly without apology but i think we can try a similar strike whatever resistance is forming up right now south of bonemarsh camp trying to protect farmers flats gets to play the part of the company on the ridge overwhelming the malices concentration we heredag unlocked his hand and gestured around the campfirewill be for the sneak attack you were all picked for your groundsense control not saun complained dirla saun flushed and glowered at her no hes our walking map and someones going to have to stay with the horses dag cast saun an apologetic look the boy grimaced but subsided and the rest of the company asked obio grayheron one of the remaining patrol leaders dag gave him a short nod youll give us a halfday start at which point it will either be overor command will pass to you and youll be free to try again try something else or circle to join forces however you can with the raintree lakewalkers obio settled back digesting this unhappily and youre going withwell yes of course going with the veiled patrol dag finished for him because dag was wellknown to be one of the cleverest at that trick in camp which begged the question in his own mind if not theirs whether he had chosen this strategy because it was the best they could do or because it played to his personal quirks well if the gamble paid off the subtle selfdoubt would be moot and also if it doesnt you cant lose old patroller in a sense saun was shoving shallow furrows in the drying mud with his boot heel he looked up a little cruel on the folks fighting the retreat toward farmers flats they dont even get to know theyre the bait neither did most of the folks up on wolf ridge said dag dryly and before saun could ask how do you know continued saun codo varleen youre all familiar with bonemarsh stand up and give us a terrain tutorial a customary task dag stepped back the local knowledge stepped forth and the other patrollers began pelting them with variously shrewd questions as the precious parchment maps were passed around and annotations scribbled in the dirt with sticks rubbed out and redrawn dag listened as hard or harder than anyone else casting and recasting tactical approaches in his head glumly aware that ninetenths of the planning would prove useless in the event there was enough brains and experience in this bunch that dag scarcely needed to guide the detailed discussion from here two bad ideas were knocked down by utau and obio respectively before dag could open his mouth and three better ones that dag wouldnt even have thought of were spat forth to be chewed over altered and approved with only the barest shaping murmurs on his part mari bless her took over the problem of coaxing sharing knives from a couple of patrollers who were not going with the veiled patrol as there were six pairs but only four knives among those here assembled they even sorted themselves out in new partnerpairs before the group growing quiet and thoughtful broke up to seek their bedrolls dag hoped they would all sleep better than he seemed likely to he rolled on his back in his own bedroll thin on the cold damp ground and searched the hazy sky for stars trying to quiet the busy noise in his head there was no point in running over the plans for tomorrow yet again for the tenth or was that the twentieth time hed done all he could for tonight except sleep but when he forced the roiling concerns for his company out the ache of missing fawn crept back in hed grown so accustomed to her companionship in so few weeks as if shed always been there or had slotted into some hollow place within him just her shape that had been waiting for years hed come to delight not only in her sweet body awakening appetites hed imagined dulled by time age and exhaustion but in the way her shining eyes opened wide in her endless questions that determined set to her mouth when she faced a new problem her seemingly boundless worldwonder and if her hunger for life was a joy to him his own renewed was an astonishment he considered the dark side of that bright coin uneasily had this marriage also reawakened his fear of death for long his inevitable end had seemed neither enemy nor friend just there accepted to be worked around like his missing hand if a fellow had nothing to lose no risk held much alarm and fear scarcely clogged thought if that indifference had given him his noted edge was that edge becoming blunted his right hand crept across his chest to trace the heavy cord wrapping his left arm above the elbow calling up the reassuring hum of sparks live ground indeed he had something to lose now by the shadow of his fear he began to see the shape of his desire the stirrings of curiosity for a future not constrained and inevitable but suddenly containing a host of unknowns places and people altogether unimagined unconceived in all senses blight it i want to live not the best time to make that discovery eh he snorted selfdisdain instead of letting his thoughts chase one another back around the circle he folded his left arm in rolled over around the absence of spark and resolutely closed his eyes the summer night was short they would head due south at dawn and make sure your body and your wits are riding the same horse old patroller t hree days gone fawn thought today would begin the fourth was it over was it even begun was dags company there yet wherever there was somewhere to the west yes and he was still alive so much her marriage cord now told her better than no news but far far from enough she watched across the campsite as cattagus settled himself at a log table with knife awl and assorted deerhide scraps his task of the morning was to make a new pair of slippers for his greatniece tesy judging by the fascinated way she danced around him giggling when he tickled her feet after measuring them against his pieces it might have been mere chance that his right hand rested for a moment on his left wrist before he leaned forward and began cutting fawn stretched her back against the apple tree and forced herself to take up her knitting again without sarris two children the campsite would have fallen all too quiet these past days although the distraction theyd provided by disappearing for several hours day before yesterday didnt exactly count as a help theyd been found by a neighbor pressed into aiding the search in the woods nearly at the other end of the islandon a quest of their own looking for their fathers from their infant points of view fawn supposed razi and utau were grand playmates who vanished as mysteriously as they arrived and sarris strained carefully repeated explanations about gone on patrol as baffling as if shed announced they had gone off to the moon fawns monthly had begun the day after dag had left not a surprise but an unpleasant reminder of too many regrets sarri had shown fawn how lakewalker women used cattail fluff as absorbent stuffing for their ragbags which could be emptied into the slit trench instead of tediously washed out along with the bags after the consolation was slight fawn had spent two unhappy days sitting spinning and cramping trying without success to decide if this was just a bad one or some abnormal relic from the malices mishandling and wishing mari were here to ask but the grinding pain had passed off at last and her fears eased with her bleeding today was much better last row fawn cast off neatly and laid the new pair of cottonyarn socks out on her skirted thigh they had come out well the few dropped stitches had been properly recaptured the heels turned at a natural angle and not something that her brothers would have threatened to dress the rooster in she grinned in memory of the irate bird stalking around with those misshapen wool bags tied to its feet though at the time shed been even madder than it had she slipped into her tent and combed her unruly hair tying it up with a ribbon then rummaged in her scrap bag for a bit of colored yarn she folded the socks neatly and made a bow around the bundle with the yarn to help them look more like a present then she straightened up put her shoulders back and walked down the road toward cumbia redwings encampment rain had blown through from the west last night and the tall hickory trees shed sparkling drops as a fresh breeze stirred them dags company must have ridden through the same broad storm fawn calculated though whether it had caught them on the road or in shelter she could not guess despite the lingering damp when fawn came to the redwing site she spotted cumbia working outside sitting on a leather cushion atop the inevitable upended log seat at one of the crude plank tables she was wearing the sleeveless calflength shift that seemed usual for women in summer here this one a faded bluishred that spoke of some berry dye the lean upright posture was slightly bent the shining silver head turned down over her task skeins of the longfibered plunkin flax yarn lay out on the table with a fourpronged lucet cumbia was looping them into the strong light cord lakewalkers used as fawn had hoped dar and omba were nowhere in sightoff to the bone shack and mare island presumably cumbia looked up and scowled as fawn approached her hands as gnarled with work and age as any farmwifes went on expertly braiding fawn dipped her knees and said how de nice morning silence unpromising but fawn hadnt expected this to be easy i knitted dag a pair of socks to go under his riding boots very fine he seemed to like them a lot so i made a pair for you too she thrust out her little bundle cumbia made no move to take it if fawn had been offering a dead squirrel found rotting in the woods cumbias expression might have been much the same fawn set the socks down next to the skeins and stepped back just a little schooling herself not to turn and flee she had to hook up some response to build on besides that dead stare i was glad to see you come watch dag ride out the other morning i know you wanted him to become an officer the hands reached the end of some counting turn stopped and set the wooden tool on the table with a sharp clack the scowl deepened as if the words were jerked from her cumbia said not like this how else should it be it seemed very like dag it came out all wrong cumbia blew out her breath it generally does with that boy the aggravation and sorrow he has brought me first to last can hardly be counted her gaze on fawn left no doubt as to what she considered the latest entry in that tally at least shes started talking well folks were close to most often do aggravate us because otherwise we wouldnt care hes brought good things as well twentyseven malice kills to start you have to be proud of that cumbia grimaced oh hes proven himself on patrol right enough but hed done that by the time he was twentyfive its in camp where hes ducked his duties as if patrolling got him off responsibility for all else if hed married when he should have years ago we wouldnt be in this muddle now he did once fawn pointed out in an attempt at a dignified reply right on time for a lakewalker man i guess it turned into a hurtful tragedy that still haunts him hes not the first nor the last to suffer such plenty of others have lost folks in the maw of some malice and cumbia was one of them fawn was reminded hes had twenty years to put it behind him well thenfawn took a breathit looks like hes not going to doesnt it you all had your chance with him and a good long chance it was maybe its someone elses turn now cumbia snorted yours seems like id say you havent lost anything to me that you had in the first place when i met him he wasnt betrothed to anything but his own death near as i could tell and if hes lost that infatuation well good cumbia leaned back her attention now fully engaged which wasnt exactly a comfortable feeling but at least it was a shift from her attempt to pretend fawn didnt exist at all fawn went on youre both of you stiffnecked i think dag must get it from you to tell the truth somebody has to bend before things break hearts for one cant you please stop dar from going to the camp council its bound to end badly yes for you said cumbia more level than venomous oddly fawn raised her chin do you really believe dagll choose to cut strings if hes forced to the edge that hed break his word you have a strange idea of your son for knowing him so long i believe hell be secretly relieved to be freed of that illchosen oath to you girl embarrassed sure and obnoxious about itmen always are when theyre caught in the wrong but in the long run glad to be rescued from his own mistakes and gladder still not to have to do it himself fawn bit her lip so you think your sons a coward as well as a liar she didnt say it or spit it she was shaken by a faint undercurrent of plausibility in cumbias argument ive known him half a summer shes known him all his life she gripped the cord around her left wrist for solace and courage what if he chooses banishment he wont no lakewalker could hell remember what he owes and who to in general dag tried to keep as much distance between himself and his family as he could and fawn was beginning to see why people left their families all the timeit was as normal for a lakewalker man as it was for a farmer woman sometimes it was the straight path for growing up like dags marriage in luthlia he presumably had never intended to return from there once hed wed kauneo sometimes families were impossible in their own right and could not be fixed only fled from and she was beginning to wonder if a little of that might have been behind dags first marriage too she chose at last whos pushing this camp council showdownyou or dar the family is united in trying to rescue dag from thisi grant selfinflicteddisaster because i think dar knows better and if hes telling you something else hes lying cumbia looked faintly bemused farmer girl im a lakewalker i know when someone is lying fooling himself then fawn tried another tack all this is hurting dag i can see the strain in him it wasnt right to send him off to war with all this mess on his mind cumbias brows rose so whose fault was that it takes two sides to tear a man apart the solution is simple go back to your farm you dont belong here absent gods girl you cant even veil your ground properly its as if youre walking around naked all the time do you even know that or did dag not tell you fawn flinched and cumbia looked briefly triumphant in sudden panic fawn wondered if her motherinlaw was reading her ground the way dag did if so shell know how to split me up the middle easy as splitting a log with a wedge and mallet cumbias head cocked curiously her eyes narrowed as if in direct response to this thought she said what use to him is a wife so stupid and ignorant youll always be doing the wrong thing here a constant source of shame to him he might be too stiffnecked to admit it but inside hell writhe youd bear children with weak grounds incapable of the simplest tasks if your blighted womb can bear at all that is youre pretty now i admit but that wont last eitheryoull age fast like the rest of your kind growing as fat and distracted as any other fool of a farmwife while he goes on rigid with regret shes probing shooting not at any facts that could possibly be known to her and certainly not blind but at fawns fears a vision of her mama and aunt nattie both grown downright dumpy in their middle age nonetheless assaulted fawns imagination half a dozen barbs half a dozen direct hitsno not blind stilli must have hit her somewhere too for her to be counterattacking so cruelly fawn remembered a description shed heard down in glassforge of how the rougher keelboat men fought duels their wrists were strapped together with rawhide thongs and their free hands given knives so they were forced to circle close unable to disengage or get out of their enemys stabbing range this fight with cumbia felt like that driven to her wits end by her own family fawn had not believed dag when hed said his would be worse but if her people fought to bruise and tumble his aimed to slice to the bone maybe dag was right about the best contact being none i didnt come here to fight this old woman i came to try for some peace why am i letting her have her war fawn took a deep breath and said dag is the most truthful man i ever met if we have a problem hell tell me and well fix it huh cumbia sat back fawn could sense another shift in her mood away from the sudden sharp attack but it did not reassure her then let me tell you the truth about patrollers girl because i was married to one sister daughter and mother to the breedwalked with them too when i was your age bout a thousand years ago men women old young kind or meanminded in one thing they are all the same once theyve seen their first malice they dont ever give up patrol unless theyre crippled or dead and they dont ever put anyone else before it mariby all right reason she should be staying in camp taking care of cattagus but off she goes and he sends her being just as bad dags father was another all of em the whole lot dont you be thinking i imagine dagll choose to cut strings because of any consideration for me or dar or anyone else who has supported him his whole life heres the fork if dag doesnt love you enough hell choose the patrol and if he loves you beyond all sensehell choose the patrol because youre standing in the center of that world hes sent to save and if he doesnt save it he doesnt save you either when fairbolt called on him the other night with the news from raintree how long did it take your bridegroom to decide to go off and leave you all alone with no friends or kin not very long fawn did not say aloud her mouth had grown too dry for speech and it wouldnt make a whit of difference if you were lakewalker born or a hundred times prettier or writhing in birth bed or crying at his childs deathbed or in agony on your own patrollers turn and go all the same you cant win this one she sat back and favored fawn with a slow blink cold as any snake neither could i so take your foolish knitting and go away fawn swallowed theyre good socks maybe omba would like to have them cumbia set her jaw youre a touch hard of listening arent you girl and then plucked up the little bundle and tossed it into the fire pit smoldering a few yards away fawn almost screamed aloud three days of work she dove after it it had not yet caught but the dry cotton smoked against the red coals and a stray end of the jaunty woolen yarn winked in scarlet sparks curling up and starting to blacken she leaned in and snatched it back out brushing off a smear of soot and glowing bits from the browning edge drawing in her breath sharply at the burning bite of them her blue skirt had muddy patches from where her knees had thumped down and she scrubbed at them as she rose glaring uselessly at cumbia it wasnt just the pain of the burn on her fingers that started tears in fawns eyes she choked out dag said it would be useless to try and talk to you should have listened to him too eh said cumbia her face was nearly expressionless i guess returned fawn shortly her bright theory that letting cumbia vent might clear the air seemed singularly foolish now she wanted to shoot some devastating last word over her shoulder as she stalked off hurting as shed been hurt but she was far too shaken to think of any she wanted only to escape go then said cumbia as if she could hear her fawn clutched the knit bundle in her unburned hand and marched away she didnt let her shoulders bow till she was out of sight on the road and having to pick her footfalls among the drying puddles her stomach shuddered and this island seemed abruptly lonely and strange hostile and pinched despite the bright morning air oppressive like a house turned prison she sniffed angrily feeling stupid stupid stupid and smeared away the drops on her lashes with the back of her hand then turned it to capture the cooling moisture on her throbbing fingers a reddening line crossed three of them she thought one might be starting to blister mama or aunt nattie would have dabbed the spots with butter made soothing murmurs and maybe kissed them fawn wasnt too sure about the butterin any case she had none in the tiny cache of food that passed for her larderbut the rest of the remedy she missed desperately not to be had ever again the thought made her want to bawl far more than the little pain in her hand shed gone to cumbia to try to head off the clash with the camp council at its apparent root to save dag she had not only failed she might have made it even worse cumbia and dar could have no doubt now of what an easy target dags farmer wife was why did i think i could help him stupid in her home campsitein maris and sarris campsite fawn corrected this thoughtcattagus was still sitting over his leatherwork now stitching a diminutive slipper held up nearly to his nose poking rawhide cords in and out of the holes hed made with his awl tesy had gone off somewhere though cattagus was apparently keeping an eye on her brother presently penned in a little corral and diverted with a pair of alarmed turtles he was tapping on a shell and calling the creature to come out as fawn crossed the clearing cattagus put down his work and looked at her shrewdly she recalled cumbias shot about walking around naked and wondered if all her efforts to put on a brave face were useless if any lakewalker looking at her could see what a seething mess she really was likely to her surprise cattagus beckoned her over she stopped by his table and he leaned on one elbow regarding her rather ironically and wheezed so where have you been girlie went to talk to cumbia fawn admitted tried anyhow burn your fingers did you fawn hastily pulled her hand from her licking tongue and hid it behind her back she threw the socks id brought her for a present in the fire should have just let them burn i guess but i couldnt stand the waste that what you been crouching over all these past three days pretty much huh lets see no girlie the burn he added impatiently as she thrust out her scorched bundle she gave him her other hand he held it in his dry thick fingers and his gray head bent slightly he was dressed as usual in nothing but the short trousers and sandals that were his summer uniform and she was conscious of the smell of him a mix of old man and lake green not unpleasant at this concentration and very cattagus would dag smell like that when he grew as old she thought she could learn to like it fawn stared at her rejected knitting as cattagus kneaded her palm do you think mari would like those socks theyre too big for me and too small for dag but theyre good for under riding boots if shes not too proud to take work from a stupid farmer she added bitterly or cumbias castoffs that last might actually be a draw said cattagus with his whistling chuckle he released her hand which had stopped throbbing fawn peeked at the red marks which had faded to pink instead of raising blisters as shed thought they would he does healing groundwork like dag thank you she said gratefully cattagus nodded picked up the socks and set them beyond his leather scraps signifying acceptance of the gift and fawn blinked back eyefog again fawn turned away then turned back blurting cumbia said because i cant veil my ground its just like walking around naked well said cattagus in a slow judicious drawl cumbia tends to be a bit on the tight side herself full of things she doesnt want others to see most folks our age just give up and be what they are fawn tilted her head considering this older farm folk can be like that some of them well not with their grounds of course but with clothes and what they do and say cumbias still tryin to fix the world im afraid shed have been a relentless patroller thank the absent gods she went for a maker he appeared to lose himself in a vision of patrolling with a younger cumbia and shuddered what does she make particularly rope and cord that does not break very much in demand for folks boats and sailboats ysee and other key uses oh soso she was making magic when i um interrupted her no great thing if you did shes been doing it for so long wouldnt have slowed her a bit if youd been someone she wanted to see i was not that fawn sighed she blinked trying to recapture her thought so do lakewalkers go about with their grounds open too if theyre relaxed or wishful to take in the world around them at its fullest aye too lots of folks have short groundsense ranges so youre out of their sight so to speak at any little distance even if youre flaring but everyone in this campsite the children excepted had long groundsense ranges she had a sudden horrible thought but when dag and i when dag opens up to meum cutting off her words was no help cattagus was chuckling downright evilly leaving no doubt that hed caught her meaning he said me i cheer for dag even though mari hits me those redwing women are a stern sisterhood i can tell you he added to her hot blush its this breaththing ysee puts me out of the action myself mostly bout all i can do these days is wave on the luckier ones fawns blush deepened but she dimly recognized that he had handed her back this intimate revelation by way of turnabout evenall cruelty and kindness how could one morning hold so much of both folks is folks i guess she said cattagus nodded always have been always will be thats better she realized she had grown much calmer her throat no longer ached she touched the cord on her left wrist and nodded to cattaguss is mari all right this morning too so far his eyes narrowed at her cord dag did something to yours didnt he orto you fawn nodded though she flushed again to recall the exact circumstances but cattagus while he could be shrewd or crude was not meanminded and seemed unlikely to press her for private details i got my ground to go into dags cord all right by aa trick i guess when we wove them but i couldnt sense his so he did some extra groundwork on mine just before he left its good to know i could find him if i had to or he me i suppose cattagus opened his mouth stopped blinked beg pardon she held up her wrist closed her eyes and turned about opening them she found herself facing west into the woods that way its pretty vague but i reckon if i got closer the sense of just where he is would grow tighter it did the other morning when he was nearby anyhow she turned and looked in surprise at cattaguss climbing brows dont everyones cords do that no oh cattagus rubbed his nose wasnt exactly the cord he did the work on i think best not to mention that trick to anyone else till he gets back why not um well lets just say if dag wants to add any complications to his argument with the camp council let him pick and choose them himself there was an undercurrent but in what direction it flowed fawn could scarcely guess all right she said doubtfully wistful she stared west again when do you think theyll come back he shrugged no knowing but his eyes seemed to know too much fawn nodded not so much in agreement as silent sympathy and took herself off to her tent she needed to think of a new project for her hands not knitting the sun was climbing toward noon she hoped it lit dags path wherever it was now winding dead silence thought dag was never a truer phrase the high summer sun beat down on a winter landscape the marshland open to his gaze looked as if it had suffered a week of killing frost what should have been high green stands of reeds lay flattened and tangled browning the line of planted poplars along which his patrol was ghosting looked ghostly themselves yellowing leaves spinning down one by one in the breezeless air the air itself was hot moist close as only a raintree summer could be but devoid of the whine and whirr of insects empty of birdcalls it was a blight indeed when even the mosquitoes lay dead floating with rafts of miscellaneous pond wrack in long gray smears atop the blank water the undersides of a couple of dead turtles made dim yellow patches in the murk the blue sky reflected there in crooked strips weird contrast to the scum the blighted soil nipped at his feet yet without the deeper sucking drain on his ground that marked land long occupied by a malice more dag could not feel that dry shock in his midsection like the reverberation of some great blow to the body that told him a malice lay near cautiously he stood up for a better view of the ruined lakewalker village that lay along the shore across a quarter mile of open water crouched down in the dead and dying weeds behind dag mari hissed nervous warning its not here he breathed to her she frowned nodded acceptance of this but whispered back its slaves might still be he dared to open his groundsense just a little swallowing against the nausea induced by so much recent blight beating against him when he was sure he wasnt going to vomit he opened himself further nothing fluttered in his perception but a few distraught blackbirds fled from the earlier disruption returning to search futilely for mates or nests theres nothing alive for a milewait he hunkered down again a few hundred paces beyond the village in a boggy stretch along the shore something swirled in his senses a familiar concentration of distorted ground ground around the patch seemed to seep toward it creeping through the soil like draining water he narrowed his eyes searched more carefully i believe theres a mudman nursery planted beyond the camp it doesnt seem to have guards just now though but theres something else maris brows twitched up and her frown deepened youd think it would be watched if anything was dag considered the possibility of a cleverly baited trap that would seem to credit this malice with an unlikely degree of foresight however he handsignaled mari who passed the order silently and the patrol took up its stealthy painfully slow veiled approach once more skirting through the scant cover around the edge of this lakelike section of the larger marsh until it reached the abandoned village or what was left of it perhaps ninety or a hundred dwellings were strung along the lakeside or back from it in kin clusters home till lately of a community of over a thousand lakewalkers with another thousand souls scattered more widely around bonemarsh a dozen tentcabins were burned to the ground the recent rain had extinguished all coals signs of hasty flight were all around but aside from the burned tents there was only a little mindless destruction dag did not see or smell corpses only partly reassuring as groundripped bodies were sometimes very slow to rot still he permitted himself the hope that most here had escaped fleeing southward lakewalkers knew how to pick up and run then he wondered what that little farmer town the malice was supposed to have come up under looked like right now what would spark have done ifhe cut off the wrenching thought he reached the log wall of the last tent standing and peered uncertainly toward the boggy patch a couple hundred paces off back from it a thicket of scrubby treeswillow slim green ash vicious trithorned honey locustshaded something dark about their boles that he could barely make out with his eye he opened his groundsense again flinched then snapped it back mari codo to me he said over his shoulder mari was at his side at once codo the oldest patroller here but for mari slid forward in a moment and joined them theres somebody under those trees dag murmured not mudmen not farmer slaves i think its some of us somethings very wrong alive asked mari peering too the half dozen figures didnt move yes butextend your groundsenses carefully dont get caught up see if its anything you recognize because i think i do codo gave him a dry glance from under gray brows silent commentary on dags earlier repeated insistence that no one open their grounds without a direct order both he and mari stared with eyes opened then closed not seen anything like that before muttered mari unconscious groundlocked said codo ah yes thats it said mari but why are they dag recountedsix with his eyes five with his groundsense which suggested one was a corpse i think theyre tied to those trees he turned to maris partner dirla hovering anxiously the rest of you stay back codo mari come with me there was no cover between here and the stand of scrub dag gave up the fraying pretense of stealth and walked openly forward codo and mari right on his heels the bonemarsh lakewalkers were indeed bound to the thicker tree boles slumped or halfhanging they appeared unconscious three men and three women older for the most part they seemed makers not patrollers if dag could guess from their look and the remains of their clothing some bore signs of physical struggle bruises and cuts others did not one woman was dead waxy and still dag hesitated to touch her to check for the stiffness or lack of it that would tell him how long but not very long he suspected late again old patroller codo hissed and drew his knife starting for the ropes that bound the prisoners wait said dag eh codo scowled at him dag what is this asked mari do you know aye i think so a new malice has to stay by its mudman nursery to keep them growing part of what keeps it tied to its lair even after its no longer sessile this malice has gotten strong enough toto farm out the task its linked up these makers to make its mudmen for it while it goesoff dag glanced southward uneasily codo breathed a silent whistle through pursed lips can we break them out of their groundlock said mari eyes narrowing not sure but wait what i dont know is how much of a sense the malice has of them at whatever distance its gone now if we fool with them with this groundwork might be an announcement that were here behind it dag you cant be thinking of leaving them said codo in a shocked voice mari looked not so much shocked as grim wait dag repeated and turned to walk toward the boggy patch the other two exchanged glances and followed every few feet along he found a shallow pit in the wet soil looking like a mud pot dug by playing children at the center of each a snout broke the surface usually flexing frantically to draw air he identified muskrat raccoon possum beaver even squirrel and slow cold turtle all were starting to lose their former shapes like caterpillars in a chrysalis but none had yet grown to human size he counted perhaps fifty well thats handy said codo looking over his shoulder with fascinated revulsion we can kill them in their holes save a lot of grief these arent going to be ready to come out for days yet said dag maybe weeks we take the malice down first theyll die in place what are you thinking dag said mari im thinking of how much i didnt want to be in command of this jaunt because of decisions like this he sighed im thinking that the rest of the company is half a day behind us im thinking that if we can get some drinking water down those poor folks theyll last till nightfall and obio can cut them loose instead and we wont have given away our position to the malice in fact the reverseitll think any pursuit is still back here how far ahead of us do you think this malice is by now said codo dag shook his head well scout around for clues but not more than a day wouldnt you guess its plain the malice has gathered up everything its got and pressed south which says to me its on the attack which also says to me it wont be looking behind it much you mean to follow fast as we can said mari anyone here got a better idea they both shook their heads if not happily they returned to the patrol now gathered warily in the village dag dispatched a pair to go get saun and bring up the horses sending the rest to scout around the desolation the malice had left about the time saun arrived with their mounts varleen found the butchering place back in the scrub where the malices forces had eaten their last meal bones animal and human mixed some burned some gnawed raw dag counted perhaps a dozen human individuals in the remains for sure but not more he tried hard to hang on to that not more as a heartening thought but failed fortunately there was no way for the three patrollers most recently familiar with bonemarsh camp to recognize anyone among the disjointed carcasses the burying too dag left for obio and the company following his veiled patrol had been keyed up for a desperate attack gearing back down for a quiet hasty lunch instead especially for the ones whod seen the butchery went ill and dag had no desire to linger if only for the certainty that the fierce argument over whether to attempt to release the groundlocked makers would start up again saun was particularly unhappy about that one as he recognized some of them from the two years hed patrolled out of bonemarsh before hed exchanged to hickory lake what if obio chooses another route saun protested you left him free to soon as we take the malice down tonight or tomorrow well send someone back said dag wearily soon as we take the malice down they may well be able to free themselves this argument was in dags view even more dodgy but saun accepted it or at least shut up which was all dag wanted at this point his own greatest regret was for the time theyd lost in their stealthy onfoot approach they might have ridden into the village at a canter for all the difference it would have made dag suspected they were now going to come up on the malice well after dark exhausted at the end of a much too long and disturbing day part of a commanders task was to bring his people to the test at the peak of their condition and will hed fumbled both time and timing here tracking the malice south presented no difficulty at least starting just beyond the marsh it had left a trail of blight a hundred paces wide that a farmer could not have missed let alone anyone with the least tinge of groundsense at the end of this one malice guaranteed finding it would be dead easy now the malice not finding us first will be the hard part dag grimaced and kicked copperhead forward at a trot his troubled patrol strung out in his wake a nother night attackwithout the aid of groundsense this time gods im as blind in the dark as any farmer dag had feared the flare of their grounds would alert the malices outlying pickets to his patrol but blundering bodily into sentries in the murk now seemed as likely a risk a misshapen moon was well up when they cleared these trees he might get a better look at what lay ahead he glanced right and left at the shadows that were his flankers mari and dirla and codo and hann and was reassured if his darkadapted eyes could scarcely make them out neither could an enemys he dared another deerlike step forward and another trying not to think blight it weve done this once today already his patrol had come up on signs of the malices massed forces soon after midnight and again left their horses in favor of this stealthy approach through terrain for which unlike bonemarsh they had no maps or plan or prior knowledge if his own exhaustion was a measure of everyone elses dag distrusted his decision to strike at once without allowing a breather but it was impossible to rest here and every delay risked discovery they had come into a level country with little farms carved out of the woods becoming more and more common not unlike the region above west blue little abandoned farms dag hoped all the people hereabouts had been warned by the refugees from bonemarsh and fled to farmers flats the open fields allowed a glimpse ahead but equally denied cover as they reached the scrubby edge of what had been a broad stand of wheat now flattened and dying dirla stole over to him see that she breathed pointing aye on the fields other side wooded land roseas much as any land rose in these partsangling up to a low ridge the red glimmer of a few bobbing torches shone through the trees then vanished again silvered by the sickly moon a narrow triangular structure crowned the crest a crude timber tower perhaps twenty feet high built of logs hastily felled and notched to lock across one another was briefly silhouetted against a distant milky cloud whatever shapes crouched on the plank platform at its top were too far away for dag to make out with his eyes but despite his tight closure the threat of the malice beat in his belly with his every pulse lookout post dirla whispered dag shook his head worse absent gods help us this malice was advanced enough to start building towers even the wolf ridge malice had not developed enough for that compulsion can you see how many on the platform dirlas younger eyes might be sharper than his own just one i think its up there then thats where were headed pass the word she nodded and silently withdrew now they had to get next to that tower without being spotted so nearacross a trampled field and up a wooded hillsideso far dag guessed that the bulk of the malices mudmen and mindslaves were camped on the ridges far side probably along a stream smoke from hidden campfires rose in thin gray wisps into a high haze confirming his speculation there was almost no wind and he regretted the absence of covering rustles from the branches overhead but what faint breeze there was moved the haze toward him he hardly needed his eyes now he could smell the enemy smoke manure piss the cooking of hedarednotguesswhat meats dag pushed through clutching blackberry brambles setting his teeth against the gouge and scrape of sturdy thorns and crouched by a fieldstone wall lining the high side of the wheatfield he half crawled forward along its shadowed western side until he reached brambles again then risked a look back the moon emerged from a cloud but the tight shapes of the patrollers following him did not once edge into the thin light good you folks are so good half the distance down he slid through more dying brambles into the black shade of the woods at the base of the ridge the patrol too spreading out to ease from shadow to shadow to his horror a muffled grunt and some thumps sounded from his left he made his way hastily toward the sound codo and hann were crouching over something halfconcealed in a crackling deadfall hann had drawn his war knife but glanced up and froze when dags hand fell on his arm codo squatted across the chest of a grizzled manfarmerslave guard both his hands tight around the struggling fellows throat hann hurry codo hissed dag touched codos shoulder eased in and studied their threatandvictim farmerslave yes clothes ragged eyes wild and mad maybe from this farm or else picked up along the way to add to the malices straggling growing army he wasnt a big man or young he reminded dag uncomfortably of sorrel bluefield dag took aim and landed several hard blows to the mans head until his eyes rolled back and he stopped bucking the meaty thumps sounded as loud as drumbeats in dags ears blight it throat slittings quieter muttered codo cautiously rising surer dag shook his head and pointed uphill this was no place for an argument and the pair did not give him one but turned to continue the silent climb dag could roll the issues over in his head without need of wordshanns glare burning through the dark was enough to make the point a throatslit guard couldnt claw his way back to consciousness in a few minutes and raise the alarm i hate fighting humans of all the vileness in this long struggle the malices mindtheft of people who should be the lakewalkers friends and allies was the worst even when the patrollers won they lost in clashes that left farmer corpses in their wake we all lose dag shook out his throbbing hand that might have been sorrel somebodys husband father fatherinlaw friend i hate fighting oh fawn im so tired of this the farmers mad eyes were sign enough of his enslaved state with no need for dags groundsense to trace the malices grip in his mind even though they hadnt slit his throat his brief alarm could have given little warning surely indeed dag decided the malice would be more likely to notice the shock of a death in its growing web of slaves than what might be mistaken for a sort of sleep much depended on how many individuals this malice controlled at what distance attempting what tasks please let it be stretched to its limits whatever it was now doing at the top of that tower ground was flowing toward it in a great sucking drain dag could feel the mortal throb of it passing under his boot soles he had a wild vision of gripping the streaming power with his ghost hand and just letting it tow him right up the slope the patrol reached the edge of the clearing bristling with stumps from the trees felled to build the towerwithin the last day dag guessed from the stillpungent smell of the sap in the faint moonlight he could make out the hulking shapes of at least four mudman guards at the towers base maybe bearmen or even bullmen big lithe stinking without need for orders he could sense his pairs moving to the front his stomach clenched and he fought down a wave of nausea time to clear the path at some faint clink or whisper of a weapon drawn from a sheath a guardians head turned toward them it lifted its snout sniffing suspiciously now dag did not cry his command just yanked out his war knife and plunged forward weaving around stumps his thoughts narrowed to his task slay the mudmen get his knifewielders past them and up the tower as fast as death faster dag took on the nearest mudman to hand ducking as it brought up a rusted sword stolen from whoknewwhere and swung violently at his head dags return stroke tore out the creatures throat and he didnt even bother dodging the spray of blood arrows from patrols archers whispered fiercely past his head to sink into the chest of a mudman beyond although the shafts didnt drop it the mudman staggered forward roaring mari her sharing knife clenched between her teeth reached the tower and began to climb codo darted past her around the towers corner and swung himself upward too another patroller reached the tower and another all in that same intent silence the rest turned to protect their climbing comrades dag could hear them engaging new mudmen reaching the clearing as yet more came crashing up the hill yowling in alarm the dark shape at the top of the tower moved standing up against a cobalt sky scattered with stars and luminous with moonwashed cloud the four climbers had almost reached the top suddenly the figure crouched leapeddescended as if floating the full twenty feet to land upon its folding legs and spring again upright as if it were light as a dancer and not seven solid feet of corded muscle sinew and bone it wheeled coming facetoface with dag this malice was lean almost graceful and dag was shocked by its beauty in the moonlight fair skin moved naturally over a face of sculpted bone hair swept back from its high brow to flow like a river of night down its back its androgynous body was clothed in stolen oddmentstrousers a shirt boots a lakewalker leather vestwhich it somehow endowed with the air of some ancient high lords attire how many molts must it have gone through how quickly to have achieved such a humanno superhumanform its glamour wrenched dags gaze and he could feel his ground ripplehe snapped himself closed tight and hard and open again as utau sharing knife out staggered with a sudden cry dag could sense the strain in utaus ground as the malice turned and gripped it starting to rip it away frantic dag extended his left arm and stretched out his ghost hand to snatch at the malices ground in turn out of the corner of his eye dag saw mari clinging to the tower side drop her sharing knife down in a pale spinning arc to dirla who had temporarily broken free of mudmen as a fragment of its ground came away in dags ghost hand the malice turned back to him with an astonished scream dag recalled that moment in the medicine tent when hed snatched ground from hoharies apprentice but this time it felt like clutching a live coal pain and terror reverberated up his left arm he tried to cast the fragment into the earth but it clung to his ground like burning honey the malice reached twohanded toward dag its dark eyes wide and furious dag tried again to close himself against it and failed he could feel the malices grip upon his ground tighten and his breath locked at the surge of astounding pain that seemed to start from his marrow and strike outward to his skin as if all his bones were being shattered in place simultaneously and dirla lunged forward onto a stump and plunged maris sharing knife into the malices back dag felt the dying enter his own shredding ground cloudy and turbulent as blood poured into roiling water for a moment he shared the malices full awareness the worlds ground stretched away from their center for miles glowing like fire with slaves and mudmen moving across it in scattered blazing ranks the confusing din of their several hundred no thousand anguished minds battered his failing consciousness the malices vast will seemed to drain from them as dag watched leaving blackness and dismay the irrational intelligence of the great being snatched at his own mind hungry above all for understanding of its plight and dag knew that if this malice took him in it would have nearly all it needed and yet still not be saved from its own cravings and desires it is quite mad and the more intelligent it grows the more agonizing its own madness becomes to it it seemed a curious but useless insight to gain here at the end of breath and light the malice screamed again its voice rising strangely like a song wavering upward into unexpected purity its beautiful body ruptured caught by its clothing and it fell in a welter of blood and fluid the earth rose up and struck dag cruelly in the back stars spun overhead and went out fawn shot awake in the dark and sat up in her lonely bedroll with a gasp shock shuddered through her body then a wash of fear a noise a nightmare no echoes pulsed in her ears no visions faded in her mind her heart pounding unaccountably she slapped her right hand over her left wrist this panic was surely the opposite of relaxed persuasion and openness but beneath her marriage cord her whole arm was throbbing somethings happened to dag hurt hurt bad she scrambled up and pushed through her tent flap into the milky light of a partial moon seeming bright compared to the inky shadows inside not stopping to throw anything over her sleeping shift she picked her way across the clearing wincing at the twigs and stones that bit her bare feet it was all that kept her from breaking into a run she hesitated outside cattagus and maris tent the night was cool after the recent rains and cattagus had dropped the porch flap down she slapped it as utau had theirs on the dark morning hed come to wake dag she tried to guess the time from the moon passing over the laketwo hours after midnight maybe there was no sound from within and she pounded the leather again then shifted from foot to foot trying to gather the nerve to go inside and shake the old man by the shoulder before she did the flap moved on sarris tent and the darkhaired woman emerged she had paused for sandals but no robe either and her feet slapped quickly across the stretch between the two tentcabins did you feel that fawn asked her anxiously keeping her voice low for fear of waking the children and then felt utterly stupid for of course sarri would not feel anything from a marriage cord wrapped around someone elses wrist did you feel anything just now sarri shook her head something woke me whatever it was was gone by the time id gathered my wits her right hand too gripped her left wrist kneading razi and utau alive alive at least that she shot fawn a curious look did you feel something surely you couldnt have she was interrupted by a grunt from the tent cattagus shouldered through the flap tying up his shorts around his stout middle and scowling whats all this tooroo in the moonlight girlies fawn says she felt something in her cord woke her up sarri added as if reluctant to endorse this i woke up too but there wasntanything mari the same gesture right hand over left although by putting on an expression of exasperation cattagus tried unsuccessfully to make it not look anxious he shook his head maris all right he added after a moment of reflection alive at least what in the wide green world can all those galloping fools be about over there at this time of night he glanced west as if his eyes could somehow penetrate a hundred and more miles and see the answer but that feat was beyond even his lakewalker powers a fact his dry snort seemed to acknowledge the two women followed his stare uneasily look now he said as if in persuasion if utau razi mari and dag are all still alive the company cant be in that much trouble because you know that bunchd find the manure pile first sarri blew out her breath in not quite a laugh accepting the thin reassurance as much fawn guessed for his sake as her own specially dag cattagus added under his breath you wonder what fairbolt thought he was about to put cattagus fawn took a deep breath and thrust out her arm my cord feels funny can you figure out anything from it his gray brows rose not likely but he took her wrist gently in his hand anyway his lips moved briefly as if in surprise but then schooled away a scowl to some more guarded line well hes alive theres that cant have got himself groundripped if hes alive more lakewalker secrets no one had bothered to mention whats groundripped cattagus exchanged a look with sarri but before fawn could grit her teeth in frustration relented and said same as what that malice down in glassforge did to your childie i take it cept lakewalkersgrown can resist close their grounds against it if the malice is a sessile or is not too strong yet what if it is strong fawn asked in worry wellthey say its a quick death no chance to share though cattagus frowned sternly but see here girlie dont you go imagining things all night your boys alive isnt he now eh fawn had trouble thinking of dag as a boy but the your part she clutched hard to her heart her wrists crossed over her chest dags mine yes not some blighting malices maybe its over said sarri in a low voice i hope its over when would we know asked fawn cattagus shrugged his ropy shoulders from the middle of raintree good news could get here in three days bad news in two very bad newswell we wont worry about that ah go back to bed girlies he shook his head and set the example by ducking back inside wheezing pointedly fawn thought sarri shook her head in unwitting echo of her testy uncle sighed deeply and made her way back to her tent and her sleeping children fawn picked her way slowly back to little tent bluefield she dutifully lay down but returning to sleep was beyond futile after tossing for a time she rose again and took out her drop spindle and a bundle of plunkin flax and went out in the moonlight to clamber up on her favorite tall spinningstump at least she might have something to show for her nightrestlessness the tap of the gold beads flicking on her wrist as she spun was normally cheerful and soothing but tonight felt more like fingers drumming flick spin shape she wished she could put spells for protection into her trouser cloth the way a lakewalker wife likely could she could spin her thread strong weave it tight sew it soundly doublestitched and secure she could make with all her heart but it would only give the ordinary expected armoring of cloth on skin not enough flick spin shape three days till any news huh i dont like this waiting part not one bit the helpless anxiety was worse than shed expected it to be and she felt pushed offbalance no more do sarri or cattagus like it either thats plain enough but you dont catch them carrying on about it do you her own unease wasnt special just for being new to her she felt she suddenly had more insight into lakewalker moodiness her assurances to dag before hed ridden off seemed in retrospect unduly blithe andwell if not stupid a word hed tried to forbid her certainly ignorant im learning now again flick spin shape if dag died on patrolher eyes went to her wrist cord still alive yes it was a safely theoretical thought she could dare to think it if something happened to him out there what would become of me despite hickory lakes fascinations without dag she knew she had no roots here while these lakewalkers seemed unlikely to cast her out naked she had no doubt fairbolt would whisk her back to west blue in two shakes of a lambs tail likely with a patroller to make sure she arrived seemed like his idea of responsible but she had no roots in west blue now either shed cut them off if not without a pang without compunction twice cutting them a third time wasnt a task she wished to face if she couldnt stay here and she wouldnt go back it was a measure perhaps of what this sometimeshorrendous year had done for her that she found this thought curiously undaunting there was glassforge there was silver shoals beyond on the grace river an even finer town by dags descriptions there was a world of possibility for an ungrass widow with determination and her wits held close about her she was practical she knew how to walk down strange roads now shed come this far she didnt have to cling to dag like a drowning woman clutching the only branch in the torrent everybody it seemed wanted dag for something fairbolt crow wanted him for a patroller his mother wanted him to demonstrate the high value of her bloodline maybe to prove her worth through his his brother dar wanted him to not make a fuss or be a distractionto stay quiet safe inside the rules ignorable fawn wasnt sure but what she should add herself into that tally because she certainly wanted dag for the father of her children someday except dag seemed to be thinking along those lines himself so maybe that one was mutual and didnt count didnt anyone want dag just for dag without justification like a milkweed or a water lily or ora summer night with fireflies because later in some very dry places the memory of that hour was enough for going on with she had to stop spinning then because she couldnt see through the silver light blurring in her eyes she dashed her hand against her hot eyelids to clear her vision twice then just let the tears run down sitting bent to her knees with her wrist cord pressed to her forehead it took a long time to make her breathing stop hitching my hearts prize my best friend my true consolationwhat trouble have you gone and found this time her arm was still throbbing though more faintly alive yes butshe might be just a farmer girl without a speck of groundsense in her body she might be any one of a hundred kinds of fool she might be ignorant of a thousand lakewalkerish things but of this she was increasingly certain this is not good this is something very wrong the insides of his eyelids were red not black there was light out there somewhere warm dawn or warm fire his curiosity as to which was not enough to make him drag open the heavy weights his lids had become he remembered panicked voices and thinking he should get up and fix the cause whatever it was he should someone had been shouting about utau and raziof course it would be razitrying to match grounds maris voice sharp and scared try to get in blight it im not losing our captain after all that fairbolt was here when had that happened someone else i cant his grounds too tight and later cant oh gods that hurts and so if it does that to you what do you figure its doing to him maris tart voice at its least sympathetic dag felt for her victim whoever he was more gasping i cant i cant im sorry the panicked voices had faded then and dag had been glad maybe they would all go away and leave him be im so tired he breathed twitched his gluey eyes opened on their own halfdead tree branches laced the paling blue of a new dawn on one side orange flames crackled up from a roaring campfire deliciously warm dawn and fire both ah that solved the mystery on his other side maris face wavered into view between him and the sky her dry voice spoke bout time you reported for duty again patroller he tried to move his lips her hand pressed his brow that was a joke dag you just lie there her hand went to his under blankets it seemed finally warming up too good he swallowed and found his lost voice how many eh how many died last night assuming the malice kill was last night he had mislaid days before under unpleasantly similar conditions now youve seen fit to grace us with your gloomy face againnone that couldnt be right saun what of saun left with the horses dag pictured the youth attacked in the dark by mudmen alone bloodied overwhelmedsaun here captain sauns anxiously smiling face loomed over maris shoulder that must have been a dream or a hallucination or this was did he get to pick which he drew breath enough to get out whats happened dirla took the malice mari began i got that far saw you drop your knife to her maris sons bone he managed to moisten his lips didnt think youd ever let that out of your hand aye well i remembered your tale of how you and the little farmer girl got the glassforge malice dirla was closer and the malice was intent on utau i saw the chance and took it utau he repeated urgently yes the malice had been about to rip the ground from his body mari gripped his shoulder through the blankets malice grazed him no question but razi brought him home you nowthats the closest ive ever heard tell of anyone getting his ground ripped without actually dying never seen a man look more like a corpse and still breathe drink said saun putting an arm under dags shoulders to lift him a bit oh good idea it was only stale water from a skin but it was wonderfully wet water wettest hed ever drunk dag decided thankee and after a moment how many of us lost none dag said saun eagerly mari frowned go on eh after that it was all over but the shoutin of which there was the usual said mari sent two pairs to retrieve saun and the horses and kept the rest close to guard our camp from hazard let four off to sleep a bit ago she nodded across the fire toward some sodden unmoving bundles stretched on bedrolls dag raised his head to look beside one of them razi sat crosslegged he smiled tiredly at dag and sent him a vague salute what of the farmerslaves there werent as many right by here as wed thought seems the malice had sent most of its slaves and mudmen marching off through the woods for some dawn attack on a town just northwest of farmers flats i imagine theyre having a right mess down there this morning gods know what those poor farmers thought when the malice fog lifted from their minds and their mudmen scampered i havent much tried to herd the folks we found here though we did check out their camp and suggest no one try to travel home alone most of em have gone off by now to try and find friends and family understandable welcome even it might be cowardice but dag didnt want to try to deal with distraught farmers this morning atop everything else let the raintree lakewalkers take care of their own dags brow wrinkled how many did we lose last night mari drew a long breath and leaned forward to peer into his face dag are you tracking me at all course im tracking you dag unwound his left arm from his blankets and waved his hook at her how many fingers am i holding up except it occurred to him that on some very disturbing level he did not know the answer mari rolled her eyes in exasperation saun bless him looked adorably confused well we still dont know about those makers we left at bonemarsh saun offered hesitantly mari turned to glare at him saun dont you dare start that up again with him now yes that was his missing piece the thing hed been trying so desperately to remember dag sighed if not exactly in satisfaction we havent heard from obio and the company yet said mari but theres scarcely been time they might have reached there hours ago they might have taken some other route said saun stubbornly it looked to turn into a bright day people tied up outdoors in such heat without drink or food could die of exposure in a surprisingly short time even without the added stress of whatever the malices groundlockor ground linkhad done to them if even one prisoner could release himself hed surely free the rest but suppose none could the throbbing headache of nightmare crept back up the base of dags skull we have to go back to bonemarsh saun nodded in eagerness ill ride ahead not alone you wont said mari sharply dag got out i left themyesterday because i could count but today i can go back yes as quickly as might be there was something wrong and i knew it but there was no time and i knew that too i have to get back there enough human sacrifice for one malice enough mari sat back dubious make you a deal dag if you can get your fool self up on your fool horse all by yourself ill let you ride it if not youre staying right here dag grinned wanly youll lose that bet saun help me sit up the boy slid an arm under his shoulders again dags head drained nearly to blackness as he came upright but he kept his blinking eyes open somehow see mari i wager theres not a mark on me your grounds so tight its cramping you cant tell me you didnt take hurt under there what does it feel like asked saun diffidently a ground rip that is dag squinted deciding saun was due an honest answer right now a lot like blood loss truth to tell it doesnt hurt anywhere in particularjust everywhere generallybut i admit im not my best mari snorted if he ate perhaps he would gain strength enough toeat hm mari went off to deal with less intractable people and saun as anxious for the bonemarsh makers as dag made it his business to get dag ready to ride while saun fed him dag took counsel with mari and codo to split the patrol sending six south to find the raintree lakewalkers and report on the malice kill and the rest north with him to with luck rendezvous with the rest of the company at bonemarsh in the event dag half cheated and used a stump to mount copperhead mari mounting from another stump eyed him narrowly but let it pass the horse was too tired to fight him which was fortunate because he was way too tired to fight back he let saun take the lead in the ride back north swifter for the daylight the lack of need for stealth and the knowing where they were going but slower for everyones exhaustion dag sat his horse and wavered in and out of awareness pretending to be dozing while riding like any good old patroller utau slumping in his saddle and closely shepherded by razi looked almost as laid waste as dag felt dag let his groundsense stay shut as it seemed to want it reminded him of the way a man might walk tilted to guard a wound maybe as for blood loss time and rest would provide the remedy he tried once to sneak out his ghost hand but nothing occurred the thought of the treebound makers he had so ruthlessly abandoned yesterday haunted his hazy thoughts he searched the memory of his glimpse of the malices mind for a hint of them but could recover only a sense of overwhelming confusion the makers fate seemed to hang in the air like some absent gods cruel revenge upon his wild hope scarcely admitted even to himself if only if only i could get through this captaincy without losing anyone i could stop if only he could balance the long weight of wolf ridge would it dag was dubious of his mortal arithmetic in the long run no one gets out alive you know that they passed into and out of a slatelined ravine letting the horses drink as they crossed the creek he could swear theyd passed this same ford not twelve hours ago pointed the other way dizzied he pressed copperhead forward into the hot summer morning d ag knew they were approaching bonemarsh again by the growing dampness of the soil and air and a brightening in the corner of his eye as the flat woods opened out into flatter water meadows he had been staring at nothing but the coarse rusty hairs of copperheads mane for the past hour but looked up as saun muffled an oath and kicked his tired horse into a canter above the bonemarsh shore life of a sort had returned a flock of turkey vultures the fingerlike fringes of their wing tips unmistakable on their black silhouettes as they wheeled his impulse to canter after saun was easily resisted as neither he nor copperhead was capable of more than a trot right now the jolting of which would have tormented his sagging back andhe didnt want to look he let his horse walk on as they neared the south margin of the marsh dag straightened squinting in guarded hope the vultures were circling over the woods back behind the village not over the boggy patch along the shore maybe theyd merely found the unburied carcasses from the mudmens feast maybe the rest of his veiled patrol turned onto the shore track and dag craned his neck heart thumping there were several horses tethered around the scrubby trees sauns now among them the rest of the company had made it good some of them at least enough dag could see figures moving in the shade then his heart clenched again at the glimpse of several long lumps on the ground he couldnt tell if the faces were covered or not bedrolls please let it be bedrolls and not shrouds had the company only just arrived because surely the next task would be to move the rescued makers off this halfblighted ground to some healthier campsite but obio was here thank all the absent gods striding out to wave greeting as they rode up dag obio cried youre hereabsent gods be praised his voice seemed to hold more than just relief to see dag alive it had the shaken timbre of a man with a crisis desperately seeking someone else to hand it to one of us is thanking the absent gods too soon i think dag tried to get both eyes open at once and brace his spine at least enough to dismount after which he was determined not to climb back into that saddle again for a long long time he slid down and clung to his stirrup leather for a moment partly for support as he woozily adjusted to standing again partly because he could barely remember what he was trying to do sauns anxious voice brought him back to the moment you have to see this captain he turned moistened his lips got out how many did we lose he felt too close to weeping and he feared frightening saun with his fragility he wanted to explain reassure fellows get like this after sometimes youll see it if youre around long enough but saun was babbling on everyones alive that was yesterday except now theres a new problem in a dim effort to fend it all off for just a moment longer like a man pulling his blanket over his head when called from his bedroll by raucous comrades dag blinked at obio and asked in a voice raspy with fatigue when did you get here last night where is everyone weve set up a camp about a mile east just off the blight obio waved toward a distant greener tree line i rested the company yesterday morning then sent scouts out after you i started us all toward here at midafternoon closing up the distance in case you know we were getting pretty worried toward dusk when my scouts hadnt come back and my flankers ran into a couple of mudmen they did for them pretty quick but it was plain you hadnt got the malice when youd planned no later couple hours after midnight about twenty miles south so saun just said but ifwell heres griff my scout who found this let him tell a worriedlooking fellow of about dirlas age came up and gave dag a nod griff had been walking for ten years and in dags experience was levelheaded and reliable which made his current rumpled wildeyed appearance just that much more disturbing gods dag im so glad youre here dag controlled a wince leaning his arm along copperheads back for secret support what happened and added prudently as griffs distraught look deepened from the beginning griff gulped and nodded the two pairs of us scouts came down here to bonemarsh late yesterday afternoon we could track where your veiled patrol had passed through right enough we figuredwell hopedthat the malice had moved off and you all had moved after it then we found these makers tied to the treeshe glanced over his shoulderand then we thought maybe you must have been captured instead because good patrollers dont abandon their own charitable griff no we left them tied passed them by dag admitted griff straightened to dags surprise the look on his face was not horror or contempt but respect he asked earnestly how did you know it was a trap trap what dag shook his head i didnt they were a sacrifice to pure tactics i didnt want to chance warning the malice there were patrollers coming up this close behind it you said there was something really wrong saun corrected this frowning and to keep our grounds shut tight when we were touching them that wasnt exactly a stretch of my wits by that point saun go on griff we could see they were groundlocked seemed to be so mallora did what you do to someone groundlocked reached in and bumped grounds to break them out of the trance exceptinstead of her waking them up the groundlock just seemed to to reach out and suck her in her eyes rolled back and she crumpled up in a heap the mudpuppies all out in their pots over theregriff waved toward the bogmade these strange bubbling noises and flopped around when it happened made us jump in the dusk i didnt notice how silent it all really was till then malloras partner bryn panicked i thinkshe reached out for her tried to drag her back and she got sucked in after i grabbed my partner ornig before he could reach for bryn dag nodded provisionally but griffs face was tightening in something like despair dag murmured it used to happen up in luthlia sometimes in the winter someone would fall through rotten ice and their friends or their kin would try to pull them out and instead be pulled in after one after another instead of running for help or a ropethough the smart patrollers there always wore a length of rope wrapped around their waists in the cold season except if someones slipped under the icewell never mind the hardest thingthe hardest thing in such a string of tragedy was to be the one who stopped but you bet the older folks understood griff blinked back tears ducking his head in thanks he swallowed for control of his voice and went on ornig and i agreed he would stay and i would go for help and i rode hard but i think i should have stayed because when we made it backhe swallowed againthe makers were all cut down from the trees as if ornig had tried to make them more comfortable but ornig was all in a heap he must havetried something he added after a moment hes sweet on bryn see dag nodded understanding and stepped away from copperhead to get a closer look at what was going on in the grove if only he could find a tree to lean againstnot that honey locust bole and branches bristling with clusters of nasty tripleheaded spineshis hand found a low branch from a young wild cherry and he gripped it and peered three or four patrollers at least one of whom dag recognized as one of the companys better medicine makers moved among bedrolls laid out where space permitted he counted eight more and more at risk someone had a campfire going though and something heating in potsdrinking water medicine all good but there was something deeply wrong with the pictureoh why havent you moved them off this blighted ground mari dirla and razi had dismounted during griffs recitation moving closer to listen razi still held the reins of utaus horse utau drooped over his saddlebow squinting dag wasnt sure how much of this he was taking in we tried said obio soon as you carry someone more than about a hundred paces away they stop breathing must have been a thrill finding that out mari said oh aye agreed obio fervent in the middle of the night last night and if you kill one of the mudmen in their mudholes griff added morosely the people scream in their sleep its pretty blighted unnerving so we stopped that too i figured said obio that ifwhensomeone caught up with the malice the groundlock would break on its own i intended to detail a few folks to look after them and take the company on as soon as enough scouts came back to give me a guess what we ought to try next exceptyou say you all did for the malice but that ugly groundlocks still holding tight dirla did said dag with maris sharing knife your first personal kill i believe dirla it was a shame that the congratulations and celebration that should have been hers were being overwhelmed in this new crisis dirla nodded absently she frowned past dag at the unmoving figures in the shaded bedrolls could there be more than one malice and thats why this link didnt break last night dag tried to think this utterly horrible idea through logically but his brains seemed to be slowly turning to porridge his gut said no right enough but he couldnt for the life of him say why not in words mari came to his rescue no because our malice would have turned all it had toward fighting the second instead of chasing after farmers and lakewalkers malices dont team upthey eat each other well that was true too but thats not it thats what i thought said dirla but then why didnt this stop when the malice died like what it does to the farmers and the mudmen maddening question lakewalkers it must have to do with lakewalkersall right sighed dag im thinkingwe got water down those folks yesterday if we can get more water and some sort of foodgruel soup i dont knowdown them again we can buy a little time maybe been doing that said obio bless your wits dag nodded buy time to think keep a close eye wait for the scoutsthen decide depending im thinking we might split the companysend some volunteers to help the raintree folks with the cleanup and the rest home maybe as early as tomorrow morning so that oleana might not due to fairbolts robbed pegboard find itself facing a similar runaway malice war next season the creeping alarm of this unnatural groundlock upon a bunch of alreadynervy patrollers was clearly contagious at this point dag could scarcely tell if his own sick unease was from the makers or their distraught caretakers blight it i wish i had hoharie here she works with peoples grounds all the time maybe shed have an idea he might as well wish for that flock of turkey vultures to spiral down grab him and fly him away home while he was at it he sighed and cast an eye over his exhausted bleary comrades everyone who was with my veiled patrol is now off duty ride on over to the campget food sleep a wash whatever you want utau youre on the sick list till i say otherwise speaking of reasons to wish for the medicine maker utau roused himself enough to growl i like that if that malice scored me it scored you a lot worse i know what i feel like why are you still walking around a question dag didnt care to probe just now even if his wits had been working utau it occurred to him had been the only other patroller with his groundsense open if involuntarily in those moments of confused terror last night when dag and the malice had closed on each other what had he perceived evidently not dags disastrous attempt to rip the malice in return dag temporized until razi says otherwise then razi grinned and cast him an appreciative half salute utau snorted dag added im going to lay me a bedroll down here shortly on this blight said saun doubtfully i dont want to be a mile away if something changes suddenly mari tugged sauns sleeve and murmured if that ones actually volunteerin for a bedroll dont argue the details she gave him a significant jerk of her head and his eyes widened in enlightenment he stepped over to dirla i had more sleep last night than you did mari said dag dag i dont know what that was last night after you went down but it sure wasnt sleep sleeping men can be waked up for one wait whats all this said obio utau pushed up on his saddlebow and looked down at dag a tad ironically malice nearly ripped my ground last night dag jumped in and persuaded it to go after him instead did it rip you obio asked dag eyebrows climbing a little bit dag admitted isnt that something like being a little bit dead seemingly obio smiled uncertainly making dag wonder just how corpselike he did look at the moment he was not lovely that was certain would he make sparks eyes happy all the same i bet so a bright picture came into his head of the thrill that would flower in her face when he walked into their campsite when this was all over would she drop her handwork and run to his arms it was the first heartening thought hed had for hours days dag wondered if hed started to fall asleep standing when a voice broke up this vision which ran away like water though his hands he almost cried to have the dream back instead he forced himself to breathe deeply and pay attention can send couriers with the news now obio was saying id like to catch fairbolt before he sends off the next round of reinforcements yes of course murmured dag dirla had been talking closely with mari at this she lifted her face and called id like to volunteer for that sir youre off duty dag started to object then realized this task would certainly get dirla home first bettershe was eyewitness to the malice kill none closer if he sent her dag wouldnt have to try to pen a report in his present groggy state she could just tell fairbolt all about it you took the malice you can do any blighted thing you please dirla she nodded cheerfully then i will obio his eyes narrowing said in that case ive a fellow in mind to send with her for partner his wife was about to have a baby when we left absent gods willing she might still be about to which would cover events from the other part of the company for fairbolt too good excellent agreed mari thats a courier who wont dawdle eh youll need to trade out for fresher horses dag began well take care of it dag razi promised right right this was all routine dirla tell sparktell everyone well be home soon eh sure thing captain obio boosted mari back on her horse and she led the rest of the patrol save saun and dirla off east toward the promised camp to reassure obio and griff dag pretended to make an inspection tour of the grove and the bog for as much good as his eyes could do with his groundsense still clamped down tight there was a dead woman yesterday dag began to obio obio grunted understanding we cut her down and wrapped her and put her in one of the tents in the village im hoping some of the bonemarsh folk might come back and identify her before we have to bury her in this heat thatll have to be by tomorrow though dag nodded and trudged on the distorting animals trapped in their mud pots were much the same repellent sight as yesterday the five surviving makers and three patrollers more inexplicably trapped were at least physically supported now as comfortable as they might be made in bedrolls on the ground in the warm summer shade the other patrollers taking turns to lift them and spoon liquids into them must also be groundclosed and walking blind dag realized even apart from the hazard of this peculiar sticky groundsnare he had the irrational apprehension that opening his ground would be like a man pulling a dressing from a gut wound that all his insides might spill out he found that while his back was turned saun and dirla had unsaddled copperhead and set up dags possessions and bedroll in a flat dry spot raked clear of debris theyd been awake as long as he had blight it why were they so blighted perky blighted childrenthe moment his haunches hit his blanket dag knew he wasnt getting up again he sat staring blankly at his bootlaces transported in memory back to the night after his last malice kill with spark on the feather tick in that farmhouse kitchen he was still staring when saun knelt to undo one boot and dirla the other it was surely a measure ofsomething that he let them can i bring you anything to eat drink asked dirla dag shook his head while riding he had gnawed down a number of leathery strips of dried plunkin on the theory that he might so dispose of two tedious chores at the same time he wasnt hungry he wasnt anything saun set his boots aside and squinted out into the afternoon light upon the silent wasted marsh how long do you suppose till this place recovers centuries it looks bad now said dag but the malice was only here a few days and the blights not deep decades at most maybe not in my life but in yours id say sauns eyes pinched and he traded an unreadable look with dirla can i getdo you want anything at all captain i want spark a mistake to allow himself the thought because it bloomed instantly into a nearphysical ache in his heart yesas if there were any part of him not hurting already instead he said why am i captain all at once here you call me dag i call you hey you boy its always worked before saun grinned sheepishly but didnt answer he and dirla scrambled up dag was asleep before the pair left the grove fawn who hadnt been able to fall to sleep till nearly dawn woke in the midmorning feeling as though she had been beaten with sticks mint tea and plunkin did little to revive her she turned to her next hand task weaving string from her spun plunkin flax to make wicks for a batch of beeswax candles sarri was planning an hour into it her eyes were blurring and the throbbing in her left hand and arm was a maddening distraction that matched the throbbing in her head was it her heartbeat or dags that kept the time at least his hearts still beating she set down her work walked up the road to where the path to dars bone shack led off and stood in doubt dags his brother dar has to care fawn considered this proposition in light of her own brothers no matter how furious she might be with them would she drop her gripe if they were hurt and needed help yes because thats what family was all about in her experience they pulled together in a crisis it was just too bad about the rest of the time she set her shoulders and walked down the path into the green shade she hesitated again at the edge of the sundappled glade if she was truly parading about groundnaked as cumbia accused dar must know she was here voices carried around the corner of the shack he wasnt then deep in concentration upon some necromantic spell she continued around to find dar sitting on the top porch step with an older woman dressed in the usual summer shift her hair in a knot dar was holding a sharing knife he drew a peeved breath and looked up reluctantly acknowledging fawn fawn clenched her left wrist protectively to her breast mornin dar i had a question for you dar grunted and rose the woman with a curious glance at fawn rose too so what is it dar asked its kind of private i can come back we were just finishing wait then he turned to the woman and hefted the knife i can deconsecrate this in the afternoon do you want to come back tonight could or tomorrow morning i have another binding tomorrow morning ill make it tonight then after supper that would do the woman nodded briskly and started away then paused by fawn looking her up and down her brows rose so youre the famous farmer bride eh fawn unable to figure her tone gave a safe little kneedip she shook her head well dar your brother with this opaque pronouncement she strode off up the path by the bitter twisting of dars lips he drew more information from this than fawn could fawn let it go she had much more urgent worries right now she approached dar cautiously as if he might bite he set the knife on the porch boards and eyed her ironically too nervous to plunge straight in fawn said instead what was that woman here for her grandfather died unexpectedly in his sleep a few weeks ago without getting the chance to share she brought his knife back to be rededicated oh yes that had to happen now and then she wondered how dar did that took an old knife and bound it to the heart of someone new she wished he and she could have been friendsor even relativesthen she could have asked never mind that now she gulped and stuck out her left arm before dag rode off to raintree i asked him if he couldnt fix it sos i could feel him through my marriage cord the way he feels me and he did she prayed dar would not ask how last night about two hours after midnight i woke upthere was this hurting all up my arm sarri she woke up about the same time but all she said was that razi and utau were still alive mari too cattagus says it didnt do this beforei was afraid thati think dags hurt can you tell anything more dars face was not especially revealing but fawn thought a flash of alarm did flicker through his eyes in any case he did not snipe at her but merely took her arm and let his fingers drift up and down it his lips moved tightened he shook his head not seemingly in defeat but in a kind of exasperation gods dag he murmured can you do worse well said fawn apprehensively dar dropped her arm she clutched it to herself again wellyes i think dag has probably taken some injury no i cant be sure how much offended by his level tone fawn said dont you care dar turned his hands out if its so it wont be the first time hes been brought home on a plank ive been down this road with dag too many times i admit the fact that hes company captain is a bit worrisome if you like i cant figure what fairbolteh but you say the others are all right so they must be taking care of him the patrol looks after its own if hes not lost or separated or something fawn could imagine a hundred somethings each more dire than the last hes my husband if hes hurt i should be lookin after him what are you going to do jump on your horse and ride off into a war zone to lose yourself in the woods drown in a bog or a river be eaten by the first wolfor malicewhose path you cross come to think maybe i should have omba saddle up your horse and put you on it it would certainly solve my brothers problems for him and it was extremely aggravating that just such panicked thoughts had been galloping through her mind all morning she scowled maybe i wouldnt be as lost as all that when dag fixed my cord he fixed it sos i can tell where he is generally anyhow she added scrupulously dar squinted down at her for a long silent unnerving moment his frown deepened it has nothing to do with your marriage cord dag has enslaved some of your ground to his he seemed about to say more but then fell silent his face drawn in doubt he added after a moment i had no idea that heits potent groundwork i admit but its not a good kind i dont understand naturally not fawn clenched her teeth that means you have to explain more do i the ironic look returned yes said fawn very definitely a little to her surprise he shrugged acquiescence its malice magic forbidden to lakewalkers for very good reasons malices mindenslave farmers through their grounds its part of what makes farmers as useless on patrol as dogsa powerful enough malice can take them away and use them against us so why doesnt that happen to lakewalkers she shot back because we can close our grounds against the attack reluctantly she decided dar was telling the truth so would the glassforge malice have stolen her mind and will from her if it had been given a bit more time or would it simply have ripped out her ground on the spot as it had her childs no telling now it did cast a disturbing new light on what she had assumed to be farmer slander against lakewalkers and their beguilements but if cattaguss oblique warning about the camp council returned to her mind with a jerk how forbidden how fiercely forbidden with what penalties had she just handed dags brotherly enemy another weapon against him oh gods i cant do anything right with these people well its discouraged certainly a lakewalker couldnt use the technique on another lakewalker but farmers are wideopen to a sufficiently powerfulhe hesitatedmaker he finished puzzlement suddenly tingeing his voice he shook it off his eyes narrowed fawn suddenly did not like his sly smile it does rather explain how dag has you following him around like a motherless puppy eh dismay shook her but she narrowed her eyes right back what does that mean she demanded i should think it was obvious if not alas to my brothers credit she strove to quell her temper if youre tryin to say you think your brother put some kind of love spell on me well it wont wash dag didnt fix my cord or my ground or whatever till the night before he left with his company dar tilted his head and asked dryly how would you know it was a horrible question was he reading her ground the way cumbia had to so narrowly target her most appalling possible fears doubt swept through her like a torrent to smack to a sudden stop against another memorysunny sawman and his vile threats to slander her about that night at his sisters wedding that ploy had worked admirably well to stampede fawn once i may be just a little farmer girl but blight it i do learn dag says so she raised her face to meet dars eye square and suddenly the look of doubt was reversed from her to him she drew a long breath i dont know which of you is using malice magic i do know which of you is the most malicious his head jerked back yeah that stings doesnt it dar fawn tossed her head whirled and stalked out of the clearing she didnt give him the satisfaction of looking back either out on the road again fawn first turned right then in sudden decision left in the time it took her to walk the mile down the shore to patroller headquarters her courage chilled the building appeared quiet although there was a deal of activity across the road at the stables and in the paddocks some patrol either coming in or going out or maybe folks getting ready to send the next company west to the war maybe fairbolt wont be here she told herself and climbed the porch a strange patroller at the writing table pointed with his free hand without looking up from his scratching quill if the doors open anyone can go in fawn swallowed her rehearsed greetings nodded and scuttled past blight this nakedground business she peeked around the doorjamb to the inner chamber fairbolt was sitting across from his pegboard with his feet up on another chair and a shallow wooden box in his lap stirrings its contents with one thick finger and frowning a couple more chairs pulled up beside him held more such trays he squinted up at his board sighed and said come in fawn emboldened she stepped to his side the trays unsurprisingly held pegs he looked she thought very much like a man trying to figure out how to fill eight hundred holes with four hundred pegs i dont mean to interrupt youre not interrupting much he looked up at last and gave her a grimace that was possibly intended to be a smile i had a question theres a surprise he caught her faint wince and shook his head in apology sorry to answer you no ive had no courier from dag since his company left i wouldnt expect one yet its still early days for any news i figured that i have a different question she didnt think shed let her voice quaver but his brows went up and his feet came down oh married lakewalkers feel each other through their wedding cordsif theyre alive anyhow stands to reason youd be listenin out for any such news from your patrollersif any strings went deadand folks would know to pass it on to you right quick he looked at her in some bemusement thats true dag tell you this no i figured it what i want to know is couriers or no couriers have you gotten any such mortal news from dags company no his gaze sharpened why do you ask this was where it got scary fairbolt was the camp council in a way but i think hes patrol first before he left dag did some groundwork on my cord or on me sos i could feel if he was alive same as any other married lakewalker just a little different route i guess almost as briefly as she had for dar she described waking up hurting last night and her moonlit talk with sarri and cattagus so just now i took my cord to dar because hes the strongest maker i know of and he allowed as how i was right my cord spoke true dag was hurt somehow last night she hardly needed to add she thought that for dar to grant his brothers farmer bride to be right about anything it had to be pretty inarguable all the intent controlled alarm shed missed from dar shone now in fairbolts eyes his hand shot out he jerked it to a stop excuse me may i touch fawn mustered her nerve and held out her left arm yes fairbolts warm fingers slid up and down her skin and traced her cord his face tensed in doubt and dismay well somethings there yes but abruptly he rose strode to the doorway and stuck his head through his voice had an edge fawn had not heard before vion run over to the medicine tent see if hoharies there if shes not doing groundwork ask her step down here theres something i need her to see right now the scrape of a chair some mumble of assent the outer door banged before fairbolt turned back he said to fawn somewhat apologetically theres reasons i went for patroller and not maker hoharie will be able to tell a lot more than i can maybe even more than dar could fawn nodded fairbolt drummed his fingers on his chair back sarri and cattagus said their spouses were all right yes yes well sarri wasnt quite sure about utau i thought but all alive fairbolt walked over to the larger table and stared down fawn followed a map of north raintree was laid out atop an untidy stack of other charts fairbolts finger traced a loop across it dag planned to circle bonemarsh and drop down on it from the north my guess was that the earliest they could arrive there was today i dont know how much that storm might have slowed them really they could be anywhere within fifty miles of bonemarsh right now fawn let her left hand follow his tracing the directional urge of her cord alas did not seem to respond to marks on maps only to the live dag but she stared down with sudden new interest maps maps could keep you from getting lost even in places youd never been before this one was thick with a veining of roads trails rivers and streams and cluttered with jotted remarks about landmarks fords and more rarely bridges dar might be right that if she just jumped on her horse and rode west she would likely plunge into disaster but if she jumped on her horse with an aid like thisshe would still be running headlong into a war zone a mere pair of bandits had been enough to overcome her before i would be more wary now the map was something to think hard about though what could have happened to dag do you think she asked fairbolt dag alone and no one else he shrugged if you want to start with most likely chances maybe that fool horse of his finally managed to bash him into a tree the possibilities for freak accidents after that are endless but they cant have closed in for the malice kill yet why not his voice went strangely soft because there would be more dead dag and i figured based on wolf ridge to lose up to half the company in this thats how i expect to know when he trailed off shaking his head obio grayheron will take command hes good even if he doesnt have that edge thatah gods i hate this helpless waiting you too said fawn her eyes widening he nodded simply a knock sounded on the doorjamb and a quiet voice problems fairbolt fairbolt looked up in relief hoharie thank you for stopping over come on in the medicine maker entered giving fairbolt a vague wave and fawn a curious look fawn had been introduced to her by dag and shown the medicine tent which to fawns mind nearly qualified as a building but they had barely spoken then hoharie was an indeterminate age to fawns eyes not as tall as most lakewalker women her summer shift did not flatter a figure like a board but the protuberant eyes in her bony face were shrewd and not unkind like dags eyes they shifted colors in the light from silvergilt in the sun to now a fine gray fairbolt hastened to set her a chair by the map table and moved boxes of pegs to free two more fawn directed an uncertain kneedip at her and sat where fairbolt pointed just around the tables corner tell your tale fawn said fairbolt settling on her other side fawn gulped sir maam fighting an urge to gabble fawn repeated her story her right hand kneading her left as she spoke she finished dar accused dag of making malice magic but i swear it isnt so it wasnt dags faulti asked him to fix my cord dar puts it in the worst possible light on purpose and it makes me so mad i could spit hoharie had listened to the spate with her head cocked not interrupting she said mildly well lets have a look then fawn at her encouraging nod fawn laid her left arm out on the table for hoharies inspection the medicine makers lips twisted thoughtfully as she gazed down at it her fingers were thin and dry and hardly seemed to press the skin but fawns arm twinged deep inside as they drifted along fairbolt watched closely occasionally remembering to breathe hoharie sat back at last with a hardtoread expression well thats a right powerful piece of groundwork for a patroller you been hoarding talent over here fairbolt fairbolt scratched his head if its so dags been hoarding himself did he mention that thing about the glass bowl and the ghost hand to you fairbolts eyebrows shot up no huh is itfawn swallowedwhat dar said bad magic hoharie shook her head not so much in negation as caution now mind you ive never seen a malices mindslave up close ive just heard about them though i have dissected mudmen and theres a tale this almost reminds me more of matching grounds for healing truth to tell which is like a dance between two grounds that push on each other as contrasted with a shaped or unshaped ground reinforcement where the medicine maker actually gives ground away could be when a malice matches ground its just so powerful it compels rather than dances pushing the other right over though there is a disparity in this as welli wouldnt be able to tell how much unless i had dag right here fawn sighed wistfully at the notion of having dag right here safe fairbolt said in a somewhat choked voice isnt a hundred miles away a bit far for matching grounds hoharie its usually done skin to skin in my experience thats where the almost comes in this has both mixed dags put a bit of workedrather delicately workedground reinforcement into fawns left arm and hand which is what she feels dancing with his ground in the cord its all very umimpulsive perhaps taking in the confusion in fawns face hoharie went on its like this child what you farmers call magic lakewalker or malice its all just groundwork of some kind a maker draws the ground he works with out of himself and has to recover by growing it back at the speed of life no more a malice steals ground from the world around it insatiably and puts nothing back think of a rivulet and a river in flood the onell give you a nice drink on a hot day the other will wash away your house and drown you theyre both water but no one sane has any trouble telling one from the other see fawn nodded if a bit uncertainly to show willing so is my company captain hurt or not said fairbolt shifting in impatience whats going on over there in raintree hoharie hoharie shook her head again youre asking me to tell you what something looks like from a glimpse in a piece of broken mirror held around a corner in the dark am i looking at all of it or just a fragment does it correspond to anything she turned to fawn what hurts exactly fawn stretched and clenched her fingers my left hand mostly up the arm it fades except i feel a little shivery all over fairbolt muttered but dag hasnt got a his face screwed up and he scowled in a confusion briefly greater than fawns itshow shall i put this said hoharie in some reluctance if the rest of his ground is as stressed as the bit i feel his body must be in a pretty bad way how bad how snapped fairbolt which made fawn rather glad because she was much too frightened to yell at the medicine maker herself hoharie opened her hands in a wide frustrated shrug well not quite enough to kill him evidently fairbolt bared his teeth at her but then sat back in a glum slump if i get any sleep at all tonight hoharie it wont be your doing fawn leaned forward and stared at her hand i was kind of hoping you would tell me i was a stupid little farmer girl imagining things everybody else used to but now that i want it she looked up and added uneasily dags not going to get in some kind of trouble for this making is he well ifwhen he gets back i guarantee ill be asking him a few questions said hoharie fervently but they wont have anything to do with this argument before the camp council it was all my fault truly said fawn dar made me afraid to tell but i thoughti thought fairbolt had a need and a right to know on account of the company fairbolt pulled himself together and said gravely thank you fawn you did the right thing if you feel any changes in this please tell me or hoharie will you fawn nodded earnestly so what do we do now what we generally have to do farmer girl fairbolt sighed we wait d ag woke well after dark to roll his aching body up pull on his boots without lacing them and stagger to the slit trench the night air was chill and dank but the two patrollers on duty had kept the campfire burning with a cheery orange glow one waved to dag as he wandered past and dag returned the silent salute the scene looked deceptively peaceful as though they watched over comrades merely sleeping after relieving himself dag considered more sleep his bonedeep grinding fatigue of earlier seemed scarcely improved the marsh remained silentthis hour should have been raucous with frogs insects and night birdsand eerily odorless either the reek of its normal life or the stench of death should have saturated this foggy air well the rot would come in time a week or a month or six or next spring which while it would doubtless smell repulsive enough to gag anyone for a mile downwind would be a first sign of life beginning its repair of the blightrot had a lively ground of its own dag stared at the grove the campfire seeming like a lantern among the trees remembering his patrols first approachonly yesterday if this was after midnighthe glanced at the wheel of the starshe could call it two days ago though that seemed scarcely more reasonable frowning thoughtfully he counted a careful two hundred paces away from the grove and found a stump to sit upon he stretched out his aching legs if he had opened his groundsense at this distance before without triggering the trap presumably he might do it again he hissed in surprise as he eased his veil apart for the first time in days cramping mari had described his closure and that seemed barely adequate to describe this shaking agony normally he paid as little attention to his own ground as he did to his body the two conflating seamlessly meaning to examine the groundlocked makers dag instead found his inner senses wrenched onto himself in the ground of his right arm a faint heat lingered last vestiges of the healing reinforcement snatched from or gifted by hoharies apprentice over time such a reinforcement was slowly absorbed converted from the donors ground into that of the recipients not unlike the way his food became dag even this trace would be gone altogether in a few more weeks in the ground of his left arm his ghost hand was not there at the moment the ground of his arm was spattered with a dozen dark spots black craters seeming like holes burned in a cloth from scattered sparks a few more throbbed on his neck and down his left side surrounding them in gray rings were minute patches of blight this wasnt just fading reverberation from a malicehandling like utaus though that echoed in him too the spots were the residue he realized of the ground hed ripped from the malice in that desperate nightfight it was like nothing hed ever seen before yet immediately recognizable strangely familiar seemed the perfect summation actually but then hed never before met up with anyone crazed enough to try to groundrip a malice maybe he was seeing why it was not a recommended technique injury or healing to a living body injured or healed its ground in turn groundripping or prolonged exposure to blight killed a body through its ravaged ground what was this peculiar infestation doing to his body now nothing good he suspected with this map to guide him he could trace deep aches in his flesh that centered over the splotches if barely distinguishable from his present general malaise pain marked damage normally what kind of damage sowas the pulsating grayness slowly being absorbed by dags ground oror was the blight spreading he swallowed and stared but could sense no discernible change stands to reason he could almost hear spark say how would a smart little farmer girl analyze this what were the possibilities well his ground could be slowly repairing itself as in any other wound or his ground might be unable to repair itself until the sources of injury were removed the way an arrow had to be extracted before the flesh around it could start to knit sometimes if more rarely flesh knitted around a fragment that could not be removed sometimes it closed but festered orwas the blight spreading out faster than his ground could repair it in which case in which case im looking at my death wound a mortality flowing as slowly as honey in winter as inexorably as time spark no how long do we in a spasm of inspiration he tried to call up his ghost hand to grip a splotch tear it out dump it in the soil anywherewas it possible to groundrip yourself but his odd power remained elusive he then massaged around a spot on his left ribs with his right hand willing its ground to reach in but found it as impossible as to will flesh to penetrate flesh the effort made his side twinge however an even more horrific possibility occurred to him then the fragments of the first great maliceking it was said grew into the plague of the world what if each of these fragments had the same potential could i turn into a malice or malice food dag bent his head and huffed through his open mouth his hand clutching his hair oh absent gods do you hate me that much or he might split into a dozen malicesorno a dominant one would no doubt conquer and subsume the others then emerge the lone victor ofwhat once the miniature malice had consumed all the ground and the life of the body it lived in it too presumably must die unless it could escape dag panted for breath in his panic then swallowed and sat up lets go back to the deathwound idea please what if this was not a spew of malice seed but more like a spatter of malice blood carrying the toxic ground but not capable of independent life for long indeedgingerly he turned his senses inward againthere was not that sense of nascent personality that even the lowliest sessile malice exuded poison yes he could live withwell be happy withwell he sat for several shaken minutes in the silent dark then peeked again no change it seemed he was not dissolving into gray dust on the spot which meant he was doomed to wake up to his responsibilities in the morning all the same so hed had a reason for coming out here what was it he inhaled and very cautiously extended his groundsense outward once more the lingering blight all around nibbled at him but it was ignorable he found the dead trees in the grove the trapped mudmen beyond the live patrollers on night watch he steered away from the groundlocked makers barely letting his senses graze them before he had found a gradient of ground moving through the soil sucked into the making of the mudman nursery did such a draw sustain it still no the death of the malice had done that much good at least ormaybe not the mudmen were still alive even if theyd stopped growing therefore they must still be drawing ground if slowly the only source of ground in the system was the locked makers and now the three fresh patrollers and he did not think their depleted bodies could produce new ground fast enough to keep up what must be the end of it if this accursed lock could not be broken the weakest makers would likely die first with them gone increased stress would be thrown onto the survivors who would not last long dag suspected death would cascade the remainder must die very quickly at which point the mudmen would also die would that be the end of it the problem collapsing into itself and gone or were there other elements hidden elements at work inside the lock no one could find out without opening their ground to the lock no one could open their ground to the lock without being sucked into it it seemed impasse my head hurts my ground hurts but no such collapse was happening now dag clutched the thought to himself as if it were hope perhaps the morning would bring better counsel or even better counselors than one battered old patroller so frighteningly out of his depth dag sighed levered himself up and stumbled back to his bedroll what the morning brought was distractions mainly a pair of scouts returned from the south to report much the sort of chaos dag expectedfarmer and lakewalker refugees scattered all over improvised defenses in disarraybut also encouraging signs of people beginning to sort themselves out with the news of the death of the malice about midday some two dozen bonemarsh exiles cautiously approached dag assigned his patrol of cleanup volunteers the initial task of helping them to identify and bury their dead including the woman maker and scavenge the village for stillusable supplies that might be carried off to the other north raintree camps that would be taking in the nearly two thousand homeless the raintree lakewalkers were likely in for a straitened winter coming up bonemarsh casualties he was glad to learn had been relatively low no one seemed to know yet if the same had been the case for that farmer town the malice had taken first three of the bonemarsh folks agreed to stay and help nurse their groundlocked makers and the hapless wouldbe rescuers the makers all had names now and life stories that the returned refugees had determinedly pressed on dag he wasnt sure if that helped in any case he sent the first batch of locals off with a patroller escort and an earnest request to send him back any spare medicine makers or other experts who might be able to get a grip on his lethal puzzle but he didnt expect much help from that quarter as every medicine maker in raintree had to be up to the ears in nearer troubles right now he had slightly more hope of the full patrol of twentyfive he sent home that afternoon carrying both a warning to hickory lake of their neighbors impending winter shortages and a much more urgently worded plea for hoharie or some equally adept maker to come to his aid to stay at bonemarsh dag selected the best medicine makersfor patrollershis company had including several veteran mothers or grandmothers whom he figured for already knowing how to keep alive people who couldnt talk or walk or feed themselves small ones anyway they can work up he hadnt expected them to work up to him however dag said mari with her usual directness the bags under your eyes are so black you look like a blighted raccoon have you had anybody look you over yet hed been thinking of quietly hauling one of the better field medicine fellows out of range of the grove to examine him mari he realized glumly was not only at the top of that list by experience and groundsense skill but would corner any substitute and have the story ripped out of him in minutes anyway might as well save steps come on he sighed she nodded in stern satisfaction he led off to his stump of last night or one like it sat and cautiously opened himself it took a couple of minutes and he ended with his head bent nearly to his knees still hurts he heard a long slow hiss through her teeth that for mari was as scary as swearing in a tone of cool understatement she observed well that dont look so good what is that black crap some sort of ground contamination it happened when i he started to say groundripped the malice but changed it to when i tried to draw the malice off from utau and it turned on me it was like bits of it stuck to me and burned i couldnt get rid of it then i closed up and passed out you sure did i thought you were just groundrippedhah listen to me just groundrippedlike utau does that umhurt looks like it ought to yeah dag turned his groundsense on himself closing his eyes for an instant to feel more clearly two of the gray patches on his left arm separate last night seemed to have grown together since like two water droplets joining im losing ground mari said hesitantly you want me to try anything think a bit of ground reinforcement might help or a match not sure i wouldnt want to get this crud stuck to you i suspect itslethalnot good better wait its not like im falling over its not like youre dancing a jig either this isnt likeutaus ground its like its scraped raw shivering and wont stop but you can see itll come right in its own time thisyeah this is outside my ken you need a real medicine maker thats what i figured hope one shows up soon meantime well i can still walk it seems if not jig dag hesitated if you can refrain from gossiping about this all over camp id take it kindly mari snorted so if this had happened to any other patroller how fast would you have slapped him onto the sick list privileges of captaincy dag said vaguely you know that road patrol leader yeah would that be the privilege to be stupid funny i dont seem to recall that one look if anybody with more skill shows up here to hand this mess on to you bet ill be on my horse headed east in an hour except that he could not ride away from what he carried inside now could he i have no idea who the raintree folks can spare or when but i figure the soonest we could get help from home is six days he stared around the afternoon was growing hazy with a brassy heat in the air that foreboded evening thundershowers mari glanced toward the grove and said quietly think those folks will last six more days dag let out a long breath and heaved himself to his feet i dont know mari does look like we need to rustle up some kind of tent covering to gather them under though rain tonight you think looks like she agreed they strolled silently back to the dead grove he wasnt sure how much mari talked or didnt but a lot of people in the grove camp that evening seemed to take it as their mission to tell him to go lie down he was persuadable except that with nothing to do but sit crosslegged on his bedroll and stare at the groundlocked makers he found himself drifting into hating them without this tangle he could have gone home with todays patrol in three days time held spark hard and not let go even for breathing his earlier weariness of this long war was as nothing to his present choked surfeit he slept poorly by late the following afternoon two of the older makers had lost the ability to swallow and one was having trouble breathing as carro one of maris cronies from obios patrol held the man up in her lap in an effort to ease him dag knelt beside the bedroll and studied his labored gasps breathing this bad in a dying man was normally a signal to share and soon but was this fellow dying need he be his thinning hair was streaked with gray but he was hardly elderly before this horror had fallen on him dag judged him to have been hale lean and wiry artin was his name dag didnt want to know an excellent smith and something of a weaponsmaster under his own tracing fingers dag could read a lifetime of accumulated knowledge in the subtle calluses of artins hands mari blotted the face and hair of the nearby woman she had just spent several fruitless minutes trying to get water down while the woman had writhed and choked if we cant get more drink into them in this heat they arent going to last anything like five more days dag carro nodded to the man in her lap this one less i see that murmured dag saun paced about dag had guessed he would volunteer for the patrol lingering in raintree to assist the refugees and indeed hed scorned an offer to ride back to hickory lake yesterday but taking his partnership with dag seriously hed instead requested assignment to this duty he slept in the nowreduced camp to the east off the blight but lived at dags left elbow in the daytime which would be a fine thing if only saun acted less like a flea on a griddle in the face of these frustrations now he declared we have to try something dag you say you think these makers are still supporting the mudmen if thats so doesnt it make sense to cut off the load obio and griff said they tried that said dag patiently the results were pretty alarming i gathered but no one died it could be like one of hoharies cuttings hurting to heal it was a shrewd argument and it attracted dag more than the prospect of just sitting here watching while these people suffered and failed my company he wasnt quite sure how these raintree makers had become honorary members of it in his mind but they had his three unconscious patrollers were the least depleted so far but dag could see that wasnt going to last i admit dag said slowly id like to see what happens for myself although how much telling detail he was likely to observe with his groundsense closed was a bitter question maybedo one and then well see saun gave him a quick nod of understanding and went to fetch his sword it was the same weapon that had put saun in harms way back at glassforge dag had heroically refrained from pointing out how useless the deadweight had been to saun on this trip too but for dispatching mudmen in their pots it would do nearly as well as a spear and better than a knife sword over his shoulder saun trod determinedly back through the grove and out toward the boggy patch his boots squelching in the mud from last nights rain he slowed trying to pick his way more cleanly upon clumps of dead grasses and peered down into the mud pots with a look of curious revulsion the unformed monsters therein were in a revolting enough state distorted past any hope of returning to their animal lives and equally far from transformation to their mockhuman forms innocent but doomed dags brow furrowed soif their transformation could somehow be completed with the malice dead would they switch their slavish allegiance to the lakewalker makers it was a disturbing idea as if dags brain didnt teem with enough of those already the more disturbing for being seductive powerful subhuman servants might be used for a multitude of desperately needed tasks had the magelords of old made something like them all malices seemed to hatch with the knowledge not to mention the compulsion of such makings which suggested it was an old old skill but the mudslaves presumably would require a continuous supply of ground reinforcement to live making them lethally expensive to maintain dag was glad to give over this line of thought as saun called which should i start with the biggest mari her face screwed up in doubt as she stared down at the damp woman maker said the smallest im not sure it matters dag called back just pick one saun stepped toward a mud pot gripped his sword in both hands braced his shoulders squinted and struck squalling and splashing rose from the hole and flying mud saun grimaced pulled back and struck hastily again what was it mari called beaver i think or maybe woodchuck saun jumped back looking sick as the splashing died away carros cry wrenched dags attention around the makersall the groundlocked folkwere writhing and moaning in their bedrolls as if in paindeep inarticulate animal sounds the other two onduty patrollers hurried to their sides alarmed the makers did not seem to be actually convulsing so dag stifled a wild look around for something to shove between teeth besides his hook bad idea or his fingers artins breathing passed from labored to choked carro pulled down his blanket and pressed her ear to his chest dag this isnt good no more saun dag called urgently over his shoulder and bent to artins other side the smiths lips were turning a leaden hue and his eyelids fluttered his heartbeats going all wrong said carro sounds like partridge wings just before the archer shoots the bird out of the air dag continued the unspoken thought his heart is failing blight it blight it saun hurried back dag raised his glance from sauns muddy boots to his suddenly drained face sauns lips parted but no sound came out dag needed no words to interpret that particular appalled look of a heart going hollow with fear and guilt you should not shoulder such a burden boy no one should but someone had to not today blight it help might be coming if the makers could be kept alive till then somehow he remembered for some reason his impulsive attack on the malices cave back in glassforge any way that works old patroller im going to try a ground match dag said abruptly moving to get a better grip on artins shuddering body dance his heart back to the right beat if i can as he had once done for saun maris voice called sharply dag no he was already opening his ground finding his way into the others body through his ground pain on pain clashing rhythms but dags dance was the stronger one the true world rushed back into his awareness blight and glory and all and he became aware of how keenly hed missed his groundsense as if hed been walking around for days with the best part of himself bloodily amputated dance with me artin dag breathed satisfaction as he felt the smiths heart and lungs take up a steadier stronger cadence once more dag did not share in such shocking pain as sauns injuries but he could feel the fragility in the makers ground how close it was to the edge of another such fall into disorder and death were the others as weakened dags perceptions widened in increasing fascination all the lakewalkers grounds were wound about and penetrated by a subtle gray structure like ten thousand tangled threads the threads combined and darkened running out like strands of smoke to the mudmens pots the mudmens grounds were the strangest of all turned black strong compellingly human in shape the fleshly bodies of the animals labored in vain straining to match that impulsion starving in their arrested growth the malice spatters on dags ground seemed to be shivering in time with the complex ground structure imprisoning the makers and dag had a sudden terror that somehow the stillliving malice bits lodged within him were what was keeping this thing intact would he have to die for it to be broken ah no affinity both had with each other no question but his spatters were as formless as a ground reinforcement if an inverted one that was negative and destructive rather than positive and healing dag struggled to understand what he was sensing in normal persuasive making the maker pushed and reinforced ground found within the object striving to make things more themselves as in dags old arrowproof coat where the protection of skin became leather became a shield in healing ground was gifted freely unformed to be turned into the recipients ground without resistance a ground match such as he had just done for artin was a dance in time the malices enslavement of farmer minds dag realized suddenly must also be such a ground dance if enormously powerful to work so compulsively and at such distances but it had to be continuously maintained as he had glimpsed from the inside during this last kill and the match died when the malice did it has a limited range too he realized which was why the malice had been forced to move along with its army this groundwork thoughhad a range of only a hundred paces but it had most certainly survived its malice maker contained powerful horrificfamiliar familiar so where have i seen anything like this before what groundwork both survived its makers death and retained the nature of its maker not melding with its recipient even after it had been released sharing knives do on a smaller scale to be sure butscarcely less complex the ground of the consecrated knife was shaped by its maker into an involuted container for the donors future death and that dissolving ground once received was held tight altered if with and not against the donors will to something lethal to malices dar must be giving something of himself away with each knife he made dag reflected on some level folks knew this which was why they treated their knife makers with such care how draining was such a making again and again and again very no wonder dar had so little left of himself for any other purpose dag turned his inner eye back upon the malices groundwork this huge horrific making was involuted and powerful beyond any scope he would ever have butbeyond his understanding as well the intuitive leap was effortless like flying in a dream i see how this may be broken he grinned and opened his eyes tried to grin tried to open his eyes face eyes body were gone from him his mind seemed one with his ground floating cut off from the outer world gray threads wound into him like little searching mouths like worms sucking and consuming im trapped fawn carefully tucked the dozen new beeswax candles that were her share of the afternoons making into dags trunk closed the lid drifted out under her tent awning and stared through the trees at the leaden gleam of the lake under the humid sky she scratched absently at one of the mosquito bites speckling her bare arms and pawed at a whine near her ear yet another reason to miss dag silly and selfish though it seemed she sighedthen tensed the heartthrob echo of pain in her left arm and down her side her constant companion for three days changed into something racing a wave of terror swept through her and she could not tell if the first breath of it was dags or her own though the panting that followed seemed all hers the rhythm broke up into something chaotic and uneven then it muted no dont die it didnt but neither did it return to its former definition absent gods forfend what was that she gulped flipped down her tent flap behind her and started walking quickly up the shore road breaking into a trot till she grew winded then walking again she did not want to draw stares by running like a frightened deer she passed patroller headquarters where one of ombas horse girls was leading off two spent mounts heads down lathered and muddy only couriers in a hurry would ride horses in wet like that but fawn quelled hope or fear of word from dags company fairbolt had said today would still be too soon considering the deathly signals he was waiting for she could not wish for more speed she popped up the steps to hoharies medicine cabinmedicine tent she corrected the thoughtand stood for a moment trying to catch her breath then pushed inside hoharies apprentice what was his name othan came out of the herb room and frowned at her what do you want farmer girl fawn ignored his tone hoharie said i should come see her if anything changed in my marriage cord something just did othan glanced at the closed door to the inner room shes doing some groundwork youll have to wait reluctantly he jerked his head toward the empty chair by the writing table then went back into the herb room something pungent was cooking over its small fireplace making the hot chambers hotter fawn sat and jittered rubbing her left arm though her probing fingers made no difference to the sensations the former throbbing had been a source of fear to her for days but now she wished for it back and why should her throat feel as though she was choking after what seemed forever the door to the inner chamber opened and a buxom woman came out with a boy of maybe three in her arms he was frowning and feverish eyes glazed his head resting against her shoulder and his thumb stuck in his mouth hoharie followed gave fawn a nod of acknowledgment and went with them into the herb room a murmur of low voices instructions to othan then hoharie returned and gestured fawn before her into the inner room closing the door behind them fawn turned and mutely thrust out her arm sit girl hoharie sighed pointing to a table in the corner with a pair of chairs hoharie winced as she settled across from fawn stretching her back and fawn wondered what she had just done for that little boy and how much it had cost her in her ground would she even be able to help fawn just now while hoharie her eyes halfclosed felt up and down fawns arm fawn stammered out a description of what had just happened her words sounded confused and inadequate in her own ears and she was afraid they conveyed nothing to the medicine maker except maybe the idea that she was going crazy but hoharie listened without comment hoharie at last sat up and shook her head well this was odd before and its odder now but without any other information im blighted if i can guess whats really going on thats no help it came out something between a bark and a wail and fawn bit her lip in fear she had offended the maker but hoharie merely shook her head again in something between exasperation and agreement hoharie opened her mouth to say more but then paused arrested her head turning toward the door in a moment boot steps sounded on the porch outside and the squeak of the door opening fairbolt hoharie muttered and a rap at the inner door and fairbolts voice hoharie its urgent come in fairbolt shouldered through followed bytall dirla fawn gasped and sat up dirla was as mudspattered as the horse she must have ridden in on braids awry shirt reeking of dried and new sweat her face lined with fatigue under sunburn her eyes though were bright they got the malice fairbolt announced and hoharie let out her breath with a triumphant hoot that made dirla smile fairbolt cast fawn a curious look about two hours after midnight three nights back fawns hand went to her cord but that was whenwhat happened to dag how bad was he hurt dirla gave her a surprised nod but replied its um hard to say why fairbolt his eyes on hoharie pulled the patroller forward and said tell your tale again dirla as dirla began a description of the companys hard ride west fawn realized the pair must have come to find hoharie not her why get to the part about dag blight you dirla we came up on bonemarsh about noon but the malice had movedsouth twenty miles we found out later launching a big attack toward farmers flats dag wouldnt let us stop for anything even those poor makers id never seen anything like it the malice had enslaved the grounds of these bonemarsh folk somehow making them cook up a new batch of mudmen for it or so dag claimed it left them tied to trees the patrol was pretty upset when dag ordered us to leave them in place but mari and codo came in on his side and dag had this look on his face that made us afraid to press him so we rode on fawn gnawed her knuckles through dirlas excited description of the veiled patrol slipping through an enemyoccupied farm at night the breathless scramble up a hill the rush upon a bizarre crude tower my partner mari had almost made it to the top when the malice jumped downmust have been over twenty feet like it was flying i never knew a malice could look so beautifulutau went for it i had my ground shut tight but later utau said the malice just peeled his open like popping the husk off a hickory nut he thought he was done for but then dag who didnt even have a sharing knife went for the thing barehanded barehooked anyway it left utau and turned on him mari shouted for me and threw me down her knife and i didnt quite see what happened then anyway i drove maris knife into the thing and all its bright fleshburst horrible and i thought it was over and we were all home alive and it was a miracle utau staggered over and draped himself on me till razi could get to himand then we saw dag fawn rocked hunched tight with her arms wrapping her waist to keep from interrupting or screaming dirla went on he was passed out in the dirt stiff as a corpse with his ground wrapped up so tight it was stranglin him and no one could get through to try to make a match or a reinforcement though mari and codo and hann all tried for the next few hours we all thought he was dying halfgroundripped like utau but worse wait said hoharie wasnt he physically injured at all dirla shook her head maybe knocked around a bit but nothing much but then around dawn he just woke up and got up he didnt look any too good mind you but he made it onto his horse somehow and pushed us all back to bonemarsh seems he was fretting over those makers wed left as well he might when we arrived the rest of the company had made it in but those makerstheir groundlock didnt break when the malice died and no one could figure out why not worse anyone who tries to open grounds to them gets drawn into their lock too obio lost three patrollers finding that one out dag believes theyre all dying mari couldnt get him to leave them though she thinks he should be on the sick listits like hes obsessed though by the time us couriers left that evening wed at least got him to sleep for a while utau and mari they dont like any of it one little bit sodirla turned her gaze on the medicine maker her hands clutching each other in unaccustomed pleadag said he wished he had you there hoharie because he needs someone who knows folks grounds down deep so im asking for you for him because daghe got us through he got us all through fairbolt cleared his throat would you be willing to ride to raintree hoharie an appalled look came over the medicine makers face as she stared wildly around at her workplace fawn thought she could just about see the crowded roster of tasks here racing through hoharies mind in an hour fairbolt continued relentlessly fairbolt hoharie huffed dismay after a long long moment she added could you make it two hours fairbolt returned a short satisfied nod ill have two patrollers ready to escort you and whoever you need to take with you fawn blurted can i come with you because i think im part of dags puzzle too she nearly held out her left arm in evidence the three lakewalkers stared down at her in uncomplimentary surprise fawn hurried on its not a war zone anymore and if i went with you i couldnt get lost so i wouldnt be being stupid at all i could be ready in an hour less dirla said not scornfully but in a tone of kindness that was somehow even more annoying that fat little plow horse of yours couldnt keep up fawn grace is not fat said fawn indignantly at least not very and she may not be a racehorse but shes persistent she added after a moment as her wits caught up with her mouth anyhow couldnt you put me up on a patrol horse just like hoharie fairbolt smiled a little but shook his head no fawn the malice may be gone but north raintree is going to be disrupted for weeks yet in the aftermath of all this i made a promise to dag to see you came to no harm while he was gone and i mean to keep it but fairbolts voice firmed in a way that made fawn think of her father at his most maddening farmer child you are one more worry i dont need to have right now others have to wait for their husbands and wives to return as well and what was the counterargument to that i am not a child oh sure that one had always worked so well funny i ran around out there in the wide world for eighteen years without your protection and survived barely she was depressingly reminded a bitter smile bent fairbolts lips and he murmured no farmer childyouve always had our protection fawn flushed as she dropped her eyes in shame he gave a satisfied nod and went on more kindly i imagine cattagus and sarri would be glad to learn the news about the malice maybe you could run and let them know it was a clear dismissal run along fawn looked around and found no allies not dirla and not even hoharie despite the curious look in her eyes the medicine tent might be her realm but it was plain the road was fairbolts and she would yield to his judgment in the matter fawn swallowed nodded and took herself out as chairs scraped and the conference continued more intently without her not being a lakewalker and all she stumped up the path between the medicine tent and fairbolts headquarters fuming and rubbing her arm its thrumming echoed in her heart and head and gut until she was in a fair way to screaming from it so was she a lakewalker bride or a farmer bride because if the first was under lakewalker disciplines the other could not be people couldnt just switch her label back and forth at their convenience fair was fair if not hah fairbolt in one thing she was surely expert and that was running away from home of which the first welltested rule was dont give folks a chance to argue with you how had she forgotten that one she set her teeth and turned aside at patroller headquarters a pair of patrollers conferring over a logbook looked up as she entered fairbolts not here said one i know fawn replied breezily i just talked with him up at hoharies which was perfectly true right no one later could say shed lied i need to borrow one of his maps for a bit ill bring it back as soon as i can the patroller shrugged and nodded and fawn whipped into fairbolts pegboard chamber hastily rolled up the map of north raintree still out on top of the center table tucked it under her arm and left smiling and waving thanks she dogtrotted to mare island let herself through the bridge gate and found one of ombas girls in the work shed i need my horse said fawn i want to take her out for some exercise a hundred or so miles worth she could use some the girl conceded then after a moment oh thats right you need help summoning her the girl sniffed grabbed a halter and line off a nail and wandered out into the pastures while she was gone fawn hastily found an old sack and filled it with what she judged to be a threeday supply of oats was it stealing to take the equivalent of what her mare would have eaten anyhow she decided not to pursue the moral fine point as the lush grass here grew free and the grain had to be painstakingly brought in from off island she considered hiding the sack under her skirts decided it would involve walking funny then remembering that sneak thief down in lumpton market just cast it over her shoulder as if shed a right the horse girl when she led grace in didnt even ask about it back at tent bluefield fawn tied grace to a tree while she went inside skinned into her riding clothes and swiftly packed her saddlebags she pulled her sharing knife from its place in dags trunk and slung it around her neck under her shirt then fastened the steel knife dag had given her to her belt last she plopped plunkins into her saddlebags opposite the grain sack till they balanced and fastened the buckles food and to spare for one little farmer girl for a threeday ride and no stopping finally she fished dags spare quill and ink bottle from the bottom of his trunk and knelt beside it penning a short note on a scrap of cloth dear cattagus and sarri dags company killed the malice but hes hurt so im going to raintree to meet up with him because hes my husband and i have a right ask dirla about the rest back soon love fawn she worked it into the tentflap ties where it fluttered discreetly but visibly then she stood on a stump to saddle grace heaved up and tied on her saddlebags and climbed aboard she was over the bridge in ten minutes more b y sunset fawn guessed she had covered about twentyfive miles from hickory lake the hours of interspersed trotting and walking nursing her mare along in what she hoped was the best balance between speed and endurance had given her plenty of time to think unfortunately by now her thoughts were mainly variations on have i taken a wrong turn yet fairbolts map was not as reassuring as shed hoped the lakewalker notion of roads seemed more fawns idea of trails their trails paths and their paths wilderness so she wasnt altogether sorry when she heard the hoofbeats coming up behind her she turned in her saddle rounding the dense greenery of the last curve a husky patroller rode followed by hoharie her apprentice othan towing a packhorse and a spare mount in a string and another patroller fawn didnt bother trying to race ahead but she didnt halt either in a moment the others cantered up to surround her and she let grace drop back to a walk fawn cried hoharie what are you doing out here riding my fat horse said fawn shortly they told me she needed exercise fairbolt didnt give you permission to come with us im not with you im by myself as hoharie sucked on her lower lip eyes narrowed in thought othan chimed in you have to turn around and go back farmer girl you cant follow us im ahead of you fawn pointed out she added though youre welcome to pass go on run along hoharie glanced back at her two patrollers now riding side by side at the rear and watching dubiously i really cant spare a man to see you home nobodys asking you to hoharie drew a deeper breath but i will if you make me fawn halted her mare and glanced back at the two big earnest fellows they would do their duty that was a bit of a mania with patrollers if she let herself get cumbered with either one of that grim pair he would see her back to hickory lake sure enough and in no good mood about it likely patrollers had objections to leaving their partners fawn tried one more time hoharie please let me come with you i wont slow you down i promise thats not the problem fawn its your own safety you dont belong out here i know where i belong thank you very much by dags side fawn rubbed her left arm and frowned i dont want to cost you your escort if its that unsafe you might need them yourself she let her shoulders slump her head droop all right hoharie im sorry ill turn around she bit her tongue on any further artistic embellishments keep it simple and short lakewalkers read grounds not thoughts dag claimed and fawns ground had plenty of other reasons to be in a roil besides duplicity hoharie stared at her for a long uncertain moment and fawn held her breath lest the medicine maker be inspired to detach a guard anyhow but finally hoharie nodded youve come out a long way if your horse cant make it back tonight it should still be safe enough to stop if you get within ten miles of the lake grace is doing all right fawn said distantly and turned away although she had to kick the mare back into a walk as she was much inclined to turn and follow the other horses dags groundsense range was a mile fawn didnt think any of hoharies party had a better range but she let grace go on for a mile and a bit before halting just to be safe she slid down and let her mare browse for a few minutes before leading her back onto the road in the summerdamp earth the hoofprints of the lakewalker horses showed plain even in the failing light no wrong turns now fawn grinned and trailed after them till she could barely see in the shadows then dismounted again and led grace off the road to outwait the hours of darkness fawn watered the mare in a nearby stream then rubbed her down and fed her oats she washed up herself swatted mosquitoes gnawed a plunkin slice squashed a crawling tick with her knife haft and rolled up in her blanket the songs of the small night creatures only made the underlying stillness more profound it weighed in upon her just how different this desolate darkness was from that of her seemingly equally lonesome trudge through the settled country south of lumpton market these vasty woods did harbor wolves and bears and catamounts shed seen the skins of all three in the stores back at hickory lake in the aftermath of the malice mindless mudmen like the one dag had slain so deftly at the horsefords could also be wandering around out here shed hardly given such hazards a thought when shed camped during the afterwedding trip up to the lake in woodlands not so very different but then shed had dag by her side curling up in his arms each night had seemed like settling into her own private magical fortress she touched the steel knife he had given her sheathed at her belt and sighed but by the first gray light of morning neither she nor grace had been eaten by catamounts yet heartened fawn returned to the trail and found hoharies tracks once more an hour into the ride she was given pause when the tracks seemed to part from her map turning off onto a path but a closer dismounted searching found them coming back and continuing likely the party had just diverted to a campsite for the night a pile of recent horse droppings reassured fawn that she remained the right distance behind she kicked grace along glumly confident that she risked no chance of overtaking hoharie prematurely on the other hand grace was carrying barely half the weight of those big patrollers mounts over time that might add up to more of an edge than anyone thought late in the morning hoharies tracks were suddenly confused by those of a much larger cavalcade going the other way a patrol fawn guessedraintree lakewalkers or part of dags company heading home the heavy prints turned off on another trail and fawn frowning unrolled her map and studied it they could be diverting to visit a small lakewalker camp marked a few miles to the south or they could be patrolling or who knew their passage rendered the trail theyd come down unmistakable but also left hoharies overlying signs harder to make out in the deeply pocked muddy patches but at midday fawn came to one of the rare timber bridges over a deepflowing brown river and was assured of her place on the map once more from time to time she passed spots where recent deadfalls had been roughly cleared from the road and she wondered if that was a task patrols undertook as well when they werent in a tearing hurry by late afternoon graces steps were shortening and stiffening and fawns backside was numb how did couriers and their horses ever manage such distances at such speed she dismounted and led the mare up a few of the steeper slopes insofar as there were any in these parts fell into resentment at the loss of precious daylight then finally considered dirla and ruthlessly cut a switch this activated grace again making fawn feel equally justified and guilty at a closegrown place where the road mud seemed wildly churned she paused spooking a couple of turkey vultures and some crows the former grunted and hissed reluctantly retreating and the latter flapped off yammering complaint she peeked over the rim of a shallow ravine where the vegetation was trampled down and caught her breath at the sight of half a dozen naked rotting corpses piled below she ventured just close enough to be certain they were mudmen and not lakewalkers then hastily remounted she wasnt sure if the patrol had slain them sometime back or if hoharies guards had done for them just recently the stench was no certain clue the absence of visible catamounts was suddenly not enough to make her feel safe anymore she pushed along well past sunset mainly because she was now terrified to stop in the deep dark that night she rolled up small and scared sniveling miserable stupid tears for the lack of dag she buried her face in her blanket edge with none to see her she supposed she might bawl to her hearts content but she really didnt want to make unnecessary noise she hoped any predator within ten miles would be too replete with scavenged mudmen to hunt farmer girls and plump tired horses she slept badly despite her exhaustion shed figured the last morning would be the worst and truly she woke hurting just as much as shed suspected she would but it would be a much shorter leg than yesterday and at the end of it she would find dag her cord still assured her of this if anything her arm throbbed more clearly if more worrisomely with each passing mile barely an hour into the mornings ride she found hoharies campsite just off the track the dirt cast over the campfire ashes still warm only the level terrain and fawns switch kept grace plodding forward into the long afternoon as the light flattened toward the west fawn rode abruptly out of the humid green of the endless woods into an open landscape metallic with heat were here the woods gave way to water meadows their grasses gone yellow and limp the sorry shrubs scattered about bore drooping brown leaves or none it all looked very sodden and strange but ahead she could see a trickle of cookfire smoke from a stand of skeletal trees along a leaden shoreline she didnt need her stolen map anymore hadnt for the past two hours her aching body bleated to her there there hes over there hoharie and her little troop were just dismounting as fawn rode up mari came striding out of the trees waving her arms and crying urgently close your grounds close your grounds hoharie looked startled but waved acknowledgment and turned to check othan and the patrollers who apparently also obeyed she saw fawn who brought grace to a weary halt just a few paces away and her face set but before she could say anything mari coming to her stirrup continued youre here sooner than i dared hope dirla fetch you yes said hoharie praise the girl did you run across the patrol we sent back home yes about a day out of hickory lake ah good maris eye fell on fawn hunched over her saddlebow whyd you bring her the tone of the question was not dismissive but genuinely curious as though there might be some very good if obscure lakewalkerish reason for fawns presence in hoharies train hoharie grimaced i didnt she brought herself fawn tossed her head othan leaned over and hissed at her you lied farmer girl you promised to turn around i did said fawn defiantly twice hoharie looked notbestpleased but the shrewd and curious look on maris face scarcely changed did you get a look at utau when you passed the patrol asked mari we sent him home in razis care oh yes said hoharie she dismounted and stretched her back really all her party looked as hot and tired and dirty as fawn felt so much for lakewalker conceit about their stamina strangest ground damage i ever saw i told utau six months on the sick list that long mari looked dismayed likely less but thatll hold fairbolt off for three which should be about right they exchanged short laughs of mutual understanding fawn slid off sweaty grace who stood head down and flopeared liquid eyes reproachful legs as stiff as fawns own saun came out of the grove to maris shoulder trailed by a couple of other patrollers both older women as the women began to confer with hoharie and mari he strode up to fawn looking astonished you shouldnt be out here dag would have a fit where is dag she craned past him toward the grove so close whats happened to him saun ran a hand over his head in a harried swipe which time not a reassuring answer day before yesterday about the time dirla rode in to hickory lake something happened to dag then i know it i felt it something terrible his brows drew down in wonder but he caught her by the arm as she tried to push past him wait you cant close your ground i dont know if youd be drawn in toowait she wrenched out of his grip and broke into a stumbling run he pelted after crying in exasperation blight it youre as bad as him among the trees a number of people seemed to be collected together in bedrolls under makeshift awnings of blankets and hides four women under one and four men under another they lay too still for sleep not still enough for death a little way off another bedroll was partly shaded under a blanket hitched to an ash trees limbs fawn fell to her knees beside it and stared in shock dag lay faceup under a light blanket someone had removed his arm harness and set it atop his saddlebags at the head of the bedroll fawn had watched his beloved face in sleep and knew its shape in all its subtle movements this was like no sleep shed ever seen the copper of his skin seemed tarnished and dull and his flesh stretched too tightly over his bones his sunken eyes were ringed with dark half circles but his bare chest rose and fell he breathed he lived saun slid to his knees beside her and grabbed her hands as she reached for dag no why not said fawn furiously yanking futilely against his strong grip whats happened to him saun began to give her a garbled and guiltysounding account of his trying to help by slaying mudmen in potsfawn gazed in bewilderment toward the boggy shoreline where he pointedthat she could only follow at all because of the prior descriptions of the groundlock shed heard from dirla of dag leaping into the eerie danger to save somebody named artin which sounded just like dag truly of dag being sucked into the lock or spell or whatever this was of dag lying unarousable all these three days gone fawn stopped fighting and saun with a stern look at her let her wrists go she rubbed them and scowled but im not a lakewalker im a farmer said fawn maybe it wouldnt work on me mari says no more experiments said saun grimly theyve already cost us three patrollers and the captain but if you dont if you dont poke at things how can you find anything out she sat back on her heels lips tight all right look around first poke later dags breathing didnt seem to be getting worse right away anyhow mari meanwhile had led hoharie and othan out to the mud pots then back through the grove to examine the other captives mari was finishing what sounded to fawn like a more coherent account of events than sauns as they came over and knelt on the other side of dag her tale of dags ground match with artins failing heart had the medicine maker letting out her breath in a faint whistle even more frightening to fawn was maris description of the strange blight left on dags ground from his fight with the malice huh hoharie scrubbed at her heatflushed face smearing road dirt in sweaty streaks and stared around for the love of reason mari what did you drag me here for in one breath you beg me to break this unholy groundlock and in the next you insist i dont dare even open my ground to examine it you cant have it both ways if dag went into that thing and couldnt get himself out i know i couldnt i dont know about you hoped youd have more tricks hoharie maris voice fell quiet ive been picking at this knot for days now till im near crosseyed crazy im starting to wonder when it will be time to cut our losses exceptall of those makers own bonded knives went missing during the time they were prisoners of the malice of the nine people down only bryn is carrying an unprimed knife right now thats not much to salvage for the price and im not real sure what would happen to someone locked up like that trying to share or to her knifeor to the others we had ill luck with those mudpuppies thats certain saun now leaning against the barren ash tree with his arms folded grimaced agreement fawns belly shuddered as it finally dawned on her what mari was talking about the picture of mari or saun or hoharielikely mari it seemed her idea of a leaders dutytaking those bone knives and methodically driving them through the hearts of her comrades going down the rows of bedrolls one after anotherno not dag fawn touched the knife beneath her shirt suddenly fiercely glad that her accident with it back at glassforge had at least blocked this ghastly possibility hoharie was frowning but it seemed to fawn more in sorrow than dissent i will say said mari dag falling into this lock seemed to give everyone in it new strengthfor a little while but the weaker ones are failing again if we were to add a new patroller every three days i dont rightly know how long we could keep them aliveexcept of course the problem would just get bigger and bigger as we strung it out im not volunteerin note and im not volunteerin you either hoharie so dont go getting ideas hoharie rubbed the back of her neck im going to have to get ideas of some sort but im not going to attempt anything at all tonight fatigue distorts judgment mari nodded approval and described the camp off the blight to the east where everyone not tending the enspelled apparently retreated to sleep when she paused fawn motioned at dag and broke in mariis it really true i cant touch him mari said it may be the finding out could be costly or not thought fawn i rode all this way hoharie said in a sort of weary sympathy we told you to stay home child theres nothing for you to do here but grieve and get in the way muttered othan almost inaudibly but i can feel dag still hoharie did not look hopeful but she rose to her knees reached across dag and took up fawns left arm anyway probing along it has it changed any lately the ache feels stronger for being closer but no clearer fawn admitted its funny dag gave me this for reassurance but instead its made me frantic is that you or him thats frantic i cant hardly tell the difference huh hoharie let her go and sat back this gets us no further that i can see yet with a pained grunt she rose to her feet and everyone else did too fawn held out her hands palms open to mari surely theres something i can do mari looked at her and sighed but at least it was a sigh of understanding theres bedding and catchrags to be washed fawns hands clenched i can do that sure better it was a task that would keep her here in the grove and not exiled a mile away oh thats important you rode a long way to do laundry farmer girl said othan and missed the cool look that the lakewalker women turned on him it was no stretch to fawn to guess who had been doing the washing so far mari said more firmly not that theres a pile its so hard to get anything into these people theres not much coming out in any case not tonight fawn you look bushed fawn admitted it with a short nod when it was all sorted out the partys horses including grace were led off to the east camp by the patrollers but fawn managed to keep her bedroll and saddlebags in the grove by dag it was driving her halfmad not to be allowed to touch him but she set about finding other tasks for her hands helping with the fire and the batches of broths and thin gruel that these experienced women had cooking hoharie commenced a second more thorough physical examination of all the silent groundlocked folk an expression of extreme frustration on her face i might as well be some farmer bonesetter fawn heard her mutter as she knelt by dag the tart thought came to fawn that really they might all be better off with one farmer bonesetters and midwives always had to work by guess and by golly with indirect clues they likely grew good at it over time resolutely fawn took on the laundry the following morning as soon as she could rise and move at least the work abused different muscles than the ones shed overtaxed the past three days riding trousers rolled above her knees she waded out into the cool water of the marsh towing a makeshift raft of lashedtogether deadwood holding the soiled blankets and catchrags the water seemed peculiarly clear and odorless for a marsh but it was fine for washing and she could keep an eye on the long lumpy shadow beneath the ash tree that was dag and see the silhouettes of the groundclosed helpers moving about the grove to her surprise one of the lakewalker men not a patroller but a survivor from the ruined village down the shore came out and joined her in the task silently taking up the rubbing and scrubbing by her side he said only youre dag redwings farmer bride not a question but a statement fawn could only nod he had a funny look on his face drawn and distant that made fawn shy of speaking to him though she murmured thanks as they passed clouts back and forth he took the main burden of lugging the heavy wet cloths back to the blighted trees and being much taller of hanging them up on the bare branches after she shook them out the only other thing he said rather abruptly as they finished and he turned away was artin the smith is my father see hoharie paced around the grove and squinted or walked out to a distance and stared or sat on a stump and drew formless lines on the ground with a stick scowling she went methodically through an array of more startling actions yelling at or slapping the sleepers pricking them with a pin stirring up the halfformed mudmen in their pots mari and saun with difficulty dissuaded her from killing another one by way of a test flushed after her futile exertions she came and sat crosslegged by dags bedroll scowling some more fawn sat across from her nibbling on a raw plunkin slice she wished she could feed dagwould the taste of genuine hickory lake plunkin be like home cooking to him but even if she could touch him he could not chewhe could barely swallow water she supposed she might try cooking and mashing up some of the root and thinning it down for a gruel disgusting as that sounded she asked hoharie quietly what do you figure hoharie shook her head this isnt just a lovers groundlock enlarged something of the malice must linger in it has to be an involuted ground reinforcement of some sort to survive the malices death what its living on is a puzzle well not much of a puzzle it has to be ground the mudmens or the peoples or both peoples most likely likelike a tick or a bellyworm made of ground fawn added to show she wasnt confused about that hoharie gave a vague wave that seemed to allow the comparison without exactly approving it it has to be worked ground maliceworked could bewell it obviously isquite complex i still dont understand the part about it being so anchored in place question is how long can it last will it be absorbed like a healing reinforcement and if so will it strengthen or slay is it just their groundlock paralysis that is weakening these folks or is there something more eating away at them inside at fawns faint gasp hoharies eyes flicked up she glanced from dag to fawn and murmured oh sorry talking to myself im afraid its all right i want to know everything so do i child hoharie sighed she levered to her feet and wandered off again saun having gone off to the east camp to sleep after taking a night watch it was othan who came at noon to feed dag broth fawn watched enviously and critically as he raised dags head into his lap wincing at every harsh click of spoon on teeth or muffled choke or dribble lost down over dags chin at least dags face wasnt rough with stubble saun had shaved it just this morning fawn had wondered at the effort since dag couldnt feel itbut somehow it did make him look less sick so maybe the use of it was not for dag but for the people who looked so anxiously after him she had smiled gratefully at saun anyhow othan on the other hand glowered at her as he worked what she finally demanded youre hovering back off cant you half a mile would do ive a right hes my husband that hasnt been decided yet fawn touched her marriage cord dag and i decided it quite a ways back down the road youll find out farmer othan coaxed the last spoonful of broth down his patients throat which moved just enough to swallow and laid dags head back down on the folded blanket that substituted poorly for a pillow fawn considered collecting dry grass to stuff it with later othan added he was a good patroller hoharie says he could be even more they say youve seduced him from his duty and will be the ruination his life if the camp council doesnt fix things fawn sat up indignantly they say so let them say it to my face if theyre not cowards and anyhow i think we sort of seduced each other my uncle whos a patroller says it and hes no coward fawn gritted her teeth as othansafely groundclosed othanstroked a strand of sweatdampened hair back from dags forehead how dare he act as if he owned dag just because he was lakewalkerborn and she wasnt the the stupid boy was just a wetbehindtheears apprentice no older than she was younger likely her longing to shut othan up make him look nohow was quelled by her sudden realization that he might be a lead into just the sort of camp gossip dag had so carefully shielded her from alsothis was half an argument just what all had dag been saying back to hickory lake camp she recalled the day hed made that poor plunkin into a porcupine with his bow and her arrows her spinning mind settled on im not a patch on your malices for ruination theyre not our malices fawn smiled blackly oh yes they are she added after a fuming moment and there isnt any was about it unless you want to say he was a good patroller and he now is a really good captain he took his company right through that awful raintree malice like a knife through butter to hear dirla tell it despite being married to a farmer so there despite yeah othan growled fawn took a grip on her shredding temper as mari and hoharie came up othan scrambled to his feet giving over glaring at fawn in order to look anxiously at the medicine maker hoharie looked grim and mari grimmer which one then said mari dag said hoharie ive worked on his ground enough to be most familiar with it and hes also the most recent to fall into the lock if that counts for anything othan good youre here she continued without a pause im going to enter this groundlock and i want you to try to anchor me othan looked alarmed are you sure hoharie no but ive tried everything else i can think of and i wont walk away from this no youre leaving that dirty job to me muttered mari irritably hoharie returned her the sort of sharp shrug that indicated a lengthy argument concluded hoharie went on ill set up a light link to you othan and try for a glimpse inside the groundlock then pull back if i cant disengage you are to break with me instantly and not try to enter in after me do you hear she caught her apprentices gaze and held it sternly othan gulped and nodded fawn scrunched back in the litter of dry grass and dead leaves on dags far side wrapping her arms around her knees and trying to make herself small so they wouldnt notice and exclude her hoharie paused then said my knife is in my saddlebags mari if it comes to that when should it come to it hoharie dont leave me with that decision too when the weakest start to die i believe it will throw more strain on the rest so it will go faster toward the end that poor maker who died before dags patrol arrived showed that such deaths wont break the lock if anything it may grow more concentrated i thinkonce two or more of the nineno tenare down then start the sharing and youll just have to see what happens next she added after a moment start with me of course that said mari distantly will be my turn to pick hoharies lips thinned mm i dont recommend this hoharie i hear you evidently not because the medicine maker lowered herself crosslegged by the head of dags bedroll motioning othan down beside her he sat up on his knees she straightened her spine and shut her eyes for a moment seeming to center herself she then took othans hand with her left hand there apparently followed another moment of invisibletofawn ground adjustments without further hesitation hoharies right hand reached out and touched dags forehead fawn thought she saw him grimace in his trance but it was hard to be sure then hoharies eyes opened wide with a yank she pulled her hand from othans and slammed the heel of it into his chest pushing him over backward her eyes rolled up her face drained of color and expression and she slumped across dag with a muted wail othan scrambled up and dove for her mari cursed and caught othan from behind wrapping her arms around his torso and trapping his hands no she yelled in his ear obey her close up close up blight you boy othan strained against her briefly then with a choke of despair sprawled back in her grip ten snarled mari thats it thats all were doing here not eleven you hear she shook him othan nodded dully and she let him free he leaned on his hands staring at his unconscious mentor in horror what did you feel mari demanded of him anything he shook his head inothing useful i dont think it was like i could feel her ground being pulled away from me into the dark he turned a distraught face to the patrol leader i didnt let go mari i didnt she pushed me away i saw boy sighed mari you did what you could slowly she stood up and braced her legs apart and her hands on her hips staring down at the two enspelled in their heap well lay her out with the rest shes in there with them now maybe she can do something different if this thing was weakening with age could we tell if nothing else she may have bought three more days of time her voice fell to a savage mutter except i dont want more time i want this to be over hoharies bedroll was placed under the ash tree close to dags othan took up a crosslegged station of guard or grief on the opposite side to fawn who sat similarly beyond dag they didnt much look at each other toward sunset mari came and sat down between the two bedrolls blight you two she said conversationally to the unconscious pair for leaving this on me this is company captain work not patrol leader work no fair slithering out of it dag my boy she looked up and caught fawns eye from where she lay on her side near dag fawn sat up and returned an inquiring look brynmari hooked a thumb over her shoulder toward the rank of female sleepers beneath their awningwill be all of twentytwo next week if she has a next week shes young good groundsense range she might yet grow up to have a passel of youngsters hoharie ive known her longer a medicine maker has valuable skills she might yet save the lives of a dozen girls like bryn so how shall i decide which first some choice maybe she sighed maybe it wont make any difference i hardly know which way to wish for agh pay no attention to my maunderings girl mari continued as fawns stare widened i think im getting too old im going to go sleep off this blight tonight it drains your wits as well as your strength blight does all despair and death you get into this mood she clambered back to her feet and gazed blearily down over dags supine form at fawn i know you cant feel the blight direct but its working on you too you should take a break off this deathly ground as well fawn shook her head i want to stay here by dag for whatever time we have left mari shrugged suit yourself then she wandered away into the softening twilight fawn awoke to moonlight filtering down through the ash trees bare branches she lay a moment in her bedroll trying to recapture her dreams hoping for something usefully prophetic in ballads people often had dreams that told them what to do you were supposed to follow instructions precisely too or risk coming to several stanzas of grief but she remembered no dreams she doubted theyd reveal anything even if she did farmer dreams perhaps if shed been lakewalkerbornshe scowled at othan asleep and snoring faintly on the other side of hoharie if anyone were to have any useful uncanny visions it would more likely be him blight him no not blight him that wasnt fair reluctantly she allowed he had courage as hed shown this afternoon and hoharie would not have favored him out of her other apprentices and brought him along if he didnt have promise as well it was merely that fawn would feel better if he were completely stupid and not just stupid about farmers then he wouldnt be able to make her doubt herself so much she sighed and rose to pick her way out to the slit trench at the far edge of the grove returning she sat up on her blanket and studied dag the stippled moonlight made his unmoving face look disturbingly corpsecolored the dark nightglitter of his eyes smiling at her would have redeemed it all but they remained sunken and shut he might die she thought without her ever seeing their bright daylight gold again she swallowed the scared lump in her throat would they let her touch him after he was dead i could touch him now but there was little she could do for him physically that wasnt already being done more safely by others wait on that then involuted ground reinforcement she rolled the phrase over in her mind as if tasting it it clearly meant something quite specific to hoharie and doubtless to dag and mari as well and othan a ground reinforcement curling up on itself which didnt gradually become part of its new owner she rubbed her arm and wondered if the ground reinforcement dag had done on her was involuted or not if she followed hoharies explanation it seemed that the involution was a cutoff bit of malice like her own was a cutoff bit of dag remembering the glassforge malice she was glad she and dag had stopped it before it had developed such farflung powers her brows bent had hoharie ever seen a malice up as close as fawn had makers seemed to stay back in camp mostly so maybe not sharing knives might be complicated to make but they were so simple to use a farmer child might do soas fawn had proven she smiled now to remember dags wild cry sharp end first her thoughts fell like water drops into a still pool sharing knives kill malices theres a bit of leftover malice in dag and artin and these other people maybe it just needs an extra dose of mortality to finish cleaning it out i have a sharing knife she inhaled shuddering it wasnt possible for her to think of something to try that dag and mari and hoharie hadnt and already dismissed for some good reason that fawn was simply too ignorant to know was it there was a lot of lakewalker emotion and habit tied up in sharing knives sacrificial in every sense sacred not seen as a fit subject for idle fooling around with she hunched over wideawake now it didnt have to be through the heart did it that was only for unprimed knives first collecting their dose of mortality for discharging the death anywhere in the malices groundworked body would apparently do she might have stabbed the glassforge malice in the foot to the same stunning effect so where were the the malice bits lodged in the enspelled lakewalkers pooled or diffuse they all had to be connected because to touch any of them triggered the same trap her knife dar had said was of dubious potency and value no affinity but its the only one i have a right to her eyes turned to dag and hes the only one i have a right to so swiftly before her nerve failed her she rose and careful not to touch his skin delicately drew down his blanket she lifted it past his ribbed chest his loose breechclout his long legs letting it fall again in folds at his feet his body was all sculpted shadows in the moonlight too thin shed thought shed started to put some meat on his bones but it was all used up again by the past weeks of dire strain and then some not the heart not the eyeeew not the gut for nonlethal flesh wounds one was pretty much limited to arms and legs carefully away from where those big veins and nerves ran down under the arm would be bad she was pretty sure likewise the back of the knee and the inner thigh better the outer thigh or the arm just below the shoulder dags strappy arm muscles didnt seem all that thick compared to the length of the bone blade hanging around her neck thigh then she crouched down if hoharie had been conscious fawn could have asked her but then fawn would still be waiting for the lakewalker expert to fix things and likely would not have conceived this desperate notion at all now the medicine maker lay entranced with the rest leaving only othan in charge fawn wouldnt have asked othan for a drink in a downpour nor have expected him to give her one still am i about to be stupid again think it through this might do nothing in which case she would have to clean the blood off her knife and explain the ugly hole in her husband tomorrow morning envisioning which she scrambled back to her saddlebags and dug out one of her spare clean ragbags stuffed with cattail fluff and some cord there a good bandage this might do what she hoped this might do something awful but something awful was going to happen anyhow she could not make things worse right then she laid out the makeshift swab dragged her pouch from around her neck and pulled out the pale knife the little delay had sapped her courage she hunkered by dags left hip a moment trying to gather it again she wished she could pray but the gods they said were absent she had nothing to trust in now but her own wits she swallowed a whimper dag says youre smart if you cant trust you trust him sharp end first anywhere she drew back her hand took careful aim at what she hoped was all nice thick muscle then plunged the bone knife in till the tip nicked against dags own bone still without ever touching him dag grunted and jerked in his sleep she whipped her shaking hand away from the hilt which stood out from his lean thigh all indigo blue and ivory in the silver light from over her shoulder othans voice screamed what are you doing you crazy farmer he reached to clamp her shoulders and drag her roughly back from dag but not before she saw dags left arm jolt up from his bedroll as though its invisible hand was wrapping itself around the sharing knifes hilt and heard the faint familiar snap of splintering bone blade h e had floated in an increasingly timeless gray fog all distinctions fading it seemed a just consolation that with them faded all fear want and pain but then inexplicably something bright and warm troubled his shredding perceptions as if the north star had torn herself loose from the sky and ventured too near him in naive luminous fatal curiosity dont fall nostay away spark longing and horror wrenched him for to grasp that joy would slay it is it my fate to blight all that i love but the star fire didnt touch him later a bolt of new strength shot through him and for a short time coherent thought came back some other light had fallen into this prison also known to himhe recognized hoharies intense ground in all its everastonishing vigorso strange that such a spring of strength should dwell in such a slight and unassuming body but the hope it should have brought him turned to ashes as he took in her anger horror and frustration i thought sure youd figure the trick of it from out there as i could notim the blinder one i had to look to see it and the wailing answer i had to look to be surei had to be certainoh dag i am so sorrybefore the fog blurred all to voiceless sorrow once more he raced to make his watch rounds in this brief stolen respite to count his company as every captain should artin yes barely holding on his ground so drained as to be translucent at the edges bryn and ornig mallora the other bonemarsh makers and now hoharie he remembered to count himself ten all dying in place again he led those who had trusted in him into the boundless dark at least this time i cant desert them more timelessness gray mouths leeched him the star fire moved too close again and he breathed dread like cold mist but the skyspark held something else a faint familiar chime her fair light and its wordless song wound together their intertwined beauty overthrew his heart this is surely the magic of the whole wide green world lakewalker groundwork has nothing to compare with it and then pain and the song pierced him he could feel every detail of the roiling ground that stabbed into his thigh kauneos bone his own blood of old the involuted and shaped vessel for mortality that was the gift of the luthlian knife maker sparks daughters death death without birth selfmaking and selfdissolution intermingled in their purest forms too pure it lay selfcontained within the involution innocent of all taint of desire motion and time it lacks affinity seemed too flat a statement to sum up its aloof stillness free of all attachment free of all pain we give best from abundance i can share pain flying as never before he raised his arm by its ground and his ghost handpure ground piebald with blight and malice spatterwrapped the hilt and the ground of the hilt his own old blood gave him entry into the involution he let his blackened ground trace up its ancient dried path catch hold and he remembered the night fawn had woven his wedding cord with bloody fingers and so drawn her own ground into it and her wideopen eyes and unguarded offer later on another night of groundweaving need blood as if she would gladly have opened her veins on the spot and poured all that vivid flood into his cupped hands sparing nothing as she does now do not waste her gift old patroller his blackened touch seemed a violation but he twisted the mortal ground between his ghost fingers the way fawn spun thread he grinned somewhere inside himself to imagine dars outraged voice you used a weddingcord technique on a sharing knife the involution uncoiled giving up its long burden into his hand kauneos bone cracked joyfully a sound beneath sound heard not with his ears but in his groundsense and he knew in that moment that dars theory of how the farmer babes death had entered his knife was entirely wrongheaded but he had no time now to examine it he held mortality in his hand and it would not wait within his hand not upon it the two were as inextricable as two fibers spun into one strong thread affinity now at last he closed his hand upon the malices dark construction his ghost hand twisted stretched and tore apart as the mortality flowed from him into the gray mouths along the lines of draining hunger and he howled without sound in the agony of that wrenching the malice spatters on his body were ripped out from their patches of blight as if dragged along on a towline gashing through his ground and out his arm the dazzling fire raced consuming its dark path as it traveled the gray fogthreads of the malices involution blazed up in fire all over the grove leaving a web of red sparks hanging for a moment as if suspended in air when it reached the mudmens dense impelling groundshapes they exploded in fiery pinwheels their aching afterimages spinning in dags groundsense weighty as whirlpools peeling off a paddles trailing edge thenquiet dag had not known that silence could reverberate so or maybe that was just him when a long strain was released the recoil itself could become a new source of painno actually that was just his body hed thought hed missed his body back when his mind had been set adrift from it in that groundfog now he was not so sure its pangs were all suddenly very distinctive indeed head neck back arm haunches all cried out and his bladder definitely clamored for attention his body was noisy cranky and insistent but he sought something more urgent he pried his eyes open blinking away the glue and sand that seemed to cement his lids together he was staring up at bare silvered branches and a night sky washed with moonlight strong enough to cast interlaced shadows across the grove voices were moaning in surprise or crying out in shock shouts of alarm transmuted to triumph in the blue moonlight and red flare of new wood thrown on a nearby fire a baffling sight met his gaze fawn and hoharies apprentice othan seemed to be dancing or perhaps wrestling it was hard to be sure othan was breathing hard through his nose fawn had both hands wrapped around one of his wrists and was swinging from it dragging his arm down his boots stamped in an unbalanced circle as he tried to shake her off cursing dag cleared his throat and said mildly albeit in a voice as rusty and plaintive as an old gate hinge othan quit manhandling my wife get your own farmer girl the two sprang apart and othan gasped sir i wasnt what he wasnt dag didnt hear because with a sob of joy fawn threw herself down across his chest and kissed him he thought his mouth tasted as foul as an old birds nest but strangely she didnt seem to mind his left arm deadened wasnt working his right weighed far too much but he hoisted it into the air somehow and after an uncertain wobble let it fall across her fingers clutching contentedly he had no idea why or how she was here it was likely a fawnfluke her solid wriggling warmth suggested hopefully that she was not a hallucination not that he was in the best shape to distinguish just now she stopped kissing him long enough to gasp dag im so sorry i had to stab you i couldnt think of any other way does it hurt bad mm he said vaguely he was more numb than in pain but he became aware of a shivering ache in his left thigh he tried to raise his head failed and stirred his leg instead an utterly familiar knife haft drifted past his focus he blinked in bemusement a foot higher and id have thought you were mad at me spark her helpless laughter wavered into weeping the drops fell warm across his chest and he stroked her shuddering shoulder and murmured wordlessly after a moment she gulped and raised her face you have to let me go no i dont he said amiably we have to get those bone fragments dug out of your leg i didnt know how far to stick it in so i pushed it all the way im afraid thorough as ever i see she shrugged out of his weak grip and escaped but grinned through her tears so that was likely all right he eased open his groundsense a fraction aware of something deeply awry in his own bodys ground just below his perceptions but managed a head count of the people in the grove before he tightened up again all alive some very weak but all alive someone had flung himself onto a horse bareback and was galloping for the east camp othan was diverted from his farmerwrestling to tend on hoharie struggling up out of her bedroll dag gave up captaining lay back with a sigh of boundless fatigue and let them all do whatever they wanted in due course othan came back with hoharies kit and some lights and commenced some pretty unpleasant fiddling about down by dags side weary hoharie directed and fawn hovered that the blade should hurt worse coming out than going in made some sense but not that it should do so more often voices muttered rose and fell its bleeding so much thats all right itll wash the wound out a bit now the swab hoharie do you know what that swab is othan think of course i do very clever fawn now tie the strips down tight no peeking under it unless it soaks through did he get it all yes lookfit the pieces together like a puzzle and check for missing chips or fragments all smooth see oh yes hoharie its like his ground is shredded hanging off him in strips ive never felt anything like i saw when it happened it was spectacular get the bleeding stopped get everyone off this blight and over to the east camp get me some food then well tackle it the evacuation resembled a torchlight parade organized by the folks who came pelting over from the east camp all dressed by guess and riotous with relief those freed from the groundlock who could sit a horse were led off two to a mount holding each other upright and the rest were carried dag was carted eastward feetfirst on a plank sauns face grinning loonlike drifted past his gaze in the flickering shadows maris voice complained loudly about missing the most exciting part dag gripped fawns hand for the whole mile and refused to let go the east camp didnt settle down till dawn fawn woke again near noon trapped underneath dags outflung arm she just lay there for a while relishing the lovely weight of it and the slow breath ruffling her curls eventually she gently eased out from under sat up and looked around she thought it a measure of dags exhaustion that her motions didnt wake him the way they usually did their bedroll was sheltered under a sort of half tent of bent saplings splinted together supporting a blanket roof halfprivate the camp extended along the high side of a little creek well shaded by green unblighted trees maybe twenty or twentyfive patrollers seemed to be moving about some going for water or out to the horse lines some tending cook fires several clustered around bedrolls feeding tiredlooking folks who nevertheless were doggedly sitting up at length dag woke too then it was her turn to help him prop up his shoulders against his saddlebags happily she fed him he could both chew and swallow and not choke halfway through he revived enough to start capturing the bits of plunkin or roast deer from her with his right hand and feed himself his hand still trembled too much to manage his water cup without spilling though his left arm more disturbingly didnt move at all and she suspected the bandage wrapping his left leg disguised even deeper ills than the knife wound his eyes were bloodshot and squinty more glazed than bright but she reveled in their gold glints nonetheless and the way they smiled at her as though theyd never quit in all fawn was glad when hoharie came by even if she was trailed by othan she was accompanied and supported by mari whose general air of relief clouded when her eye fell on dag the medicine maker looked fatigued but not nearly as ravaged as dag perhaps because her time in the lock had been the shortest she had all her formidable wits back about her anyhow othan unwrapped the leg and hoharie pronounced his neat stitches that closed the vertical slit to be good tight work and the redness only to be expected and not a sign of infection yet and they would do some groundwork later to prevent adhesions othan seemed even more relieved at the chance to rewrap the wound with more usual sorts of patroller bandages while this was going on mari reported before you ask three times dageveryone made it out of the groundlock alive dags eyes squeezed shut in thankfulness i was pretty sure is artin going to hold on his heart took hurt there i thought yes but his son has him well in hand all the raintree folks could be carried off by their kin as early as tomorrow at least as far as the next camp theyll recover better there than out here in the woods dag nodded once theyre away our folks will be getting anxious to see home again too bryn and ornig are up already and i dont think mallora will be much behind young yknow i dont know about you but im right tired of this place with that hole in your leg its plain youre not walking anywhere its up to hoharie to say how soon you can ride ask me tomorrow said hoharie the legs not really the worst of it so what about the arm hoharie dag asked hesitantly his voice still sounded like something down in a swamp croaking its a bit worryin not moving like that kind of takes me back to some memories i dont much care to revisit hoharie grimaced understanding i can see why as othan tied off the new dressing and sat back she added quietly time to give me a look you have to open yourself dag yeah he sighed he didnt sound at all enthusiastic fawn thought but he lay back against his saddle prop with a faraway look on his face his lips moved in something deeper than a wince mari hissed hoharies lips pursed and othan who had sewn up bleeding flesh without a visible qualm looked suddenly ill well thats a bigger mess than utau and i thought he was impressive allowed hoharie let me see what i can do with this you cant do a ground reinforcement after all you just went through dag objected i have enough oomph left for one she replied her face going intent i was saving it for you figured fawn tugged at mari and whispered urgently whats going on what do you all sense that i cant the ground down his left sides all marked up with blight like big deep bruises mari whispered back but those nasty black malice spatters that i felt before seem to be gone nowthats a real good sign i reckon the ground of his left arm though is hanging in tatters hoharies wrapping it all up with a shaped ground reinforcementooh cleveri think she means to help it grow back together easier as it heals hoharie let out her breath in a long sigh her back bent dag his expression very inward stared down at his left arm as it moved in a short jerk better he murmured in pleased surprise time said hoharie and now she sounded down in that swamp too dag gave her a dry look as if to say now whos overdoing she ignored it and continued itll all come back in time as your ground slowly heals slowly got that dag dag sighed in regret yeah his voice fell further the ghost hand its gone isnt it for good like the other hoharie said somewhat impatiently gone for a good to be sure but not necessarily forever i know it perturbed you dag but i wish youd stop thinking of that hand as some morbid magic it was a ground projection a simplewell it was a ground projection anyway as your ground heals up from all this blight it should come back with the rest of it last i imagine so dont go fuming and fretting oh said dag looking brighter fawn could have hit him for winking at her like that just then because it almost made her laugh out loud and shed never dare explain why to all these stern lakewalkers now said hoharie sitting up and rubbing her forehead with the back of her wristothan watching her closely handed her a clean rag and she repeated the gesture with it and nodded thanks its my chance to ask a few questions what i need to know is if a similar act would solve a similar problem because i need to write this out for the loretent if it does and maybe pass it along to the other hinterlands too i hope there never is a similar problem said mari because that would mean another runaway malice like this one and this one got way too close to being unstoppable but write it out all the same sure you never know no one can know till its tried said dag but my own impression was that any primed knife placed in any of the groundlocked people would have worked to clean out the malices involution it only needed someone to think of itand dare it seems a strange way to spend a sacrifice agreed hoharie stillten for one all the lakewalkers looked equally pensive contemplating this mortal arithmetic when did you think of it pretty nearly as soon as i was trapped in the groundlock i could see it then hoharies gaze flicked to fawns left wrist fawn by now inured to being talked past almost flinched under the suddenly intent stare that was also about the time you felt a change in that peculiar ground reinforcement dag gave you wasnt it fawn did it seem to come with say a compulsion othan sat up straight oh of course that would explain how she knew what to do did it fawns brows drew down in doubt it didnt seem anything like so clear i wish it had been so how did you know asked hoharie patiently to use your sharing knife like that i she hesitated casting her mind back to last nights desperation i figured it how she struggled to express her complex thoughts simply a lot of it hadnt even been in words just in pictures well you said that there were cutoff bits of malice in that groundlock sharing knives kill malices i thought it might just need an extra dose to finish the job but your knife had no affinity what fawn stared in confusion dag cleared his throat his voice went gentle dar was rightabout that anyway the mortality in your knife was too pure to hold affinity with malices but i was able to break into its involution and add some a little extra lastminute making would you say hoharie hoharie eyed him making im not sure that wasnt magery dag fawns brow wrinkled in distress is that what tore up your ghost hand oh if i had known sh soothed dag if you had known what she stared down at her hands clutching each other in her lap after a long pause she said id have done it all the same good he whispered so said othan clearly struggling with this you didnt really know you were just guessing he nodded in apparent relief a real stab in the dark and in fact except for dag saving it all at the last you were wrong fawn took a long breath considering this painful thought sometimes she said distantly with all the dignity she could gather it isnt about having the right answers its about asking the right questions dag gave a slow blink his face went curiously still but then he smiled at her again in a way that made the knot in her heart unwind and gave her a considering nod yeahit was what we in tent bluefield call a fluke othan he murmured and the warm look he gave fawn with that made the knot unwind all the way down to her toes later in the afternoon saun came back from the woods with a peeledsapling staffhickory he claimed with that and sauns shoulder for support dag was able to hobble back and forth to the slit trench that cured dag of ambition for any further movement he was quite content to lie propped in his bedroll occasionally with fawn tucked up under his arm and watch the camp go by and not talk he was especially content not to talk a few inquiring noises were enough to persuade fawn to ripple on about how shed arrived so astonishingly here he felt a trifle guilty about giving her so little tale in return but she had saun and mari to cull for more details and she did the next day the last of the companys scouts returned having hooked up with another gaggle of bonemarsh refugees returning to check on their quick and their dead with the extra hands on offer it was decided to move the recovering makers to better shelter that day and the raintree cavalcade moved off in midafternoon the camp fell quiet at this point dags remaining patrol realized that the only barrier between them and a ride for home was their convalescent captain the half dozen patrollers who were capable of giving minor ground reinforcements either volunteered or were volunteered to contribute to his speedier recovery dag blithely accepted them all until his left foot began to twitch his speech slurred and he started seeing faint lavender halos around everything and hoharie with some dire muttering about absorption time blight it cut off the anxious suppliers the miasma of homesickness and restlessness that permeated the air was like a fog by evening dag found it easy to persuade mari and codo to split the patrol and send most of them home tomorrow with hoharie leaving dag a suitable smaller group of bodyguards or nursemaids to follow on as soon as he was cleared to mount a horse again mari after a consultation with hoharie out of dags earshot appointed herself chief of their number somebodys got to stand up to you when you get bored and decide to advance hoharies timetable by three days she told dag bluntly when he offered a reminder of cattagus if we leave you nothing but the children youll ride right over em despite his pains and exhaustion dag was wholly satisfied to lie with fawn that night in their little shelter as if hed entered some place of perfect balance where all needs were met and no motion was required he wasnt homesick on the whole he had no desire at all to think about hickory lake and what awaited him thereno he stopped that slide of thought be here with her he petted her letting her dark hair wind and slide through his fingers silky delight in her saddlebags she had brought candles of all things of her own making and had stuck one upright in a holder made from a smooth dented stone shed found in the stream he was unaroused and in his current condition likely unarousable but looking at her in this gilded light he was pierced with a pure desire as if he were gazing at a running foal or a wheeling hawk or a radiant melting sunset wonder caught up in flight that no man could possess except in the eye and impalpable memory where time was the final foe but the long defeat was not now now now fawn seemed content to cuddle atop the bedroll and trade kisses but at length she wriggled up to do off her boots and belt they would sleep in their clothes like patrollers but she drew the line at unnecessary lumps with a thoughtful frown she pulled her sharing knife cord over her head i reckon i can put this away in my saddlebags now she slid the haft out of its sheath and spilled the three long shards of the broken blade out on the bedroll lining them up with her finger dag rolled over and up on his elbow to look huh so that explains what othan was doing down there fishing all those out of me i wondered sonow what do we do with it fawn asked a spent knife if its recovered is usually given back to the kin of the bones donor or if that cant be done burned on a little pyre its been twenty years butkauneo should have kin up in luthlia who remember her i still have her uncle kaunears bone too back home in my trunkhadnt quite got round to arranging for it when this raintree storm blew in on us i should send them both up to luthlia in a courier pouch with a proper letter telling everyone what their sacrifices have bought that would be best i think she nodded gravely and extended a finger to gently roll a shard over in the end this did do more than just bring us together despite what dar said about the farmer ground being worthless because of your making that redeemed it imnot glad exactly theres not much glad about thissatisfied i think dar said he hoisted himself up and stopped her lips with a kiss dont worry about what dar says i dont dont you she frowned butwasnt he right about the affinity dag shrugged wellit would have been strange if he werent knives are his calling im not at all sure he was right about the other though other about how your babes ground got into my knife her black eyebrows curved up farther he lay back again raising his hand to hover across from his stump as a man would hold his two hands some judicious distance apart it was just a quick impression you understand when i was unmaking the knifes involution and releasing the mortal ground i couldnt prove it it was all gone in the instant and only i saw butthere was more than one knife stuck in that malice at that moment back at glassforge and there is more than one sort of ground affinity there was a link a channelbecause the one knife was kauneos marrowbone see and the other was her hearts death knives dont take up souls if there is such a thing but each one has a a flavor of its donor i expect she died wanting and regretting well a lot of things but i know a child was one i wouldnt dare say this to anyone else but ill swear it to you it wasnt the malice pushed that ground into kauneos bone i think it was given shelter fawn sat back her lips parting in wonder her eyes were huge and dark winking liquid that reflected the candlelight in shimmers he added very quietly if it was a gift from the grave its the strangest i ever heard tell of butshe liked youngsters she would have saved em all if she could fawn whispered shes not the only one seemingly and rolled over into his arms and hugged him tight then sat up on her elbow and said most seriously tell me more about her and to his own profound astonishment he did it came in a spate when it came to speak easily of kauneo at last to repossess such a wealth of memory from the far side of pain was as beyond all expectation as claiming a stolen treasure returned after years as miraculous as getting back a missing limb and his tears when they fell seemed not sorrow but grace f or the next couple of days dag seemed willing to rest as instructed to fawns approval although she noticed he seemed less fidgety and fretful when she sat by him saun had stayed on with griff for his partner varleen replaced dirla as maris partner there were not too many camp chores for fawns hands everyone having pretty much caught up with their cleaning and mending in the prior days though she did spend some time out with the younger patrollers working on or playing with the horses grace hadnt gone lame though fawn thought it had been a near thing the mare was certainly recovering faster than dag fawn suspected lakewalkers used their healing magic on their horses if not officially certainly on the sly on the third day the heavy heat was pushed on east by a cracking thunderstorm the tree branches bent and groaned menacingly overhead and leaves turned inside out and flashed silver the patrollers ended up combining their tent coversexcept for the one hide that blew off into the woods like a mad baton dag and fawns sapling frame and clustering underneath the nearby creek rose and ran mudbrown and foamyellow as the blow subsided into a steady vertical downpour by unspoken mutual assent they all eased back and just watched it passing around odd bits of cold food while their cookfire pit turned into an opaque gray puddle griff produced a wooden flute and instructed saun on it for a time fawn recognized maybe half of the sprightly tunes in due course griff took it back and played a long eerie duet with the rain varleen and saun supplying muted percussion with sticks and whatever pots they had to hand dag and mari seemed satisfied to listen everyone went back to nibbling dag who had been lying slumped against his saddlebags with his eyes closed pushed himself slightly more upright adjusted his left leg and asked saun suddenly you know the name of that farmer town the malice was supposed to have come up under greenspring saun replied absently craning his neck through the open leeward side of their shelter to look in vain for a break in the clouds do you know where it is ever been there yeah couple of times its about twentyfive miles northwest of bonemarsh he sat back on his saddlecloth and gestured vaguely at the opposite shelter wall dag pursed his lips that must be what pretty nearly fifty miles above the old cleared line nearly how was it ever let get started up so far it wasnt there in my day saun shrugged some settlements been there for as long as ive been alive three roads meet and a river there were a couple of mills if i remember rightly sawmill first later when there got to be more farms around it they built one for grain blacksmith forge more wed stopped in at the blacksmith a few times though they werent too friendly to patrollers why not asked fawn willing to be indignant on sauns behalf old history first few times farmers tried to settle up there the raintree patrollers ran them off but they snuck back worse than pulling stumps to try and get farmers off cleared land on account of all the stumps they had to pull to clear it i guess there finally got to be so many of them and so stubborn it would have taken bloodshed to shift em and folks gave up and let em stay on dag frowned saun pulled his knees up and wrapped his arms around them in the damp chill fellow up there once told me lakewalkers were just greedy to keep such prime farming country for a hunting reserve that his people could win more food from it with a plow than we ever could with bows and traps what we hunt they could not eat growled mari thats the same fellow who told me blight bogles were a fright story made up by lakewalkers to keep farmers off saun added a bit grimly you wonder where he is now griff and varleen shook their heads fawn bit her lip dag wound a finger in his hair pulling gently on a strand he was overdue for another cut fawn thought unless he meant to grow it out like his comrades i want to look at the place before we head home griffs brow furrowed thatd be a good three days out of our way dag maybe only two if we jog up and catch the northern road again he added after a moment we could leave here two days early and be home on schedule all the same mari gave him a fishy look thought it was about time for you to start gettin resty hoharie said seven days off it for that leg we all heard her come on you know she padded that mari did not exactly deny this but she did say and why would you want to anyway you know what blight looks like without having to go look at more its all the same thats what makes it blight company captains duty fairbolt will want a report on how this all got started not his territory dag its some raintree camp captains job to look into it dags eyelids lowered and rose in that peculiar iamnotarguingaboutthis look his gaze met fawns curious one nonetheless i need to see whatever can be seen im not calling for a debate on this in case any of you were confused a faint rare tinge of iron entered his voice not arguing apparently but not giving way either maris face screwed up why i could likely give you a tolerably accurate description of it all from right where i sit and so could you depressing but accurate what answers are you lookin for if i knew i wouldnt have to go look more hairtwisting i dont think im even looking for answers im think im looking for new questions he gave fawn a slow nod the next morning dawned bright blue and everyone spent it getting their gear spread out in the sun or up on branches to dry out by noon dag judged this task well along and floated the notion of starting out todayin gentle easy stages to counter maris exasperated look and mutter of told you so but since mari was as sick of this place as everyone else dag soon had his way with the promise of home dangling in the distance however roundaboutly the youngsters had the camp broken down and bundled up in an hour and saun led their six mounts and the packhorse northwest they skirted wide around the dead marsh flat and dun in a crystalline light that still could not make it sparkle for all that a shortcut across the blight would have saved several miles halfway around mari drew her horse to a halt and turned her face to a vagrant moist breeze what saun called back alert smell that said mari right whiffy said varleen wrinkling her nose somethings starting to rot dag explained to fawn who rode up beside him and looked anxiously inquiring thats good she shook her head you people hope is where you find it he smiled down at her then pushed copperhead along he could feel his weary patrols mood lighten just a shade as hed promised mari they weaved through the woodlands of raintree at a sedate walk they rode with groundsenses open like people trailing their hands through the weeds as they strolled not formally patrolling but as routine precaution you never knew dag himself had once found and done for a very early sessile that way when he was riding courier all alone in the far northeast hinterland of seagate still their amble put a good twelve miles between them and the bonemarsh blight by the time they stopped in the early evening dag thought everyone slept a bit better that night even he did despite the throbbing ache in his healing thigh they started off the next day earlier but no faster varleen spotted two mudman corpses off the trail that appeared to have died naturally running down at the end of the stolen strength the malice had given them suggesting the hazard from the rest of their cohort was now much reduced even at this slow pace the little patrol came up on the first noxious pinching of the blight around greenspring by midafternoon in the shade of the last live trees before the trail opened out into cleared fields dag held up his hook and everyone pulled their mounts to a halt we dont all have to go in we could set up a camp here you could stay with varleen and griff fawn blight this deep will be draining even if you cant feel it bad for you andit could be ugly will be ugly fawn leaned on her pommel and gave him a sharp look if its bad for me wont it be worse for you convalescing as you arentat least not any too fast that i can see mari vented a sour chuckle shes got you there fawn took a breath and sat up this placeits something like west blue right maybe dag allowed theni need to see it too she gave a firm little nod they exchanged a long look her resolve rang true should i be surprised soonest begun soonest done then we wont linger long dag braced himself and waved saun onward they rode first past deserted farms sickly then dying then dead then dead with a peculiar gray tinge that was quite distinctive dag knew it well and furled his groundsense in tight around him as did the other patrollers it didnt help quite enough what are we looking for asked griff as the first buildings of a little town hove into view past a screen of bare and broken buckthorn bushes someones scraggly attempt at a hedge id like to find the lair to start said dag see where the malice started out try to figure why it wasnt spotted it wasnt that hard they just followed the gradient of blight deeper and deeper it felt like riding into a dark hollow for all that the land here was as level as the rest of raintree the flattened vegetation grew grayer and even the clapboard houses with their fences leaning drunkenly seemed drained of all color it all smelled as dry and odorless as cave dust the town was maybe twice the size of west blue dag gauged it had three or four streets a sturdy wharf jutted into a river worthy of the name and not just a jumpedup creek which seemed to flow deeply enough to float small keelboats up from the grace and certainly rafts and flatboats down a square for a day market alehouse and smithy and forge perhaps two hundred houses a thousand people formerly none now the pit of the blight seemed to lie in a woodlot at the edge of the town the horses snorted uneasily as their riders forced them forward a shallow shalelined ravine with a small creek running through it shadowed a near cave partway up one side not unlike the one theyd seen near glassforge if much smaller it was quite empty now the shale slumping in a slide to half block the water alongside the creek the earth was pocked with manwide mandeep pits so thickly clustered in places as to seem like a wasp nest broken open the malices first mudman nursery likely with all these people around said griff its hard to believe that no one spotted any of the early malice signs maybe someone did said fawn and no one paid them any mind being too young and short the woodlot is common for the whole town you bet the youngsters here played in that creek all the time and in these woods dag hunched over his saddlebow and inhaled carefully steadying his shuddering stomach yes malice food indeed of the richest sort delivered up this was how the malice had started so fast he remembered its beauty in the silver light how many molts as many as it liked did no one know to run asked varleen or did it just come up too quick it came up fast sure but not that fast opined mari she frowned at dags huddle some were killed by ill luck but i expect more were killed by ignorance why were fawn began and stopped dag turned his head and raised his brows at her i was going to say why were they so ignorant she said in a lower voice but i was just as ignorant myself not long back so i guess i know why dag still wordless with the nightmare images running through his mind just shook his head and turned copperhead around they rode up from the ravine on the widest beaten path as they returned down the main street near the wharf sauns head suddenly came up i swear i hear voices dag eased his groundsense open slightly snapping it back again almost at once cringing at the searing sensation but hed caught the lifesparks over that way they rode on turning down a side street lined with bare trees and empty houses some new clapboard the older ones logsided a few had broken glass windows most still made do with oldfashioned parchment and summer netting though also split or ripped the street became a rutted lane beyond which lay a broad field its trampled grass and weeds graydun a score or so of human figures milled about on its far end along what used to be a tree line a few carts with dispirited horses hitched to them stood by they cant be back trying to farm this said saun in dismay no said dag rising in his stirrups and squinting its no crop theyre planting today theyre digging graves said mari quietly must be some refugees whove come back to try and find their kin same as at bonemarsh griff shook his head in regret dag hitched his reins into his hook for all that his left arm was still very weak to free his hand he waved the patrol forward but with a cautioning gesture brought them to a halt again at a little distance from the greenspring survivors the townsmen formed up in a ragged rank clutching shovels and mattocks in a way that reminded dag a lot of the horsefords first fearful approach to him sitting so meekly on their porch if the horsefords had suffered reason to be nervy these folks had cause to be halfcrazed or maybe alltheway crazed after an exchange of looks and low mutters a single spokesman stepped out of the pack and moved cautiously toward the patrol stopping a few prudent paces off but within reasonable hearing distance good reassurances might work better delivered in a soothing tone rather than bellowed dag touched his temple how de the man returned a short grudging nod he was middleaged careworn dressed in work clothes due for mending that hadnt been washed for weeks an almost welcome whiff of something human in this odorless place his face was so gray with fatigue as to look blighted while alive dag thought unwillingly of sorrel bluefield again you folks shouldnt be on this sick ground dag began its our ground the man returned his stare distant its been poisoned by the blight bogle itll go on poisoning you if you linger on it the man snorted i dont need some lakewalker corpseeater to tell me that dag tried a brief acknowledging nod you can bury your dead here if you like though i wouldnt advise it but you should not camp here at night leastways theres shelter still standing the townsman raised his chin and scowled and added in a tone of warning well be guarding this ground tonight in case you all were thinking of sneaking back what did the fellow imagine that dags patrol had come around to try to steal the bodies of their dead infuriated protests rose in his mind we would not do such a foul thing we have plenty of corpses of our own just now thank you all the same farmer bones are of no use to us groundripped bones are no use to us and as for groundripped farmer bones teeth tight he let nothing escape but a flat you do that perhaps uneasily realizing hed given offense the townsman did not apologize but at least slid sideways and how else will we find each other if any more come back the bogle cursed us and marched us off all over the place had he been one of the bewildered mindslaves it seemed so did no one know to run for help when the bogle first came up to spread a warning what help the man huffed again you lakewalkers on your high horses rode us down i was there his voice fell we were all mad with the bogle spells yes but they had to defend dag began and stopped the cluster of nervous townsmen had not put down their toolweapons nor dispersed back to their forlorn task he glanced aside at fawn watching in concern from atop grace and rubbed his aching forehead he said instead abruptly how about if i get down from this high horse will you step away and talk with me a pause a stare a nod dag steeled himself to dismount varleen watching closely slid down and went to copperheads bridle and saun dropped from his own mount unshipped the hickory staff that hed carted along slotted under his saddle flap and stepped to dags stirrup dags leg did not quite turn under him as he landed on it and he exchanged an almostsmile with saun as the youth carefully unhanded his arm both he thought thrown back in memory to their night attack on the bandit camp ages ago he gripped the staff and turned to the townsman who was blinking as if he was just now taking in the details of his interrogators ragged condition dag pointed to a lone dead tree blown or fallen down in the field and the townsman nodded again as dag swung the staff and limped toward it he found fawn at his left side her hand slipped around his arm not yet in support but ready if his leg folded again he wondered if he should chase her back to grace spare her what promised to be some grim details he dismissed his doubtstoo late anywayas they arrived at the thick trunk she speaks farmer with that thought dag guided fawn around to sit between them both men could see over her head better than she could see around dag andif this fellows most recent view of a lakewalker patroller had been looking up the wrong end of a spear he could likely use a spacer we both could dag breathed a little easier as the mob of townsmen went back to their digging now it was the lakewalkers turn to stand in a tight cluster holding their horses and watching dag uneasily this bogle was bad for everyone dag began again raintree lakewalkers lost folks too and homes bonemarsh camps been blighteditll have to be abandoned for the next thirty or more years i reckon this place longer the man grunted whether in agreement or disagreement was hard to tell maybe just in pain have very many people come back to find each other fawn put in the man shrugged some most of us here knew wed be coming as a burial party butsome i found my wife he added after a moment thats good then said fawn in a tone of encouragement shes buried over there the townsman added pointing to a long mound of turned earth along the tree line mass grave dag thought oh said fawn more quietly they waited for us to come back the man continued all the wives and daughters all the boys the old folks it was like there was something strange and holy happened to their bodies because they didnt rot not even in the heat its like they were waiting for us to come back and find them dag swallowed and decided this was not the moment to explain the more arcane features of deep blight im so sorry said fawn softly the man shrugged could have been worse daisy and cooper over there they found each other alive just an hour ago he nodded toward a man and one of the few women who were both sitting on the tail of a wagon staring blankly with their backs to each other fawns little hand touched the mans knee he flinched andwhy worse fawn could ask such things dag would not have dared he was glad she was here daisy shed thought coop had their youngsters with him coop he thought shed had them with her theyd had four he added after a moment were saving the children for last see in case more folks show up to look dag followed his glance to a line of stiff forms lying halfhidden in the distant weeds behind it the men were starting to dig a trench it was longer than the finished mound are the orphans being sheltered somewhere off the blight fawn asked thinking absentgodsknewwhat about someone brokering some bright arrangement to hook up the lost half families with one another if he knew her the man glanced down at her likely she looked as young to him as she did to dag for he said more gently no orphans here miss but she sucked on her lower lip obviously thinking through the implication weve found none alive here under twelve nor many over dag said quietly as she looked up at him as if he could somehow fix this next to pregnant women children have the richest grounds for a malice building up to a molt it goes for them first preferentially when bonemarsh was evacuated the young women would have grabbed up all the youngsters and run at once the others following as they could with what animals and supplies they could get at fast with the offduty patrollers as rear guard the children would have been got out in the first quarter hour and the whole camp in as little more they did lose folks beyond the range of warningsome of those makers we freed from the groundlock had stayed to try and reach a party of youngsters whod gone out gathering that day fawn frowned i hadnt heard that part of the tale did they find them in time dag sighed no some of the bonemarsh folk who came back later recovered the bodies finally for a burial not so different than this he nodded toward the mounds the townsman listening stared down and dug his boot heel into the dry soil brows pinching in wonder yes thought dag witness her farmers can ask and be answered wont you try us did they take their fawn shut up abruptly remembering not to ask about knifebones in front of farmers dag guessed she just shook her head the townsman gave dag a sidelong look youre not from bonemarsh are you no my company rode over from oleana to help out were on our way home now dags patrol killed your blight bogle fawn put in a little proudly when the malicesbogles curse lifted from your mind that was when huh said the man and then after a bleak silence could have been sooner stung to brusqueness dag said if any of you had owned the wits to run and give warning at the first it could have been a lot sooner we did all we could with what we had as soon as we knew a stubborn silence stretched between them there was too much grief and strain here thick as mire for argument or apology today dag had pretty much pieced together the picture hed come for it was maybe time to go a trio of townsmen came out of the barren woods back from some errand therepissing searching and stopped to gape at the newcomers one grizzled head came up sharply staring the man began to walk toward the fallen tree faster and faster his stride turned into a jog then a run his face grew wild and he waved frantically crying sassy sassy dag stiffened his hand drifting to his knife haft the townsman beside fawn straightened up with a moan and held out his palm in a gesture of negation shaking his head the runner slowed as he neared gasping for breath rubbing his redrimmed eyes and peering at fawn in a voice gone gray he said you arent my sassy no sir said fawn looking up apologetically im dags fawn he continued to peer are you one of ours did those patrollers bring you back he waved toward the lakewalkers still standing warily with their horses we can try and find your folks no sir im from oleana why are you with them im married to one taken aback the man turned his head to squint his gaze narrowed on saun who was standing holding copperheads reins watching them alertly the mans mouth turned down in a scowl if thats what that boy told you missie im afraid he was lying hes not she broke off as dag covered and squeezed her hand in warning the grizzled man took a breath if you want to stay here missie we could find you find you he trailed off looking around dolefully shelter muttered his comrade not hardly he stood up and squeezed his friends shoulder give it over shes not our business not today with a disappointed glance over his shoulder the grizzled man dragged off i hope he finds his sassy said fawn who wasis she his daughter granddaughter replied the townsman ah we need to get off this blight fawn said dag wondering if had it been some other day the townsmen would have made fawn their business disquieting thought but the dangerous moment if that had been one was past oh of course she jumped up at once youve got to be feeling it hows your leg doing itll be well enough once im in the saddle again he grounded the butt of the hickory stick and levered himself up he was starting to ache all over like a fever the townsman trailed along after them as dag hobbled back to his horse it took saun and varleen both to heave dag aboard copperhead this time he settled with a sigh and even let saun find his left stirrup for him and take away his stick varleen gave fawn a neat boost up on grace and fawn smiled thanks you ready dag saun asked patting the leg as ill ever be dag responded as saun went around to his horse the townsmans eyebrows rose youre her dag surprise and deep disapproval edged his voice yes said dag they stared mutely at each other dag started to add next time dont but then broke off this was not the hour the place or the man so when where and who will be the townsmans lips tightened i doubt you and i have anything much to say to each other patroller likely not dag raised his hand to his temple and clucked to urge copperhead forward fawn wheeled grace around dag was afraid shed caught the darker undercurrents after all because the struggle was plain in her face between respect for bereavement and a goaded anger she leaned down and growled at the townsman you might try thank you somebody should say it at least once before the end of the world disconcerted the townsman dropped his eyes before her hot frown then looked after her with an unsettled expression on his face as they left the blighted town and struck east up a wagon road alongside the river mari asked dryly satisfied with your looksee dag he grunted in response her voice softened you cant fix everything in the whole wide green world by yourself you know evidently not and after a moment more quietly maybe no one can fawn eyed him with worry as he slumped in his saddle but he did not suggest stopping he wanted a lot more miles between him and what lay behind him greenspring should it be renamed deadspring on the charts now mari had been right hed had no need for a new crop of nightmares let alone to have gone looking for them he was justly served even fawn had grown quiet no answers no questions just silence he rode in it as they turned north across the river looking for the road home s ome six days after striking the north road the little patrol clopped across the increasingly familiar wooden span to two bridge island fawn turned in her saddle watching dag his head came up but unlike everyone else he didnt break into whoops and his lopsided smile at their cheers somehow just made him look wearier than ever mari had decreed easy stages on the ride home to spare their mounts though everyone knew it had been to spare dag that mari fretted for him troubled fawn almost more than this strange undaglike fatigue that gripped him so hard the last day or two the easy part had silently dropped out as the patrol pressed on more like horses headed for the barn than the horses themselves they paused at the split in the island road and mari gave a farewell wave to saun griff and varleen she jerked her head at dag ill be taking this one straight home i think right said saun need a helper razi and utau should be there and cattagus her austere face softened in an inward look then she added yep fawn wondered if shed just bumped grounds with her husband to alert him to her homecoming dag roused himself i should see fairbolt first fairbolts heard all about it by now from hoharie and the rest said mari sternly i should see cattagus saun glanced at his two impatient comrades both with families waiting and said ill stop in and see fairbolt on my way down island let him know were back and all dag squinted thatd do i guess consider it done go rest dag you look awful thankee saun said dag the slight dryness in his voice suggesting it was for the latter and not the former statement though it covered both saun grinned back and the younger patrollers departed at a trot that became a lope before the first curve dag mari and fawn took the shore branch and while no one suggested a trot mari did kick her horse into a brisker walk she was standing up in her stirrups peering ahead by the time they turned into her campsite everyone had come out into the clearing razi and utau held a child each and sarri waved cattagus waved and wheezed striding forward in addition there was a mob of new facesa tall middleaged woman and a fellow who had to be her spouse and a stairstep rank of six gangling children ranging from fawns age downward to a leaping little girl of eight the woman was maris eldest daughter obviously back from the other side of the lake with her family and her new boat they all surged for mari although they stepped aside to give cattagus first crack as she slid from her saddle bout time you got back old woman he breathed into her hair and youre still here good saves thumpin you she muttered sternly into his ear as they folded each other in razi dumped his wriggling son off on sarri who cocked her hip to receive him utau let tesy loose with admonishments about keeping clear of copperhead and the pair of men came to help dag and fawn dismount utau looked tired but hale enough fawn thought maris soninlaw and razi had all three horses unsaddled and bags off in a blink and the two volunteered to lead the mounts back to mare island preferably before the snorting copperhead bit or kicked some bouncing child tent bluefield was still standing foursquare under the apple tree and sarri smiling rolled up and tied the tent flaps everything inside looked very neat and tidy and welcoming and fawn had utau drop their grubby saddlebags under the outside awning there would be serious laundry she decided before their travelstained and reeking garments were allowed to consort again with their stayathome kin dag eyed their bedroll atop its thick cushion of dried grass rather as a starving dog would contemplate a steak muttered boots off leastways and dropped to a seat on an upended log to tug at his laces he looked up to add any problems while we were away well said sarri sounding a trifle reluctant there was that goround with the girls from stores they tried to steal your tent the little said utau abruptly indignant sarri shushed him in a way that made fawn think this was an exchange muchrepeated what said dag squinting in bewilderment not stealing exactly said sarri yes it was muttered utau blighted sneakery they told me theyd been ordered to bring it back to stores sarri went on overriding him they had it halfway down when i caught them they wouldnt listen to me but cattagus came out and wheezed at them and frightened them off razi and i were out collecting elderberries for cattagus said utau or id have been willing to frighten them off myself the nerve to make away with a patrollers tent while he was out on patrol fawn frowned imagining the startlingshockingeffect it would have had with her and dag both so travelweary to come back and find everything gone dag looked as though he was imagining this too uncle cattagus puffing in outrage was likely more effective sarri allowed he turns this alarming purple color and chokes and you think hes going to collapse onto your feet the girls were impressed anyway and left off ran cattagus tells it said utau brightening when razi and utau came back they put your tent up again and then went down and had some words with the folks in stores they claimed it was all a misunderstanding utau snorted in a pigs eye it was it was some crony of cumbias down there with a notion for petty aggravation anyway i spoke to fairbolt who spoke with massape who spoke with someone and it didnt happen again he nodded firmly dag rubbed the back of his neck looking pinchbrowed and abstracted if hed had more energy fawn thought he might have been as angry as utau but just now it merely came out saddened i see was all he said thank you he nodded up to sarri as well fawn not to tell you your job but i think you need to get your husband horizontal said sarri im for it said fawn together she and utau pulled dag upright and aimed him into the tent utau releasing dags arm from over his shoulder as he sank down onto his bedroll grunted dag i swear youre worse off than when i left you in raintree that groundlock do this to you your leg hasnt turned bad has it from what hoharie said id thought shed patched you up better n this before she left you he was better said fawn but then we went and visited greenspring on the way home it was all really deepblighted i think it gave him a relapse of some sort except she wasnt so sure it was the blight that had drained him of the ease hed gained after their triumph over the groundlock she remembered the look on his face or rather the absence of any look on his face when theyd ridden out of the townsmens burying field past the line of small uncorrupted corpses hed counted them that was a fool thing to do for a groundripped man to go and expose yourself to more blight utau scolded you should know better dag yeah sighed dag dutifully lying flat well were all home now sarri and utau took themselves out with an offer of dinner later which fawn gratefully accepted she fussed briefly over dag kissed him on the forehead and left him not so much dozing as glazed while she went to deal with unpacking their gear she glanced up at the lately contested awning of little tent bluefield as she began sorting home again was it fawn brought dag breakfast in bed the next morning so it was only plunkin tea and concern the concern at least he thought delicious though he had no appetite he let her coax him into eating and then bustle about getting him propped up comfortably with a nice view out the tent flap at the lakeshore as the sun climbed he could watch her down on the dock scrubbing their clothes from time to time she waved up at him and he waved back in due course she shouldered the wet load and climbed up out of sight somewhere likely to hang it all out to dry he was still staring out in benign lassitude when a brisk hand slapped the tent side and hoharie ducked in there you are saun told me youd made it back she greeted him ah hoharie yeah yesterday afternoon i also heard you werent doing so well ive been worse hoharie was back in her summer shift out of riding gear indeed shed made a questionablelooking patroller she settled down on her knees and folded her legs under herself looking dag over critically hows the leg after all that abuse still healing slowly no sign of infection thats a blessing in a deep puncture although after all that ground reinforcement i wouldnt expect infection and the arm he shifted it still very weak he hadnt even bothered with his arm harness yet this morning though fawn had cajoled him into clean trousers and shirt no worse should be better by now come on open up dag sighed and eased open his ground it no longer gave him sensations akin to pain to do so the discomfort was more subtle now diffuse and lingering horarie frowned what did you do with all that ground reinforcement you took on last week over in raintree its barely there it helped but we crossed some more blight on the way back not smart her eyes narrowed whats your groundsense range right now good question i havent he spread his senses he hardly needed groundsense to detect maris noisy grandchildren shouting all over the campsite the halfclosed adults were subtler smudges fawn was a bright spark in the walnut grove a hundred paces off beyond thatnothing very limited shockingly so havent been this weak since i lost my real hand well if you want an answer to how am i recovering theres your test no patrolling for you for a while captain not till your range is back to its usual dag waved this away im not arguin that tells a tale right there hoharies fingers touched his thigh his arm his side he could feel her keen regard as a passing pressure through his aches after my story and sauns fairbolt reckoned hed be putting your peg back in the sick box he wanted me to tell him for how long so how long longer than utau anyway fairbolt wont be happy about that well weve talked about that about you you did rather more in that bonemarsh groundlock than just take hurt you know something in her tone brought him up if not to full alertness which eluded him still then to less vague attention he let his ground ease closed again hoharie sat back on the woven mat beside the bedroll and wrapped her arms around her knees regarding him coolly youve been patrolling for a long time she observed upwards of forty years so cattagus walked for almost seventy my grandfather longer than that its a life ever think of another something more settled not lately or at least not until this summer he wasnt about to try to describe how confused hed become about his life since glassforge anyone ever suggest medicine maker yes you but you werent thinking it through i remember you complained about being too old to be an apprentice may i point out yours could be about the shortest apprenticeship on record you already know all the herblore from decades of patrol gathering you know field aid on the practical sidepossibly even more than i do your groundmatching skills are astonishing as saun has lived to testify to anyone who will listen saun you may have noticed is a bit of an enthusiast i wouldnt take him too seriously hoharie she shook her head i saw you do things with ground projection and manipulation inside that groundlock that i can still barely wrap my mind around i examined artin after it was all over you not only could do it you could be good dag a lot of people can patrol not near as many can do this level of making fewer still such direct groundwork i knowi scout for apprentices every year be reasonable hoharie groundsense or no a medicine maker needs two clever hands for well all sorts of tasks you wouldnt want me sewing up your torn trousers let alone your torn skin and the list goes on indeed it does she smiled and leaned forward butpatrollers work in partnered pairs all the time youre used to it and i get from time to time a youngster mad for medicinemaking and with clever hands but a bit lacking on the groundsense side you get along well with youngsters even if you do scare them at first im thinkingwhat about pairing you up with someone like that dag blinked then blinked again spark she had the cleverest hands of anyone hed ever met and absent gods knew the wits and nerve for the task his imagination and heart were both suddenly racing tossing up pictures of the possibilities they could work together right here at hickory lake or at bearsford camp honorable necessary respected work to win her a place here in her own right he could be by her side every day and every night and once she was trained they might do morewould fawn like the notion he would ask her at once he grinned at hoharie and she brightened i see you get the idea she said in a tone of satisfaction im so glad as you might guess i have someone in mind yes oh did othan talk to you beg pardon its his younger brother osho hes not quite ready for it yet mind but neither are you but if i knew hed be pairing with you i could admit him to training pretty soon wait what no i was thinking of fawn it was hoharies turn to rock back blinking but dageven if shes stillshe has no groundsense at all a farmer cant be a medicine maker or any kind of a maker farmers are in their own way all the time midwives bonesetters certainly but they cant use our ways im sure their skills are valuable and of course better than nothing but they just cant id do that part you said dagthe sick and the hurt are vulnerable and touchy im afraid a lot of folks wouldnt trust or accept her it would be one strange thing too many theres also the problem of her ground i like fawn but having her ground always open around delicate groundwork maybe distracting or interferingno it wouldnt distract me he thought of arguing he settled his shoulders back on his cushion his little burst of excitement draining away again leaving his fatigue feeling worse by contrast instead he asked more slowly so why dont we do more for farmers no i dont mean the strong makers like you youre rare and needed here but all of us the patrols are out there all the time we know and use a dozen little tricks amongst ourselves that we could find ways to share more than just selling plants and preparations we could build up goodwill over time he remembered aunt natties tale of her twisted ankle just such a good deed had borne some fair fruit even decades afterwards oh dag hoharie shook her head do you think no ones tried it tempted through pity or even friendship it sounds so fine but it only works as long as nothing goes wrong as it inevitably must that goodwill can turn to bad will in a heartbeat lakewalkers who let themselves get in over their heads trying to share such help have been beaten to death or worse if it were his voice faltered he didnt have a counterargument for this one as it was perfectly true there has to be a better way was easy to say it was a lot harder to picture exactly how returning to her subject hoharie said fairbolt doesnt much want to give you up but he would for this he can see a lot of the same things i do hes watched you for a long time i owe fairboltdag lifted his left armeverything pretty much my arm harness was his doing hed spotted something like it in tripoint see a farmer artificer and a farmer bonesetter over there had got together to fix things like it for some folks whod lost limbs in mining and forge accidents neither of them had a speck of groundsense but they had ideas hoharie began to speak but then turned her head in a moment fawn popped around the tents open side looking equally pleased and anxious hoharie im so glad youre here how is he doing mari was worried as if fawn didnt expect her own worry to count with the medicine maker and is she so wrong in that hoharie smiled reassuringly he mostly needs time and rest and not to do fool things dag said plaintively not to mention horizontally how can i do fool things when i cant do anything hoharie gave his query the quelling eyebrow twitch it deserved and went on to give fawn a set of sensible instructions and suggestions which added up to food sleep and mild camp chores when ready fawn listened earnestly nodding dag was sure shed remember every word and be able to quote them back at him likely hoharie rose ill send othan down in a couple of days to pull those stitches out i can do that myself said dag well dont she returned she glanced down at him think about what i said dag if your feetor your heartache too much to walk another mile you could do a world of good right here i will he said unsettled hoharie waved and took herself out frowning fawn flopped down on her knees beside him and ran a small hand over his brow your eyebrows are all scrunched up are you in pain she smoothed away the furrows no he caught the hand and kissed it just tired i guess he hesitated thinkin is that the sort of thinkin where you sit like a bump for hours and then jump sideways like a frog he smiled despite himself do i do that you do well im not jumping anywhere today good she rewarded this resolve with a kiss and then several more it unlocked muscles in him that he hadnt known were taut one muscle at least remained limp which would have disturbed him a lot more if he hadnt been through such convalescences before must rest faster dag spent the next three days mired in much the same glazed lassitude he was driven from his bedroll at last not by a return of energy but by a buildup of boredom out and about he found unexpectedly intense competition for the sittingdown camp chores among the ailingutau cattagus and himself he watched cattagus moving at about the same rate he did and wondered if this was what it was going to feel like to be old there being no hides to scrape at the moment and utau and razi having shrewdly been first in line to help cattagus with his elderberries dag defaulted to nutcracking he had after all a builtin tool for it he was awkward at first with the fiddly aspects but grew less so fawn who plainly thought the task the most tedious in the world wrinkled her nose but it exactly suited dags mood not requiring any thought beyond a vague philosophical contemplation of the subtle shapes of nuts and their shells walnuts and hickory shells over and over very reliably they might resist him but only rarely did they counterattack the hickory being the more innately vicious fawn kept him company first spinning then working on two pairs of new riding trousers one for him and one for her made of cloth shared by sarri sitting with him in the shade of their awning one afternoon she remarked id make you more arrows but everyones quivers are full up dag poked at a particularly intractable nutshell do you like making arrows better than making trousers she shrugged it just feels more important patrollers need arrows he sat back and contemplated this and we dont need trousers i think you have that the wrong way round spark its poison ivy country out there you know not to mention the nettles thistles burrs thorns and bitey bugs she pursed her lips as she poked her needle slowly through the sturdy cloth for going into a fight though when it counts i still dont agree id want my trousers in fact if i were waked up out of my bedroll in a night attack i think id go for them before my boots or my bow but patrollers sleep in their trousers in camp she objected although not in hotels she allowed in a tone of pleasurable reminiscence that gives you a measure of importance then doesnt it he batted his eyes at her i can just picture it a whole patrol riding out armed to the teeth all bareassed do you have any idea what the jouncing in those saddles would do to all our tender bits wed never make it to the malice agh now im picturing it she bent over laughing stop ill allow you the trousers and ill thank you with all my heart he assured her and with my tender bits which made her dissolve into giggles again he could not remember when shed last laughed like this which sobered him but he still smiled as he watched her take up her sewing once more he decided he would very much like to thank her with his tender bits if only they would get around to reporting for duty again he sighed and took aim at another hickory shell fortunately or unfortunately while he was still recuperating fawns monthly came ona bad one it seemed alarmingly bloody dag concerned dragged mari over to tent bluefield for a consultation she was reassuringly unimpressed and rattled off a gruesome string of what dag decided were the female equivalent of oldpatroller stories about much worse things she had seen i dont recall the young women on patrol having this much trouble he said nervously hovering mari eyed him thats because girls with these sorts of troubles generlly dont choose to become patrollers oh makes sense i guess softening mari allowed as how fawn was likely still healing up inside which from the state of the scars on her neck dag guessed to be exactly the case and that the problems should improve over the next months and even unbent enough to give fawn a tiny ground reinforcement in the afflicted area dag thought back to his toofew years with kauneo how a married mans life got all wound about in these intimate rhythms and how they had sometimes annoyed himtill hed been left to wish for them back he dealt serenely wrapping hot stones and coaxing some of cattaguss best elderberry wine out of him and into fawn and her pains eased at last one bright quiet morning dag hauled his trunk out under the canopy for a writing desk and took on the task of his letter to luthlia at first he thought he would keep it painlessly short a sentence or two simply locating each bones malice kill he was so much in the habit of concealing the complications of the unintended priming it seemed so impossible to set it out clearly and the tale of fawn and her lost babe seemed too inward a hurt to put before strangers eyes silence was easier and yetsilence would seem to deny that a farmer girl had ever had any place in all this he weighed the smooth shards of kauneos bone in his hand one last time before wrapping them up in a square of good cloth that fawn had hemmed and changed his mind instead he wrote out as complete an account of the chain of events focusing on the knives as he could manage most especially not leaving out his belief of how the babes ground had found refuge from the malice it was still so compressed he wasnt sure but what it sounded incoherent or insane but it was all the truth as he knew it when he was done he let fawn read it before he sealed it with some of sarris beeswax her face grew solemn she handed it back with a brief nod thatll do for my part she helped him wrap up the packet carefully with an outer cover of deer leather secured by rawhide strings for protection and he addressed it to kauneos kin ready for razi to take up to the courier at patroller headquarters he fingered the finished bundle and said slowly so many memoriesif souls exist maybe they lie in the track of time we leave behind us and not out ahead and thats why we cant find them not even with groundsense were lookin in the wrong direction fawn smiled wryly into his eyes leaned up and kissed him soft or maybe theyre right here she said fairbolt turned up the next day dag had been halfexpecting him they found seats on a pair of stumps out in the walnut grove out of earshot from the busy campsite razi says youre feeling better fairbolt remarked looking dag over keenly my bodys moving again anyway dag allowed my groundsense range still isnt doing too well i dont think hoharies notion that it has to come all the way back before i patrol again is right though halfway would be good as most its not about you going back on patrol for which judgment ill be relying on hoharie and not you thanks its about your camp council summons ive been holding em off on the word that youre still too injured and ill after raintree which is harder to make stick when its seen you are up and about so you can expect it as soon as that heron island dredging fracas is sorted out dag hissed through his teeth after raintreeafter all fawn and i didtheyre still after a camp council ruling against us hoharie and i and bryn and mallora and ornig would all be dead and buried right now in blighted bonemarsh if not for fawn not to mention five good makers lost this on top of the glassforge malicewhat more could they possibly want from a farmer girl to prove herself worthy his outrage was chilled by a ripple of cold reflectionin forty years he had never been able to prove himself worthy in certain eyes hed concluded sometime back that the problem was not in him it was in those eyes and no doing of his could ever fix it why should any doing of fawns be different fairbolt scratched his ear yeah i didnt figure that news would sit too well with you he hesitated i owe an apology to fawn for trying to stop her here when you were calling her from out of that groundlock it seems right cruel in hindsight i had no idea it was you behind her restiness that day dags brows drew down you been talking to othan about the bonemarsh groundlock ive been talking to everyone who was there as i had the chance trying to piece it all together well just for the scribe it wasnt me who told fawn to put that knife in my leg like like some malice riding a farmer slave she figured it out by her own wits fairbolt held up both palms in a gesture of surrender be that as it may how are you planning to handle this council challenge ive discouraged and delayed it about as much as i can without being bounced off your hearing myself for conflict of interest and since i dont mean to let myself get excluded from this one the next move has to fall on you which is where it belongs anyway i might point out dag bent venting a weary sigh i dont know fairbolt my minds been working pretty slow since i got back it feels like a bug stuck in honey truth to tell fairbolt frowned curiously an effect of that peculiar blight you took on do you think idont know its an effect of something accumulation maybe he could feel it building up in him but he could not put a name to it it wouldnt hurt for you to tell more of your tale around you know said fairbolt i dont think everyone rightly understands how much would be lost to this camp and to oleana if you were banished what brag and boast dag made a face i should be let to keep fawn because im special if youre not willing to say it to your friends how are you going to stand up in council and say it to your enemies not my style and an insult to boot to everyone who walks their miles all the same without fanfare or thanks now if you want me to argue that i should be let to keep fawn because shes special im for it mm said fairbolt if he was picturing this the vision didnt seem to bring him much joy dag looked down rubbing his sandal in the dirt there is this if the continued existence of hickory lake campor oleanaor the wide green worlddepends on just one man weve already lost this long war yet every malice kill comes at the end down to one mans hand fairbolt said watching him not true theres a world balanced on that knifeedge the hand of the patroller yes but held in it the bones donor and the hearts donor and the hand and eye and ground of the knife maker and all the patrol backing up behind who got the patroller to that place patrollers we hunt in packs then all the camp and kin behind them who gave them the horses and the gear and the food to get there and on and on not one man fairbolt one man or another yes fairbolt gave a slow conceding nod he added after a moment has anyone said thank you for raintree company captain not as i recollect dag said dryly then was a little sorry for the tone when he caught fairbolts wince he added more wistfully though i do hope dirla got her bowdown yes they had a great party for her over on beaver sigh i heard from the survivors dags smile tweaked good fairbolt stretched his back which creaked faintly in the cool silence of the shade between the dark tree boles the lake surface glittered in a passing breeze i like fawn yeti cant help imagining how much simpler all our lives could be right now if you were to take that nice farmer girl back to her family down in west blue and tell them to keep the bridegifts and her pretty insulting fairbolt dag observed he didnt say who to it would take a list he decided you could say youd made a mistake but i didnt fairbolt grimaced i didnt think that notion would take had to try though dags nod of understanding was reserved fairbolt spoke as if this was all about fawn and indeed it had all begun with her dag wasnt so sure his farmer bride was all it was about now the all part seemed to have grown much larger and more complex for one since raintree since west blue since glassforge or even before that piling up unnoticed fairbolt mm this was a bad year for the patrol did we have more emergences all told or just worse ones fairbolt counted silently on his fingers then his eyebrows went up actually fewer than last year or the year before but glassforge and raintree were so much worse they put us behind which makes it seem like more both bad outbreaks were in farmer country yes there is more farmer country now more cleared land and its spreading were bound to see more emergences like those and not just in oleana youre from tripoint fairbolt you know more about farmer artificers than anyone around here the ones i watched this summer in glassforge theyre more of that sortdag raised his arm in its harnessdoing more things more cleverly better and better youve heard all about what happened at greenspring what if it had been a big town like tripoint the way glassforge is growing to be fairbolt went still listening listening hard dag thought but what he was thinking didnt show in his face dag pushed on malice takes a town like that it doesnt just get slaves and ripped grounds it gets knowhow tools weapons boats forges and mills already builtpower as sure as any stolen groundsense and the more such towns farmers build and they will the more that ill chance becomes a certainty fairbolts grim headshake did not deny this we cant push farmers back south to safety by force we havent got it to spare then theyre here to stay eh im not suggesting force but what if we had their help that power instead of feeding it to the malices we cannot let ourselves depend we must not become lords again that was our fathers sin that nearslew the world isnt there any other way for lakewalkers and farmers to be with each other than as lords and servants malices and slaves yes live apart thus we avert lordship fairbolt made a slicing gesture dag fell silent his throat thick so said fairbolt at length what is your plan for dealing with the camp council dag shook his head fairbolt sat back in some exasperation then continued its like this when i see a good tacticianand i know you are onesit and wait instead of moving as his enemy advances on him i figure there could be two possible reasons either he doesnt know what to door his enemy is coming into his hand exactly the way he wants ive known you for a good long timeand looking at you right now i still dont know which it is youre doing dag looked away maybe i dont either after another silence fairbolt sighed and rose reasonable enough ive done what i can take care of yourself dag see you at council i suppose likely dag touched his temple and watched fairbolt trudge wearily away through the walnut grove the next day dawned clear promising the best kind of dry heat the lake was glassy dag lay up under the awning of tent bluefield and watched fawn finish weaving hats the result of her finding a batch of reeds of a texture shed declared comparable to more farmerly straw she took her scissors and tongue caught fetchingly between her teeth carefully trimmed the fringe of reeds sticking out around the brim to an even finger length there she said holding it up thats yours he glanced at its mate lying beside her why isnt it braided up all neat around the rim like the other silly thats a girls hat this is a boys hat sos you can tell the difference not to question your people but thats not how i tell the difference between boys and girls this won a giggle as hed hoped it just is for straw hats all right so now i can go out in the sun without my nose coming all over freckles i think your nose looks cute with freckles or without well i dont she gave a decisive nod he leaned back his eyes halfclosing his bonedeep exhaustion was creeping up on him again maybe hoharie had been right about that appalling recovery time after all thats it fawn jumped to her feet he opened his eyes to find her frowning down at him were going on a picnic she declared roundly what just you wait and see no dont get up its a surprise so dont look he watched anyway as she bustled about putting a great deal of food and two stone jugs into a basket bundled up a couple of blankets then vanished around behind cattagus and maris tent to emerge toting a paddle for the narrow boat bemused he found himself herded down to the dock and instructed to get in and have a nice liedown padded and propped in the bottom of the boat facing her you know how to steer this craft he inquired mildly settling er she hesitated it looked pretty easy when you did it and then after a moment youll tell me wont you its a deal spark the lesson took maybe ten minutes once theyd pushed off from the dock their somewhatwandering path evened out as she settled into her stroke and then all he had to do was coax her to slow down and find the rhythm that would last she found her way to that too he pushed back his boys hat and smiled from under the fringe at her her face was made luminous even beneath the shadow of her own neat brim by the light reflecting off the water all framed against the deep blue sky he felt amazingly content not to move if your folks could see us now he remarked they really would believe all those tales about the idleness of lakewalker men hed almost forgotten the blinding charm of her dimple when she smirked she kept paddling they rounded walnut island pausing for a glimpse of some of the stallions prancing elegantly in pasture then glided up through the elderberry channels several boats were out gathering there today dag and fawn mainly received startled stares in return for their waves except from razi and utau working again on cattaguss behalf and indirectly their own cattagus fermented his wines in large stone crocks buried in the cool soil of the islands woods which he had inherited from another man before him and him from another dag had no idea how far back the tradition went but he bet it matched plunkins they stopped to chat briefly with the pair a certain hilarity about dags hat only made him pull it on more firmly and fawn paddle onward tossing her head but still dimpling at length to no surprise but a deal of pleasure on dags part they slipped into the clear sheltered waters of the lily marsh he then had the amusement carefully concealed under his useful hat fringe of watching fawn paddle around realizing that her planning had missed an element namely where to spread blankets when all the thick grassy hillocks like tiny private islands turned out to be growing from at least two inches of standing water he listened to as much of her foiled muttering as he thought he would get away with then surrendered to his better self and pointed out how they might have a nice picnic on board the boat wedged for stability up into a willowshaded wrack of old logs fawn took aim and with only a slightly alarming scraping noise brought them upright into this makeshift dock she sat in the bottom of the boat facing him their legs interlaced and shared food and wine till shed succeeded in fulfilling several of hoharies recommendations at once by driving him into a dozy nap he woke at length more overheated than even farmer hats and the flickering yellowgreen willow shade could contend with and hoisted himself up to strip off his shirt and arm harness fawn opened one eye from her own replete slump then sat up in some alarm as he lifted his hips to slip off his trousers i dont think we can do that in a narrow boat actually you can he assured her absently but im not attempting it now im going into the water to cool off arent you supposed to get cramps if you swim too soon after a heavy meal im not going swimming im going floating i may not move any muscles at all he selected a dry log about three feet long from the top of the wrack wriggled it loose and slipped into the water after it the surface of the water was as warm as a bath but his legs found the chill they sought farther down flowing over his skin like silk he hung his arms over his makeshift float propped his chin in the middle kicked up some billowing coolness and relaxed utterly in a little while to hisalas still purely aestheticpleasure fawn yanked her shift over her flushed face unwedged a log of her own and splashed in after him he floated on blissfully while she ottered around him with more youthful vigor daring to wet her hair then her face then duck under altogether hey she said in a tone of discovery partway through this proceeding i cant sink now you know he crooned she splashed him got no rise then eventually settled down beside him he opened his eyes just far enough to enjoy the sight of her pale bare body seemingly made liquid by the waterwaver caressed by the long fringed water weeds as she idly kicked and turned he looked down meditatively at the yellow willow leaves floating past his nose harbinger of more soon to come the light is changing and the sounds in the air i always notice it when the summer passes its peak and starts down and the cicadas come on makes menot sad exactly there should be a word as though time was sliding away and not even his ghost hand could catch it noisy things cicadas fawn murmured chinned on her own log i heard em just starting up when i was riding to raintree they were both quiet for a very long time listening to the chaining counterpoint of bug songs the brown wedge of a muskrats head trailed a widening vee across the limpid water then vanished with a plop as the shy animal sensed their regard the blue heron floated in but then just stood folded as though sleeping on one leg the greenheaded ducks drowsing in the shade across the marsh didnt move either the clear light lay breathing like a live thing this place is like the opposite of blight murmured fawn after a while thick denseif you opened up would its ground just flow in and replenish you i opened up two hours ago and yes i think it may he sighed that explains something about places like this then she muttered in satisfaction a much longer time later they regretfully pulled their wrinkled selves up onto the wrack and back into the boat dressed and pushed back to start for home the sun was sliding behind the western trees as they crossed the wide part of the lake and had turned into an orange glint by the time they climbed the bank to tent bluefield dag slept that night better than he had for weeks f awn woke late the next morning she judged by the bright lines of light leaking around the edges of their easterly tent flaps the air inside was still cool from the night but would grow hot and stuffy soon wrapped around her dag sighed and stirred then hugged her in tighter something firm nudged the back of her thigh and she realized with a slow smirk that it wasnt his hand i thought that picnic would be good for him he made a purring noise into her hair indicating the same satisfying realization and she wriggled around to turn her face to his his eyes gleamed from under his halfclosed eyelids and she sank into his sleepy smile as if it were a pillow he kissed her temple and lips and bent his head to nuzzle her neck she let her hand begin to roam and stroke giving and taking free pleasure from his warm skin for the first time since hed been called out to raintree he pulled her closer still seeming to revel in her softness pressing tight to him skin to skin for the length of her body this needed no words now no instruction no questions a hand slapped loudly three times against the leather of the tent flap and a raspy female voice called dag redwing hickory dags body stiffened and he swore under his breath he held fawns face close to his chest as if to muffle her and didnt answer the slaps were repeated dag redwing hickory come on i know youre in there a frustrated hiss leaked between his teeth all his stiffening alas slackened no one in here by that name he called back gruffly the voice outside grew exasperated dag dont fool with me im not in the mood i dislike this as much as you do i daresay not possible he muttered but sighed and sat up he ran his hand through his sleepbent hair rolled over and groped for his short trousers what is it fawn asked apprehensively dowie grayheron shes the alternate for two bridge island on camp council this season is it the summons likely fawn scrambled into her shift and trailed after dag as he shoved through their tent flap and stood squinting in the bright sun an older woman with streaked hair like ombas braided up around her head stood drumming her fingers on her thigh she eyed dags bedrumpled look in bemusement fawn more curiously the camp council hearing for you is at noon she announced dag started today short notice i came around twice yesterday but you were out and i know fairbolt warned you so dont pretend this is a surprise here let me get through this she spread her legs a trifle pulled back her shoulders and recited dag redwing hickory i summon you to hear and speak to grave complaints brought before the hickory lake camp summer council by dar redwing hickory on behalf of tent redwing noon today in council grove do you hear and understand yes dag growled thank you she said thats done but im not dag redwing dag put in that fellow no longer exists save it for the grove thats where the argumentation belongs she hesitated glancing briefly at fawn and back to dag i will point out youve been summoned but your childbride has not theres no place for a farmer in our councils dags jaw set is she explicitly excluded because if she has been we have a sticking point before we start no dowie admitted reluctantly but take it from me she wont help your cause dag anyone who believed before that youve let your crotch do your thinking wont be persuaded otherwise by seeing her thank you said dag in a voice of honeyed acid i think my wife is pretty too dowie just shook her head im going to be so glad when this day is over her sandals slapped against her heels as she turned and strode off theres a woman sure knows how to blight a mood dag murmured his jaw unclenching fawn crept to dags side his arm went around her shoulders she swallowed and asked is she any relation to obio grayheron hed be her cousin by marriage shes head of tent grayheron on this island and she has a vote on the council thatsnot too encouraging actually shes one i count as friendly i patrolled for a year or so with her back when i was a young man before i left to exchange and she quit to start her family if that was friendly fawn wondered what hostile was going to be like well shed soon find out was this all as sudden as it seemed maybe not the camp council question had been a silence in the center of things that dag had been skirting since theyd returned from raintree and shed let him lead her in that circuit true hed plainly been too ill to be troubled with it those first few days but after he doesnt know what he wants to do she realized cold knotting in her belly even now he does not know because what he wanted was impossible and always had been and so was the alternative what was a man supposed to do then they dressed washed up ate dag did not return to cracking nuts nor fawn to spinning he did get up and walk restlessly around the campsite or into the walnut grove wherever he might temporarily avoid the other residents moving about their own early chores when the dock cleared out from the morning swimmers he went down and sat on it for a time knees bent under his chin staring down into the water fawn wondered if he was playing at that old childs amusement hed showed her of persuading the inedible little sunfish that clustered in the docks shade to rise up and swim about in simple patterns the sun crept as the shadows narrowed dag came up under their awning and sat beside her on his log seat he propped his right elbow on his knee neck bent staring down at his sandals at length he looked up toward the lake face far awayfawn couldnt tell if he was trying to memorize the view or not seeing it at all she thought of their visits to the lily marsh this place nourishes him would he starve in his spirit exiled a man might die without a mark on him from having his ground ripped in half she took a breath sat straight began beloved his face turned sideways to her in a fleeting smile he looked tired what are you going to do i dont know he seemed for an instant if he wanted to amend that bluntness in some reassuring fashion but then just let it stand she angled her face away i wasnt going to tell you this story but now i think i will when you were first gone to raintree i knitted up another pair of socks like those youd been so pleased with and took them to your mother for a present a peace offering like didnt work it wasnt a guess nor a chiding more of a commiseration fawn nodded she saidwell we said several things to each other that dont matter now but one thing she said sticks she said once a patroller sees a malice he or she doesnt ever put another thingor personahead of patrolling i do wonder sometimes how she was betrayed and who the patroller was my father i suspect did sound like fawn conceded but not with another woman i dont guess me either something aunt mari once let slipdar and i once may have had a sister who died as an infant in some tragic way he says he doesnt remember any such thing so she would have had to be either before or within a few years after he was born if so she was buried in a deep deep silence because father never mentioned her either huh fawn considered this could bewell she bit her lip im no patroller but i have seen a malice and if theres anything your mama was right about its that she said if you didnt love me enough youd choose the patrol she held up a hand to stem his beginning protest and that if you loved me beyond all senseyoud choose the patrol because you couldnt protect me for real and true any other way he subsided silenced she raised her face to meet his beautiful eyes square and went on so i just want you to know if you have to choose the patroli wont die of it nor be worse off for having known and loved you for a space ill still be richer going down the road than when you met me by far if only for the horse and the gear and the knowing i never knew there was as much knowing as this to be had in the whole world maybe looking back ill remember this summer as a dream of wonderseven the nightmare parts if i didnt get to keep you for always leastways i had you for a time which ought to be magic enough for any farmer girl he listened gravely not attempting after his first protest to interrupt trying to sort it out maybe for he said are you saying youre too tired to keep up this struggle anymore she eyed him no thats you i think he gave a little selfderisive snort could be keep it straight i love you and ill walk with you down any path you choose butthis one isnt my choice to make its yours true and wise he sighed i thought we both chose in that scary little parlor back in west blue and yet your choice will be honored or betrayed by mine in turn they dont come separately no they dont but they do come in order and west blue wellthat was before either you or i saw greenspring that town couldve been west blue those people me and mine i watched your lips move counting down that line of deadto keep you theres a lot of things id fight tooth and toenail your kin my kin another woman sickness farmer stupidity you name it cant fight greenspring wont he blinked rapidly and for a moment the gold in his eyes looked molten he swiped the shiny water tracks from his cheekbones with the back of his hand leaned forward and kissed her on the forehead that terrifying kiss of blessing again thank you he whispered you have no idea how that helps she nodded shortly swallowing down the hot lump in her own throat they went into their tent to change him out of his short trousers and sandals her out of her somewhat grubby shift when on her knees sorting through his trunk she tried to hand him up his cleanest shirt he surprised her by saying nomy best shirt the good one your aunt nattie wove he hadnt worn his wedding shirt since their wedding wondering she shook it out its folds wrapped in other clothes to keep it from creasingher green cotton dress as it happened oh yes wear that one he said looking over his shoulder its so pretty on you i dont know dag its awfully farmergirl shouldnt i dress more lakewalker for this he smiled crookedly down at her no it was disquieting in this context to be all gussied up in their weddingday clothes again she adjusted the hang of the cord on her left wrist and the gold beads knocked cool against her skin were they to be unmarried in this new noon hour as if tracing back over some exact path after they had gotten lost maybe they had gone astray somewhere along the way but fingering the links of events back one by one in her memory she couldnt see where dag had picked up his hickory stick so she guessed they were in for a longish walk to this grove since hed stopped using it around the campsite a few days back she brushed her skirts straight slipped her shoes on and followed him out of the tent dag realized hed walked for a mile without seeing a single thing that had passed his eyes and it wasnt because the route was so familiar his mind seemed to have come to some still place but he wasnt sure if it was poised or simply numb they were passing patroller headquarters when fawn uncharacteristically silent till then asked her first question where is this council grove anyhow he glanced down at her the rosy flush from their walk in the noon warmth kept her from being pale but her face was set not much farther just past hoharies medicine tent she nodded will there be very many people there is it like a town council i dont know town councils there are nearly eight thousand folks around hickory lake the whole point of having a camp council is so they dont have to all show up for these arguments anyone can come listen whos interested though it depends on how many people or families or tents are involved in a dispute its only tent redwingand tent bluefieldtoday therell be dar and mama but not too many friends of theirs because they wouldnt care to have them watch this my friends are mostly out on patrol this season so i dont expect a crowd he hesitated swinging his staff along then shrugged his left shoulder depends on how they take our marriage cords that affects most everyone and could grow much wider how long will it take at the start of a session the council leader lights a session candle session lasts as long as it takes to burn down which is about three hours they say of a dispute that its a onecandle or twocandle or tencandle argument they can spread over several days see he added after a few more paces but this one wont not if i can help it how do you know she asked but then it was time to turn off into the grove grove was a misnomer it was more of a clearing a wide circular space at the edge of the woods weeded of poison ivy and other noxious plant life and bordered by huge flowering bushes people had planted over the yearselderberry forsythia lilacsome so old their trunks were thick as trees upended log seats were scattered about on grass that a couple of placid sheep were at work nibbling short to one side rose an open frame nearly the size of patrol headquarters under a shingled roof for bad weather but today a small circle of seats was set up in the shade at the clearings edge a few more folks were walking in as dag and fawn arrived so apparently they were not late fairbolt crow talking head down with mari arrived last they split off from each other fairbolt taking the remaining unoccupied log seat at the end of a closeset row of seven backed up to some venerable elderberry bushes branches hanging heavy with fruit mari strode over to the gaggle of patrollers seated to dags right dag was not surprised to see saun razi and utau already there saun jumped to his feet and rolled up a log for her he was a little more surprised to see dirlahad she paddled all the way over from beaver sigh for this and griff from obios patrol clustered to the left of the councilors row were only dar cumbia and omba the latter plainly not too happy to be there his mother looked up from a bit of cord she was working in her lap for habit or comfort shot dag one glance of grim triumph which he scarcely knew how to interpretsee what you made me do maybethen looked away the looked away part he had no trouble understanding since he did the same like not watching a medicine maker rummage in ones wound dar merely appeared as if he had a stomachache and blamed dag for it hardly unusual for dar one log seat waited directly across from the councilors utau muttered something to razi who hurried to collect another from nearby and set it beside the first not ten feet of open space was left in the middle no one was going to have to bellowat least not merely to be heard fawn looking every bit as wary as a young deer stopped dag just out of earshot by clutching his arm he bent his head to her urgent whisper quick who are all those new people fairbolt was seated perhaps not accidentally closest to the patrollers and dowie grayheron beside him dag whispered back left from fairbolt and dowie is pakona pike shes council leader this season head of tent pike a woman of ninety or so as straightbacked as cumbia and one of her closer friendsdag did not expect benign neutrality from her but he didnt say it to fawn next to her are laski beaver and rigni hawk councilor and alternate from beaver sigh laski a woman in her eighties was head of tent beaver on beaver sigh and a leather makerit was her sister who made the coats that turned arrows no one would ever have pulled her from her making for council duty rigni closer to dags age came from a tent of makers specializing in boats and buildings though she herself was just emerging from raising a brood of children she was also one of dirlas aunts she might have heard some good of dag and fawn next down from them tioca cattail and her alternate ogit muskrat from heron island i dont know them all that well only that tioca was a medicine maker and since the recent death of her mother head of tent cattail on heron ogit was a retired patroller of about cumbias age curmudgeonly as cattagus but without the charm of no special making skills he liked being on council dag had heard while he was not close friends with cumbia the two had certainly known each other for decades despite ogits patrol connections dag did not hold much hope for an ally in him fawn blinked and nodded and dag wondered if she would remember all this and keep it straight in any case she now let him lead her forward he seated her on his right to the patroller side of things and settled himself laying his hickory staff at his feet and sitting up with a polite nod to the councilors across from him on a shorter sawedoff log in front of pakona sat a beeswax candle she nodded back grimly lit the wick and lowered a square parchment windbreak around it lanternlike from beside it she picked up a peeled wooden rod the speakers stick and tapped it three times against the makeshift table everyone fell silent and regarded her attentively theres been a deal of talk and gossip about this she began so i dont think anyone here needs more explainingto the complaint in the matter comes from tent redwing against its member dag redwing whos speaking for tent redwing dag stirred at his naming but voiced no protest let that one go for now youll find your chance i do said dar holding up one hand behind him cumbia nodded cumbia as head of tent redwing was more than capable of speaking for herself and everyone else and dag wondered at this tradeoff an extension of dags shunning didnt trust herself to keep her voice and argument steady she looked like old iron today but mostly she looked old pass this down to dar then said pakona the stick went from hand to hand speak your tents complaint dar he took the stick inhaled cast dag a level stare and began it wont take long as we all know dag returned late from a patrol this summer with a farmer paramour in tow that he named his wife on the basis of a pair of wedding cords that no one had witnessed them make we say that the cords are counterfeit produced by trickery dag is in simple violation of the longstanding rule against bringing suchselfindulgences within the bounds of camp tent redwing requests the camp and the patrol enforce the usual penalties returning the girl to her people by whatever means required and fining dag redwing for his transgression dag rigid with surprise exhaled carefully how interestingly clever of daryes this had to be dars idea he had entirely shifted his argument from the one threatened before dag had departed for raintree of forced stringcutting or banishment a glance at fairbolts rising eyebrows told dag the camp captain too had been taken by surprise he cast dag an apologetic glance dag wasnt sure how long ago dar had rethought his attack but he had been shrewd enough to keep it from fairbolt dag opened his ground just enough to catch the councilors sevenfold flicker of ground examination upon him and fawn tioca cattail tilted her head and said pardon but they appear to be perfectly usual cords to me cant that girl shut down herno i suppose not how do you think they are false they were falsified in the making said dar the exchange of grounds in the cords marks a true marriage yes but the making also actsnormallyas a barrier against anyone not bearing lakewalker bloodlines from contaminating our kinships its not a great making true its more like the lowest boundary we tend to think everyone can do it but that is itself the sign of the value of this custom in the past i say the farmer girl did not make her own cord but that dag made it for her with a trick he stole from my knifemaking techniques of using blood to lead live ground into an object it represents nothing but cunning how do you know this dar asked fairbolt frowning dar said a trifle reluctantly dag told me himself thats not what i said dag said sharply pakona held up a quelling hand wait for the stick dag hold on said rigni hawk her nose wrinkling were taking hearsay testimony on a matter when we have two eyewitnesses sitting right in the circle thank you rigni huffed fairbolt in relief quite right pakona i think the stick should go to dag for this tale he has reason to lie said dar looking sullen thatll be for us to sort out said rigni firmly pakona waved and dar reluctantly handed the stick around via omba to dag so how did you make those cords asked tioca in curiosity fawn and i made both cords together dag said tightly as some of you may remember my right arm was broken at the timehe made the old slinggestureand the other is well as you see lakewalker blood or no i was quite incapable of weaving any cord at all fawn wove the cord she now wears i sat behind her on the bench with my arms along hers and i cast my ground into it in the usual way i dont see how anyone in his right mind can maintain that cord is invalid pakona waved to quell him again but murmured so go on what about the other i admit i attempted to aid her in catching up her ground to weave into the second cord we were having no luck at all when suddenly all on her own she cut open both her index fingers and wove while bleeding her ground welled right up and into the cord i didnt help her any more than she helped me less id say you instructed her to do this then said tioca no she came up with it a few nights earlier dag and i had been talking about ground fawn put in breathlessly and hed told me blood held ground after it left the body because it was like alive separately from the person which i thought was a right disturbing idea so i remembered it youve not been given leave to speak here girl said pakona sharply fawn sat back and clapped her hand over her mouth in apology and alarm dag set his jaw but added fawn is exactly right i recognized it as a technique that any of us here who have been bonded to sharing knives have likewise seen but i didnt suggest it fawn thought of it herself they used a knifemaking technique on wedding cords dar said in a voice of outrage groundwork is groundwork hoharie says dag shot back i defy you to find a rule anywhere says you cant tiocas eyes narrowed in considerable intrigue medicinemaking does have to be a little moreadaptable than some other kinds of making she allowed such as knifework hung implied in a kindly sort of tone dag allowed himself an instant of enjoyment watching dars teeth grit one brothers word against tothers rumbled ogit muskrat from his end of the row ones a maker ones not given the matter is making i know which id trust fawn her lips pressed tight cast a look up at dag but youre a maker too he gave her a small headshake he was letting himself get distracted wound up in side issues this wasnt about their cords very canny of dar to try to make it so though it dropped the whole smoldering issue of threatened banishment against a what was that word fairbolt had used notable patroller into the lake was that part cumbias doingshaken by doubt of her sons allegiance despite her harsh words to fawn a reaction to whatever reputation dag had won in raintree it certainly avoided complicated and possibly ferocious campwide debates over the councils right to force a stringcutting if dar could make it stick it made everything simple and the problem go away without anyone having to change anything and if dar couldnt make it stick there was still the other strategy to fall back on but dag doubted there was a person on council who wouldnt prefer the simpler version fairbolt not excepted but if you rule the girls cord is invalid said laski beaver scratching her head yet dags is not does that mean hes married to her but shes not married to him makes no sense both are invalid snapped dar pakona with admirable evenhandedness gave him the same quelling glower and headshake shed given dag and he subsided pakona turned back and said bring those things up here dag we need a closer look she added reluctantly the girl too dag had fawn roll up the soft fine fabric of his left sleeve and dutifully rose to walk slowly down the row of councilors fawn followed silent and scared the touches both with fingers and groundsense were for the most part brief enough to be courteous although a couple of the womens hands strayed curiously to the fabric of his shirt tioca dag was almost certain detected his fading ground reinforcement being slowly absorbed in fawns left arm but she said nothing about it to the others fairbolt at the end of the line waved them both away ive seen em repeatedly dag and fawn recrossed the circle and sat once more he watched her head bend as she straightened her skirts in the green dress she looked like some lone flower found in a woodland pool in a springcomelate very late she is not your prize old patroller not to be won nor earned shes her own gift lilies always are his onlyfingers traced her cord on his arm and fell back gripping his knee theres our vote then said pakona is this unusual cordmaking to be taken as valid or not theres this said laski slowly once word gets out id think others could repeat this trick acceptance would open the door to more of these mismatches but theyre good ground constructions said tioca as solid as well mine she wriggled her left wrist and the cord circling it are cords not to be proof of marriage anymore maybe all cordmakings will have to be witnessed hereafter said laski a general unenthusiastic hm as everyone envisioned this i suggest said pakona that we set the future actions of future folks beyond the scope of this council or well still be arguing as the hundredth candle burns down we only have to rule on this couple this day weve seen all there is to see heard from the only ones who were there whether the idea for the thing was dags or the farmer girls seems to me not to make a great deal of difference the outcome was the same a no vote will see it finished right now a yes vote willwell it wont dar is this agreeable to tent redwing dar leaned back for a lowvoiced exchange with their frowning mother cumbia had run out of cord to play with her hands now kneaded the fabric of her shift along her thin thighs a grimace a short nod dar turned back yes we accept he replied dag you yes said dag slowly he glanced aside at fawn watching him in trusting bewilderment and gave her a little nod of reassurance go ahead dar expecting more argument looked at him in sharp surprise dag remembered fairbolts word picture of the sitting tactician wise man fairbolt he settled back to watch the candle burn down as pakona started down the row ogit no no farmer spouses well that was clear tioca a slight hesitation yes i cant reconcile it with my makers conscience to say thats not a good making rigni called upon looked plaintively at tioca and at last said yes laski after a bit of a struggle said no pakona herself said no without hesitation and added if we let this in its going to be every kind of mess and it will go on and on dowie dowie looked down the row and made a careful count on her fingers and looked appalled a no from her would finish the matter a yes would create a tie and throw it onto fairbolt after a long long pause she cleared her throat and said yes fairbolt gave her palpable cowardice a slow blistering and ungrateful glare then he sighed sat up and stared around a longer silence stretched you know theyre good cords fairbolt dag thought dag watched the struggle in the captains face between integrity and practicality and admired how long it was taking the latter to triumph in a way dag wished the integrity would pull ahead it wasnt going to make a bit of difference in the end after all and fairbolt would feel better about himself later fairbolt said pakona cautiously camp captain always goes last to break the tie votes its a duty fairbolt waved this away in a yeah yeah i know gesture he cleared his throat dag you got anything more to say a certain amount yes it will seem roundabout but it will go to the center in the end makes no never mind to me whether its before or after you have your say though fairbolt gave him a little nod go ahead then you have the stick pakona looked as though she wanted to override this but thought better of annoying fairbolt while his vote hung in the breeze she crossed her arms and settled back dar and cumbia were frowning in alarm but dag certainly had all their attention dags mind was heavy his head ached but his heart felt light as if it were flying might just be falling well know when we hit the ground he set the speaking stick aside reached down gripped his hickory staff and stood up full height excepting the patrollers who just came back from raintree with me how many folks here have heard the name of a farmer town called greenspring an array of blank looks from the center and left although dirlas aunt rigni after a glance at her patroller niece hesitantly raised her hand for a moment dag returned her a nod im not surprised there are so few it was the town in raintree where that last malice started up unchecked no one told me the name either when i was called out to ride west now partly that was due to the confusion that always goes with such a scramble but you knowpartly it wasnt no one knew or said because it didnt seem important to them so how many herenot my patrollersknow the numbers of dead at bonemarsh ogit muskrat said gruffly weve all heard them bout fifty grownups and near twenty youngsters such a horror sighed tioca dag nodded nineteen thats right fairbolt was watching him curiously no im not taking your advice about boasting fairbolt maybe the reverse just wait so who knows how many died at greenspring the patrollers to his right looked tightlipped holding back the answer the majority of the councilors just looked baffled after a stretch pakona finally said lots i imagine what has this to do with your counterfeit wedding cords dag he let that counterfeit slide unchallenged too i said it was roundabout of a thousand townsfolkroughly half the population of bonemarshgreenspring lost about three hundred grownups and allor nearly allof their youngsters i counted not less than one hundred sixtytwo such bodies at the greenspring burying field and i know there were the bones of at least three more at the bonemarsh mudmen feast we cleaned up after didnt mention those three to the townsmen doing the burying it wouldnt have helped at the time he glanced down at fawn glancing up at him and knew they were both wondering if some of those scattered bones might have been the missing sassy dag hoped not he shook his head at fawn to say no knowing and she nodded and hunkered on her seat does anyone but me see something terribly wrong with those two sets of numbers the return stares held discomfort more than a twinge of sympathy even pity but no enlightenment dag sighed and plowed on all right try this bonemarsh diedpeople slain animals slaughtered that beautiful country blighted for a generationbecause we failed at greenspring if the malice had been recognized and stopped there it would never have marched as far as bonemarsh it wasnt lack of patrollers or patrolling that slew greenspring raintree patrol is as stretched as anyone elses but there would have been enough if only it was a lack ofsomething else talking knowing friendships even a whole lot of simple things that could have been different that one man or another might have changed but didnt are you blamin the raintree patrol burst out mari unable to contain herself any longer because that isnt the way i saw it seems the farmers were told not to settle there but they didnt listen pakona made her handwave again though not with any great conviction im not blaming either side more than the other said dag and i dont know the answers and i know i dont know and its stopped me right cold but you seeonce upon a time i didnt know dirt about patrolling either and half of what i thought i did know was wrong theres a cure for ignorant young patrollers thoughwe send em for a walk around the lake turns em into much smarter old patrollers pretty reliably good system its worked for generations so im thinkinmaybe its not enough anymore just to walk around the lake maybe we or some of us or one of us needs to walk around the world the circle had grown very quiet dag took a last breath and maybe that fellow is me sometimes when you dont know how to start you just have to start anyway and find out movin what youd never learn sittin still im not going to argue and im not going to defend because thats like asking me to tell you the ending before ive begun there may not even be an ending so fairbolt you can cast that last vote any way you please but tomorrow my wife and i are going to be down that road and gone thats all he gave a short sharp nod and sat back down f awn let out her breath as dag settled again beside her her heart was pounding as though shed been running she wrapped her arms around herself and rocked looking around the circle of formidable lakewalkers from the restive pack of patrollers to her right she heard utau mutter you all were asking me what it felt like to be groundripped now you know to which mari returned a lowvoiced shut up utau you dont have the stick razi said under his breath no i think weve just been hit with it she motioned him too to shush both pakona and fairbolt glanced aside not friendlylike and the patrollers subsided fairbolt sat back with his arms folded and glowered at his boots dag murmured to fawn give this back to pakona will you spark i wont be needing it again he handed her the little length of wood theyd called the speaking stick she nodded took it carefully and trod across the circle to the scary old woman who looked even more like cumbias sister than cumbias sister mari did maybe it was the closer age match or maybe they were nearrelated these lakewalkers all seemed to be neither of them wishing to get as close to the other as to pass it from hand to hand fawn laid the stick down next to the candlelantern and skittered back to the shelter of dag despite the prohibition on her speaking here she swallowed cupped her hand to his ear and whispered back at the firefly tree i thought if i loved you any harder i wouldnt be able to breathe i was right gulping she sat back down his crooked smile was so tender it pierced her like some sweet sharp blade saying better than words its all right all wrong and all right mixed together so confusingly he hugged her once around the shoulders fiercely and they both looked up to watch fairbolt as did everyone else fairbolt grimaced scratched his head sat up smiled a little fairboltish smile that wasnt the sort of thing anybody would want to smile along with and said i abstain a ripple of dismay ran along the line of his fellow councilors punctuated at the end by an outraged cry from dar what you cant do that said dowie she swiveled to pakona beside her can he do that and less audibly can i do that which made fairbolt rub his forehead and sigh but he answered her i can and do but not often i generally prefer to see things settled and done but if dag is taking his farmer bride away regardless i fail to see the emergency in this what about tent redwing demanded dar wheres our redress fairbolt tilted his head appearing to be considering this tent redwing can do as any other disputant can in the event of a locked council decision bring the complaint again to the new council next season its only two months now to bearsford camp but hell be gone wailed cumbia it was a measure of her distress fawn thought that she didnt even grab for the stick before this outburst but for once pakona didnt wave her down she was too busy gripping her own knees maybe fairbolt shook his head this marriagecord redefinition is too big and complicated a thing for one man to decide even in an emergency its a matter for a campwide meet separate from the emotions of a particular case folks need time to talk and think about this more carefullike fawn could see that this argument was working on the camp council and it was plain enough that to some it didnt matter how fawn went away as long as she went the mob of patrollers was looking downright mulish thoughif not as mulish as dar dar turned around for a rapid lowvoiced consultation with cumbia she shook her head once in anger once in something like despair then finally shrugged dar turned back tent redwing requests the speaking stick pakona nodded picked it up and hesitated you cant ask for another vote on the same matter till bearsford you know i know this isdifferent but urgently related that stringcutting idea thats for a camp meet as well and as ive told you before i dont think youll get it especially not if shesa head jerk toward fawnalready gone its neither said dar she shrugged acceptance and passed the stick along to him dar began tent redwing has no choice but to accept this delay he glowered at fairbolt but as is obvious to everyone by bearsford season dag plans to be long gone our complaint if sustained involves a stiff fine owed to the camp we ask that dag redwings camp credit be held against that new hearing lest the camp be left with no recourse if the fine is ordered also to assure hell show up to face the council pakona and ogit looked instantly approving laski and rigni looked considering tioca and dowie dismayed fairbolt had hardly any expression at all pakona said in a tone of relief well that at least has plenty of precedent dag was smiling in a weird dry way fawn dared to push up on one knee and whisper in his ear again what does that mean can they make you come back no he murmured to her see once in a while some angry loser receives a council order to make restitution and tries to resist by drawing out his camp credit and hiding it this stops up that hole till the settlement is paid but since dar will never be able to bring the complaint to bearsford councilor anywhere else since i wont be there to answer itthis would tie up my camp credit indefinitely stripping me like a banishment without actually having to push through a banishment may work too since no one likes to see the camp lose resources right clever except that i was ready to walk away stark naked if i had to i wont be rising to this bait spark brothers she muttered subsiding back to her hard seat his lips twitched indeed pakona said tent redwings request seems to me reasonable especially in light of what dag redwing said about his intention to leave camp leave said ogit is that what you call it id call it plain desertion wrapped up in fancy nonsense and what are you going to do about that fairbolt he leaned forward to glare around the council at the camp captain on the other end that will be a matter internal to the patrol fairbolt stated and the iron finality in his voice was enough to daunt even ogit who sat back puffing but not daring to say more breaking his intent to speak no further dag gave fairbolt a short nod ill like to see you after this sir its owed fairbolt returned the nod at headquarters its on your way aye pakona knocked her knuckles on the log candle table thats our vote then should dag redwings camp credit be held till the bearsford council yes will hold it no will release it it was plain that she struggled not to add something like to be taken off and frittered away on farmer paramours but her leaders discipline won barely fawn sensed ogit yes no surprise there the string of three more yesses variously firm or reluctant were more of a disappointment the vote was lost before it even came to pakonas firm yes dowie looked down the row seemed to do some mental arithmetic and murmured a safely useless no fairbolt grimaced and grumbled no as well pakona stated tent redwings request is upheld camp council rules dag redwings camp credit is held aside until the bearsford rehearing a little silence fell as it all sank in until broken by saun surging up to yell you blighted thieves razi and griff both tackled him and wrestled him back into his seat after raintree after raintree mari turned and scowled at him but seemingly could not force herself to actually chide as she turned back the look she shot at her nephew dar would have burned bacon fawn thought ombas jaw had been working for quite some time now she snatched the speaking stick out of her surprised husbands hand waved it and cried out make him take his horse copperhead is a blighted menace the beast has bitten three of my girls kicked two and torn more hide off his pasturemates than i ever want to sew up again i dont care if dag walks out bare to the skin but i demand his horse go with him which all sounded plenty irate except that her eye away from dar and toward dag shivered in a wink theres a mental picture for you spark dag said out of the corner of his mouth at her me and copperhead bareback to barebackside she could have shaken him till his teeth rattled for making her almost laugh aloud in the midst of this mess as it was she had to clap her hand over her mouth and look down into her lap until she regained control happy eyes she whispered back and had the sweet revenge of watching him choke back a surprised guffaw dar glowered at them both furiously impotent against their private jokes which was also pretty tasty amongst the ashes wherever did you come by that horse anyhow fawn asked under her breath dag murmured back lost a game of chance with a keelboat man at silver shoals once lost ah that explains it pakona considered dag not in a friendly way that does bring up the question of where camp credit leaves off and personal effects begin and if she was picturing dag walking out naked it wasnt with the same emotions fawn did by a long shot fairbolt rumbled no it doesnt pakona unless you want to start a revolt in the patrol saun still squirming in his seat with utaus hand heavy on his shoulder looked as if he was ready to begin an uprising right now and if steam wasnt billowing from dirla razi and griff it was only because they werent wet pakona raised an eyebrow at fairbolt cant you keep your rowdy youngsters under control fairbolt pakona id be leading them her mouth thinned in lack of appreciation of his humor or whatever that wasblack and sincere anyhow but she veered off nonetheless very well till the bearsford rehearing theformer patroller can take away his horse copperhead its gear and whatever personal effects it can carry the farmer girl can leave with whatever she came with its no business of ours what about all those bridegifts he sent off said dar suddenly dag stirred his eyes narrowing dangerously mari looked up at this one dar dont even start fawn wasnt sure if that was her patrol leader voice or her aunt voice or some alloy of the two but dar subsided and even pakona didnt reprimand her pakona straightened her spine and looked around the circle tent redwing do you have anything more to say before i close this session dar choked out through flat lips no maam the campcredit ruling had left him looking bitterly satisfied but cumbia behind him was drawn and quiet dag redwing dag shook his head in silence pakona held out her hand and the speaking stick was passed back to her she tapped it three times on the log table leaned forward and blew out the session candle at the door to his pegboard chamber fairbolt excluded dags outraged escort of fellow patrollers and their increasingly imaginative and urgent offers to wreak vengeance on dar dag was just as glad fairbolt gestured him and fawn to seats but dag shook his head and simply stood hanging wearily on his hickory stick not fellow patrollers anymore i suppose what was he now if not fawns patroller he hardly knew fawns dag leastways always she leaned up under his left arm looking anxiously at fairbolt and dag let some of his weight rest on her slim shoulders im sorry about how that came out back there said fairbolt jerking his head in the general direction of the council grove i didnt expect dar to blindside me twice i always said my family was impossible i never said they were stupid sighed dag i thought it was a draw between the two of you myself id made up my mind to it when i walked into that circle that i was going to walk out banished for real and if they didnt offer it i was going to take it myself he added you have my resignation of course i should have stopped in here before the session and not blindsided you with that too but i wasnt just sure how things were going to play out if you want to call it desertion i wont argue fairbolt leaned down and plucked dags peg from the painted square on the wall labeled sick list he straightened up and weighed it thoughtfully in his palm so what are you going to do out there walking around farmer country i just cant picture you plowing dirt leastways it would involve movin though right now sitting looks pretty good that moodll pass it always does i wasnt joking when i said i do not know he had once traveled great distances for all he knew the next great journey would be all in one place but walked the long way through time a passage he could barely envision let alone explain no plan i ever made has been of the least use to me and sometimesplans keep you from seeing other paths i want to keep my eyes clear for a space find out if you really can teach an old patroller new tricks youve learned quite a few lately from what hoharie says wellyes dag added give my regrets and thanks to hoharie will you she almost tempted me away from you butit would have been the wrong road i dont know much right now but i know that much no lordship said fairbolt watching him no dag concurred i mean to find some other road wide enough for everyone someone has to survey it could be the new way wont be mine to make but mine to be given out there from someone smarter than me if i keep my ground open watch and listen hard enough fairbolt said meditatively not much point for a man to learn new things if he doesnt come back to teach em pass em on dag shook his head change needs to happen but it wont happen today here with these people camp council proved that fairbolt held his hand out palm down in a judicious rocking gesture it wasnt unanimous theres a hope dag conceded even if it was mainly due to dowie grayheron having a spine of pure custard fairbolt barked a laugh shaking his head in reluctant agreement dag said this wasnt my first plan id have stayed here with spark if theyd have let me be getting myself ready for the next patrol even now no youd still be on the sick list i assure you said fairbolt he glanced down hows the leg you were favoring it walking back i noticed its coming along it still twinges when im tired im glad ill be riding copperhead instead of walking bless ombas wits ill miss that woman fairbolt stared out the hookedopen window at the glimmer of the lake soif you could have your first plan backsorry fawn not even what you call lakewalker magic could make that happen now but ifwould you take it it was a testing question and a good one dag tilted his head in the silence his eyelids lowering rising then said simply no as fawn looked solemnly up at him he gave her a squeeze around the shoulders go on and chuck my peg in the fireplace im done with it fairbolt gave him a short nod well if you ever change your mindor if the world bucks you off againyou know where to find us ill still be here you dont ever give up do you fairbolt chuckled massape wouldnt let me very dangerous woman massape the day i met her fortyone years gone all my fine and fancy plans for my life fell into hickory lake and never came up again hang on to your dangerous woman too dag theyre rare and not easy to come by dag smiled ive noticed that fairbolt tossed the peg in his palm once more then abruptly held it out to fawn here i think this is yours now dont lose it fawn glanced up at them both her eyebrows climbing in surprise then smiled and folded the peg in her firm little grip you bet i wont sir dag made plans to leave in the gray light of dawn in part to get a start on a day that promised to turn cool and rainy later but mostly to avoid any more farewells or worse folks who still wanted to argue with him he and fawn had packed their saddlebags the night before and dag had given away what wouldnt fit his trunk to sarri his good ash spear to razi and his fathers sword to utau because he sure wasnt passing it back to dar his winter gear in storage at bearsford he supposed he must abandon with his camp credit tent bluefield he left standing for stores to struggle with since theyd been so anxious for it dag was surprised when omba herself and not one of her girls appeared out of the mists hanging above the road leading copperhead and grace she gave him a hug sneaking in a goodbye out of sight of the kin he inquired hugging her back well that and umi have to offer an apology to fawn fawn taking graces reins from her said you never did me any harm that i know of omba im glad to have met you omba cleared her throat not harm exactly more of anaccident she was a bit flushed in the face dag was bemused to note not at all like her usual dry briskness fawn im very sorry but im afraid your horse is pregnant what cried fawn she looked at grace who looked back with a mild and unrepentant eye and snuffled her soft muzzle into fawns hand in search of treats grace you bad girl what have you been up to she gave her reins a little shake laughing and amazed omba said dag leaning against copperheads shoulder and grinning despite himself who have you gone and let ravish my wifes mare omba sighed hugely rig crows stallion shadow got loose and swam over from walnut about five nights ago had himself a fine old time before we caught up with him youre not the only mares owners im going to have to apologize to today though youre the first in line im not looking forward to it will they be angry asked fawn were they planning other mates was he not a good horse oh shadow is a fine horse dag assured her you would not believe how many furs rig asks for and gets as a stud fee for that snorty horse of his i know i paid through the nose last year to have him cover swallow for darkling and therefore said omba pulling on her blackandwhite braid everyone will say they are very upset and carry on as convincingly as possible while rig tries to collect it could go to the camp council youll forgive me i trust for wishing them all a long tedious dispute burning many candles said dag if rig asks my wife and i are just furious about it all he vented an evil laugh that made even fawn raise an eyebrow at him i wasnt even going to mention grace omba assured him ill be having troubles enough over this utau and razi came out to help them saddle up followed by sarri and mari and cattagus together dag mostly exchanged sober nods except with his aunt mari whom he embraced fawn hugged everybody think youll be back asked utau gruffly for that bearsford council maybe not for that for the rest who can say ive left home for good at least four times that i recall as mari can testify i remember a spectacular one bout eight years back she allowed there was a lot of shouting you managed to be gone for seventeen months maybe ill get better at it with practice could be she said then added but i sort of hope not and then it was time to mount up razi gave dag a leg up and sprang away copperhead put in his usual tricks and was duly chastised and utau boosted fawn onto grace on the road dag and fawn both turned and gave silent waves as silently returned as the blurring forms left behind parted to their different tents the mist swallowed them all dag and fawn didnt speak again till the horses had clopped over the long wooden span from the island she watched him lean his hand on his cantle and stare over his shoulder she said quietly i didnt mean when i fell in love with you to burn your life to the ground he turned back giving her a pensive smile i was dry dry timber when you met me spark itll be well he set his face ahead and didnt look around again he added after a while though im sorry i lost all my camp credit i really thought when i promised your folks i would care for you to have in hand whatever youd need for your comfort come this winter and on for a lot of winters more all the plunkins in the bearsford cold cellars wont do us much good now as i understand it your goods arent lost exactly more like held like my dowry his brows rose theres a way of looking at it i hadnt thought of i dont know how wed manage traveling anyhow with a string of what did you sayeight horses he considered this picture i was thinking more of converting it into tripoint gold tridens or silver shoals silver mussels their monies are good all up and down the grace and the gray but if all my camp credit for the past eighteen years were converted into horsesaverage horses not copperheads or shadowshm let me see he did some mental estimating for the curiosity of it that would be about forty horses roughly way too many for us to trail in a string its true forty horses said fawn sounding quite taken aback you could buy a farm for the price of forty horses but i wouldnt know what to do with it once i had it but i wouldoh never mind she added im glad i didnt know this yesterday id have been a lot more upset offends your notions of economy does it well yes or my notions of something he gave her a wink youre worth it at twice the price spark trust me huh but she settled again thumping her heels gently against graces widesprung sides to urge her to keep up looking meditative they pulled their horses to a halt at the place a mile from the bridge where the road split in three so he said which way dont you know no well not north not this late in the season in the meadows the cicadas were growing noisier as the morning warmed but the first frosts would silence them soon enough whichever way we go well need to travel in easy stages see on account of graces delicate condition he suspected he could get a lot of use out of graces condition if he played it right not fooled a bit fawn looked narrowly at him and said couldnt agree more she swiveled her head but stillwhich road her eye was caught by something and she twisted in her saddle whats this dag followed her gaze and his stomach knotted coldly at the sight of saun and dirla galloping madly from the bridge and waving at them please please not some other malice outbreaki dont want to have to do all this leaving over again but their flushed faces when they pulled up and sat panting on their fidgeting mounts werent that sort of anxious i was afraid wed missed you gasped dirla kindly said dag touching his temple but i thought wed all said goodbye yesterday and while not enoughit had been enough saun catching his breath waved this away its not that its this he stuck a hand in his vest and pulled out a leather bag which clinked a lot of folks from our company and in the patrol werent too pleased with how things went yesterday in the camp council so dirla and griff and i took up a little collection its nothing compared to what dar stripped you of i know but its something he thrust out the bag toward dag who let copperhead shy away a step i thank you kindly saun but i cant take that not as many chipped in as i thought should said dirla looking irate but at least the blighted camp council has nothing to do with this dag was both touched and embarrassed look you children i cant fairbolt put in three gold tridens saun interrupted him and told us not to tell massape and massape put in ten silver mussels dirla added and told us not to tell fairbolt she paused in reflection you do wonder what theyll say if they catch up with each other are you telling saun asked her interested nope wellthe crow clan was rich dag sighed looking at those earnest eager faces he could see he wasnt getting out of this one i suppose the patrol will be wearing out some of those horses i left behind likely said saun dag smiled in defeat and held out his hand saun passed the bag across grinning ill try and remember all you taught me no more swordplay in the woods right thats a start dag agreed duck faster is another good one cept you learned that one all by yourself itll stick better that way i do allow take care of each other you two the patrol looks after its own said dirla firmly dag gave her a warm nod the patrol looks after everybody dirla her return smirk was quite sparklike then youre still some kind of patroller arent you take carecaptain they waved and turned away dag waited till theyd stopped craning around and looking back then hefted the bag and peeked in huh not bad well this gives us a direction how so fawn asked south he said definitely ive been south she objected all the way to glassforge spark south doesnt even start till you get to silver shoals im thinkinthis season passage on a flatboat going down the river isnt too expensive we could ride slow down as far as silver shoals pick out a boatload grace and copperhead in too i could see a lot of farmer country and sit still at the same time very enticin that notion ive always wanted to do that follow fall all the way down to the sea and show you the sea ride back easy come springyou can make spring last a long time riding north at the right pace bet my ground will be healed by then what do you think her mouth had fallen open at this sudden spate of what were to her he guessed quite fantastical visions she shut it and swallowed when you say travel she said you dont think small oh thats just a jaunt by old patroller standards he assured her he twisted in his saddle to tuck the leather purse away in his saddlebag then frowned when his fingers pushing through a fold of blanket cloth encountered an unidentifiable lump he traded off and pulled out the lump to hold up to the light and gazed in some astonishment at a plunkin ear whats this did you pack this he asked fawn she blushed them yes i thought you should have your food wherever we end up we dont eat the ears love i know that she tossed her head theyre for planting sarri told me the earsll keep good for two or three years dry i snuck round last night after you fell asleep and filched some out of the feed bin on mare island not the best maybe but i picked out the nicestlooking that were there what were you thinking farmer girl i was thinkingwe might have a pond someday and at his look well we might he couldnt deny it he threw back his head and laughed smuggling plunkins and horses no no spark its all clear to me now the only future for us is going to be as road bandits she grinned in exasperation and shook her head just ride dag as they chirped their horses into a walk a patrol of some two dozen wild geese flew overhead calling hauntingly and they both turned their faces upward to mark the beating wonder of those wings a bit early fawn commented maybe theyre out for a jaunt or lost not those fellows it looks like a pointer to me spark i say lets follow em stirrup to stirrup they did
