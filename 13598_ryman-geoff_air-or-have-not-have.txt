geoff ryman air or have not have dedicated to doris mcpherson and what is left of the original meadowvale ontario canada chapter mae lived in the last village in the world to go online after that everyone else went on air mae was the villages fashion expert she advised on makeup sold cosmetics and provided good dresses every farmers wife needed at least one good dress mae would sketch what was being worn in the capital she would always add a special touch a limegreen scarf with sequins or a lacy ruffle with colourful embroidery a good dress was for display we are a happier people and we can wear these gay colours mae would advise yes that is true her customer might reply entranced that fashion expressed their happy culture in the photographs the japanese women all look so solemn so full of themselves said mae and lowered her head and scowled and she and her customer would laugh feeling as sophisticated as anyone in the world mae got her ideas as well as her mascara and lipsticks from her trips to the town it was a long way and she needed to be driven when sunni haseem offered to drive her down in exchange for a fashion expedition mae had to agree apart from anything else mae had a wedding dress to collect sunni herself was from an old village family but her husband was a beefy brute from farther down the hill he puffed on cigarettes and his tanned fingers were as thick and weathered as the necks of turtles in the backseat with mae sunni giggled and prodded and gleamed with the thought of visiting town with her friend and confidante who was going to unleash her beauty secrets mae smiled and whispered promising much i hope my source will be present today she said she brings me my special colours you cannot get them anywhere else i dont ask where she gets them mae lowered her eyes and her voice i think her husband a dubious gesture meaning that perhaps the goods were stolen stolen from who knows supplies meant for foreign diplomats the tips of maes fingers rattled once in provocation across her clients arm the town was called yeshibozkent which meant green valley city it was now approached through corridors of raw apartment blocks set on beige desert soil it had billboards a new jail discos with mirror balls illuminated shop signs and toyota jeeps that belched out blue smoke the town centre was as mae remembered it from childhood traditional wooden houses crowded crookedly together wooden shingles covered the roofs and gables the shop signs were tiny faded and sometimes handlettered the old market square was still full of peasants selling vegetables laid out on mats middleaged men still played chess outside tiny cafes youths still prowled in packs there was still the publicaddress system the address system barked out news and music from the top of the electricity poles its sounds drifted over the city announcing public events or new initiatives against drug dealers it told of progress on the new highway and boasted of the well known entertainers who were visiting the town mr haseem parked near the market and the address system seemed to enter maes lungs like cigarette smoke perfume or hairspray she stepped out of the van and breathed it in the excitement of being in the city trembled in her belly the address system made maes spirits rise as much as the bellowing of shoppers farmers and donkeys as much as the smell of raw petrol and cut greenery and drains she and her middleaged client looked at each other and gasped and giggled at themselves now mae said stroking sunnis hair her cheek it is time for a complete makeover lets really do you up i cannot do as good a workup in the hills mae took her client to halats the same hairdresser as sunni might have gone to anyway but mae was greeted by halat with cries and smiles and kisses on the cheek that implied a promise that maes client would get special treatment there was a pretence of consultancy mae offered advice comments cautions careful she has such delicate skin the hair could use more shaping there and halat hummed as if perceiving what had been hidden before and then agreed to give the client what she would otherwise have had but sunnis nails were soaking and she sat back in the centre of attention like a queen all of this allowed the hairdresser to charge more mae had never pressed her luck and asked for a cut something beady in halats eyes told mae there would be no point what mae got out of it was standing and that would lead to more work later with cucumbers over her eyes sunni was safely trapped mae announced i just have a few errands to run you relax and let all cares fall away she disappeared before sunni could protest mae ran to collect the dress a disabled girl a very good seamstress called miss soo had opened up a tiny shop of her own miss soo was grateful for any business poor thing skinny as a rail and twisted after the usual greetings miss soo shifted around and hobbled and dragged her way to the back of the shop to fetch the dress her feet hissed sideways across the uneven concrete floor poor little thing mae thought how can she sew yet miss soo had a boyfriend in the fashion business genuinely in the fashion business far away in the capital city balshang the girl often showed mae his photograph it was like a magazine photograph the boy was very handsome with a shiny shirt and coiffedup hair she kept saying she was saving up money to join him it was a mystery to mae what such a boy was doing with a cripple for a girlfriend why did he keep contact with her publicly mae would say to friends of the girl it is the miracle of love what a good heart he must have otherwise she kept her own counsel which was this you would be very wise not to visit him in balshang the boyfriend sent miss soo the patterns of dresses photographs magazines or even whole catalogues there was one particularly treasured thing a showcase publication the cover was like the lid of a box and it showed in full colour the best of the nations fashion design models so rich and thin they looked like ghosts they looked half asleep as if the only place they carried the weight of their wealth was on their eyelids it was like looking at western or japanese women and yet these were their own people so longlegged so modern so ethereal as if they were made of air mae hated the clothes they looked like washingup towels oatmeal or grey in one colour and without a trace of adornment mae sighed with lament why do these rich women go about in their underwear the girl shuffled back with the dress past piles of unsold oatmeal cloth miss soo had a skinny face full of teeth and she always looked like she was staring ahead in fear if you are rich you have no need to try to look rich her voice was soft she made mae feel like a peasant without meaning to she made mae yearn to escape herself to be someone else for the child was effortlessly talented somehow effortlessly in touch with the outside world ah yes mae sighed but my clients you know they live in the hills she shared a conspiratorial smile with the girl their taste speaking of which lets have a look at my wedding cake of a dress the dress was actually meant to look like a cake all pink and white sugar icing except that it kept moving all by itself white wires with styrofoam bobbles on the ends were surrounded with clouds of white netting does it need to be quite so busy the girl asked doubtfully encouraged too much by maes smile i know my clients replied mae coolly this is at least she thought a dress that makes some effort she inspected the work the needlework was delicious as if the white cloth were cream that had flowed together the poor creature could certainly sew even when she hated the dress that will be fine said mae and made a move towards her purse you are so kind murmured miss soo bowing slightly like mae miss soo was of chinese extraction that was meant to make no difference but somehow it did mae and miss soo knew what to expect of each other the dress was packed in brown paper and carefully tied so it would not crease there were farewells and mae scurried back to the hairdressers sunni was only just finished hairspray and scent rising off her like steam this is the dress said mae and peeled back part of the paper to give halat and sunni a glimpse of the tulle and styrofoam oh the women said as if all that white were clouds in dreams and halat was paid there were smiles and nods and compliments and then they left outside the shop mae breathed out as though she could now finally speak her mind oh she is good that little viper but you have to watch her you have to make her work did she give you proper attention oh yes very special attention i am lucky to have you for a friend said sunni let me pay you something for your trouble mae hissed through her teeth no no i did nothing i will not hear of it it was a kind of ritual there was no dream in finding sunnis surly husband mr haseem was redfaced half drunk in a club with unvarnished walls and a television you spend my money he declared his eyes were on mae my friend mae makes no charges snapped sunni she takes something from what they charge you mr haseem glowered like a thunderstorm she makes them charge me less not more replied sunni her face going like stone the two women exchanged glances maes eyes could say how can you bear it a woman of culture like you it is my tragedy came the reply aching out of the ashamed eyes so they sat while the husband sobered up and watched television mae contemplated the husbands hostility to her and what might lie behind it on the screen the local female newsreader talked talents such people were called she wore a red dress with a large gold brooch something had been done to her hair to make it stand up in a sweep before falling away she was groomed as smooth as ice she chattered in a high voice perky through a battery of tigers teeth she goes to halats as well mae whispered to sunni weather maps shots of the honoured president and the full cabinet one by one making big decisions the men in the club chose what movie they wanted since the satellites they could do that satellites had ruined visits to the town before it used to be that the men were made to sit through something the children or families might also like to watch so you got everyone together for the watching of the television the clubs had to be more polite now women hardly saw tv at all and the clubs were full of drinking the men chose another kung fu movie mae and sunni endured it sipping cocacola it became apparent that mr haseem would not buy them dinner finally late in the evening mr haseem loaded himself into the van enduring unstoppable and quite dangerous he drove them back up into the mountains weaving across the middle of the road you make a lot of money out of all this mr haseem said to mae i i make a little something i try to maintain the standards of the village i do not want people to see us as peasants just because we live on the high road sunnis husband barked out a laugh we are peasants then he added you do it for the money sunni sighed in embarrassment and mae smiled a hard smile to herself in the darkness you give yourself away sunnisman you want my husbands land you want him to be your dependant and you dont like your wifes money coming to me to prevent it you want to make both me and my husband your slaves it is a strange thing to spend four hours in the dark listening to an engine roar with a man who seeks to destroy you in late may school ended there were no fewer than six girls graduating and each one of them needed a new dress miss soo was making two of them mae would have to do the others but she needed to buy the cloth she had a mobile phone a potent fashion symbol but she needed another trip to yeshibozkent mr wing was going to town to collect a new television set for the village it was going to be connected to the net mr wing was something of a politician in his way he had applied for a national grant to set up a company to provide information services to the village swallow communications he called himself and the villagers said it would make him rich kwan mr wings wife was one of maes favourite women she was intelligent and sensible there was less dissembling with her mae enjoyed the drive mr wing parked the van in the market square as mae reached into the back for her hat she heard the publicaddress system the voice of the talent was squawking a tremendous advance for culture the talent said now the green valley is no farther from the centre of the world than paris singapore or tokyo mae sniffed hmm another choice on this fishing net of theirs wing stood outside the van ramrodstraight in his brownandtan town shirt i want to hear this he said smiling slightly taking nips of smoke from his cigarette kwan fanned the air your modern wires say that smoking is dangerous i wish you would follow all this news you hear sssh he insisted the bright female voice still enthused previously all such advances left the valley far behind because of wiring and machines this advance will be in the air we breathe this new thing will be like tv in your head all you need is the wires in the human mind kwan gathered up her things some nonsense or another she murmured next sunday there will be a test the test will happen in tokyo and singapore but also here in the valley at the same time what tokyo sees and hears we will see and hear tell everyone you know next sunday there will be a test there is no need for fear alarm or panic mae listened then there would certainly be a need for fear and panic if the address system said there was none what test what kind of test what what the women demanded of the husband mr wing played the relaxed superior male he chuckled hoho now you are interested yes another man looked up and grinned you should watch more tv he called he was selling radishes and shook them at the women kwan demanded what are they talking about they will be able to put tv in our heads said the husband smiling he looked down thinking perhaps wistfully of his own new venture there has been talk of nothing else on the tv for the last year but i didnt think it would happen all the old market was buzzing like flies on carrion as if it were still news to them two youths in strange puffy clothes spun on their heels and slapped each others palms in a gesture that mae had seen only once or twice before an old granny waved it all away and kept on accusing a dealer of short measures mae felt grave doubts tv in our heads i dont want tv in my head she thought of viper newsreaders and kung fu wing said its not just tv it is more than tv it is the whole world what does that mean it will be the net only in your head the fools and drunks in these parts know nothing about it it is a word they use to sound modern but you go to the cafes you see it the net is all things he began to falter explain how can one thing be all things there was a crowd of people gathering to listen everything is on it you will see on our new tv it will be a net tv kwans husband did not really know either the routine had been soured halat the hairdresser was in a very strange mood giggly chattery her teeth clicking together as if it were cold oh nonsense she said when mae went into her usual performance is this for a wedding for a feast no said mae it is for my special friend the little hussy put both hands either side of her mouth as if in awe oh uh are you going to do a special job for her or not mae demanded her eyes were able to say i see no one else in your shop oh how the girl would have loved to say i am very busy if you need something special come back tomorrow but money spoke halat slightly amended her tone of course for you i bring my friends to you regularly because you do such good work for them of course the child said it is all this news it makes me forget myself mae drew herself up and looked fierce forbidding in a word older her entire body said do not forget yourself again the way the child dug away at kwans hair with the long combhandle said back peasants the rest of the day did not go well mae felt tired distracted she made a terrible mistake and with nothing else to do accidentally took kwan to the place where she bought her lipsticks oh it is a treasure trove exclaimed kwan idiot thought mae to herself kwan was goodnatured and would not take advantage but if she talked there would be clients who would not take such a goodnatured attitude not to have been shown this themselves i do not take everyone here whispered mae hmm this is for special friends only kwan was goodnatured but very far from stupid mae remembered in school kwan had always been best at letters best at maths kwan was pasting on false eyelashes in a mirror and said very simply and quickly dont worry i wont tell anyone and that was far too simple and direct as if kwan were saying fashion expert we all know you she even looked around and smiled at mae and batted her nowhuge eyes as if mocking fashion itself not for you said mae the false eyelashes you dont need them the dealer wanted a sale why listen to her she asked kwan because thought mae i buy fifty riels worth of cosmetics from you a year my friend is right said kwan to the dealer the sad fact was that kwan was almost magazinebeautiful anyway except for her teeth and gums thank you for showing me this said kwan and touched maes arm thank you she said to the dealer having bought one lowly lipstick mae and the dealer glared at each other briefly ill go somewhere else next time mae promised herself the worst came last kwans ramrod husband was not a man for drinking he was in the promised cafe at the promised time sipping tea having had a haircut and a professional shave a young man called sloop a tribesman was with him sloop was a telephone engineer and thus a member of the aristocracy as far as mae was concerned he was going to wire up their new tv sloop said with a womans voice it will work like your mobile phone no cable we cant lay cable in our mountains but before mmn there was not enough space on the line for the tv he might as well have been talking english for all mae understood him mr wing maintained his cheerfulness come he said to the ladies i will show you what this is all about he went up to the communal tv and turned it on with an experts flourish up came not a movie or the local news but a screenful of other buttons you see you can choose what you want you can choose anything and he touched the screen up came the local talent still baring her perfect teeth she piped in a high enthusiastic voice that was meant to appeal to men and bright young things hello welcome to the airnet information service for too long the world has been divided into information haves and havenots she held up one hand towards the heavens of information and the other out towards the citizens of the green valley inviting them to consider themselves as havenots those in the developed world can use their tvs to find any information they need at any time they do this through the net incomprehension followed there were circles and squares linked by wires in diagrams then they jumped up into the sky into the air only the air was full of arcing lines the field they called it but it was nothing like a field in karzistani it was called the lightningflow compasspoint yearning field everywhere in the world then the lightning flow was shown striking peoples heads there have been many medical tests to show this is safe hitting people with lightning kwan asked in crooked amusement that does sound so safe doesnt it its only the formatting that uses the yearning field said sloop that happens only once it makes a complete map of minds and thats what exists in air and air happens in other dimensions what there are eleven dimensions he began and began to see the hopelessness of it they were left over after the big bang i know what will interest you ladies said her husband and with another flourish he touched the screen youll be able to have this in your heads whenever you want suddenly the screen was full of cream colour one of the capitals ladies spun on her high heel she was wearing the best of the nations fashion design she was one of the ladies in maes secret treasure book oh kwan breathed out oh mae look isnt she lovely this channel shows nothing but fashion said her husband all the time kwan exclaimed and looked back at mae in wonder for a moment she stared up at the screen her own face reflected over those of the models then thankfully she became kwan again doesnt that get boring her husband chuckled you can choose something else anything else it was happening very quickly and maes guts churned faster than her brain to certain knowledge kwan and her husband would be fine with all this look he said this is what twoways does you can buy the dress kwan shook her head in amazement then a voice said the price and kwan gasped again oh yes all i have to do is sell one of our four farms and i can have a dress like that i saw all that two years ago said mae it is too plain for the likes of us we want people to see everything kwans face went sad that is because we are poor back in the hills it was the common yearning the common forlorn knowledge sometimes it had to cease all the businessmaking you had to draw a breath because after all you had known your people for as long as you had lived mae said none of them are as beautiful as you are kwan it was true except for her teeth flatterytalk from a fashion expert kwan said lightly but she took maes hand her eyes yearned up at the screen as secret after secret was spilled like blood with all this in our heads kwan said to her husband we wont need your tv it was a busy week it was not only the six dresses for some reason there was much extra business on wednesday mae had a discreet morning call to make on tsang muhammed mae liked tsang she looked like a peach that was overripe round and soft to the touch and very slightly wrinkled everything about her was offkilter she was chinese with a religious karz husband who was ten years her senior he was a muslim who allowed or perhaps could not prevent his chinese wife keeping a pig the family pig was in the front room being fattened half the room was full of old shucks the beast looked lordly and pleased with itself tsangs fouryearold son sat tamely beside it feeding it the greener leaves as if the animal could not find them for itself is it all right to talk mae whispered her eyes going sideways towards the boy who is it mae mouthed tsang simply waggled a finger so it was someone they knew mae suspected it was kwans oldest boy luk luk was sixteen but he was kept in pressed white shirt and shorts like a baby the shorts only showed he had hair on his footballplayer calves his face was still round and soft and babylike but lately had been full of a new and different confusion tsang oh mae gasped sssh giggled tsang who was red as a radish as if either of them could be certain what the other one meant i need a repair job so it was someone younger almost certainly kwans handsome son well they have to be taught by someone whispered mae tsang simply dissolved into giggles she could hardly stop laughing i can do nothing for you you certainly dont need redder cheeks said mae tsang uttered a squawk of laughter there is nothing like it for a womans complexion mae pretended to put away the tools of her trade no i can effect no improvement certainly i cannot compete with the effects of a certain young man nothing nothing gasped tsang nothing like a good prick mae howled in mock outrage and tsang squealed and both squealed and pressed down their cheeks and shushed each other mae noted exactly which part of the cheeks were blushing so she would know where the colour should go later as mae painted tsang explained how she escaped her husbands view i tell him that i have to get fresh garbage for the pig whispered tsang so i go out with the empty bucket and come back with a full bucket mae said airily oh tsang pretended to hit her you are as bad as me what do you think i get up to in the city asked mae who arched an eyebrow lying love she realized later walking back down the track and clutching her cloth bag of secrets love is not mine she thought of the boys naked calves on thursday kwan wanted her teeth to be flossed this was new kwan had never been vain before this touched mae because it meant her friend was getting older or was it because she had seen the tv models with their impossible teeth how were real people supposed to have teeth like that kwans handsome son ducked as he entered wearing his shorts showing smooth full thighs and a secret swelling about his groin he ducked as he went out again guilty mae thought for certain it is him she laid kwans head back over a pillow with a towel under her should she not warn her friend to keep watch on her son which friend should she betray to herself she shook her head there was no possibility of choosing between them she could only keep silent just say if i hit a nerve mae said kwan had teeth like an old horse worn brown black her gums were scarred from a childhood disease and her teeth felt loose as mae rubbed the floss between them she had a neat little bag into which she flipped each strand after it was used it was maes job to talk kwan could not mae said she did not know how she would finish the dresses in time the girls mothers were never satisfied each wanted her daughter to have the best well the richest would have the best in the end because they bought the best cloth oh some of them had asked to pay for the fabric later as if mae could afford to buy cloth for six dresses without being paid they all think their fashion expert is a woman of wealth mae sometimes found the whole pretence funny kwans eyes crinkled into a smile but they were almost moist from pain it was hurting you should have told me your teeth were sore said mae and inspected the gums in the back they were raw if you were rich kwan you would have good teeth rich people keep their teeth and somehow keep them white not brown mae pulled stray hair out of kwans face i will have to pull some of them mae said quietly not today but soon kwan closed her mouth and swallowed i will be an old lady she said and managed a smile a granny with a thumping stick who always hides her mouth when she laughs both of them chuckled and thick glasses that make your eyes look like a fish kwan rested her hand on her friends arm do you remember years ago we would all get together and make little boats out of paper or shells and we would put candles in them and send them out on the ditches yes mae sat forward we dont do that anymore we dont wear pillows and a cummerbund anymore either there had once been a festival of wishes every year and the canals would be full of little glowing candles that floated for a while and then sank with a hiss we would always wish for love said mae remembering next morning mae mentioned the wish boats to her neighbour old mrs tung mae visited her nearly every day mrs tung had been her teacher during the flurry of what had passed for maes schooling she was ninety years old and spent her days turned towards the tiny loft window that looked out over the valley she was blind her eyes pale and unfocused she could see nothing through the window perhaps she breathed in the smell of the fields when mae reminded her about the boats of wishes mrs tung said and we would roast pumpkin seeds and the ones we didnt eat we would turn into jewelry do you remember that mrs tung was still beautiful at least in maes eyes mrs tungs face had grown even more delicate in extreme old age like the skeleton of a cat small and fine she gave an impression of great merriment by continually laughing at not very much she repeated herself i remember the day you first came to me she said before shens village school mrs tung had kept a nursery there in their courtyard i thought is that the girl whose father has been killed she is so pretty i remember you looking at all my dresses hanging on the line and you asked me which one i liked best mrs tung giggled oh yes and you said the butterflies blindness meant that she could only see the past we had tennis courts you know here in kizuldah did we mae pretended she had not heard that before oh yes oh yes when the chinese were here just before the communists came part of the chinese army was here and they built them we all played tennis in our school uniforms the chinese officers had supplied the tennis rackets the traces of the courts were broken and grassy where mr pin now ran his carrepair business oh they were all so handsome all the village girls were so in love mrs tung chuckled i remember i couldnt have been more than ten years old and one of them adopted me because he said i looked like his daughter he sent me a teddy bear after the war she chuckled and shook her head i was too old for teddy bears by then but i told everyone it meant we were getting married oh mrs tung shook her head at her foolishness i wish i had married him she confided feeling naughty she always said that mrs tung even now had the power to make mae feel calm and protected mrs tung had come from a family of educated people and once had had a house full of books the books had all been lost in a flood many years ago but mrs tung could still recite to mae the poems of the turks the karz or the chinese she had sat the child mae on her lap and rocked her she could recite now the same poems listen to the reed flute she began now how it tells a tale her old blind face swayed with the words the beginning of the mathnawi this noise of the reed is fire it is not the wind mae yearned oh i wish i remembered all those poems when she saw mrs tung she could visit the best of her childhood mae then visited the ozdemirs for a fitting the mother was called hatijah and her daughter was sezen hatijah was a shy slow little thing terrified of being overcharged by mae and of being underserved hatijahs low old stone house was tangy with the smells of burning charcoal sweat dung and the constantly stewing tea from behind the house came a continual agonized bleating from the family goat it needed milking the poor animals voice was going raw and harsh hatijah seemed not to hear it hatijah had four children and a skinny shiftless husband who probably had worms half of the main room was heaped up with corncobs the youngest of her babes wore only shirts and sat with their dirty naked bottoms on the corn oh this was a filthy house perhaps hatijah was a bit simple she offered mae roasted corn not with your childs wet shit on it thought mae but managed to be polite the daughter sezen stomped in barefoot for her fitting wearing the dress it was a shade of lemon yellow that seared the eyes sezen was a tough raunchy brute of a girl and kept rolling her eyes at everything at her nervous mother at maes efforts to make the yellow dress hang properly at anything either one of the adults said does will tomorrow sezens mother tried to begin yes thought mae with some bitterness tomorrow sezen will finally have to wash sezens bare feet were slashed with infected cuts what my mother means is sezen said will you make up my face sezen blinked her unkempt hair making her eyes itch yes of course said mae curtly to a younger person who was so forward what with all those other girls on the same day for someone as lowly as us the girls eyes were angry mae pulled in a breath no one can make you feel inferior without you agreeing with them first said mae it was something old mrs tung had once told mae when she herself was poor and famished for magic take off the dress mae said ill have to take it back for finishing sezen stepped out of it right there naked on the dirt floor hatijah did not chastise her but offered mae tea because she had refused the corn mae had to accept the tea at least that would be boiled hatijah scuttled off to the black kettle and her daughter leaned back in full insolence her supposedly virgin pubes plucked as bare as the babys bottom mae fussed with the dress folding it so she would have somewhere else to look the daughter just stared mae could take no more do you want people to see you go put something on i dont have anything else said sezen her other sisters had gone shopping in the town for graduation gifts they would have taken all the familys good dresses you mean you have nothing else you will deign to put on mae glanced at hatijah she really should not be having to do this womans work for her you have other clothes old clothes put them on the girl stared at her with even greater insolence mae lost her temper i do not work for pigs you have paid nothing so far for this dress if you stand there like that i will leave now and the dress will not be yours wear what you like to the graduation come to it naked like a whore for all i care sezen turned and slowly walked towards the side room hatijah the mother still squatted over the kettle boiling more water to dilute the stew of leaves she lived on tea and burnt corn that was more usually fed to cattle her cowseyes were averted untended the family goat still made noises like a howling baby mae sat and blew out air from stress this week she looked at hatijahs dress it was a patchwork assembly of her husbands old shirts beautifully stitched hatijah could sew mae could not with all these changes mae was going to have to find something else to do besides sketch photographs of dresses she had a sudden thought would you be interested in working for me mae asked hatijah looked fearful and pleased and said she would have to ask her husband in the end she agreed to do the finishing on three of the dresses everything is going to have to change thought mae as if to convince herself that night mae worked nearly to dawn on the other three dresses her noisy old sewing machine sat silent in the corner it was fine for rough work but not for finishing not for graduation dresses the bare electric light glared down at her like a headache as maes husband joe snored above them in the loft joes brother siao and his father snored too as they had done for twenty years in the morning they would scamper out to the water butt to wash holding towels over their yfronts mae looked into joes open mouth like a mystery when he was sixteen joe had been handsome in the context of the village wild and clever theyd been married a year when she first went to yeshibozkent with him where he worked between harvests building a house she saw the clever city man an acupuncturist who had money she saw her husband bullied made to look foolish asked questions for which he had no answer the acupuncturist made joe do the work again in yeshibozkent her handsome husband was a dolt here they were both of them now middleaged their son lung was a major in the army they had sent him to balshang he mailed mae parcels of orange skins for potpourri he sent cards and matches in picture boxes he had met some city girl lung would not be back their daughter ying had been pulled into lungs orbit she had gone to stay with him met trainee officers and eventually married one she lived in an army housing compound in a bungalow with a toilet at this hour of the morning mae could hear their little river rushing down the steep slope to the valley then a door slammed in the north end mae knew who it would be their muerain mr shenyalar he would be walking across the village to the mosque a dog started to bark at him mrs dohs by the bridge mae knew that kwan would be cradled in her husband s arms and that kwan was beautiful because she was an eloi tribeswoman all the eloi had fine features her husband wing did not mind and no one now mentioned it but mae could see kwan shiver now in her sleep kwan had dreams visions she had tribal blood and it made her shift at night as if she had another tribal life mae knew that kwans clean and noble athlete son would be breathing like a moist baby in his bed cradling his younger brother without seeing them mae could imagine the moon and clouds over their village the moon would be reflected shimmering on the water of the irrigation canals which had once borne their paper boats of wishes there would be old candles deep in the mud then the slow sad voice of their muerain began to sing even amplified his voice was deep and soft like pillows that allowed the unfaithful to sleep in the byres the lonely cows would be stirring the beasts would walk themselves to the village square for a lick of salt and then wait to be herded down to valley pastures in the evening they would walk themselves home mae heard the first clanking of a cowbell at that moment something came into the room something she did not want to see something dark and whole like a black dog with froth around its mouth that sat in her corner and would not go away nameless yet mae started sewing faster the dresses were finished on time all six each a different colour mae ran barefoot in her shift to deliver them the mothers bowed sleepily in greeting the daughters were hopping with anxiety like water on a skillet it all went well under banners the children stood together including kwans son luk sezen all ten children of the village all smiles all for a moment looking like an official poster of the future brave redcheeked with perfect teeth teacher shen read out each of their achievements sezen had none except in animal husbandry but she still collected her certificate to applause and then maes friend shen did something special he began to talk about a friend to all of the village who had spent more time on this ceremony than anyone else whose only aim was to bring a breath of beauty into this tiny village the seamstress who worked only to adorn other people he was talking about her one who was devoted to the daughters and mothers of rich and poor alike and who spread kindness and goodwill the whole village was applauding her under the white clouds the blue sky all were smiling at her someone kwan perhaps gave her a push from behind and she stumbled forward and her friend shen was holding out a certificate for her in our day mrs chungmaam he said there were no schools for the likes of us not after early childhood so this is a graduation certificate for you from all your friends it is in fashion studies there was applause mae tried to speak and found that only fluttering sounds came out and she saw the faces all in smiles ranged around her friends and enemies cousins and nonkin alike this is unexpected she finally said and they all chuckled she looked at the high school certificate surprised by the power it had surprised that she still cared about her lack of education she couldnt read it i do not do fashion as a student you know they knew well enough that she did it for money and how precariously she balanced things something stirred like the wind in the clouds after tomorrow you may not need a fashion expert after tomorrow everything changes they will give us tv in our heads all the knowledge we want we can talk to the president we can pretend to order cars from tokyo well all be experts she looked at her certificate handlettered so small mae found she was angry and her voice seemed to come from her belly an octave lower im sure that it is a good thing i am sure the people who do this think they do a good thing they worry about us like we were children her eyes were like two hearts pumping furiously we dont have time for tv or computers we face sun rain wind sickness and each other it is good that they want to help us she wanted to shake her certificate she wished it was one of them who had upended everything but how dare they how dare they call us havenots chapter the next morning was the day of the test mrs tung came calling on the arm of her grandson mr ken kuei granny tung exclaimed mae delighted and alert she was doing her laundry and the cauldron was huge and unsteady on the kitchen brazier mr ken gracefully passed his grandmother across to mae mrs tung was still in her robe and slippers hooting to herself like an owl i thought i would just pop in dear said old mrs tung it was a great adventure for her to go visiting she laughed at her daring as mae eased her onto a chair mr ken was a handsome orderly man i told my grandmother about your certificate and she wanted to see it oh it is nothing but please sit down mr ken mae wanted mr ken to sit she liked his calming influence i meant to visit you this morning with some graduation cakes please have some mr ken smiled and bowed slightly it would be delightful but my wife is doing the laundry and i said i would help her oh perhaps you could come and help me mae joked mae got no help mr ken bowed and left mrs tung ran her hands over the certificate with its frame and glass it shows how we all love you said old mrs tung read it for me dear mae could not read this was embarrassing she recited what she remembered it said to chung mae wang certificate of appreciation from the graduating class of for fashion studies mae had to stop something was swimming in her eyes there was an area out of focus i think i need glasses said mae the blur shifted changing size and shape like a slug maes fingers began to buzz mrs tungs head was cocked to one side do you hear something dear there was a flash as if someone had taken a photograph oh mae said and was thrown back onto a chair everything tingled her feet her hands even her eyes worst of all her brain tingled she could feel it dance the room went dim chocolate i smell chocolate cooed old mrs tung mae smelled wine perfume sweat onions rain on cobbles scorched rice old shoe leather colours danced in her eyes greenyellow redblue as if colour had become toffee to be stretched and mixed and there was music all kinds of music as if hundreds of radios were being played at once and a rearingup of screeching tinkling sounds like thousands of birds i dont feel well said old mrs tung she raised her hand to her forehead and for mae it seemed to open up in stages like a fan it must be this test of theirs said mae mae dear mrs tung said i need to get home and then mae had a sense of deja vu so strong that the words seemed to echo it was not as if she had been here once before it was as if she had always been here and would go on being here for ever it was as if an image of herself had been copied in layers off into eternity mae stood up but the room seemed to be stuffed full of sponges she had to fight her way forward giddy with sensation colours lights stars sounds smells maes hand touched a skillet or so she thought and she yelped and jumped back she felt silk on her cheek a baby kissed her toes her fingers were plunged into paddy mud mrs tung rose shuddering to her feet flies she said and began to wave her stick pork cheese tomatoes oak bark ginger all skittered about maes tongue all these flies old mrs tungs blind eyes looked wild im here granny said mae trying to sound calm she waded her way through sight and sound the world chattered screeched stank glittered rippled stroked soured sweetened burned the air seemed set solid against her mae had to push herself from one second into the next time was gluing shut mrs tung spun around ugh flies she stumbled and tottered sideways into the brazier granny tung everything was slow the cauldron rolled like a world making up its mind to fall a wash of boiling water poured over mrs tungs thighs and legs and the cauldron toppled against her ringing like a slow gong and knocking her off her feet mrs tung fell forward onto the ground and a steaming white sheet poured out with the chalky water and enveloped her clinging suddenly stillness mae panted for a moment she had the sensation of having been fired from a gun shot a great distance to somewhere else here she jumped forward and jostled the scalding sheet away from mrs tung the boiling water had settled into her earthen floor turning it into steaming mud hopping barefoot mae grabbed hold of mrs tungs arms and pulled the old woman howled the skin of mrs tungs hands was ruckedup and red like old tomatoes i will get your grandson mae said it seemed as if hundreds of versions of mae were speaking all at once and would be stuck saying the same thing for ever mae ran out into the courtyard a vortex of hens was running round and round in a perfect circle all the village dogs were barking their voices echoing from the amphitheatre of the surrounding hills in the far corner was a lump of what mae at first thought was mrs kens laundry in a heap mae ran towards mr kens kitchen something tickled the inside of her ear a mosquito go away mae tossed her head the buzzing returned more insistent and louder mae remembered that once a louse had got trapped inside her ear i dont need this now the noise mounted to a roar mae had to stop and she dug a finger in her ear to prise it loose the sound motorboated forward inside her head as if changing gears whining and roaring at the same time nothing for it but to push on the roar deafened mae it numbed her hands as she fumbled with the latch on mr kens door the ken family mr ken his mother his two little girls all sat around the table as if at a séance they all held hands and it seemed to mae because she could hear nothing that they were all chanting in unison mr ken rose up at the table and mouthed at her she began to make out what he was saying no need for fear and alarm mr ken mae began and the noise in her head rose to an allconsuming lions roar the two girls and old mrs ken waved her forward nodding join in they seemed to say they all stood up and worked their mouths like fish at her just listen to the words try talking along with them you will find that will help mae listened and the roaring seemed to narrow into something like a line of surf breaking along a beach she focused and there seemed to be voices like mermaids in the waves mae started to repeat them and they suddenly came clear imagine that your mind is a courtyard assign these words like livestock to a pen they are instructions they will be in that pen whenever you need them the roaring stopped mae sighed oh with relief mae nodded to indicate to ken that she got it try to see the courtyard you will find that you have a very clear picture of it in your head echoing after each word a great sigh rolled all around their house rising and falling with maes own voice everyone in the village was saying the same thing at once mae grabbed hold of mr kens forearm and started to pull can you see it there are four pens in the courtyard and they have signs over them can you see the signs can you read them mr ken cried mae your grandmother the words rocked the room like a ship at sea and mae was nearly thrown from her feet the unfocused motorboat sound roared again mae winced she rejoined the chanting of the choir the signs say help information airmail and thats entertainment mr ken looked quizzical mae signalled desperately towards her house she saw him remember granny he waved wildly to his mother and his daughter and then turned and ran with mae outside all the voices of the village tolled around them like a thousand calls to prayer we call the pens and things inside them the format the laundry in the corner of the courtyard had sat up mrs ken tui sat with her elbows pressed tightly over her ears mr ken moved towards her mae pulled him and signalled no no in here in here go to help when you need help using air info will tell you about everything from weather reports to whats available in the shops mae dragged mr ken into her kitchen on the floor granny tung lay with her back arched her hands claws of pain mr ken ran forward and slipped on the steaming mud floor airmail is where you go to send messages to other people anyone anywhere old mrs tung felt her grandsons hands she looked up her blind eyes staring her face smeared with trails of tears she quailed in a thin voice thats entertainment is full of air versions of your favourite films mr ken tried to pull her out of the steaming water he touched her and she howled with pain he winced and looked up at mae in horror lets rest for just a moment take some time to think about the format and in a few moments youll see what air really can do like the sound of a rockfall dying away everything went still there was the sound of wind moving in the courtyard was that it was it finished im so sorry mr ken she stood up and knocked the brazier anything to make a bandage mr ken asked all the sheets were boiling everything will still be hot he nodded i must see to my wife ill get a sheet he stood and left them mae knelt do you hear that mrs tung your grandson ken kuei is bringing bandages mrs tung seized maes hand mae winced at the ruined flesh i can see mrs tung whispered her blind eyes moved back and forth in unison blind mrs tung said she could see and something moved behind the curtain of the world the world had always been a curtain it seemed one drawn shut inside maes head now it parted oh god oh please said mae inshallah the village dogs began to howl again the world pulled back and suddenly mae stood in a blue courtyard everything was blue even her own glowing hands neon signs glowed over the livestock pens they were green red yellow and mauve and the flowing scripts were in the three languages of karzistan and mae knew as if in a dream what the words meant in air mae could read help info airmail the voice of air said perhaps you see the format more clearly now this is how air will look from now on this is an aircast an image we can send out to you it will be there whenever you need it lets see what an aircast looks like go into the area called thats entertainment mae mae said a voice far too closely far too intimate as if someone were whispering in her ear mae mae help today we have an aircast from national opera granny tung mae heard her own voice but she had not spoken the voice of air said we will see part of the opera turandot the opera is a favourite with audiences in the capital the whisper came again it was granny tung mae where is the world im trying to find you granny air said perhaps we like to think that the operas hero kalaf is karzistani mae raged i dont want to go to an opera i need to talk to granny tung immediately the sound of the opera dimmed a new calmer voice spoke to send messages go to the area called airmail mae shot forward she went through a blue wall and into it mae crashed into metaphor information swallowed her information was blue and she was lost in it mae mae do not attempt to send or receive airmail until you have configured your personal airmail address this is like putting your house name on your letterbox if mae had had a voice she would have shouted ive got no time this is an emergency for an emergency configuration simply repeat your own name several times mae said her own name over and over mae mrs tung seemed to cry out mae mae mae mae something seemed to go click it felt like a small electric shock something was connected immediately mae was seized hugged held in terror as if she were a strong tree in a flood can you feel it its pulling us back mae the voice of air slowed to a crawl your mailbox is configured time was stopping old mrs tung said one small forlorn unexpected word full of dread water time reversed everything the format the voices the whitewashed stone walls the people in them were sucked back in down it all collapsed and everything was gone the past is so very different we know it at once mae knew she was in the past because of the smells the wood beams stank of creosote the house had a stewed odour of bodies and tea and fermenting beanshoots she was in a house at night with no lights on the walls were in unexpected places a stairwell opened up underneath her feet a woman stumbled rolled down the steps and landed up to her knees in water my books someone thought all my beautiful books the woman stumbled to her feet tried to find a candle a candle fool in this she waded across the floor of her main room water lapping around her shins how much water is there where can it come from she reached out and touched a leather binding on the shelf and in that moment knew the books were lost she heard a laugh behind her and turned a womans voice said what is it worth now all the money you married the voice was rough and silky at the same time an old womans voice is it still coming in mrs tung screamed twisting around mrs tung was young supple and strong it is roaring down every slope hearing that voice mrs tungs heart sank with a sense of oppression overruling and contempt mrs tung waded her way through the flood are the children upstairs she demanded oh said the dark voice so now you remember you have children the voice was bitter triumphant and full of hatred mrs tung pushed past her feeling her old quilted overcoat the old woman laughed again a familiar hooting a slightly hollow laugh then from outside the house from the slopes above there came a spreading hiss and clatter like applause as if all the stones of the valley were rising in tribute lily ahmet mrs tung called in the dark to her children a thousand rolling pebbles clattered against the house like rain there was a boom and the house shuddered mrs tung mae tried to say the words went somewhere else lily mrs tung shouted again her voice breaking the house groaned and something made a snapping sound mrs tung bashed her head on a doorway heard a wailing in a corner she scooped up a child in thick pyjamas mae could feel the buttonup suit made of flannel smelling of damp dust where is your brother the child could only wail lily where is ahmet the child buried her head and screamed mae thought lily ahmet mrs tung had another family another family before the kens who mrs tung turned and begged the quilted coat mrs yuksel please have you seen ahmet has he gone down the stairs yes said the calm dark voice he went out the front door and the certain terrible knowledge ahmets grandmother did not want a halfchinese grandson you let him out the laugh you let him out to die carrying lily mrs tung thrust herself past her motherinlaw ahmet ahmet mrs tung wailed a whole broken heart she plunged down into her front room and into mud up to her waist the front room was choked with it the child in her arms kicked and screamed it was all mrs tung could do to shrug herself around turn and wrestle her way back towards the stairs as her foot struck the lowest step still under mud she felt a scurrying sensation round her knees water was flowing in over the top of the mud the water was still coming for them inexhaustible bearing lily she hauled herself up mrs tung mrs tung a voice was pleading her own voice if this voice was her voice then who was she mrs tung this is just a memory mrs tung what what this is all air mrs tung water she shouted back and rose out of the mud hatred swelled out of her heart she felt the wall of the staircase on the wall was a family sword so you will not inherit my beautiful room said the laugh mrs tung swung the sword the laugh was cut off mrs tung turned and ran into the upstairs corridor the wooden timbers creaked like a ship the entire house shuddered heaved and moved forward from its foundations it twisted and began to break apart she ran towards its end room the one with the beautiful window the one that looked back towards home to kizuldah she heard a great collapsing behind her felt timbers separate fall rumble like barrels somehow she kicked glass from the window lily screamed reflected in the roaring water was fire leaping along rooftops mrs tung jumped falling many feet out over the downside of the slope awash in a wake of water she fell through warm air down into a snowcold icy torrent everything pulled lily was pulled from her she slipped away like a scarf into the current mrs tung the water was blue mrs tung this is just a memory this is not really happening then why is the air warm why is the water cold can you feel water in memory mae held and pulled resisted the flood and the backwards pull somewhere dimly there was singing turandot was being performed three old men sung about their lost homes kiu tsiang honan there mrs tung we need to get back there from somewhere old mrs tung said it was real it was as real as now and as important my lily was real mae said we need to get home that was home that is real it all gets washed away i can die that means nothing but a whole universe dies every day slowly slowly it deserves remembrance here see it was beautiful beautiful dear mrs tung sssh see see life like a mountain huge cold fearsome ice with water wreathed in cloud and air and sunset too big too strange suddenly they were standing in a courtyard a courtyard at night mae said mrs tung that is the format why are there neon signs help entertainment i have done with all that i am too old in the corner there is a tv set when did we get a tv it is showing an opera i have never seen an opera it is the opera in balshang and i have always always wanted to see that oh the red and the gold and look at the jewels as they sing i have heard this on radio and dreamed there she is there she is the princess singing of a beautiful woman who died centuries ago in the opera a woman sang principessa loo ling my ancestress sweet and serene mrs tung mrs tung im afraid mrs tung i have to go then go child i have to get back you go on i will stay here mae pulled herself away and felt herself stretching held by someone elses thoughts she goes i always thought lily would be here to meet me instead it is mae faithful little mae who helps me across our flesh is earth and fire our desires and the fire burns through the flesh the water washes it all away and what is left is air and air rises towards heaven there was a sense of parting like a sprain mae was separated from mrs tung and standing in the format demanding in terror how do i get back air answered leaving airmail in the event of an emergency every message area has its own entry protocol which should prevent access to the full mind mae cried ive got access to the full mind it was cold inside mrs tung and the cold seemed to clasp and hold and freeze protocols can break down in the event of illness or extremes of emotion if you find your mind in contact with more than the airmail area of the person you are contacting first find your own airmail address concentrate on that area as if in meditation repeat your address like a mantra her address mae remembered mae mae mae mae something brushed past her darling child it seemed to say mae mae mae mae mae that was what mae was saying over and over when she woke up lying on the floor holding mrs tung mae knew then why the old woman had laughed through the last sixty years of her life it was not to keep up her spirits mrs tung had hooted all her life from heartbreak and the dear old creature was dead chapter mae was finding everything funny she lay in bed pushing herself into the corner of the alcove her face stretched into a grin she could not explain her family and friends were crowded around they knew mae had been inside mrs tung when she died maes mother sat beside the bed in state and that was funny allah her mother said calling on the god of the prophet with hands raised maes mother was a buddhist a terrible thing said maes brother jumei shaking his head he had put on his best city suit and long city coat for the occasion he sweated steaming for his respectability kwan passed mae tea and that was funny someone dies and so you make a cup of tea kwan intoned many people say that they did not find death so terrible mae laughed it was the soft hooting sound of heartbreak that was part of her now how can they say anything if theyre dead kwan said calmly sometimes the doctors bring them back isnt science wonderful mae chuckled did they ask the people if they wanted to come back maes mother cursed the devil it is shytan the work of shytan we will take care of you now promised maes brother heavyfaced that made mae laugh too more like you want me to go on taking care of you she thought mae remembered mr kens wife lying in the courtyard how is mrs ken tui mae asked everything went silent joe sitting at the kitchen table lifted up his baseball cap and scratched his head kwan answered tui is dead too maes brother leaned forward and took her hand kwan hesitated then spoke she ran out of the yard she was crying that she was going mad she threw herself down into the well mae squawked with laughter it was terrible but she did you all went to see an opera and meanwhile the rest of us lived one she was still chuckling when she asked the next question do they count the test as a success mr wing looked grim no he said mae found that funny too and chuckled again and waved her hand it would seem not she replied mr wing said they said that the process was proved physically safe but there were still many instances of panic and injury and no one can drink from their wells they are so stuffed with the bodies of neighbours mae laughed again and alarmed herself she was laughing too much mr wing kept doggedly informing her to calm her which only made things funnier they will not begin aircasting for another year so we have a year to live mae said there is to be an international program of education mae imitated the voices out of pure hilarious rage you all now have a pigpen inside your head and we do not know how to clean it up the pig is called terror you also have another area marked death please do not choose death you can choose terror and panic whenever you like there is also kwan said calmly a world of the spirit and you have travelled that mae stopped laughing abruptly the next morningmae tried to go back to work she tried once more to boil the clothes it took all morning she kept dropping things distracted she was aware that as a fashion expert she should look her best she put on a best dress but it wouldnt hang right as though it were on backwards she started to apply makeup in the mirror and burst into tears the face was alive but alone the brazier was moved outside the kitchen mae found herself standing outside in the courtyard with the long wooden laundry spoon still in her hand remembering she was remembering all the children who had run in that yard the girls in dirty flowered trousers the littlest boys in shorts the biggest lads in sweatshirts sports gear she saw them in waves coming and going she found herself remembering children like woo who had died caught in a thresher before mae was born mae was remembering what old mrs tung had seen she remembered a farming village owned by a landlord who the communists later killed she remembered his car all polished cream metal too large and fast for local roads it was pulled by oxen and the landlord waved from its back seat he was fat childish he gave little miss hu a bonbon hu ailing had been mrs tungs name once mae remembered weaving pots from reed she remembered women whose faces were almost familiar whose names she could almost recall and she heard them agree that it was best to be a middle wife first wives were supposed to lead and lived in fear of being usurped the youngest wife would always be the lowest in the house so how can you be a middle wife without being the youngest first someone asked mae remembered how to make cucumber pickles that would survive crisp and free from vinegar taste for three years she remembered bean harvests sitting in groups sorting good from bad shelling grilling drying pickling the women had worn quilted jackets no makeup and they all smoked chervil in their soapstone pipes they tried to get rid of teeth teeth just caused trouble and pain mae remembered the poems tis the fire of love that is in the reed it is the fervour of love that is in the wine mrs chung it was mr ken standing in front of her the reed is the comrade of everyone who has been parted from a friend his neatly trimmed hair his round face all seemed newly widowed and alone she saw his face as a boy as a grandmother would see it the face of the future now grown up now bereft now without her the chasm of the future into which we all fall and decline and disappear the hollow that is left in the world by our own missing shape oh she said and hugged him she wept into his shoulder mrs chung he said again and gingerly patted her back i have your grandmothers memories mae blurted it out all in a rush fearful terrified and she covered her mouth you had a blue plastic truck i remember that and you drove the family crazy making truck noises you wanted to be a truck driver her face was stained with tears she was shaken with the mystery and sadness of life why did you never become a truck driver ken kueis round and handsome face was slack unmanned by the sudden intimacy the question was a good one his grandmother had never asked it the farm he murmured the shrug said there was much more to be said he glanced about the courtyard mae was still in her morning robe come inside mrs chung he said and began to lead her do you want me to get joe i dont know she wanted mr ken she wanted to talk to him about his childhood she had a terribly strong sense of who he was she had held him as a baby she had known that even as a baby he was a reserve of quiet calm strength he never wept or wailed he could fight but only when he needed to he had been so good at football like ahmet had been all of this made her weep for what had gone as if kueis childhood was the distant shore of some beautiful retreating land for mrs tung taking care of the familys longawaited grandson had been the last time she was useful i was a skeleton for years said mae confused mr kens face was seriously worried for her your grandmother loved you said mae she was so sad when you went away he had managed to get her back into her own house i did not go away you grew up she accused him and started to weep we should come out of shells she said the shells should be the babies and the babies should be left behind alive for the mothers for the mothers to cradle stay here said mr ken and he ran and mae was left alone and she wept she wept for the village that had already died the old kizuldah you should be able to turn a corner and find home again with its undrained marshes in the valley floor the valley was left unploughed for the waterfowl the foxes the stars and young lovers oh mrs tung i was a friend of yours and still i did not know you i never came close after you had sat me on your knee and showed me pages of clothes and beautiful women even though i saw you every day still i did not know you i never asked you about japanese airplanes was it true that the landlord put poachers heads on spikes an answer came from somewhere yes you see no one believes that now people think it was just communist fairy tales we lose we lose so much the voice came back only everything it was as though old mrs tung had come in and sat down once there was a cold snap and i dropped a shirt from the laundry line and it broke and mae saw that world of rising with the dawn of bending all day jamming rice plants into mud in the morning you would hear all the men going off singing songs sing them for me said mae in her mind and stood up to work both of them sang old work songs that only mrs tung remembered simple songs about someone whose work trousers would not stay up or about the love of the porcupine for the wood louse she remembered jokes that the villagers had told jokes about moths who was so innocent now to joke about moths sole leather or candles mae hung up her laundry singing to herself in a loud rough peasant voice mrs chung asked a young voice mae turned and had to blink the round young face could have been from any era the s the s or the s the low rope collar of the dress told her what year it was this was one of saturdays graduates han an i came to thank you for my graduation dress you are welcome said mae and bowed an was the daughter of a woman who had been maes best friend when they were children they hardly saw each other now we heard that you were not well after the test mae shook her head no she was not well at all the young woman looked shaken we all thought that as fashion expert you would be most at home with the new things mae started to say what had happened and found she could not it was too complicated and too simple at the same time she could phrase it i am haunted by a ghost she could say i stole part of mrs tungs soul she could say i was in airmail when she died she could say i think airmail is a place all of it would be true and all of it false language like mrs tung herself was an old fragile footbridge breaking through mae stood with the wet sheets folded over her arm everything foxed her an saw this let me help you said an an had bought cakes of gratitude she passed these to mae to hold out of reach of mr kens dog and began to nip clothes pegs onto the sheets if i was still concerned about being fashion expert mae thought i would be alarmed i would be alarmed at this loss of status but i cannot be alarmed i cannot help it an led her back into her own kitchen she made mae tea mae unwrapped the cakes and she began to weep she wept copiously like a natural spring welling up out of the depths of the earth they were oldfashioned cakes cakes such as the villagers had baked for each other for hundreds of years beautiful little cakes made mostly from air old rice spare sugar preserved sweet things in tiny precious slices a story of hundreds of years of poverty and gratitude was told in those cakes it seemed to her that old mrs tung all her friends and her mothers friends all of the village women from the hard centuries had clustered around to receive that thankyou joe came home early with dr bauschu the county doctor you cannot work wife said joe heartsick as if she were a favourite machine that had broken she paused and contemplated what must be true my heart is too full she replied and suddenly she remembered him she saw him tiny mischievous in shorts the child joe she saw him as mrs tung saw him oh what an angel a beautiful merry little fellow in shorts running amongst the others chuckling and buffing them on the head still laughing when they cuffed him back he grew quickly and was too soon developed joe had ceased to learn there was little enough mischief in joe now or laughter oh husband what we have all lost what we will all go on losing through all of history it cannot be weighed it cannot be measured her handsome comic husband stood helpless scratching his head whoever had heard of a wife who could not work because she perceived the weight of history dr bauschu asked her to sit down and roll up her sleeve he was a hard thin man who circulated among half a dozen villages with a battered old black briefcase he had always been highly critical of the fashion expert she did too much massaging with oils too much dental flossing services on the borderline where beauty crossed into health he seemed quite pleased that she was ill so you see when illness really comes even you call for the doctor how unpleasant could he be i am in mourning fool for a whole way of life dr bauschu insisted on taking her temperature her pulse he prodded her for lumps and peered down her throat it is a nervous condition triggered by the trauma of that test otherwise there is nothing wrong i suggest a drawingoff of humours even mae knew that he had ceased to be scientific he heated her good glasses and set them on her lower back to suck and draw the doctor used to come every six months said mae sleepily in a white van with a red crescent we would all line up for treatment even if there were nothing wrong there always was something to cure a tooth or a cut or head lice the doctors glasses gleamed as he snapped shut his bag she was talking nonsense the fashion expert had fallen that night most of the village crowded into maes single room maes sisterinlaw mrs wang barracked around maes kitchen trying to brew tea by looking in all the wrong places scattering arrangements joes brother siao quietly followed her replacing things ten of the soongs who were connected to mae by various marriages crowded into her house she couldnt even think of some of their names maes mother exclaimed to old mrs soong it is gods will we have sinned and gone on sinning so god punishes us nonsense mother said mae god doesnt punish he doesnt reward he lets us get on with it her father was murdered said her desolate mother handkerchief gesturing towards mae as if that explained everything she lost her sister and her daughter all the family legends came out mae was too tired and harassed for them now wasted love was wearisome her handsome older sister missy who died maes elder daughter who also died why remind her of that now being with people feeling so ill reminded mae of the worst of her past she wanted everything gone she wanted sleep but they had all come to make her feel better teacher shen came looking solemn he brought his beautiful wife suloi in case anyone misunderstood his friendship with mae teacher shen mae said pleased to see him suloi had kwans face the face of their minority the eloi mrs shen was just as beautiful as kwan even now here she was merry mrs shen asked how is our fashion expert very confused mae replied i am more a history expert now she looked up at teacher shens face and lo remembered him as a skinny putupon little boy old mrs tung had worried so about him she had wished she had more books to give this solemn child you should have gone for that exam mae said sleepily to be a civil servant teacher shen blinked his face darted up towards kwan who nodded once downwards i could not afford the time or the books he said quietly so i took the teaching course remember the tiny white book about the rabbits mae murmured old mrs tung had found it for him a book of his very own his face was a wan smile his eyes unblinking he produced from his pack this one he said it was a tiny battered book stained by childhood and it said in the language of their people the tale of peter rabbit the teacher turned to others in the room about him and his staring eyes were filling its true he whispered to the room its true shens eloi wife edged closer to mae on her knees smiling she took maes other hand you have become a prophet she said in a very quiet voice of the past said mae what would it be like just once to have a moment to herself standing among her friends were sunni and her husband mr haseem he wanted this house the next day was mrs tungs funeral mae watched impassively as the cardboard coffin was lowered into the rocky ground the mosque looked small high on the hill its whitewash peeling the whole hillside looked peeling it was somewhat strange to see your own body buried to see people you did not really know daub their faces to know that you had lived so long that there was no one left to mourn you mrs tungs grandsons were grown men sad yes discomfited in suits one was a mechanic in yeshibozkent another drove buses they would be back to business by the afternoon mae was not in mourning for her mrs tung was not dead a body was only earth mrs tung was with her in air sunni haseem came to her and took maes hand i am so sorry said sunni conventionally why mae asked she led a full life sunni agreed and mae remembered mrs tung making love in the middle of battle in the marsh she remembered the tops of the reeds being cut down by bullets as mrs tung embraced mrs tungs young man leaned back and smiled and mae remembered that smile it was careless as if to say life is not worth having if its not worth losing and mae knew the boy was killed she died at an honourable age said sunni oh fashion wife with your little kitchen and lack of love what do you know about it what have you ever given for anything honourable mae repeated as if all mrs tung had done was darn tea towels she was a guerrilla she hid soldiers in the school kwan and joe came forward and took her arm lets get you back home kwan said mae stood her ground why do people treat the past as if it had lost a battle that the present won she demanded fists clenched why do they treat it as if it faded because it was weak joe looked baffled and distressed i dont know said kwan the past is real said mae its still here then maybe so is the future said kwan through those weeks into june mae slept late and long she grew plump through inactivity dreaming of ninety years worth of human voices children adults the barking of favourite dogs long since dead the sloshing of water on burntout canoes long since rotted away gradually she found she could make meals again do some tidyingup or sweep she managed to banish her sisterinlaw from her kitchen her husband joe began to look relieved his work clothes were ready again for him in the mornings and his breakfast of steamed noodles but mae would stand near her tiny kitchen window to catch a glimpse of mr ken her heart would go out to him with two young daughters late in life leaving for his fields in the earliest dawn long before her joe her heart would go out to him for the infant and small boy he had been and for his plump face thin waist and the quick nimble way he did things she kept thinking of old mrs tung in the reeds how the dress had come up the trousers down and how mrs tung had opened up to her lover fully completely loose and abandoned like a sail in the wind wanting him to fill her with babies nothing held back old mrs tung had known that prim and delicate as she may have looked the fashion expert had not for all her talk of beauty the lipsticks the oil in the hair the flower hairgrips they were all signals signals that said love me i have not been loved that was why they had power over her why she was drawn to them why she needed them she had wanted to festoon herself with flags saying come to me i cannot come to you now she simply wanted mr ken chapter it was night and mae was half asleep in bed when she heard joe comehome back from the teahouse joe hissed and giggled at his brother siao someone else was with them so where is the wife a man asked mae recognized the voice sunnis husband had come back with them joe murmured something polite and indistinct back at work in the fashion business joe chuckled something sunnis husband chuckled back good to be the man of the house again ah haha joe told his brother siao to fetch the whisky siao grumbled fed up with joe playing the older brother oh no the good stuff for mr haseem joe exclaimed in frustration a clink of glasses joe would be pinkfaced in the evening and redeyed in the morning joe was worst when drunk he simply became a sheepish goon why couldnt sunnis husband just come bearing good wishes and go because thought mae sunnis husband does not bear good wishes mae lay still and focused with her ears i can help said sunnis husband mae could almost hear the wallet unflap unfold she kicked her way free from the sheets and threw on a robe then she thought no that is not enough she needed to look like a fashion expert everything worked against her the dark and the slovenly disorder the alcove had become she tried to move quietly she wanted to appear suddenly in order pristine to say we do not need your help sunnisman sir how much joe exclaimed in wonder mae fumbled for her best dress in the dark her hand struck a hanger and she felt the dress the curtainfolds of the collar seemed to be right she hauled it on over her head and ran her fingers through the birdsnest tangle of her hair she patted the windowsill and found a hairgrip hands shaking with urgency she pulled her hair back as tightly as she could bear it and slipped on the grip everything felt lopsided her face the grip the dress hanging off one shoulder but straining around her belly shoes where were her shoes mr haseems voice drawled as if over a woman enough to clean up the old barn set up a byre buy a few goats ah haha dont joe fool thats how he does it he loans too much money and then takes the farm in payment sandals inappropriate with a best dress but anything now i feel like a haystack thought mae and pulled back her curtain with gracious slowness around her table sunnis husband was leaning back at home feet on a chair ricewhisky bottle opened and half empty wife called joe as if overjoyed to see her siao looked up in drunken dolefulness faysal haseem appraised her with narrow eyes and a grin we are honoured said sunnis husband pushing a whisky glass to her in her own kitchen you wear your best dress for us she couldnt find another joe thought this was very funny and laughed opening his mouth like a ducks bill mae said you are very kind to offer us help arent i said sunnisman and lifted up the glass he has already loaned us one hundred riels said joe oh said mae then you must give them back naw growled sunnis husband and sloshed the whisky around in his mouth one hundred riels wife a new barn goats we will be rich mr haseem is far too kind mae sat down trying to get her business brain to work she was not up to cunning but how will you pay him back husband oh we can come to some kind of arrangement said joe besotted foolish no problem about payments said sunnis husband not so drunk that his eyes did not fix on mae and twinkle with mischief if it comes to it you can pay out of your fashion business ah said joe in scorn we will not need that you do not have it said mae with a sick and weary chuckle could not joe see that mae had been ill through the spring fashion season we will have an ox two oxen said joe with a bit of swagger two oxen cannot pay back one hundred riels mae clasped her head to keep her brains together all she could do was play the game as if everything were above board so she asked straight out please mr haseem there is no way for us to pay the money back this is a very bad business proposition for you i think it is a good one he said redfaced knowing exactly what he was doing you will lose the money oh she had been a fool to try to dress why did she dress to show him they still had an extra source of money all the village knew now that was unlikely all her dressingup had done was delay her until it was too late so much for fashion i wont lose the money said sunnis husband will i joe certainly not said joe dazzled he unfolded the actual money in a fan joe you are drunk mae said in desperation she looked at siao who took light little puffs of his cigarette and gazed at his shoes he didnt like this either siao she pleaded tell him this is your fathers house tell him that we wont be able to pay back the money siao glanced up at her and rubbed his whole face once with his hand he had managed to grow a wispy beard and around his mouth were strings of muscle he flicked ash mr haseem has been very kind but weve all hit the bottle perhaps we should say thank you mr haseem and give our answer in the morning answer in the morning joe said a friend generously offers money and you insult him by saying we have to consider i am saying that perhaps mr haseem and ourselves will feel different in the morning siao said joe glanced sideways at mr haseem he needed to look like the boss of the house sometimes it is necessary to take a risk you never have done that siao you have never left home neither have you said siao quietly but i think perhaps soon you may have to mae spoke joe your brother is right wife this is between men mae turned mr haseem please my husband does not know what he is doing please take the money back there is no way we can pay you except to give you the farm she was being honest she was much reduced she had no weapons i think that is for your husband to say said mr haseem mae leaned forward mr haseem please dont take the farm please dont do this i am a friend of your wifes think of the friendship and please dont swallow us please i beg of you terror and confusion from the test hatred of what was happening overwhelmed her mae got down on her knees in the dust in her best white dress with the heartshaped patterns she abased herself please dont take our farm i think it is your wife who is drunk chuckled sunnis husband wife barked joe you are making a scene you are ill ill in the head he jabbed a finger at his own take the money back sobbed mae seizing it from joe and pushing it at mr haseem please it fell on the ground she cradled it up poison money and tried to push it at him again he took it rolled it neatly leaned across the table and put it into joes pocket patted it grunted and leaned back he looked content exactly as though he had eaten well so mae thought you have your loan and you even had me begging on my knees you know that i know and that i am helpless i should have denied you that at least i give nothing else away to you mae stood up and wiped her cheeks she had a blinding headache suddenly and the entire room seemed filthy dull and wearisome one hundred riels is not a bad price to pay for a farm she said it is good business mr haseem for you joe looked befuddled here husband she poured him another whisky it is best that you be merry now it is best that you forget she stroked his crisp slickedback hair then lightly batted it he took the glass with a hazy swagger the wife pours her man a drink that is right and proper behaviour mae slipped her hand into his pocket and took the money she counted it one hundred riels she said in acknowledgement to sunnis husband it is all there of course said mr haseem leaning back i am an honest man an honest man insisted joe and held up the glass the wife always keeps the money mae said folding the money into the collar of her best dress she thought i would not put it beyond you to steal it back from my husband while he drops off sunnis husband tipped his glass towards her in mock salute mae could not bear to see any more she left and pulled the curtain shut behind her but did not lie down she stood riveted to the spot by panic he has us he has us just like he got the others the loans the further loans the money that could not be paid the seizing of the house the lands this whole house is only worth three hundred riels our fields only bring in about a hundred we have to find a years extra income with interest mae thought of sunni mens business is it well it can be womens business as well now she could turn on the light the bare bulb glowed over sewing machine toiletries and heaps of cloth it showed her crumpled face bags and lines around the eyes a puffy mouth as if her husband beat her there was her comb she pulled it through her hair there was her lipstick she precisely placed it outlining the lips she wished she had she pinched her cheeks and found the right shoes and threw on a sweater she strode back out into the kitchen im going for a walk she announced and stalked out into the courtyard sunnis husband roared with laughter and saluted her walk well fashion expert mae walked across upper street then up the steep slope to mr haseems riverside house she knew that sunni would be awake bitter watchful mae pushed open the courtyard gate walked to the kitchen door ducked down and entered the kitchen light was on but sunni was not there best not to surprise her if she was not looking her best friend sunni she called it is just mae can i come to talk in fact sunni was ready for her mae knew that from the way the curtain snapped back on its rings the way sunnis hair and makeup were perfect but most of all from the way she stood straight and tall with her plump face set this is late for a social call sunni informed her indeed but i need your help indeed you have not been yourself lately said sunni standards have been allowed to slip mae knew then in her gut that this was pointless she knew in her gut what the situation was but at least later she would be able to say that she had asked are you going to ask me to sit down mae asked i do not intend to stay long as you say i have not been well lately sunni motioned for her to sit at the kitchen table not to enter her main rooms sunni chose to stand mae announced i will of course stay in the fashion business sunnis head inclined that is the first time i have heard you admit that it is a business it has always been couched before in terms of friendly advice and indeed much advice was given for free out of friendship said mae her voice was sad she felt sad and one can tell of course who ones friends are in adversity sunni sunni i know what you are but you are better than this sunni said nothing mae continued your husband of course is in the farmbuying business sunni was still unmoved all of this so far she would have been expecting she would have known that the loan would be offered sunni may even have tried to dissuade her husband but right now as far as she was concerned the decision had been taken sunni took her time to respond it is more clever than being a farmer it is the way to prosperity it is of course prosperity that pays for fashion your husband has got joe drunk and fired him up with wild imaginings and loaned him one hundred riels tuh more like your joe has got my husband drunk to loan you that much we cant pay sunni and you know as well as i do that that is how your husband gets rich and i am asking you as a friend to use your good offices to get your husband to take back the money now or indeed mae reached down into her dress to take the money back from me now yourself and plead our case with him and ask him to spare us mae held out the money printed so elaborately with the portrait of president kubla khan sunni seemed to falter in her resolve please sunni said mae and felt the weakness of the illness return as her voice shook near tears again otherwise we will lose everything this loan nonsense said sunni faltering it is mens business my husbands business i cannot interfere sunni he will destroy us i cannot help you she turned to go sunni if you were ever my friend mae stood to follow her unbidden into the rich mans house there were embroidered curtains embroidered cushions gold on green everything overstuffed the very room overstuffed a small farm room full of glass decanters snowstorm domes and a set of billiard balls without a table this is none of my business said sunni more fiercely now her arm was across her tummy as if she had cramps she suddenly spun and as for being friends you were a servant do you understand i bought your services your your advice your your fawning over me i purchased it and you know that sunni sunni you hate this you are made clumsy of course it was business we both knew that mae was growing annoyed but you cannot have a business without a relationship and ours was straightforward and good with no misunderstandings that can continue but only if this nonsense as you so rightly call it this nonsense over the loan is put to bed sunni looked cornered her head was shaking slightly no no no mae understood you are frightened of him what nonsense how dare you of course you are frightened of him i am frightened of him he is a brute sunni the two women stared at each other the money was between them mae looked at it considering its power but mae sighed he makes you rich that is why you married him and therefore you cannot question the way he makes his money as you say it pays for fashion she put it back into her dress sunnis face had crumpled her mouth working she wanted revenge now revenge for being so coldly clearly described fashion expert who will need you ah who will want your advice servant when your friend wings tv gives us all advice and better advice than you ever gave peasant farmers wife whore said mae coldly i will regret that she thought but i do not need to take insults now at least i am not a whore sunni sunni had no response to that at all mae turned and quickly walked away sunni started to bellow i was going to say something something to him to help you sunni followed mae into the kitchen i was but i will not now how dare you call me names friend you you do anything for money and you call me whore mae stood at the kitchen door save it sunni save it everything you have said about me is true and i am sorry you sold your life for this house i might have done the same and out into the night out under the stars and clouds that were eternal a moon that was nearly full what now she wondered dear god what now mae got back to find both her husband and sunnisman asleep at the table siao had climbed upstairs out mae said and shook mr haseem drunken man get out up out blearily mr haseem gazed up at her and grinned i know you she thought you are the strong man who rules by force you will have heads on spikes if we let you out of my house she said again and hit him hey he bellowed and looked for assistance at joe her useless husband was dead to the world too deadened even to help his enemy out out out was all she could think of saying raining blows about his head he began to chuckle he seemed to think it funny shewolf he chuckled oh yes that was it the image of the angry wife chastising her husbands drunken friends it enraged her still further to find herself cast in such an ancient role i am not throwing you out because you are drunk i am throwing you out because you are an enemy to us because you want to steal everything from us get out before i slice open your eyes mae grabbed her big kitchen knife he stopped laughing and jumped back away from the table she saw his eyes flicker and she seized the cleaver before he did i will kill you and then we do not have to pay you back the money i will kill you and spare the village a strongman she meant it she swiped the cleaver at him and he yelped and jumped back shouting hey madwoman the air has entered your head and hey i will she promised and came at him knife and cleaver flashing kill you her voice became a screech he ran for the door and seized his coat his thick tobaccoyellow fingers trembling face crossed in surprise fear confusion the world was suddenly upside down for him to be chased by a madwoman with knives one last gasp of surprise and he ducked out of the house mae chased him across the courtyard howling insults run dog run donkey go go go there was light on courtyard walls lights springing on throughout the village mr kens dog awakened began to bark she heard the sound of mr haseems feet outside the gates the flapping of his loose shoeheel other dogs began to bark all the village was awake all the village would know by morning what had happened mrs chung there in his underpants only was mr ken she began to sob she dropped the knives they clattered to the stone she hid her eyes in shame in fear how had things gone so far so quickly what is happening mr ken said he stood still looking at her aghast she didnt want him to think her mad she gathered herself in and explained mr haseem has loaned joe one hundred riels he got joe drunk and joe took the money mr ken knew what that meant ah he said we will never pay it back he will get our farm wont he take the money back mr ken shifted aware now of his nakedness she yearned to hold him that would comfort her that would stop the world spinning make everything stop no he doesnt want the money he wants us and our land he wants to make us slaves he wants to do the same to you too a pause a beat the lights were still on youd best go inside he said she felt frozen in place still shaking still helpless he knelt down to pick up her knives she saw how the top of his back swelled outwards to broad shoulders she saw the crease down the middle of his strong back where the spine was buried deep then he put an arm around her and in silence turned her not towards her house but his own sssh he said he guided her into his own kitchen he did not turn on the light very carefully her knives were placed on the table almost without a sound what are we doing here in the darkness each of us are we doing what i think we are doing my mother will be awake he said in a voice as quiet as water on reeds she smelled his breath sleepy garlicky but somehow not unpleasant it was old mrs tung who moved her old mrs tung who knew how to get what she wanted somehow her hands were on his shoulders then down his smooth broad back then his hands were on her breasts and her heart was thumping she could hardly breathe this was dangerous madness but she found she did not care one should not do this one should make men stand off and away but she had been doing that all her life and all she had to show for it was joe she must have tugged at him for suddenly his smooth upholstered chest seemed to surround her his thick bowed legs and his underpants loose but also now full with a small hard penis were pressed against her she was wearing no underpants such a tiny penis it would be inside her so quickly it could be done so quickly so simply as simply and as sweetly as a kiss she found herself pulling up her good white dress he kissed her she slipped down the last of his clothing and finally finally finally for the first time in her life she had it this was foolish he would despise her later but she had just tried to kill someone with knives and she no longer cared it was softly done it was quiet she felt his spasm felt something shoot against an inner wall then his forehead leaned against hers he had not left her body yet suddenly as if clubbed she was overwhelmed something clenched shook and moistened inside her she couldnt stop herself saying oh oh oh sssh he said and slipped out of her her dress fell down covering her he stepped out of his underwear and walked with her to the courtyard the village lights were off now the moon was still out he was blue and naked and she had never seen anything as beautiful they looked at each other what now both their faces seemed to say then they both smiled overwhelmed by the speed of what had happened let tomorrow take care of itself he nodded once meaning swift now hide now she turned and walked back into her house turned and looked at his dark and empty doorway she got back in and joe was still asleep you are not a bad man she thought you are just a bit of a fool and i do not want you the way i want mr ken she left him sleeping at the table she fell onto their disordered bed chapter in the morning joe had a hangover he would not stop moaning and holding his head mae was abrupt with him she took back his plate of cold uneaten breakfast youll have a headache longer than that youll have a headache all your life when you find yourself the slave of mr haseem joes eyes were fearful as well as pained we will have to make money we might as well buy goats and make cheese mae said we should spend none of it then all we have to do is earn back the interest the interest joe groaned and held his head we agreed no interest then we will say that and give him back just the hundred joe looked fearful he will say it was fifty per cent he always says that then you had best get to work she told him joe left looking guilty he left mae alone with all the terrors of adultery if joe looked guilty what was she the village did not forgive women who strayed they would say mr ken was a widower he had his needs but what had mae been thinking of you cant be a fallen woman and a fashion expert the husbands wont let you in the house the best she could hope for was that they would blame air so who buys fashion from a crazy woman with air in her head who chases men with knives what was she going to do well mae apart from anything else you have to make money all your life you have done that by staying ahead of the village you better get to that tv and find out what everyone has been watching on it with no more precise thought than that she stood up and walked out into the courtyard and in the courtyard mr ken was staggering with a wheelbarrow of mucked straw oh wonderful good morning mr kensir mae called brightly for the village to hear she walked more quickly to escape to her horror mr ken lowered the barrow and began to walk towards her with an expression of perplexed sincerity even solemnity at least this time he was fully dressed mae started to walk more quickly she wanted to avoid any chat in public places such as her house he began to smile slightly he walked faster he stood in the gateway of all the silly places there was still a hint of a smile in the creases of his mature face but he said the most direct thing do you regret last night no she said before realizing that she had spoken she wanted to escape do you want to go on mae felt something akin to panic she wanted him to stand out of the gate to keep his voice down he looked like both her husband and her son at once yes she said quickly so this was love ken kuei stood before her and she could scarcely bear to look at him she felt old and misshapen in comparison he was her boy her baby she saw in him the beauty and sadness of passing generations it was as though mr ken were a corridor into which she could shout and hear echoes resonate like sad voices into a lost past into lost chances no wonder she had never had love mae knew now that she had avoided it love hurt she had known inside that love would make her guts twist her eyes weep she wanted to be with ken kuei it hurt that she found no light and easy words with him it hurt that their situation was dreadful that they would have to slip and slide hide do it in corners like something dirty it hurt worse than childbirth worse than anything mr ken said i will see you when i can his jaw worked with something unsaid i do not want to cause you trouble mae cupped her forehead between her hands oh that is nice trouble what trouble could there be fucking another man than your husband all disaster loomed there i am a widower there will be no blame on me he said looking at the ground we have been talking long enough and too solemnly she murmured and mimed the pleased and neighbourly smile that kept distance mae raised her voice for the sake of the walls it is so sad about your wife i still feel for you she said if there is anything you need please ask my husband mr ken was still smiling theres no one to hear you she felt silly frightened but she couldnt help it she remembered the listening lights of the night before it will be no trouble just talk to joe she felt like weeping in panic when how he demanded i will leave my house tonight she whispered we can go out into the fields into the reeds three am that firm old light was in his eyes again he kept shifting in her vision between man and boy now he seemed older he nodded once good this will end well he promised her she shook her head with misgiving and left him and so she was reduced to being a young girl addled by love instead of money love catches up with you if you ignore it she thought she wanted to be with him now she wanted to suckle on his nipples as though they were breasts all these things shocked her overturned her she was upended like a boat i am bereft mae said she said it to old mrs tung she answered when i was in trouble i started a school mae walked on towards the television set and there were the men of the village at this hour of the morning watching kung fu there was joe i knew she exclaimed i knew i would find you here shiftless feckless man joe shifted his feet staring at them wincing with hangover and embarrassment you comic character she told him more in frustration sadness and affection than anything else young mr doh old mr doh mr ali they all chuckled too your wife is well again i see joe said young mr doh and a good hand with knives i hear too said old mr doh and they all laughed which meant that yes they all knew she had chased mr haseem out of her house did joe he kept grinning looking baffled mae needed the men to be away she needed the television what are we to do with you small boys mae said shaking her head ah you have families you have fields you have duties what are you doing here watching the movie shrugged joe more laughter joe you dolt she said simply quickly that made the men laugh again wifely humours young mr doh said it was a way of saying a woman was right he leaned forward and pushed some buttons okay ive saved the movie what time the men frowned and wobbled their heads they murmured times but old mr doh was something of a leader eight oclock he said with a flourish his son moved the hands of the clock to eight mae felt a stab of something icy in her chest they can do that go back to a movie the movie folded up like a picture and was dropped into a pink piggy bank mae thought mr doh knows how to do that and i dont the men stood up with a murmuring and an exchange of cigarettes they nodded goodbye to mae she was left standing alone in the courtyard the screen showed nothing but a door mae sat in front of the screen she touched the door it creaked it opened there were pictures with words underneath mae couldnt read on the screen was a picture of an hourglass with running sand like her life draining away and there were rows of pictures books and magnifying glasses and things that had no meaning for mae at all mae saw a drawing of a newsreader news would be good she touched the newsreader and up came a screen of words too many words too complicated it assumed so much this machine that you understood what the signs meant that you could read that you could guess what lay behind each door or each word her heart was sinking then she saw a picture of an ear touch the ear said a womans voice kwan behind her kwan was wearing a folded headdress the peasant dress of her ethnic minority she had never done that before she stood over mae go on she said mae did the tv replied you have chosen the talking option mae felt both relief and shame kwan knew the fashion expert found it difficult to read it is good you are learning said kwan suddenly relaxing it is good you are not afraid of it afraid well yes this was new stuff the tv kept talking the list of available topics is very long it is probably easier if you tell me what you want to know it was as if the television were inhabited by a ghost like old mrs tung fashion said mae and for some reason as if on impulse or from affection kwan had taken hold of the muscles between maes neck and shoulder and given them a squeeze so you are going to fight said kwan mae paused you know she sighed in this village there is nothing to do but talk mae was ashamed fearful and angry there is everything to do mae amazed herself again with the passion almost the frenzy that welled up inside her the village is like a goose without a head when the legs keep twitching the whole world has died and we have a year to learn how to live all over again she spun around to look at kwan kwan was blinking in surprise the television said in a honeyed voice you have a choice of looking at the paris spring collections the beijing festival of culture or the vogue channel i do not need to be beholden to that dog of a man now i need to be doing this pause kwan said once to the machine it whirred in place mae we could loan you the money to pay him back what is the interest joe was so drunk he did not even ask mae swayed under the weight of it all we would not charge interest murmured kwan mae felt many things all at once gratitude relief and wariness she feared that they would end up replacing one loan with another you and wing make yourselves rich the same way haseem does she thought only you are more polite though she loved kwan mae did not entirely trust her we would stand in an echoing corridor of loans mae said quietly that is true said kwan calmly but the offer will stay open if you need it thank you wingswife maam dont be silly said kwan for mae had addressed her as an employer mae sighed until we have money i am everyones servant she said the offer is kind and will be remembered paris she told the television show me paris i will leave you to it then said kwan she turned and walked away she has changed too thought mae we will all change so mae looked at the ghosts of paris and they were no help these were clothes that no human being could wear let alone farming women in the happy province the television talked and talked it explained why it was such a revolution that long flaps of cloth hung uselessly down to the knees from the shoulders or that someone called giannini had gone for splashes of colour mae already knew it is just a special way of talking it sounds grand but it offers nothing to actually do what she asked herself what actually am i trying to do i am trying to find something that will make me money i think if i spend more time at this machine then i can stay ahead of my clients find something to sell them but they are ahead of me paris fashion kept parading as if to say look peasant look what you cannot afford to even look at look at what your world could never have in it learn the lesson of your poverty and your distance and your unimportance she looked around two little village girls stood in kwans courtyard twisting in place with coy naughtiness who told you you could come to mrs wings house go on go away we want to watch the television one of them said determined to stay hopeful of being allowed to you should be in school mae said they said nothing but their eyes and smiles grew brighter a little boy ran up to them and stopped dead to see an adult by the television the girls burst into fits of naughty giggles then an kaihuis daughter sauntered in her eyes widened she bowed briefly towards mae children said an newly graduated you should be in school more giggles mae reached up to find some way to turn it off to hoard the fashion information how had young mr doh done it mae touched something and another screenful of words appeared main menu said the screen were they in a restaurant an said no no dont change it for my sake then she used a new word undo she said and they went back to the fashion show the sun kept rising the courtyard kept filling ans friend lingso walked in as well lingso said that she had preferred the singapore fashion show last week but then she said eastern couture suits our tastes better mae felt like she had swallowed an ice cube whole while she had been ill and wasting time all the village had been watching television mae felt a kind of hungry panic she had fallen so far behind in desperation she turned around what do the children want she asked she knew the answer kung fu she knew also that the children would run forward and push the button for themselves the children sat openmouthed as the kung fu hero met a man whom they all knew was a dragon in disguise the secret dragon breathed out fire for some reason he could fly with a sound like a sliding whistle even an and ling appeared to be content this confirmed maes suspicion that people would watch anything so long as it was on tv mae didnt watch she sat thinking over and over what do i do what can i do at high noon mr shen arrived from the school he was shaking with rage all of you back into class all of you what are you doing when you should be at your lessons he cuffed the boys about the head they ran off giggling mr shen glared at mae you have let this sickness take you over mae was shocked to have teacher shen of all people be angry with her i was trying to use it for information she began her voice sounded weak even to her oh yes it looks like it hong kong indulgence this whole country is sinking into it he spun on his heel and marched to the television set he pulled out its plug in a fury he pulled at the plug until by adrenaline strength he succeeded in hauling the wires free from their screws there he said shaking the naked wires at mae then he walked away taking the plug with him he stopped at the foot of the stone staircase leading up to the wing house mrs wingmaam shen shouted i have taken the liberty of turning off your machine perhaps i can advise you to keep it inside your house and away from my students the children were gone still giggling like laughing leaves blown in the wind shen marched off through the dust without a further word to mae she looked up and saw kwan already descending the stairs to the courtyard she had a screwdriver and a replacement plug the village was a boat that had come free from its anchor mae shook her head an was elegantly scornful hes scared because he is teacher and he knows nothing about all this tub my parents pretend nothing has happened said lingso even more beautifully turning away her lipstick was perfect kwan knelt beside the tv quietly replacing the plug why dont you take it inside mae asked because we want the village to have it said kwan still kneeling at least now we can look at fashion in peace said an on came paris again kwan walked back up the stairs to her laundry or her sweeping the paris show ended and the two girls changed to the vogue channel more ghosts in silver fabric and mae found that she had nothing to say that was any different from what the two girls said finally when a shadow had crept across the wall and touched the screen it was like a sorrowful spell quietly she bid the girls farewell young poised beautiful they could read they had no dinners to cook this new world was theirs when mae got home joe was waiting with mr haseem joe did not look like a dolt now he looked very upright and angry you will apologize to mr haseem he demanded mr haseems face seemed to be made of old porridge heavy dour unmoving and he looked without blinking at mae she looked back she calculated quickly knowing what had happened someone had told joe about the attack and honest joe moral joe was appalled he had no understanding that sometimes morality was not enough there was one quick way out im very sorry mr haseem mae said coolly i have not been myself lately joe nodded once abruptly quite right and proper the nod said to chase a guest with knives from our house joe murmured you have to cling to something if all the world is changing joe clung to rules he was stiff formal but dignified maes heart wanted to break for him he just did not understand mr haseemsir said joe please accept an invitation to dinner haseem was as slow as a frog on a lilypad with its sticky tongue curled up waiting to lunge i am afraid mr chungsir that my wife would not consent she is too upset by the events of last night oh said joe in shock he turned and glared at his wife things were said to her that cannot be easily forgiven mr haseem pressed his advantage i accept the apology for your good sake mr chung i have to say that nothing in your wifes manner makes me think her apology is genuine he was trying to enlist joe force more out of her no thought mae you will not humiliate me further mae said it was genuine enough mr haseemsir when i got down to you on my knees and begged you to take back the money if you are so insulted perhaps you will withdraw your generous loan she held out the money again sunnisman leapt to his feet really this is too much you let your wife drive you joe she has no place in interfering with our business you and i are friends but i want no dealings with her thats because thought mae i am a match for you any further business will be conducted in my house she is not welcome there mr haseem stalked out joe blinked at her in fury speechless he was not used to scenes of any sort least of all in his own kitchen mae felt detached it was strange the mix of feelings she thought of joe in a kindly distanced way it was part of the beauty of their way of life that he should be so small so constrained and so insistent on good behaviour that way of life was dead what is the interest rate mae asked joe in a small clear voice what he clamped a hand on his forehead his head shook in disbelief do you care only for money she stayed in the same mode still and cool is anything in writing yes he said fiercely proudly thinking see how businesslike i am her heart sank for him so i ask again what is the interest rate two per cent he said with a diagonal jerk of the head that seemed to say see how unfounded were your fears a month she asked he blinked at her poor joe that means that in a years time we not only have to pay him back the hundred but also find a further twentyfour riels a quarter of a years income and that is only if he does not compound it monthly she let the roll of notes fall like leaves onto the table there is your money joe i suggest that you do not spend one riel of it it will be hard enough for us to find the extra twentyfour she turned and began to cook supper the blackened pot the single electric ring she looked at him and he was looking at the money make no mistake joe i will not work for mr haseem her voice was cool with promise she cooked joe drank come darkness come three am she prayed in the courtyard of the wings great house kwan had an air of someone cleaning up after the party collecting cigarette butts kung fu mae asked ruefully oh sighed kwan you begin to regret your generosity said mae i begin to regret that people do not get bored said kwan and slumped on a chair i know i know said mae her eyes going hard like boiled eggs in agreement i am bored kwan looked around questioning is there anything on that thing other than fashion and kung fu junk for women junk for men ask it said kwan but ask it for what ah said kwan that is the question when you are an ignorant peasant you do not even know what to ask maes mind danced in the format like a moth around an electric light search she told the television the tv replied please tell me which word or keywords eloi mae said the name of kwans national minority kwan sat up with a sharp intake of breath ah that does not bore you tonight thought mae i am as sharp as a knife the tv asked what aspect of the eloi interests you kwan intervened history politics the tv whirred to itself the tv said we have found sixteen listings whose main subject is the history or politics of the eloi minority kwans face softened i thought there would be nothing fourteen of these listings are held in our professional or academic files if you are a professional or academic subscriber say yes say no if you are not a subscriber to get the good listings you had to pay to pay you had to have something called a clever card which established that you were believable kwan said that she was a director of swallow communications were sorry your account covers a range of popular entertainment and documentary options but full text searches must be paid for by corporate subscription please say yes if you want to subscribe and have your clever card ready mae asked whats a clever card kwan looked worn you have to go to the bank you have to have a passport you have to have money more than we have but you pay the government pays kwan sighed not enough for that well have the two free listings the first offering was the official karzistani government files it gave a picture of a happy modern people a model spun around in traditional garb fashion exclaimed mae and began to laugh the model was a balshang beauty all beijingstyled angular elegance face composted with layers of paint and powder mae suddenly thought she had never seen anything as funny traditional eloi woman mae gasped for breath fresh from mucking out stable and making shitcakes for the fire kwan stood still and icy there was a government video of a modernday eloi relocated to balshang apartments the woman was plainly of eloi stock but was drab in a loose white shirt blue trousers and an awkward headscarf to appease the citys muslims she proudly showed her new toilet her new icebox mae could not help but laugh again the boldness of it not one mountain not one pony not one terraced field not one dirty hungry child not one destroyed buddhist temple oh everything was modern about the eloi hmm said mae they call it information that does not make it true kwan paused for a moment then suddenly looked around do you have a lover she asked maes heart stopped how do you mean when a woman gets bold and heedless as if she had gone through a door when she gets harder cynical and brighter well and mae knew something too do you have a lover then mae thought of the beautiful kwan and her older husband long ago said kwan and tapped the screen to select the next article who asked mae edging forward kwan looked back who is yours she asked yours was long ago and does not matter the past is dead the next free offering was in german from a museum it was about some show or exhibition in berlin that was long since closed kwan scrolled down a menu hoping to find something else he was an eloi shepherd high in the hills she said mae was fascinated oh was he beautiful eloi men could be beautiful like their women some of them had tattoos like stockings on their bare smooth legs and bracelets and wild stallionmanes of hair he was to me said kwan she looked old under the harsh yellow light old but in a good way handsome lined smiling with endurance he was blind in one eye what happened the usual things said kwan amused with a bit of a swagger no i mean the end kwans endurance was even more rocklike he said i was too chinese she shrugged he was right i stayed with wing she sighed with concern be careful mae oh i have been careful all my life do not tell me to be careful its not sunnisman is it ah squawked mae and pretended to spit i had to ask chasing a man with knives it could mean it meant i really wanted to kill him that bastard he wants to take everything everyone laughed said kwan did they it was not funny at the time i tell you old sunnisman knew i was mad and he went running kwan started talking like a talent our fashion expert all delicate femininity the sweetness of flowers the wistfulness of morning mist the gentleness of the butterfly kwan shook her head chasing the headman with cleavers mae suddenly understood it was funny this year all village fashion experts will wear an adornment of knives we see kizuldah beauty mrs chung in a necklace of real murder weapons used on friends of drunken husband note the subtle arrangement of cleavers about the shoulders kwan smirked in mild amusement and then said so who is he mine is not yet in the past said mae mmmhmm said kwan she thought she had guessed who it was mae gave her a slap on the back of the arm you be careful you know nothing i am saying nothing replied kwan the voice droned on in a language they could not speak the advertisement showed rare photographs of the eloi they looked as if they had been taken one hundred years before they were as alien to modernday eloi as the propaganda video had been alien faces stained with dirt with tense lines of muscle around the chin and cheeks they wore headdresses and boots that were wrappings of animal hides these worn people stared accusingly out of the screen from the past oh allah be praised said mae shaking her head feeling disappointment for kwans sake there is nothing in between said kwan her head shaking quickly from side to side we are either like angels descending at the end of an old pageant all costume or we are refrigerators for the karz their choices came to an end that was it kwan was hardfaced save she said print the tv buzzed as if it were sewing something a tongue of paper began to emerge mae saw letters stick out and then the top of an eloi head it prints she said almost in despair kwan nodded in the west children make screens for this thing they do all their business on it you can even make movies for aircasting on this thing that knob on top is a camera in america children make air music out of their own heads and then share it they call it kolab oh we are so far behind said mae we live in a different world said kwan sometimes i think we can never catch up now with air they will be ready and we will not be we will be like children wandering around lost kwan pulled out her sheet of paper it was all laid out with information about her people that she had not written suddenly she snapped to im going to bed she announced you be good finally mae was left alone with the screen money she asked it there were offerings of books she could buy or courses she could pay to take there was a course in how to have a bank account offered by the balshang older citizens institute someone in a place called mi wok ee was offering loans the text came up and the tv read it for her but much of it made no sense suddenly there was an avalanche loans courses how to get rich quick many windows all at once on the screen all babbling one window on top of another cutting off the other voice before it had finished stop said mae nothing happened say yes if you want to ring this telephone number to have personal ontv counselling on making money please have your clever card or believability card ready calls cost two dollars a minute buy this book join this bank just say yes no no no no mae kept saying they crowded round like wasps on shit one little window sliding on top of another one a little babbling voice talking over the last stop temporarily overloaded replied the tv and suddenly went dark one little voice spoke from the darkness thank you for using our helpful librarian tool from time to time searches on this free service will result in paidfor responses arriving according to your interest in the silence mae felt her heart thumping that was it that was the great online world the net that mr wing had talked so long and hard about that he had yearned for fought for no wonder no wonder they wanted to replace it maes eyes swelled with disappointment and anger what use was it to them this thing it was just a way to sell them things to take money from poor people what use was it if you had no money no banks no way to get clever cards or believability maybe shen was right all it did was show us worlds we could never join we just sit and watch and get soft and fat and bored and talk about singapore fashion as if we could ever take part we push our noses against the window and watch other people eat off said mae and the tv went as still and ominous as black thunderclouds so what was she to do now mae plunged her fingers into her hair her hair was greasy and needed washing she had missed a fashion season she had to find an extra twentyfour riels for the loan so what did she have make a list mae she listed house three rice terraces no orders for dresses she had mrs tungs memories she had sickness debts and an idle husband his hardworking brother his aging father she had her own interfering brother and her overwhelmed mother if she went to them for help they would try to take over she had kwans offer would it be so bad owing kwan money she had air she had been inside air deeper than anyone else so what was in air all right she closed her eyes and tried to find her way back in air she said nothing happened she tried to think her way back to the courtyard she remembered it but could not see it she did begin to discern something dimly an extra weight in her head like a load to be carried she felt it and tried to describe it to herself unlike a headache it didnt disappear when described instead it focused if anything air felt like a turnip in the rice sometimes a tuber grew you would pull on what you thought was a weed but it wouldnt budge so you would reach deep down into the mud and follow the root to pull it free and there numb dumb but salvageable there would be something you could use you just had to haul it out mae seemed to trace this root with her mind deeper and deeper but it was held fast mired it would not move it was as if it were rooted by an entire planet rather than its blanket of earth and then mae remembered something she had an address and the address was her name mae mae mae mae mae mae she felt a gentle settling it was as if she were dust or feathers in the air during cleaning day she seemed to swirl in the sunlight like stars and then to fall gently down she settled gently slowly into place it was rather calming she felt a wide smile spread across her face the loan the money the house her husband mr haseem all seemed to fall back up away into a world that was full of light and dust and settling it was as if she were finally finally going to her bed after a long day in the fields when your shoulders are sore and knees are full of needles you settle not so much onto the bed as into yourself more and more of mae fell into place gradually enough of her came together to look up and around mae seemed to stand in the courtyard welcome a voice said you dont have any airmail messages the stones were blue as if in moonlight they were made of dust too mae could waft up to and then through them they were just pictures as on a screen did the tv make images out of dust she asked for info air spoke to her in the voice and accent of her people right now we have nothing new we just have some things to show how air works you can have a look at some of those the voice was like her own this is me talking okay i want to find out about making money okay but this is the first time youve done this a lot of things we have here are like movies they are very familiar because they are made to work like movies this wont be like that this will be as if you grew someone else in your head this will be as if you become someone different if you dont like it just say your address okay said mae oh no wait does this need my address to work airmail and all services but air movies need your address to work am i the only one in the village with an address there was a buzzing for the first time mae felt that her brain was made of something she could feel the ends of it sparkle and fizz like it was the edge of a tapestry before the ends were tied air said old mrs tung is the only other person with an address do you still feel like accessing our money expert somewhere else where she was huge like the moon mae nodded her head yes that was enough for air this courtyard mae thought it is my own courtyard something she could not turn into a voice came at her it was dim like talking on her mobile when there was a bad connection there were no words but she somehow understood that understanding suddenly ballooned out yes they want to help poor people and they want to demonstrate this thing so they needed me it was as if she had another mrs tung it was not quite a whole person it rattled too quickly and seemed to go a bit in circles it was a part of person an attitude to something it was a thousand things that person knew matted together like a rug so of course i said yes money what do you want to know mae could almost see it a tiny little overcoming spirit so sure of itself so amused and so in love with money and business and investments and trust funds trust funds suddenly sure secure and certain mae had knowledge of trust funds it was not booklearning it was knowledge like riding a bicycle or how to walk across the spring floodplain by stepping on the tufts of reed thebanks hold your money and pay you so that they can use it stop stop i want to sell people something new well then you better find out what they want one way is to do a koeh so tong ah a question map mae saw one all lines of writing on paper in english someone elses memories you find people who are like the people you want to know about normally thats so tough you need scientists to help you but in this case you can actually ask all the people thats a one hundred per cent sample just make sure you really have got them all mae saw a series of black balls in a column this was a list a way of remembering called dos and donts she saw a name too and knew it was the name of the person in her head and she caught a word this was kru kru in her own language meant a great teacher this was a kru word for something she couldnt pronounce but which got turned into mat unrolling in karzistani mat unrolling is what a trader did in the square they unrolled a mat laid out their radishes mae liked that it sounded real dont ask leading questions and that means a question that puts an idea into peoples heads that they might not have had dont ask questions that can be answered yes or no ask the same question two or three times in different ways to see if you get the same answers hold hold how can i remember this the flow of knowledge stumbled who said that someone somewhere seemed to ask the overcoming spirit was frightened whats in my head it seemed to ask nothing nothing said mae and went still and small she started thinking in this new train again how it rattled along this train of thought knowledge came intimately as if it were her own the thoughts felt close and personal the thing was eager to share it felt its life had been vindicated by doing this one great thing mae began to see a tiny old white man with bright and shining eyes so they are somehow able to copy krus give us krus in our heads this kru was a great and good mat unrolling kru so great and good that he could afford to give his head for nothing he gives his wisdom as from heaven to help because he feels pity there is a word for that bodhisattva so where else would you expect to find an emanation of the buddha but in heaven but never never would you expect the great gift of wisdom to enter you as if from a balloon in reverse as if the balloon was pumping you up filling you with air this was a very great gift indeed mae felt her wide grin and she felt her solid body press both hands together in respect and she also had one wicked thought i have an address no one else in kizuldah does mae sat under another desert mountain sky she sat with hands kept pressed in respect and learned all she could about question maps and unrolling her mat the stars turned slowly mae grew tired before that bright enduring unchanging mind somewhere her giant body dipped in respectful farewell maes spirit went back the way she had come she recited mae mae mae mae mae she felt a wind blow and scatter her and spin her she seemed to spin dancing back into the solid world mae found herself sitting next to the dead and useless mechanical box her eyes were wide and streaming with water as if she were weeping from joy she had not blinked all the time she was in air and she stood up and she strode forward and she knew what she would do she would make a question map and ask all the women in the village what they wanted and that would be what she would make and she would be one with the kru to understand how the magic of money really worked for it seemed clear now that money had come from the gods was an aspect of them until it had been stolen by kings and presidents coins should bear the image of the buddha and she would go back and learn more if the net were all about greed and gouging then she would learn how to use it to unroll her mat she would be among the ones who won in this life through work and virtue air was new air was strong air would bear her up she felt the long root go back and she knew now she was rooted in the world but the world was in rooted in air chapter mae walked back down lower street just before three am she was looking down at her feet in the moonlight to avoid stumbling on the old cobbles something happened inside her eyes it seemed as if the surface of the road swelled up flickering she felt herself swell grow larger but more diffuse as mist suddenly the road was paved with yellow light reflected from its smooth asphalt surface mae looked up to see a street lamp towering over lower street on a high concrete pole when had there been a streetlight on lower street or a concrete pole mae looked around and saw the town spilling down the hillside like a necklace all strings and spangles of light below in the valley where once there had been a marsh a neon sign glowed hotel nearness it said next to it was some kind of shop blazing out blue fluorescent light over its own whitewashed wall and the road a bright red awning hid the things in its window children yelled somewhere running children stayed in the village these days why leave all the world was here now because of air the children stayed mae saw her greatgrandchildren every day where am i where is this the air smelled of car exhaust and was full of noise televisions backfiring cars and an ambulance siren mae was old and irritated by a bad back and she was thinking this is where it was this is where my house once stood my house with joe climbing up this steep hill had cost her she had fallen months before and her back was still not right she still tried to walk in a sprightly way though crumpled stiff and sore it was here old mae thought here that we met here it all happened here i was reborn a wind rose carrying with it the sound of blown reeds the wind seemed to lift mae up with it mr ken stood waiting in the courtyard gate and the old woman saw mr ken to her he was a ghost from the past old mae choked put a hand to her mouth everything heart eyes gorge seemed to swell with panic and love there he was her mr ken he wore a sweatshirt she remembered it now clear as day and his good trousers with the spandex band instead of a belt the wind blew stronger the sense of panic and loss were taken with it along with the streetlights and mae collapsed not like dust settling but like a house of cards all at once and it seemed she pulled the world with her it had all fallen back into place as she knew it what mae thought what was that she clamped a hand to her forehead it was a gust of madness air thought mae air goes into the future as well she looked about her there was no hotel nearness the hills were dark the rural streets were silent maybe she thought maybe i should not go into air too often mr ken put a hand to his lips and paused questioning to give her a chance to refuse maes response was simply to walk towards the valley he followed there were no listening lights at three in the morning the wind in the reeds was like the sound of a waterfall like everything tumbling out of her head they walked in silence just outside the village in the sound of the wind he felt safe to speak i thought you might not come he said your house was dark where have you been in the future she heard herself say she thought and then confirmed it ive been into the future watching television mae felt distant maybe she was just tired she shook her head she didnt want him to talk she wanted to listen to the world the wind and the moon she could hear the moon move through clouds mae what do you mean she was not looking at him she was looking up away kizuldah will become just like everywhere else we will have stores and streetlights and parking lots she turned and looked back at the darkened silent silhouettes of houses and already regretted it mourned her village his handsome face was crossed with concern you are a husband inside mae thought kind decent capable of love so why was she not responding im very sleepy she said as an excuse as a lie as the truth mae was feeling suddenly contrary he took her hand are you worried he asked his eyes were searching her face for something the woman who had a lover and brandished knives suddenly unsheathed herself what do you think of when you remember tui she demanded his head hung for a moment she was my wife he struggled she was always frail she did not like the rolling of his hand somehow indicated sex it made her shake i thought that was love but later i knew it was fear i dont know what frightened her mae sighed she was always a frightened little thing we used to pick on her it was not right but we said she had fleas i remember he said in soft surprise had he really forgotten that you never teased her you were always a good boy said mae it was not said entirely with respect but then it is difficult to be bad when your grandmother runs the school i remember the things you would make mr ken said my grandmother would sometimes show them to me specially i thought they were beautiful what things she said people always talked about the things mae made as a child it meant they didnt have to say you were slow at your letters mr ken said you would find old shells and make a necklace once you made peas in their shells out of library paste i thought they were wonderful grandmother tried to bake them to save them and they broke remember mae began to understand he was saying he had wanted her even in those days and had not spoken the truth was that she had not much noticed him back then when had ken kuei gone from the quiet staring boy to the broadshouldered handsome man joe had been the one when they were young joe was like a knifeblade young and sharp the rebel maybe he had been the fashion expert then you married very young ken kuei said he was trying to say that he had been screwing up his courage when the announcement of their wedding had come mae said you should have been quicker i know he said quietly he stopped do you want to do this he asked mae shrugged i am here you dont seem happy happy whoever said life would be happy his wife had just killed herself no im not i never am she said her fingers digging into her hair you will have to get used to that they stepped down off a bank down into reeds she tried to feel anything at all maybe she was just tired maybe i just want to know what it is all for if everything is to be swallowed up if we are all reduced like those old photographs of eloi history turns us into exposed meat sex like history stripped away who you were you do what everyone else does overwhelmed by base nature sex would blow away their selves chung mae ken kuei like favorite scarves lost in the wind mae was the one who initiated it perhaps she just wanted it over she pulled his face to hers they kissed the ground was damp in patches the tops of the reeds danced as if in excitement in honour of the moon the clouds were strange they were stippled around the moon like splattered mudplaster mae noticed that even while mr ken offered the beauty of his flat stomach and round thighs he was slower this time he worked himself up through many minutes while she looked at the moon through his endurance mae was finally brought once again to the state she had never achieved with joe she became no one just a body but she had learned a lessening of desire in the man makes him work harder longer so the woman got more out of it joe was always done in an instant she said wed better go it must be getting late or getting early he chuckled and put his forehead on hers again it was a gesture of what relief gratitude surrender it made her smile because already parts of him were becoming familiar mr shenyalar began to sing from his tower the sky was already silver as she slipped back into her disordered house inside it was tiny and dark the ground floor looked posed like a museum exhibit except that it smelled of joe and was full of his snoring it was only then that the love came the love she had been trying not to feel it came torn out of her like a baby ripped raw out of the womb she missed mr ken she wanted him there not to screw but to talk to about the past the village and all the things she could never talk about to joe her marriage was over she couldnt bear to get into bed with joe so she set about cooking his breakfast she cooked in hatred weeping as she oiled the pan and boiled the noodles siao and old mr chung tumbled down out of the loft and she dumped noodles onto their plates and she thought of the ridges of callus on mr kens palms she remembered his soft voice the strength of him the hesitant words joe got up an hour later hung over and silent finally he left to go he said to work mae sat in a chair feeling drained and exhausted and baffled by herself i wasted our night she thought as if holding it to herself and ive got my question map to do how am i to do a question map i cant write she was half asleep when the thought came its a managers job to manage theres always going to be something you dont know how to do just find someone who does it was a beautiful new thought for mae of course just find someone who can it warmed and comforted her and made the world seem tranquil and forgiving mae went to sleep and woke up as someone new chapter the next evening mae called on han ans mother with a proposition the house was the last on marsh street down in the floodplain even now in summer its courtyard was full of mud goat turd and chicken shit mae balanced over it on high heels and knocked on the inner door ans mother kaihui opened the door in a haze of fatigue and loose hair her eyes widened at maes outfit mae bowed mrs hanmaam mae was wearing her white dress with hearts and over that her husbands best grey jacket her hair was pulled severely back she wore her huge spectacles and she carried a clipboard mae was well aware no village woman had ever dressed like that before kaihui covered surprise in polite responses she ushered mae inside and exchanged assurances of wellbeing formalities over mae said i was wondering if i might speak to your daughter i have a proposition for her an was called and came in she was in work clothes an old flowered dress and an apron her hair was in a kerchief which she quickly pulled off her head kaihui made tea and served they talked of the season it was time to get out into the terraces but it seemed as if lambing had only just finished mae felt impatience dead dead this all has died perhaps too soon she launched into the business all our lives she said are going to change air will come again we have the television now to help us be more modern but nothing is really being done to make the village ready she explained that she needed the help of a diligent studious person she saw a stirring of interest then excitement in ans eyes mae continued i have two purposes i confess first it is to help me shape my business that will change too but the second is also to help the village to decide what do we want to do for the future also though mae did not say so to write the answers down and read them later kaihui did not know what to think coming fresh from floors the battle against mud and the trial of boiled socks we are very flattered that you think of my daughter for such an unusual activity she said i must confess i do not understand are you offering her a position not yet admitted mae i am not yet sure i have a business people might tell me dont bother no one wants your fashion but if i do then i will need a bright young talent ans eyes glistened oh she understood the young one she could smell the new world she knew the fragrance of it kaihui said that is very interesting but we are talking about time and my daughter is needed in work here it would not be polite to say your daughter will have to leave you one way or another by marriage or by work it was not polite but perhaps politeness had died too so mae said it an will not always be with you and like all of us she faces choices one choice is to cling to old ways and end up boiling her husbands underwear or she can use her way with words and her beauty in a new way a way that will bring cash and not labour into your house an was trying to fight down a smile her cheeks clenched and she was not daring to look at either her mother or mae may i see the questions asked kaihui her eyes were hard with the mild insult pained at the truth and alert with a flourish mae produced her question map an could not suppress a cry of surprised admiration mae had spoken the questions to kwans tv and the tv had printed it out all in lines it looked like something from the government kaihui might be stuck boiling socks but she could read as she read she began to look wistful these are indeed questions that need to be asked i am concerned about modesty these questions are to be asked of men as well mother an blurted out and pulled herself in indeed yes said mae shyly herself the men run the village and so must be asked that is one reason why i myself need an assistant so that there is no misinterpretation we will always present ourselves together kaihuis eyes said something else you are no longer a model of propriety as long as you do not go armed she said an did not move we will consider the offer its good and bad points mae bowed as she sat when she stood to go an got up and took her arm and said i will escort our guest her mother decided to relent at the courtyard gate an said fiercely quickly no matter what she says i will help you there was no need for rebellion kaihui said yes the next day mae and an went to work mae had decided that it would flatter people if she made an appointment to see them it would get them thinking and it would establish her claim to have done it first her secretary as she called an wrote a letter to all thirtyfour households asking for a convenient time to visit that night when mae sat down to consult the tv kwan came running down the steps of her fourfarm house she kissed her mae kwan said you clever clever lady why did you not tell of such a brilliant plan i felt it might seem stupid mae lied it was unformed i had no idea what the response would be but it is just the thing exclaimed kwan eyes bright and full of pain oh it is to help me with my fashion business it is more than that it asks us to think about the future said kwan do you need any help oh you are so kind no i have an han kaihuis daughter as my secretary if it works out she can join me in the business ah said kwan yes of course you have that terrible loan to repay she paused our offer of help is always open to you maes inner heart groaned this was difficult how could she say you are kind and a good friend but i believe you are smarter than i am and would take over my project make it yours how can i say that the part of you that hungers needs to take my project over and make it yours mae replied i may have to take up the offer indeed you are so good such a kind heart kwans smile did not change just her eyes what value is that in the new world against her own instructions mae had spent some of sunnismans loan on pens and paper and a clipboard for an to write with this made her feel bad her new image made her feel good an did not have to be told how to dress she also wore a jacket of her fathers and suddenly proudly wore the big spectacles she had always tried to hide she looked like a newsreader they worked in the evenings after supper their first appointment was with tsang and her husband mr muhammed the village children lined up outside their gate to watch the arrivals of the talents ask her about kwans son one of the boys bellowed like a bullfrog to squeals of delight and harsh unkind laughter tsang had put on her best clothes and made tea and curtained off the room full of corncobs her husband hasan was a most devout muslim who wore a black robe and had a copy of the book ready mae explained her two purposes she phrased it this way to ask the man of the house about the coming of air and to ask the woman about fashion but either could speak at any time any questions they did not wish to answer were fine had they any views about the coming of air indeed said mr muhammed and spoke for twentyfive solid minutes the religion of peace has always been a friend to science when the west descended into a dark age it was peace that kept alive the teachings of aristotle and plato peace had no difficulty reconciling god and mathematics the spirit and the solid world of physical laws an nodded and wrote down the odd phrase mae said ah and oh at each fresh insight and felt her heart dragged down mr muhammed paused to sip tea he was all lean neatness with thin lips going purple with age and thin fingers his head was wrapped in white like a bandaged wound that needed to be kept clean when she asked her second question what he felt about the test he simply repeated what he had said before but he added that all information was nothing compared to the word of god and that if the air became a channel of godlessness then it would be a great evil to be rooted out but how had he reacted what did he himself experience mae was surprised she really wanted to know mr muhammed denied air had any effect it was interesting to see the beijing opera but it should not be allowed to drive out the book tsang plump cheerful and slovenly agreed with her tidy husband everything he said that was her view pressed to say what her activities were she listed cleaning cooking and fieldwork fashion oh a married woman such as herself needed no fashion ans and maes eyes caught each other they bowed professed delight and congratulated mr muhammed on his contribution he seemed pleased and guided them to the door if you need any help mrs chungmaam help teaching the children about this new thing then come to me to speak frankly you have a great enemy tuh he cast his head back up the hill that animalworshipping eloi mae didnt understand i am sorry i am just a wife i do not know who you mean mr muhammeds eyes softened moved by the incompetence and innocence of a woman teacher shen said mr muhammed gently he hates it he is very angry with you for what you are doing what am i doing mae asked causing trouble said mr muhammed still smiling across the bridge from mr muhammed was the vast household of old mr doh young mr doh was joes great friend and he greeted mae and an with gusts of hilarity he tried to pour them rice wine instead of tea and spoke over his shoulder to his own and his brothers children who clustered around the door to listen young mr doh teased and complimented mae at the same time oh where are your angel wings where are the veils and the bobbles you are wearing glasses why did you put on your husbands clothes by mistake the children chorused giggles and hid their mouths mae asked what does young mr doh think of air what air where is it i tell you it will never happen how many people died eh no one wants it i want movies said his brother who was a bit simple so do i piped up one of the grandsons it is as boring as mud in this village futbol roared all the boys in unison approximating in their language the name of the great international sport mr doh said we get all of that on tv already i tell you nothing will change the two young doh wives of course worked and had no need of fashion on the other hand young miss doh was famous for wearing mens clothes and riding a motorcycle outside on the street an and mae shrugged to each other at home joe waited for them in the kitchen still in his undershirt and work trousers so wife did you learn anything an bowed and joe grunted siao and old mr chung watched why suddenly did it seem to mae that their gaze was insolent mae found she did not want to talk in front of them everything was like an egg that she wanted to warm and protect and hide away the two women also sat at the table under the stares of the men an looked over their question sheets very few of your questions are answered maam we will need to talk to wives separately why do you need to do that said joe belligerently because wives do not talk around their husbands oh and you want to encourage them tuh joe looked to his father and brother for support siao grunted and hid his face mae sighed joe i try to make us money to do that i need to know what women want clothes for to cover their nakedness or else theyd all be whores he said joe we have a wellbroughtup lady guest joe looked sullenly at both of them mae looked at an everyone is pretending that nothing has changed no one will talk about the test at all an looked a bit tense no one knows what to make of it except you an hesitated and then decided to push on in your case ma am it was like a doctor prescribing deadly poison as a last resort you have already gone through it the worst every time people see you they are reminded that you were driven mad by it that it changed you beyond recognition ans eyes were saddened yes said joe suddenly fierce yes you are not the woman i married an persisted in a quiet kindly voice people might become frightened of you i will walk you home said mae joe forbade it they had a terrible fight in front of an mae was beside herself she really had had enough think you stupid man though i know you find it difficult to even recognize your own shoes i cannot let the village beauty walk home unchaperoned what would her mother say oh so now you quote tradition at me you who walk about in mens jackets i am not staying here to listen to rubbish or to let you make a greater fool of yourself in front of miss an mae stormed out she said to an this is going to be harder work than i thought i think of it said an as being like childbirth i find it is already preparing me for many difficult tasks ahead she paused i want to thank you for the opportunity i want to thank you for all your help we will find who your friends are mrs chungmaam mae safely delivered an to her mother and climbed back up to the village square the teahouse overlooked the hill growing out of the side of joes cousins house it was full of light and smoke and bellowing mae walked away from it across their little stream which was allowed to find its own way across the cobbles she sat in the dark on the bench in front of mrs kosals house under the great oak generations of children had swung from its branches the people of kizuldah called it the one tree it seemed to reach up into the stars away from her husband away from everyone mae settled back down into air she did not have to go far before she felt the wisdom of the kru come to her it was so evident then what she was doing wrong she was just talking she had to explain to people what the rules were and ask them for quick simple answers if people left one question unanswered it was either irrelevant to them which told you something or they had something to hide ask questions that had simple objective answers avoid yes or no listen carefully and find a way to characterize the replies so they could be compared the kru was not a voice it was like bubbles full of answers popping in her head it did not ask stupid questions like why dont you get them to write the answers themselves they cant write it knew what she knew it was becoming part of her mae knew nothing really about making dresses she knew nothing really of air or the old net or what money really was or even how to get things off this mountain but she knew one thing through air she could add knowledge to herself in a new way from somewhere from the future she heard the sound of a siren the next day mae and an interviewed mr and mrs mack musa mack looked like the other village men except that his hair had a reddish tinge and curled he was a christian so was his wife who was from across the valley a world away on slopes lost in haze mr mack was the villages token westerner even though his family had lived in the valley for over a century he could drink whisky and not get drunk he was gross in his movements too large people watched him for corrupt tendencies he talked too loudly mr mack shouted them into his house and both mae and an blanched as if the sheer force of his shouting could hurl them against the wall most gross of all he had recently grown a long red beard it was incredibly good fortune to have facial hair he was like an emblem of good luck but really who could bear to kiss such a thing there was a picture of isa the christians god on the wall and he too had a beardful of good fortune but why would a god be helping with the lambing tea was served which was a relief mr mack kept bellowing he was shouting mae suddenly saw because he was so uncomfortable all his life he had been seen as compromised and so he had become what people thought he was it will be a great thing it will bring the world in right here mr mack said marginalized he had a love of foreign things i am very frightened whispered his wife mariam i did not like that thing in my head i was spitting terror laughed mr mack but i reckon that you get used to it after a while it was said his mattress was often seen in his courtyard draining urine it was said that he wet his bed his wife when they examined the responses did most of the talking both were frightened of air both wanted to learn how to use it mariam spoke at great sincere length about fashion mae was sorry she had never approached her before it had been unfair thinking on maes part she had supposed the macks were dirty and uninterested in fashion i would like to have three good dresses one in white for funerals and one full of bright colours for festivals and one very dignified dress for happy ceremonies and for going to my church which i can only do once a year mae saw that she was lonely you missed it last year said mr mack mariam looked sad it was a bad year for farming what sort of dignified dress what kind of colours simple very simple but looking nice you know very modest please and easy to keep clean it must look good after i wash it but i was thinking perhaps in blue and white together if the colours held fast mariam had a pinched face and she pressed her hand over her heart blue and white that was a new colour mae saw an write it down they said goodbye and loose mr mack had his arm around his wife as though she were a parcel outside an said they seemed happy enough they visited the pin tribe like the macks and ans mother they lived south of the main village along the river the pins had turned the marsh below lower street into a graveyard for cars baked tyretracks swept round to rows of vehicles of faded green or rusty red old taxis and rumpled pickup trucks were missing doors or tyres dusty cats and tiny black turkeys called hindis picked their way among them under corrugated tin sheds saws and drills and welding torches were hung with festive abandon the core of the family had been two brothers and their wives when they had stopped farming to become mechanics enver atakoloo the village blacksmith and a fullblooded karz became enraged mr atakoloo shot the elder of the brothers pin xi survived and it was whispered lived as husband to both his own and his brothers wife not to mention it was whispered in even lower voices his brothers wifes unmarried sister who also lived there the ten children and other homeless relatives meant that no fewer than nineteen people lived among the wrecks of the cars or in the barns that had once sheltered livestock the whole house smelled of feet and bedding the tiny diwan was screened from the rest of the house by drying laundry mrs pin xi wore trousers and an apron covered in blue and yellow checks the five daughters peered out from behind the laundry in awe of the transformation of an the five pin sons considered themselves men to be interviewed they sat up straight on the diwan cushions and were forthright air would be great the doh boys were wrong they could do much more than watch football there were great games you could play in air mrs pin beamed with pride every time one of her huge brood spoke fashion oh she needed a new apron no lots of aprons a different one for every day so she could wash the others and good dresses hmm it might be nice yes a good dress nothing fancy nothing fancy nothing fancy again and the daughters come out girls come out and out poured the girls hearts in the direction of an so an had to do both the wise encouraging nods and the writing they wanted to be modern they did not want to look traditional they wanted to see what the rest of the world wore though glance at father it would be good to show the world that traditional values could still be modern they all of them told stories in turn of the day of the test mae asked if they were frightened no they said they were not scared at all no they were ready mr and mrs pin shrugged we are old theysaid what do we know leavetaking took half an hour of shaking hands and bowing the widow and the spinster sister who had not spoken at all now made very formal goodbyes professing pleasure afterwards an and mae stood talking on boards balancing across the mud of marsh street so sighed mae they want work clothes that look good but will wear well they want lots of cheaper clothes so they can take them on and off and wash them a lot the younger women want to be modern but they dont know what modern will be so they will rely on us to show them and adornment is passing they like our mens jackets an was smiling mrs chung is very wise i did not see that but i feel you are right mae settled under the one tree on the bench and called her self and sank down into air answers popped again and again numbers sang to the kru they showed him their hidden secrets joyfully those secrets shocked mae she had planned to buy aprons oven gloves blouses and day shoes cheap in yeshibozkent this would cost riels and give her less than profit the numbers did a dance and showed her to pay off the interest and only riels principal each year she could do nothing that did not make per cent profit her situation was impossible at least with best dresses there was no risk you only bought cloth when you had a sale and it was a luxury you could charge more the numbers did a further dance mae knew how many girls would graduate next year there was likely to be only one wedding eight dresses for a profit of about doing nothing was not an option best dresses it would have to be if mae was still going to be in the bestdress business she would need a seamstress cheap she stood up from the one tree and walked to hatijah ozdemirs house hatijah sat slumped on the floor she looked up piteously at mae dark circles under her eyes her oldest daughter sat just as unmoving but vastly plumper disconsolately mumbling bread forgotten laundry hung crisp and shriveled over the woodbin and the floor was piled with unwashed pots another child was wailing in the backyard that mae had vowed she would never enter it smelled specially of pus how mae wondered was such a creature able to sew so skilfully maybe she put her heart into that and nothing else how are you hatijah said mae as if she were ill oh said hatijah and shook her head are you unwell it is all this worry said hatijah five mouths to feed and we have no money and edrems joints ache so he finds it difficult to work poor man sometimes he cannot work for days ive never seen edrem work at all thought mae would you like some money hatijah looked back with a dull and heavy face probably not if it means she has to move thought mae she decided hatijahs problem was laziness hatijah seemed like a woman underwater too tired even to swim to the surface of her own face she did not reply remember i said back in may before before the test mae always faltered finding words for the event i said that i might have some sewing work to offer you someone else said only if i get to come too it was sezen by the stars everything about sezen had changed sezen wore grubby black trousers and an old black leather jacket she glowered there was no hint of politesse no smiles no graces mae herself had grown more blunt what will you bring she asked myself said sezen you cant do anything replied mae your mother can sew you would just be a burden then my mother wont help you sezens face was fatter and covered in spots her hair had been impulsively chopped back from her face her hands were jammed in her pockets her posture had changed her head leaned to one side her hips were thrust sideways every line of her body was a challenge hatijah just stared okay said mae with a shrug if this is a house where the daughter rules the mother your little brother is half starved and none of you have any clothes find money where you can mae started to leave i can tell you what clothes to make sezen stared back at her mae looked at her jacket her jeans what clothes to rescue from garbage sezens plump head wavered on a skinny neck if thats the only place i can find them she still challenged look you want to make clothes for old women what does a married woman need a best dress for i tell you who is most interested in clothes people my age and we dont want what you make mae stopped she knew what this sensation was this was the sensation of truth coming from unexpected sources we see on tv we dont want to look like peasants we dont want to look like fashion people this is what we want to look like sezen had a school notebook tied with string to a post she opened it and pressed it so it would stay open she did this slowly with her eyes on mae with an air of presenting something outstanding instead of schoolwork sezen had been drawing she was drawing who she thought she was this sezen had long flowing sculpted black tresses and wore tight jeans mutton sleeves pinched wrists mae made to hold the book to see better ah said sezen and snatched it back you will not steal this fashion expert she seemed to say mae shook her head so jeans and mutton sleeves these are new ideas many girls waste their time with fashion drawing there is nothing special in that sezens eyes rolled how annoying when blind people cannot see she held the book out one last time now the drawings had short slicked hair pasted up into tiny points they showed a dream sezen she looked like a hoodlum everything she wore was black this was evil fashion for bad young people and mae knew herself that yes given half a chance this is what they would buy so now you begin to see said sezen the muslim girls would not be allowed hah said sezen scornfully they are the worst what they wear under their robes is nobodys business what they dont wear sometimes mae considered and on balance this was not what she had planned there is something in what you say but i dont like to be threatened and i dont like the way you boss your mother mae shrugged said goodbye and walked out mae was out on the street when there was a change in the sound of the air around her and a darkness in the corner of her eye sezen had run after her without giving the impression of having done so i will set up my own business said sezen with what air mae blew out air and stopped and looked at her mae felt pity for her and dislike at the same time you dont have a bargaining position dont you understand that child sezen had nothing yet she stared back unblinking determined that curious wavering of the head her mouth was working too slightly all the time my mother is useless my father is useless show some respect said mae though it was true i have to do everything my mother just sits there not much gets done does it sezen your house is a disgrace i would not take credit for that if i were you sezen suddenly shouted will you let up on me all of you you are always on me it is because you are rude said mae i hate housework i will do anything else i will be very hardworking and i do know what the young girls want look look sezen shook the red book at mae mae took it from her sezen let her mae folded it and put it under her arm her kru bubbled in her head she calculated i will look at these sezen but the problem is that girls your age have no money their mothers will spend five riels on a dress what will the girls spend one riel two she shook her head two riels said sezen she counted on her fingers you can sell six outfits and get black denim for them all for five riels in the market my mother sews them i sell to the girls we all make money i do not count six sales my boyfriend lives down the hill he has a motorcycle there are plenty more modern young people around here than you think theres one you dont know about sezen waited an that did made mae pause and the little minx struck again hard you see your helpful little talent an she wants these clothes i will think about it sezen so thats six sales for twelve riels total so thats seven riels profit i get one my mother gets one my boyfriend gets one that leaves four for you but i get to spend five riels on cloth mae shook her head you will need to do better than that sezen i agreed to nothing okay you understand nothing i will see if this fits in with my business plan it does insisted sezen mae walked off still shaking her head still what sezen had said about young people wanting something different was true a new kind of bestdress business was not an entirely bad idea something bubbled up from the kru you can either be a general store and stock cheap standard items or you specialize if you specialize you have to spread geographically if i can sell best dresses to this village and the next thats not such a bad idea maybe i will need that motorcycle after all chapter sunnishusband announced to the village he was bringing in a television as well well wife your friend kwan has a rival joe exclaimed cheerily he was back from doing business all day at the teahouse business meant sipping tea and playing chess until suppertime mae was ladling soup into siaos and old mr chungs waiting bowls she thought a moment i dont know why you say rival tuh dont play innocent with me you know the wings and the haseems are rivals rivals for stealing their neighbours farms muttered siao into his soup as if jabbed joe snapped his head around in siaos direction and then decided this was support yes wife your friend kwan is no better or worse than faysal haseem mae served her husband his soup except that we dont owe the wings any money siao said haseem has to run it off the wings account for which of course he will pay rent like water so wing still gets richer at haseems expense that makes wing more clever siao was an odd fish somehow he knew more than joe mae had long ago noticed that he did all the work going off every morning with old mr chung to work on the walls he kept the households accounts so why was he content to sleep in the loft there was no doubt that two tvs in the village was news as mae and an went about their interviewing they discussed the situation what really would mr haseem get out of having a tv position yes but how would he use it to make money his only idea would be to charge people for watching it since wing did not he couldnt either at midnight mae went back to kwans to work on her tv she was learning how to use the accounts package the tv was fine she had decided just so long as you didnt go online mae found mr doh mr ali and mr ho watching a police thriller drug dealers were being rounded up by computer surveillance mae found herself thinking so they are still loyal to wing who is watching at sunnis kwan was thinking the same thing she was serving tea to them as guests she had not done that for days mae to show support began to gather up used cups and was rewarded by a beautiful smile over the plastic tub that was kwans sink they talked i wonder what horrors mr sunni shows on his set how to take over villages perhaps said kwan i think he wants to be a strongman like in the very old days he wants us all to work for him if you had daughters he would try to marry one of his sons to them to form a political alliance kwan bent from the middle with a silent laugh maes eyes were narrow and merry he probably thinks that he has the male tv and you have the female kwan had to put down a cup in order to laugh you have become like a thornbush lately i hate mr sunnisman mae said with a shrug i wish i had killed him it will be very interesting when you interview him for your question map on the contrary i look forward to it i cannot wait until he tries to do one of his own kwan was still smiling but she suddenly gently pushed the tip of maes nose do not grow too bold mae i have more than one enemy i hear shen said kwan her voice suddenly curdling i cannot get over the change in that man i must talk to him as well sighed mae she saw she was not just making a question map she was building a party she realized that in a sense it was the party of mr wing joe got wind of a construction job in balshang it would take three days to drive there siao joe old mr chung and mr doh would drive down in mr haseems van to join the work gang being recruited in yeshibozkent they were to leave that very day it is a good opportunity joe said they are building an industrial farm many buildings there is a whole camp for the workmen they are hiring how much do they pay asked mae he blew out air from stress i dont know all the men in the country will be going there hoping for work but mr doh says that it is government work so they try to spread it to all parts of the country who knows there is a chance and it is better than sitting around here mae was glad it showed her husband had taken on the reality of their problem i will pack your food and your shirts she said it was a proper wifely thing to do he nodded once to indicate that this was quite right too and drew in smoke from his scrawny cigarette mae folded his shirts even if it was only four riels a week if it was four weeks work that would be sixteen riels and if siao and old mr chung did the same then their problems were over taking into account loss of odd jobs that was still a total of thirtytwo riels overall siao took one final look at the household accounts siaos eyes latched onto maes briefly this comes just in time eh mae nodded silently yes she could feel her eyes sparkle mr haseems van drew up outside their gate and beeped mae did not want to be seen by that man so she pressed the food and the reed box of clothing into her husbands hands farewell husband good health courage come back a wealthy man the words tumbled as automatically from her lips as sneezes then came a pause he stared at her wanting more they had been young lovers once she had borne him three children he pulled her to him and kissed her and she hugged him pushing her face to the side of his she would have her freedom after he was gone siao called to him from beyond the gate mr haseem beeped again she patted him go or your good friend will drop you in the shit she said and unbidden tears came into her eyes this was very convenient she made sure he saw them there were wisps of fear at being left alone wisps of loss for joe who was her domestic companion i will see lung and our daughter he said i will bring back news of lung joe worshiped his athletic achieving military son that will be the best part she said now hurry hurry joe grinned like a boy again and broke into a run he waved at the gate again he thinks i love him she thought he thinks that in the end we are still man and wife and she remembered him when he was sixteen handsome a leader of the village youth joe never grew up she heard the car door slam she heard male exuberance a chattering a yelling she remembered him his hair greased up a toothpick never out of his mouth car insignia stolen from vehicles in the valley pinned to the back of his jacket she heard the van grind its way down the mountain road she listened to the sound of loneliness the sound of dust mr kens house was there like he was ever present always close with a door that could both open and conceal mae was walking before she knew it i need to be out in the fields by late afternoon she thought or people will talk it was still lunchtime the children would be napping in mr shens school mr kens mother might be sleeping before returning to the fields if not she could always say who will do your weeding for you mr ken i and the village women could offer to help she walked into mr kens kitchen he was sipping soup his late breakfast he looked up still shiny with sweat from weeding his own fields joes gone she said quietly and his brother ill be along he said she walked back to her own house shaking her body was like mr haseems truck rattling down the road this is crazy if anyone comes to call they will find us she pinned up the window curtains and drew shut the heavy draughtcurtains across the doorway she took down her sun hat her jumper her apron to collect the compost her highsoled field clogs she rammed them under the bed their absence would signal she was not there all of that would signal mrs chung is out at work how then did she draw shut the draughtcurtains she opened them again she lay down on the bed still smelling of joe it smelled of joe but that smell would now be driven out by the smell of mr ken that thought alone seemed to loosen the corsets of her belly i will smell him when i sleep at night she heard the latch her breath caught no one called out her name she heard the latch close her heart was pumping this is mad if it is not him how will i explain i will say i caught too much sun and i am ill the curtains of the alcove were pulled back rattling on their plastic rings it was him and he was smiling he was shiny no longer he had bathed he was naked under his overalls which he flung utterly aside and he was soon on top of her his skin was as perfect as apricots the next day mae went back out onto her husbands land the chungs had one valley paddy and two long terraces very high up the mountainside mae had neglected them since planting the nursery rice dock and bindweed were already sprouting between the onions and rice shoots she began the long climb up the beaten paths the swallows swooped about her scooping insects out of the air the terraces creaked and buzzed with the sound of crickets water lay in puddles as warm as soup on her terrace the air was hot still breathless the heat did a shivering fandance in the air only the kites circling high overhead looked cool mae went to work hauling out weeds her back was soon aching tears of sweat wept into the ground this delicious rice she thought it will be seasoned with my own salt her clogged feet sank deep into the creamy soil with every step the mud sucked and clung like a lover her high broad hat kept the sun off her neck shoulders and even her arms it could not keep away the flies and the midges come friend swallow here is a feast free me from flies she waved her hands at the midges but they returned to tickle and stick to her skin that was like cooked rice glutinous and steaming mae stood up she could see far below on the plain the livid green paddies of wet rice the slashes of mirror among them were water reflecting sky beyond hazy losing all shape in bright sunlight were the flat yellows beiges and greys of the distant mountains was it like this in your day old mrs tung no the voice was like wind suddenly with a lurch mae fell growing smaller the world collapsed around her deflating she was somewhere else little miss hu was swung up away from the ground and out over the paddies holding on to a high wooden arm the arm was part of a pump for transferring water higher up the mountain miss hu hung for a moment giggling in a mixture of fear and delight boys sat on the other end of the arm a huge ball of dried mud miss hu drew a breath and let go and dropped down her heart rose into her mouth and the mud greeted her like a mother with a plump hug the little girl stood up coated in wet earth and whooped to the boys in triumph she jumped up and down splashing in the mud not caring about her old paddy clothes again again she demanded the boys lowered the arm and she ascended again she looked out across the valley the terraces were lined with pumps dipping their heads like graceful marsh birds below on the hillside there was no schoolhouse no mosque the opposite mountain was striated like an onion in layers of paddies the terraces climbed in steps green and lush to the village of aynalar its main street zigzagged up the narrow pass between high fine stone houses with whitewashed walls and stainedglass windows there was a dome and a minaret hu ailing looked at it with yearning one day she promised i will live in aynalar she let go again and mae lurched out of the past she blinked and that same hill was now beige and featureless a mass of tumbled grey stone if you focused you could see traces traces only of the walls the flood had washed one terrace down onto another wiping them all away one whole side of the valley had gone no one spoke of it now no one remembered it was healed scar tissue the opposite hillside once layered with fields stared back at her like an old blind face mae remembered old mrs tung she had always sat at her attic window facing out across the valley wind in her face blind she had been looking in the direction of aynalar as if for her it was still there this is worrying thought mae no this is really worrying the way the world shrugs and suddenly there is the past there is the future like i have a sickness in my head no one said this would happen they did not say you would visit the past they did not say dead friends would not leave they do not understand what air is she felt the wind move chilling her wet arms like fear where is this mrs tung asked all mae wanted when she got home was a chance to think but waiting in her kitchen was her brother wang jumei afternoon sister jumei said he wore his creamcoloured summer suit hello brother thank you for coming to see me she beamed thank you for coming when it will be necessary to make you lunch thank you for coming so that it will be impossible for me to wash thank you for trying as always to assert that joes house is in some way yours would you like something to drink tea would be excellent he nodded she put on the kettle and thought no i will not miss my bath she snatched up fresh clothes and draped them over her arm you will not mind brother if i wash she said in a littlegirl voice or would you rather i stank and dripped sweat into your lunch jumei waved his hand as if it were nothing but he was too choked with his own unsorted emotions to speak if the kettle boils and he wants to make his own tea let him my brother he wants this house and cannot accept it will not be his he is a grain merchant he sells insurance he wears suits he has to cast his shadow over things anger made her snap shut the curtain closing off the narrow alley between the two houses she scowled as she peeled off the sweaty tshirt all pleasure in her bath gone she needed to think absentmindedly she scooped cold water over herself from the rain butt jumei will want to chaperone me or even have me move back into his house for propriety well that wont happen but he will also feel he has the right to drop in and out when he pleases joe knows what jumei is up to that is why my brother never does this when joe is around but oh god he will be here day and night with his new baby and his wife will want me to change its diapers he bring mother and leave her here and say its my turn to take care of her when i want to sleep in ken kueis arms unless i am so rude that he goes away and doesnt come back necessity in life can have a wonderful calming effect unless i finally really tell him what i think is going on unless i say it in the way i have always wanted to say it she began to grin i am just going to say what i really think i am a peasant wife used to livestock and hard reality his little cream suit is no defence against that mae went back into the house still smiling with anticipation jumei sat staring at the boiling kettle haha men you just sit there watching it boil cant you make the tea yourself jumei had no answer for that i i was offered tea indeed said mae toweling her hair there it is her hand indicated the earthenware bin in which the tea leaves kept dry briskly she put away the dirty clothes in the wicker basket i hope brother you did not come with thoughts of my cooking you lunch i have my appointments she smiled at him her teeth had never felt so big he was foxed nothing was going as he had pictured it you are bold mae he said bold to visit neighbours i have known all my life what is bold about that you are bold to wear so much perfume pooh you smell more like a woman than my customers she pulled the alcove curtain shut around her to put on her talent clothes ill tell you what else is bold to drop into another mans house the moment he is gone and expect to be cooked lunch or doesnt your wife cook for you anymore you are a woman alone no i am not miss an and i always work together so i do not need a chaperone i certainly do not need to be chaperoned in my husbands house mae was decent in the heartpatterned dress so she pulled the curtain back she wanted to see his face slack with surprise she stepped into her talent shoes and there is no need to try to establish any rights to this house if joe dies siao inherits if he dies old mr chung inherits either one of them could marry and then it would never fall to the family wang he shivered in his chair mae you are impossible this is a brotherly call i know replied mae flinging up her husbands jacket to open up its arms she paused and i know exactly what that means whatever ive got jumei you want its been like that for as long as i can remember you want joes cock too you want to inherit this house maybe you can inherit it if you let joe fuck you she sniffed and made plain she was about to leave she muttered both of you would probably enjoy it all blood drained from her brothers face abruptly like a cripple he stood up shambling shivering having trouble gathering up the cane i dont know whats come over you you talk like a peasant a rough farm girl he was at the door i am a rough farming girl i i had come to offer to pay the debt and mae whooped in triumph i know i know and that is how you thought you would get the farm her sneaky little brother his face fell mae had to laugh she took his arm and led him towards the door come come brother its not so bad all our fights end this way only this time i have decided to skip the fight mae remembered the kettle she swooped back into the kitchen to take it off the ring and when she came back he had gone for a few weeks maes days settled into a pattern she did her housework in the early morning and worked in her fields until noon at lunch or during the day she might snatch some time with mr ken in the early evening mae and an would visit neighbours with their question map and drink tea late into the night after escorting an home mae worked to master the television she saw there were hundreds of things she might do with the tv she could use the television to sell or to market call she could use it like a telephone to talk live or leave voicemail in a year she would be able to use it to make material for aircasts aircasts were like films but they were translated into the format they could go then direct to peoples heads so there would be aircast versions of movies and aircast version of ads thought mae and all the ads if you looked hard enough had something called intimacy shields so mae began to wonder how do you do that in air when its inside your head she tried to buy bolts of cloth online but she still needed something called a believability card and that was easiest to do when you had a clever card kwan rubbed her shoulders the world out there has grown bigger there are two worlds there is the one you can see and another world people have made up and it is bigger than the real one they call it info and mae felt lust lust to be part of that world lust to know how it worked lust to know how the television worked and how the net and how the air would give all that wings with a lust that bordered on despair she wanted to be first she wanted to know all she wanted to be mistress of all its secrets i will learn she promised herself kwan would leave to go to bed mae would keep learning and relearning how to make the accounts system work she asked for the wrong things the machine got stuck on the way she said certain things she kept forgetting what fo mu lah were and how you entered them but she knew that it meant the numbers would add themselves up she thought in passing of siao joes brother and how he should see this she learned that she could save pictures from the net or from video she learned she could change their colour she learned she could use the tiny camera to copy things from the real world and change them above all else she learned that she would no longer need to know how to read or write and at three am her feet crossing in front of each other as she walked she would make her way home as sweaty as if she had been weeding the rice by night as well a note on the door might say in her mothers handwriting your mother called she wonders where her daughter spends her time and asked if you would be good enough to visit her mae would promise herself that she would when she had time she would fall into her bed mr ken might be there snoring gently she might kiss him more usually she would sleep alone she would pull the pillow that smelled of him between her legs and she might dream always of the past of beautiful thankyou cakes not delivered until stale or a prize dress forgotten on a line until the sun bleached it the sense of unease would persist as she sat up the long hot day would begin again the next fashion season would not be until after harvest in october by then she would know how much joe and siao had brought in she could leave deciding about her fashion business until then mae thought she was doing all that she could then sunni set herself up in the bestdress business mae arrived at the kosals to interview them oh mrs haseem has just visited and asked us all the same questions mrs kosal told mae see she has sent us a leaflet mrs kosal went to fetch it and passed it to mae her watchful face and smile not entirely sympathetic mae felt sick the thing she feared most had happened her knowledge her ideas had been taken and used by her enemy before she had had a chance to complete them and sunni was richer and had more time and she had a television of her own mae stood reading in the street looking at the professional print job alarmed and unhappy an kicked grit beside her i cannot bear to read it said mae and passed it to her did an know she could not read perhaps she did an read it aloud true fashion for true ladies now that certain parties have been uncovered as offering false advice the way is now open for truth and beauty mrs haseemmaam sets the new standard for fashion with her eye on the world she sees what the world of fashion really has to offer visit her fashiondoctor surgery when you have a moment see what she can offer you as a best dress it will be professionally made by best fashion houses she will also visit to listen with clear heart and true vision to what you have to say do not waste words like seed grain on barren fields only mrs haseemmaam can make your words grow into green fields sunni was trying to destroy her mae forced herself to be calm in front of an she looked at the swallows the swallows still darted the sky was faithful mae took some comfort the village has never had a leaflet before she said i have to admit it is a bold stroke a great compliment it says to us you are as important as rich city people to have a leaflet printed for you it was the work of a professional letterwriter and that mae saw was wrong in many ways she has made a mistake mae said saving face in front of an she addresses us as an employer would and who are these fine ladies she writes for mrs wing only mrs wing who i think is still my friend yes i see said an but she still kicked grit an can you help me this evening can you stay late an sat at her kitchen table and wrote thirtythree letters in her beautiful handwriting on pages torn from maes exercise books mae made sure every one of them was different dear mrs pin your husband feeds his children by fixing cars and vans how would you feel if a rich man wrote everyone saying dont use mr pin he cant fix things this would be unkind and untrue sunni gives herself airs and calls herself mrs haseemmaam she wants you to talk to her like she is your boss you can call me mae like i am your servant i will work hard to get you a good best dress your servant mae dear mrs doh i am not rich and do not have the money to pay someone to write letters for me i cant pay to have them printed in the city i am a plain person who likes beautiful clothes and wants her friends to be beautiful you do not need to call me ma am i have always made good dresses for my friends and always will your friend mae and finally dear sunni i may be a servant but i find i am still a fashion leader i start to wear mens jackets and so do you i do a question map and lo so do you mr wing brings television your husband so original does the same you follow me and that shows i give true fashion advice everyone in the village thinks that too it will be good to have two fashion experts because both fashion experts must work harder it will be fun for me to see you work hard your servant mae hands shaking with rage mae folded up the letters and sealed them with rice paste i will walk you home she told an and then she delivered all the letters to the thirtythree houses including sunnis mae looked up at the stars as bright as the souls of her people something inside her thrashed like a fish pulled up onto the shore at first she thought it was anger it was the need to do something more instead of going home she marched up the hill to kwans house kwans courtyard was empty but the television was running an old film with no one watching mae sat down to work speaking to the machine kwans dog started to bark finally kwan came out saw mae and started to laugh kwan sat on her steps in her nightdress and shook her head mae you have just written letters to everyone in the village and now what are you doing i am setting up a school said mae kwan was still laughing what tonight yes tonight i feel like the whole village will be swept away unless we do something now come and see images of the five pens swam up onto the screen kwan came up behind her i made these there are the five pens that air sets up in your mind i will make the tv imitate air and i will show people how to use them what they will be able to do what do you think kwan was quiet that will be a good thing to do i will call in everyone i will call in people during those times when they are not busy i will ask men to come just after breakfast i will ask women to come after lunch kwan started to chuckle again you just thought of this i have been slow said mae we all have to learn kwan or air will come and it will use us not the other way around what she felt was akin to panic what she felt was akin to flying audio poster pictures she ordered birds swallows blue on white the words flew onto the screen as if they were swallows the screen said for her under the silhouette of a bird we have the school here ah okay kwan nodded yes maes words became a poster swallow school be like a swallow learn to fly in the air mrs chung mae has been deep into air she has been learning a lot about how the tv works she wants her friends to know it too she will show how air will work by giving lessons on my television for free men come just after breakfast women come just after lunch rowdy unruly young pests come after school and not before mrs wing kwan lady sunnima am you do not need a letter writer and a printer to make a leaflet mae will do one for you kwan was by now laughing aloud print said mae thirtythree copies two copies were lined up side by side on one sheet of paper there was a whirring sound and kwan eased the paper out of her machine mae she said reading you are a miracle mae felt triumph chapter the only manto show up at maes first lesson was mr ken he sat quiet and patient and brought no one else with him he was not a leader of the village there is no need to do this just for me he said i need to practise said mae alone in front of someone who accepted her she spoke from the heart we should all be grateful to mr wing who brought us this machine just in time finally we can see tv but not just tv not just kung fu ah but info this is what the rest of the world has had since they were born this is what they know like we know how to breathe now this is where air starts from air thinks everyone knows this if we dont know it we get nowhere in air and if we get nowhere in air we will be as far behind the rest of the world as apes are from us you wont believe what air does in air they dont just give you tv shows in air krus come and give you their whole head their wisdom enters you you can use it like it was your own brain in air children will become wiser than adults they will have parts of wise adults in their heads i know this because i have shared this i have had a great kru in my head telling me about mat unrolling in new york people are already sharing their wisdom their dreams in one pool it becomes like another person that everyone can use they call this collabo they have collabo clubs where everyone dances to everyone elses music all of this all of this will be on us next year and half of us have never made a telephone call that is why we must move that is why we must learn now her hand had become a fist and she shook it mr ken sat in his chair as if it were accelerating too quickly sunni came to maes first afternoon lesson she wore a black gown with gold leaf and a floating chiffon scarf and she was pink and white and her hair was in a glossy sweep her nails were painted her shoes were white she made mae look as if she had come direct from the fields who was more of a fashion expert now sunnis face was a mask of a smile and she gazed at each of the women and gave them a nod i assume it is all right for me to come as well mrs wingmaam she did not even look at mae kwan smiled and said that all were welcome mae is doing helpful work for all of us sunni sauntered among the rows of cushions nodding gracefully to each of the women i will be round later with the fabric i promised you she folded herself neatly onto a cushion and sat next to her ally mrs ali elegant dignified they gazed about them as if from a great height sezen showed up with her boyfriend to whom mae took an instant dislike his face was frozen into a sneer and there was a tattoo on his neck mae had sezens notebook ready to give back to her ill talk to you about it later said mae and sezen for no very good reason turned to her boyfriend with her mouth open as if aghast at bad behaviour more women came in clumps of friends chattering and laughing mrs mack came alone all the pins came together maes sister soong se came with jumeis wife who had been born a soong as they arrived misgivingdoubts overtook mae could she really talk to so many people mae was torn between different impulses one towards elegance one towards directness hello i am very pleased to see you all here the women murmured hello back exactly as if they were in school and mae was teacher this surprised her made her shy made her retreat into peasant bluntness she tried to start as she had started with mr ken but it came out muted and flat when we go on air this is what they all know so we need to know it too to keep up with them okay the tv would not go on mae realized that the tv had always been on when she arrived here she was a teacher and she could not switch it on its asleep said kwan the ladies laughed not knowing that it was an actual word wake said mae shyly up came the five pens of air mae felt sunni behind her looking for every mistake what the test did is change everybodys mind it made the inside of your head look like the inside of a tv mae was taken aback when the women laughed again so you have these five pens inside your head now air imitates tv so learning how to use the tv will help learning how to use the air i use it to breathe said mrs ali she was looking in a conspiratorial way at mrs sunnimaam more chuckles they wanted this to be jolly like a ladies tea party mae found she was too shy in front of so many people to be relaxed enough for that she was exposed to an enemy who had perhaps brought allies now you will also use it to think mae said to mrs ali it sounded like a rebuke sezens boyfriend gave an ugly squawk and he whispered something rude that made sezen giggle and hiss at him to be quiet sunnis eyes were on mrs ali and very slightly she shook her head mae pointed to the screen which was showing the familiar air format you will see that you already know how air works oh good we can go now said sezens boyfriend sezen hid her mouth and laughed each of these four areas contains different things the section called help is the one we cover today because this is where information about info is kept open help up came a list of options mae could not read it but she knew it by heart this shows all the things the television can do how to make the tv work how to find things that we want to know what to do when things do not work mae turned to them is there something any of you want to know they sat sunni sat looking down at her new dress adjusting the scarf into a perfect position mrs haseemmaam perhaps you would like to learn how to print a leaflet i have already printed a leaflet replied sunni her face a mask of a smile good then we need not do that said mae her eyes said that is what i wanted you will not learn it from me mae wanted to humiliate sunni in public her gut moved her forward there are many things the tv can do perhaps i can show you how to use it to design special clothes in a special way sezen may i use your drawings sezen sat up and blinked uh ah okay her boyfriend laughed at her and she hit him mae trotted forward feeling shortlegged and took the notebook scan mae said and held up the book in front of the little camera eye sitting on top of the tv it took a moment if this was an egg i would now go and wash the bowls and come back later the homely touch made most of her audience laugh then mae pulled the camera round now please scan mrs haseemmaam the audience was onscreen and mae touched the screen image of mrs haseem to select her you see we live in new ways already sezen has been looking at new kinds of clothes for modern people what the tv can do is show us what such clothes will look like on real people so they can see themselves if the fashion suits them we will show modern fashion on mrs haseem the young people spurted laughter mae had seen a department store in tokyo do this if they could she could the machine whirred kwans face was held still but its smile was spreading slowly what the machine is doing is building an image of mrs sunnimaam this image will be complete and can do many things though it might take some time to make she glanced at the screen the tv whirred to itself mae was stuck for something to say so lets start to make our new clothes for new people she murmured to the tv multitask the machine did not understand multitask mae said again sunni raised her voice very slightly not everybody follows your orders mae indeed not mrs haseemmaam i am not in a position to give orders a new window opened with the image of sezens jacket mae told the machine it was to be a jacket and sunnis size which she knew from ordering her dresses mae called up textures she called up colours oh gasped mrs pin as the drawing of the jacket suddenly inflated into something that looked almost real mae stuck in the knife and twisted the advantage is that you do not need to visit the city to see fashion you do not need to have talents come and visit to parade clothes that look good on them you can see what clothes look like on you it might have been better manners said sunni looking pained to try it on yourself mae sniffed i have just come from working in fields i no longer care what i wear she started on the jeans black jeans with handcuffs at the belt every business will have to change even farming even water all of it will change because of info that is why i want you to be ready the jeans were made in sunnis size a different hairstyle for you mrs sunnimaam beautiful spiky cropped slicked we can give you a whole new look mae went back to the newly computed image of sunni you could paste on the designs and the person could stand up and turn and see the clothes as if they really wore them mae did not know the command she knew how to paste images but the images were flat and dead the command she needed was an english word mae could not remember it she searched her airscarred mind she felt what she called the root the thing that was reached back into air what is the thing i need she demanded the whisper was slight as slight as the moment when you remember mae saw a sign that looked like it was made of red and yellow blocks d mae remembered the funny seesaw sound of english she really did not know if this was going to work but if it did the village would talk about nothing else tree dee com poo tay shon pause the screen went dark mae heard very faintly a grinding she heard the sound of wind please wind please air please sky i am of the earth help me pink said the lines of the screen awakening sezen roared she stood up and covered her mouth and hopped up and down beset by hilarity hope all manner of feelings including hatred of the rich for on the screen mrs haseemmaam was sitting on her chair dressed as sezen had dreamed spiky hair black leather black jeans everything black mrs haseem looked down in shame she tried to look up in pity she saw herself as too old too plump squeezed into jeans and looking like a drug dealer i use clothes to flatter friends not to make fun of people sunni said bad girl sunni said it too an echo on the screen she stood up with maximum dignity onscreen the effect was hilarious for she walked off like a fashion model on a catwalk as in a video she looked proud to be bad girl sunni mrs pin and mrs doh grinned eyes goggling pleased at her defeat mrs ali stood up suddenly straight and fierce and walked off to join mrs haseem so i know who my friends are thought mae and i am somewhat in sezens debt now she said for those who are left lets go back to looking at this thing in the afternoon the children cameto the swallow school their clothes were ragged their stripy tshirts brown with age and dust they clutched notebooks to their chests we want to see the games they chorused mae remembered teacher shen i think we had better look at education she said she saw a little girl called dawn wince its not so bad dawn said mae education mae told the machine and an owl flew onto the screen maybe an owl meant education in america but in karzistan owls were birds of death not of wisdom this owl wore glasses which was especially terrifying the children went silent hiya it began to parrot and prance dawn covered her eyes see its a friendly owl mae said it began to recite all the options it can help you with schoolwork the children stayed silent but became accepting they accepted it might be useful to know this and none of them had opened up the owl before call me owl said mae the children giggled nervously i am old i am wise i am friendly you call on me and i will help you owowowowlll wheedled dawn twisting in her chair and they all broke into giggles it was extremely rude to call an adult owl mae let them laugh mae decided to show them a symphony from paris there was more than one of them a list of choices offered things mae had never heard of explain she said the television spoke they were names of people who had made music who is bay toh vang she asked and the television told them about the man his life and a world that was unfamiliar strange gone the world was a big place and history made it even bigger showing different worlds at different times it was like looking down a huge chasm mae even felt a bit dizzy the children wanted to see the nest of singing talents called the pink and gold girls instead up they came breasts sparkled with sequins but with positive messages about learning being the way for both boys and girls mae found hindu raga and indian musical movies she showed them muslim music from the arab league half her audience sat forward for they yearned with all their hearts for a muslim world she showed them puccini a voice explained that opera was about love and action stabbings and vows and disguises mae showed them collabo from new york the music from a hundred american minds pouring into one mix it bounced jagged strange brave bold stupid smart the children of karzistan saw the careless faces of new york and they saw themselves dawn leaned forward wideeyed the light of the future dancing in her eyes when they left they made a sound mae had not heard before thirty children left talking as loudly and seriously as adults when mae got back home she found that mr ken had cooked her a meal he stood slim and broad at the same time wearing an apron and grinning at himself what are you doing what what she asked i cook for you he said pleased god he was beautiful that is my job she was chuckling oh and youve been working sit tea is made then we eat mae looked at her good man sometimes life was a miracle sometimes you found a good man to love you sometimes he lived next door the only foolishness was to expect it mae took off her field hat and gave ken kuei a kiss looking at his face mae thought no true foolishness would be not to know it when you got it and take it noodles and pig bowel he said proudly of his supper the size the beauty the miracle of the world fields of butterflies thousandyearold fields childrens faces drifting clouds of life mae dropped down onto a chair and took her bowl of tea under her arm she still had sezens notebook mae opened it again she saw the immaculate clothes the lean hard faces sheet after sheet one dream after another all clean all hard getting darker meaner and angrier amid all that filth she dreams of this with that useless mother the dirty babies no wonder she is angry angry and hard as nails and she wants and she wants mae recognized that hunger it was info lust the thought came as simply as the bursting of a bubble sezen wants me as a mother how touching do i find that i am going to have to do something different now that sunni takes half my business do i say yes to sezen and do these badgirl best clothes the food arrived borne by beautiful arms crowned by a beautiful smile bubbling up from inside her came a chuckle she pulled him to her and kissed his shirt with its slightly rounded belly where is your mother where are your children didnt you hear no you were gone this morning working as always they are all visiting the other grandparents he smiled we are truly alone oh her voice trailed away in delight after supper in the alley between the houses mae stood nude before him kuei poured cold delicious water over her he soaped her washing her back she poured water over him and washed him then soapy and nude they made love she had never even dreamed of doing this with a man kuei knelt and with gentle puppydog lapping kissed her mostsecret places it was animal doglike a year before shame would have overcome her instead she felt as though another layer of clothing had been flung free mae held herself even more open for him and soft warm wet he explored her and she saw the swollen head of his penis round and the colour of a peach and she knelt then and ate oh i am sorry he gasped and the fruit burst in her mouth and the strongest possible taste of masculinity pumped into her he pulled her to her feet and most shocking of all he plunged both of them into a kiss he poured water over them cooling purifying and it was her turn to crumple in the middle and she pressed the back of her own hand against herself as if to quell the trembling he kissed her cheek and stepped out to dry himself she looked down and saw her hand was bloody she was menstruating she poured water over it she explained she had not known she was worried some men were terrified that menstrual blood would weaken them then we both have the most each other has to give he said and kissed her again and she went wet again and they made love again this time more conventionally i have blood and semen inside my belly she thought they washed again the water like a cool loving tongue of some creature that cared for both of them dust stickiness their everyday selves were all washed away both of them tumbled into bed darkness settling over their minds like night kuei she whispered finally she had called him by his first name they were awakened by a pounding on the door a man was calling her name in rage joe gasped mae kuei was naked beside her in bed and his clothes were in the small shed with the drain between the drawn curtains it was night stay here she whispered pleading mae chung mae someone bellowed could it be that it was not joe her heart shuddered anyone else would be a relief i must talk with you open this door i want words mae fluttered into her morning robe her mind clearing as if a strong wind had blown through it she snapped the curtains shut around the alcove and turned on the kitchen light mae shouted back i am coming who are you to be shouting so the kitchen was covered with unwashed pans but betrayed no other sign of a male presence patience patience she opened the door and something was thrown in her face it was lightweight it fluttered it did not hurt but it made her turn her head when she looked back she was dismayed it was teacher shen his lean and handsome face was hard with tension his eyes were wide with anger mae was temporarily undone she had been a friend shen demanded what are you about what are you trying to do he was beside himself i ask the same question of you have you gone mad shen to shout at me what is this about you know what this is about the tv you setting up a school so that was it this was going to be tiring and there would be no resolution come in she said wearily mr ken would be trapped in her alcove i was in bed i have been at work all day at that school i call it a school because thats what it is but it is not a schoolschool everyone knows that it is a way of teaching people he glowered at her teach them to watch bad movies teach them that it is better to live in beijing or bombay or any other place than here i have made a mistake thought mae i should have spoken to him and got him to agree this mistake will take time to undo her fingers were burrowed into her uncombed hair teacher shen we have always been friends yes he insisted i am an impulsive person i see something needs doing i do it i should have talked to you first and explained you should not set yourself up you let your rivalry with sunni carry you too far ow that was true teacher shen do you know any thing about info he resented that though his expression did not change we all need to learn about it we need to learn about it because soon we will spend half our lives in info and no one not one of us knows a thing about it we will all become like little children again we will all be lost unless we learn his expression had not changed but there was something helpless frozen about him a poor peasant boy who fought and fought to learn who gave everything to be allowed to be a teacher and he was her friend kind shen wise shen poor shen she saw in his face that he feared he had lost everything he lived in a hovel in a village on a hill he had given his life to trying to teach the children you are right about sunni she said softly sunni tries to take my farm my business she wants to take everything i have his chin started to tremble he knew the feeling well they cant even read most of them he said finally and looked up at the ceiling what did you show them today bay toh vang we heard a part of a symphony and we had info on him i knew nothing about bay toh vang they do not know their multiplication tables and you are telling them everything will be easy just wish into the machine you dont have to work you dont have to learn teacher shen glared at her you will make slaves of them no mae said quietly i will do the reverse of that who puts air into their heads who controls it who makes the things they see there do they no the great huge powerful things in the world do you know how computers work woman by numbers in the end all those pictures all those words are just numbers and these children cannot even add shen got up to go sick at heart and unable to bear her and what she was bringing do you think any of my children went home and learned their arithmetic last night or were they humming the songs that yu op pah wanted them to hum he had an old socialist hatred for the west tell them that shen said mae tell them they must learn their numbers to control the machine when you call up bay toh vang by toggling your right ear by calling yourself madam owl he looked hunted destroyed and powerless you talk about sunni to get my sympathy you have done what sunni would do thats what you have done to me teacher owl shen stood up mae thought i have lost a good friend i dont want us to be enemies she called after him he was already in the courtyard she went after him shen teacher shen we are on the same side we both want the same things she ran across the courtyard shen please come to my school use it yourself you must find out about it too that was of course entirely the wrong thing to say he spun on his heel and snarled at her like a dog baring fangs beyond words mae stopped her breath halted by the shock and suddenly he was gone down the street stumbling back into her kitchen she saw what he had flung at her her leaflet of which she had been so proud kuei was by the table towel around his waist that sounded terrible he said oh i should have talked to him but there wasnt time there never seems to be enough time she was near to weeping she went to her kuei and leaned against him and he put an arm around her her head turned around and looked at her room then she saw she had not pulled the curtain fully shut behind her mr kens shoes were beside the bed fully visible and the pillow with two head marks mr ken had hidden behind the curtain but the curtain had a gap on either side of it had he seen teacher shen was both a friend and an enemy would he say anything when and why would he say it later that night asleep in bed mae heard applause she lifted up her head the sound came from all around the house as if the hills were a theatre thronged with people she got up and half asleep stepped out her front door bam mae was shaking with terror and up to her thighs in mud in her own courtyard she was wringing with sweat and panic mud and water were pouring through the open gate part of her had to pause to check yes this is my house my house in a flood everything else in her danced fingers knees bladder for some reason her first thought was for ken kueis mother somehow this mae was carrying a flashlight she shone light across the courtyard at the battened windows and the closed doorway mae had to fight through the mud towards mr kens house the mud was a heavy slow evil and there were sharp rocks inside it what when flood said a voice it was old mrs tung mae could see shelves of water moving over the surface of the mud each one a millimetre deeper than the last itold you there would be a flood mrs ken mae called again if there were no one left in the old house she would run where was mr ken where was anyone behind her outside she heard the entire hillside move the terraces are going mae screeched then she dropped back again to some version of now sweat trickled from her and she knew she had seen the future the flood was coming again chapter sunni hired a minibus with rows of seats to take her customers to green valley city mae was in her terraces working and saw the van drive out of the village it stopped on the road below her maes eyes were sharp so were sunnis sunni leaned out of the window and stared up at mae over the top of sunglasses sunnis hair was perfect under a blue scarf she said something inside the van mrs ali looked around sunni to see madam owl at work in her fields mrs nan miss ping all peered up at her this is stupid thought mae she keeps trying to poop on me in such tiny ways mae grinned and smiled and waved as if at friends she felt like turning and pointing her arse at them did they really take such delight in knowing that she had to work mrs ali said something and patted sunni on the shoulder having exposed madam death as a mere peasant the van of the other party drove off towards the city mae found she really didnt care she chuckled and went back to work her hills were beautiful her husband had found work whatever happened she would have some kind of business her school was a success joe would come home and then perhaps like childbirth or mourning the thing with mr ken would have to end the rice whispered in the wind as it had done for two thousand years at times the world seemed good and at peace and happy mae knew this was only a respite for life was a constant struggle bird eats worm bird has its eggs and those eggs are eaten the rice is beautiful and then cut down people melt into the earth while yearning for the sky in the afternoon mae taught her school at sunset walking home from teaching the children mae saw a van come jostling up lower street oh this is sunnis circus she thought well i can wave just as prettily again the van squealed to a halt at the tight corner the driver did not know the road the sunset light made everything look golden but his van actually was a beautiful flaked metallic gold excuse me said the driver balshang face balshang accent can you tell me where lives mr wing mae thought quickly yes indeed but it will be easier if i show you may i the mans face did not change for a moment he was silent and then said please he pushed open the door for her the back of the van was jammed with tools books a suitcase and a hastily rolledup blue tent the metal pegs had earth jammed into their grooves he asked her how soon to harvest here he was young very young indeed to own such a fine van he was incredibly skinny the biggest thing about him was his hair young thick springy and forced under a hat it was a completely useless hat it was soft and khakigreen and had no brim it would not keep off the sun but it would make the head hot he wore tiny glasses and smiled benignly there was a gentle air about him that made mae want to warn him be careful where you choose to sleep alone in that tent it is just under a month said mae the men will be back soon they try to find work ah he said his mouth jerked in a strange downward motion the van revved up the sudden steep slope towards mr wings house why is there a problem with work mae asked huh said the man it was a kind of a laugh havent you heard we get no news up here said mae ho just that there is none the entire country is moving looking for work he eased the van into mr wings courtyard dashboard lights flashed and he flipped something off and swung himself out of the van mae followed he stood hands on hips regarding the house these old mountain houses are very fine he said it is lovely to be so cool mr wing keeps his television outside that is so the village can use it i teach on it he turned he was very young but with a crease down either side of his mouth that only skinny men get what do you teach how to use the tv what air will be like i call it swallow school so people can fly in the air hmm he said whats your name mae she said no he said your full name he paused im from the government he seemed to think this would reassure her mae did not answer there is mrs wing kwan was coming down her steps a question on her face hes from the government warned mae wincing mrs wing is your husband here the man asked my husband is visiting his many farms to see how things progress said kwan i he began and thought better of it idid not expect an eloi is what he wanted to say i am from the central bureau of information technology he announced we are very concerned to see how the test went kwan maintained a faultless exterior that was some months ago yes there are many villages i am visiting them all to inspect the damage and to help prepare people for what is coming next year we are doing that for ourselves said mrs kwan she inclined her head towards mae mae has been helping us all so i hear said the central man he beamed and nodded approval it is not so in other places it is so here said kwan good and your tv it works well oh very well said kwan not sounding like herself at all her smile stiffened and her eyes glistened with meaning at mae she wants him away from her tv thought mae good the central bureau of information technology gave him a grant no kwan fluttered i am afraid i know nothing of my husbands business mae changed the subject as if it were a rug under his feet do you need a place to stay you see my neighbour has spare rooms now you could park your van in my courtyard kwan waved another flag of distraction at him oh yes poor mr ken you might like to talk to him it is so sad his wife was driven mad by the test and drowned herself and his grandmother died of shock the central man looked stricken he shook his head such foolishness he said we are not educated people said kwan casting her eyes down thats not what i meant he said i mean it was foolish to have that test a central man saying the government was wrong either he was young and foolish or very dangerous kwan and mae exchanged further anxious glances the central man looked pained were i am sorry to have to ask mrs wingmaam did anyone else in this village die in the test no no those were the only people such a terrible thing two in one house kwans eyes were on maes again child voices sounded outside the gate whispering in wonder mae said sir the children have seen your van if you want to drive anywhere wed better go now the truth of it made kwan and mae laugh as water does on a skillet shes right said kwan the central man made the same embarrassedlooking downward jerk of the mouth he nodded put on his useless hat again and said may i come back to talk to you tonight of course kwan replied but it is mae you really need to talk to ah said mae the rough little monkeys have seen us dawn and zaynab peered grinning out at them from behind the gate and the pins crowded behind them oops the man said and broke into an ungainly hobble as the van bumped back down lower street the perfect thing happened sunni and her busload heaved up over the hill into the little square the central man swerved his golden car to miss them mae stuck her head out the window and grinned and waved ms haseem mrs ali miss ping their faces fell to see chung mae in a golden car of her own hello hello she called smiling and nodding the central man was grinning too so those are the opposition are they mae felt endangered what do you mean he changed gear and his van inched forward oh the test has created much trouble in villages like this one youll have to tell me where to drive how about back to balshang mae thought to herself the government van fitted neatly through the gate of maes courtyard mr kens hens scattered the dog started to bark and his youngest daughter came running out to stare at the golden van old mrs ken emerged wiping her hands mae bowed to her lovers mother she exchanged formulaic greetings and then mae explained this gentleman needs a spare room old mrs ken looked doubtful then the central man said i can pay you five riels a night mae was dumbfounded my god i could have paid back the interest on the loan mae had to endure old mrs kens sunburst of a smile she bowed and bowed again to mae delighted at receiving such bounty from a neighbour it will be an honour and privilege she exclaimed it will bring happiness into our house again dear mrs chung you think of your neighbours too much you are too kind oh no sir let us carry your things kuei kuei she called her sons name ken kuei emerged having just bathed he puts the city man to shame thought mae as mr ken lifted up the central mans case kuei was round like ripe fruit the central man was stricken bushes on a plain the central man said mrs chung i must talk to you some more once i am settled in of course said mae her house was dark inside she drank water ate cold rice and felt suddenly alone it was strange having old mrs ken smile on her if kueis mother had known the truth she would have beaten her breast and called down scandal from the village all around the thought was as cold as the rice as the silence how am i going to find my way out of all of this and then the government spy came back in excuse me he said you are the government she said and shrugged meaning how am i to stop the government his golden vehicle was the colour of sunlight through her one tiny window poverty was shabby around her shoulders like a motheaten shawl im not the government he said well i come from it but we are all karzistanis we care for our country may i he indicated a chair what would you say central man if i denied the chair to you probably mae decided nothing he finally remembered formalities and offered mae his name it made mae close her eyes and smile embarrassed for him his name was oz oz last names had been adopted only in the last century people chose their own for good luck oz in the turkic language of the karz meant real and genuine and sometimes naive the central mans name meant mr genuinely sincere mr sincere tapped the top of the table the test was far too soon he said and karzistan is not a powerful enough country to stop it and he sighed it would have been wrong to stop it because the test would have come but it would have been run by big companies she stared back at him big companies owned by very rich people they would have run the test instead you have heard of the yu en united nations she shook her head i am an ignorant peasant they decided to have the test the worlds governments i know governments are not people but they are better than big companies do you now how the air works it depends what you mean all right in a computer there is a plate and that plate holds info he took one of her dishes as an example now to hold any info it must be patterned like embroidery it must be divided into circles like this and sections like a pie like this and then certain kinds of areas must be created like the pens she said you mean the format exactly he said the format so the question was this did we want big companies rich men making the shapes of peoples minds mae grew solemn i see she said sitting forward his strange long monks face looked at hers did she the yu en felt it had to prevent that so it came up with a different format it was a format that that would allow more companies more countries to join you didnt want the big companies to run peoples brains said mae yah he nodded so you pushed through the yu en test to be first and mae thought thats what killed people i didnt push it he said quietly all you central men you never say anything is your fault tuh the big men behave like the little villages said mae they walked back to kwans house mae tried to delay the central man as long as she could by talking about the deaths of mrs ken tui and old mrs tung until he began to show signs of exasperation as they walked the village children out well past bedtime flocked around him pin soon yelped you work for the government he gazed up at the central man in something like admiration yes are you rich no mr oz chuckled no one who works for the government is rich my brother is in the army and he is rich ah the army that is a different thing what rank is he pin soon looked blank a bit ashamed he didnt know he drives a truck he announced proudly the central man asked do you go to mrs chungs school yes yes he piped old madam death we call her the central man looked uncertain why is that because the education sign is an owl giggled dawn who still could not believe the stupidity of such a thing mae watched for it and saw the quick downward jerk of the mouth an embarrassment at a certain kind of awkwardness in the world it reminds him of himself mae thought i asked them to call me madam owl so that they would come to think in a different way about the owl lets hope it helps he replied he stopped at kwans gate and turned towards the children okay i am now visiting with mrs kwan and she will not want to be bothered with so many children so you all go home now we want to ask you more questions said dawn and put her hand experimentally into his pocket he pulled it out but did not slap it no candy he said his smile going thin i have none dawn giggled i was looking for money he was useless dawn i will box your ears warned mae dawn was laughing too hard twisting in the central mans grip dawn said mae her voice darkening okay okay dawn chuckled and pulled back mae said in her best madam owl voice all of you go home and go to bed go on it is the same everywhere the central man smiled then why havent you learned how to handle it mae thought she pulled the gate shut and barred it then the central man said an unexpected thing would you say that the opposition here falls along religious lines maes eyes boggled in the dark you had to be very careful raising questions like that even with no one around religious lines she asked he laughed aloud all right it has in many places some of the minority tribes are very superstitious about it they think the voices are ghosts or demons or something some of the muslims are very welcoming we have had no trouble like that said mae hmm well this village is one of the best ive seen said mr oz kwan was settled on her floor sitting crosslegged it looked as though she was writing letters she gathered them up quickly mae caught her gaze and kwans eyes twinkled she had done whatever it was needed doing to the tv she went to make tea cheerful and expansive the central man asked questions one after another after another they were as many as grains of rice in a terrace kwan yawned look you want answers to all of these things mae has done a question map what he sat forward oh many thanks kwan it was nothing said mae and she glared at kwan what do you mean it was nothing what did you do the central man asked kwan realized her mistake oh it was a trifle a question map means that you go and ask everyone in the village the same questions is that what you did mae still could not lie yes she admitted but it was about fashion but did it deal at all with the test what people felt about it can i see it maes eyes narrowed and she let them drill into kwans unseen behind him kwan did a quick abject bow of apology i gave it to kwan said mae still angry oh thats right now where did i put it you know i think luk must have thrown it out he thought it was just useless paper the central man begged please let me see it please the young man was very earnest you dont know how important it is no one talks to me i am supposed to do research but if i do it the way they want no one will talk to me but we need to know we need to know if we are to help you he looked back and forth between them i almost think i should believe you thought mae but you are a government spy he was in despair he ran his hand across his forehead most people are pretending it did not happen he said they are learning nothing they are not making ready it will come again as sure as winter comes it will come next april he twisted in his chair and i have to be able to tell the government they must spend money they must send teachers out into the villages to prepare the test was a disaster a disaster but going on air will be an even bigger one his fists clumsily punctured the air in frustration all right so i believe you thought mae you are a nice sad powerless boy why should i trust the government he was a boy but not a stupid one i wont tell anyone you showed it to me i know i know your neighbours will think you betrayed them to a government spy but let me see it so i know how it affected them i dont need their names but i do need to be able to go back and say to the government they need help we need to listen to people to find out how to help them his two fists were bunched together mae relented we feel the same way you and i he breathed out in relief but governments never help the likes of us we are too far away from everything that is why i need to see what you have done look the people in government have sons in the army you all have sons in the army do you think our sons wish the people harm or do they want the karzistani people to succeed not all of us are karzistani said kwan her face and voice were pinched mr oz had no argument against that he slumped slightly a terrible mistake has been made if the government wont help you who will we help ourselves said kwan youre about the only ones who have he muttered more to himself than to them my question map was about fashion said mae the very idea now struck her as absurd silly i did it to find out how the air would change my business what did you find out he asked quietly that the village has died mae said equally quietly mae realized that she had been hearing a clock ticking for some time what clock where how do you mean he asked i mean i mean our children will become like children everywhere else they will play computer games and learn everything and the very last of the old ways will go absolutely everything we know and love will go they will have supermarkets here and streetlights and the men will drive fords not vans or tractors mae looked around kwans room there definitely was no clock but it ticked mae heard the sirens again she turned slowly and looked and saw that outside kwans window the air was full of orange light as if their village life were burning she knew she was staring at the future again she stood and walked as if on a ship at sea and stared out from kwans high window there was a blimp with neon lights advertising an electronic address tethered to the courtyard gate there were tables full of people in the courtyard this house was now a restaurant the streetlights were yellow and they fell far away all across the valley and up the other side and there were moving lights of cars all over the valley and drifting music from everywhere mae kwans voice was anxious mae her hand was on maes shoulder mae started to speak in a voice that was not entirely her own it was partly old mrs tungs all the old songs she said and the old good manners all that will go from down below in the restaurant a drunk laughed loudly we used to work all together in circles and take turns to bring the lunches and all of us who could read wed recite the poems for the ladies not not pop songs not some song in english but our own great great poetry words that had meaning we would read the mevlana and mae or mrs tung or someone started to cry listen to the reed how it tells a tale mae mae kwan was saying over and over mae come back we made our own clothes we smoked our own tobacco we didnt worry about hairspray and makeup what counted was how strong a woman was how much she could lift in winter wives cooked in teams one set of wives making the soup all day another set of wives making the goulash all day everybody ate no one was lonesome on the first day the muerain would call on god and give us wisdom and the next day the priest in his robes would bless the food and on the third day the communist read from his little red book and in kizuldah all three were the same man mae watched her hands wringing a tea towel over and over and were destroying it we have to destroy it to live kwan was speaking quietly but she was turned towards the central man you asked me if anyone else died during the test mae did she was in someone elses head and they died and mae came back a different person she gets like this she joins the dead she loses herself she was always so beautiful your test did that to my friend im very angry at your test im very angry at all you people and mae saw on kwans stern face a single slow tear the central man sat with a hand covering his mouth was that true what kwan had said was she mae in that condition im sorry the central man managed to whisper huh said kwan a lot of use that is the noise from the restaurant below faded this room became clearer as if someone had turned on many extra lights mae decided something i will let you see my question map she said back in maes house mr oz read the question map shaking his head over and over mae said i will let you have it to take away if you tell me everything you know about air mr oz read the question map shaking his head over and over mae kept on yu en gates all that stuff he looked up at her how he said the quantitative data has been entered into a spreadsheet and computed the qualitative material how did you know how to do this this is a structured piece of research in air there is a kru in air the central man went very still indeed you go back into air you are not supposed to be able to do that when i had my accident to get out i made myself an airmail address how did you do that its my name theyre not still aircasting he said perplexed the kru is still there he shouldnt be hes copyright he agreed to do it only for the test his mouth did its downward twist you people said mae you dont really know what air is do you youre right said the central man we dont he explained the kru was a great businessman a rival of the company that made the gates format he had donated his expertise as a demonstration for the test of the yu en format the deal wasnt that he would go on forever giving away everything he knew for free everyone had assumed it would end with the test mrs tung is always with me said mae mr oz left going across the courtyard mae heard old mrs ken greet him with all the gusto that five riels a night could purchase mae smelt chicken cooking for the generous guest she sat down and wondered if kuei would be able to visit her now with all of his house in an uproar i am like someone in mourning of course you are in mourning said old mrs tung it was a dull kind voice we all want an anchor we all want to turn the corner to go home but home always goes away home leaves us and we get older and then older again and farther away from home from ourselves we die before we die my dear we go from village beauties to old crones from mischievous children to weary adults from ripe maidens full of love to embittered used women full of bile and all we have is love with nothing to love just the love aching out reaching out and never clasping love in return just the reeds just the swallows just the mist in the air the sunlight in the air just the sound of the wind that never changes that is all the home we have dear old mrs tung sleep my dear for all the beauty we have lost and all the beauty we will lose chapter the next morning mr oz and mae found two groups of armed men in mrs wings courtyard on one side were mr shen mr koi and mr masud they were all either eloi or oldfashioned muslims against them stood mr mack mr pin mr ali and old mr doh shen said we are bringing this to a stop mae read the two sides mr ali was of sunnis party he was here to help save kwans machine an alliance against shen so quickly mr ali had brought his own gun that would mean shen had already threatened mr haseem there was a clicking sound lean brown hard mr wing stood on his steps he held a russian rifle with the hammer pulled back he said that does not belong to you shen from out behind him stepped enver atakoloo he also had a gun mae stepped forward and gave both parties a bow of respect she said quietly to shen bring what to a stop teacher shen pointed at the tv we dont want that in our village i am sure it is for you men to decide mae said sweetly like a cat with humans she had a voice she only ever used with men but teacher consider you wont be able to keep out the air when it comes the central man felt the time had come for him to intervene with his full authority mrs chung is right the tv will help you prepare for april mae wanted to smile at him and weep at the same time poor boy this is happening because you have arrived you will be invisible to them like an angel untouchable but also invisible mr shens answer was simply to walk to the tv with his riflebutt raised to smash it the sky ripped open guns had always sounded like firecrackers to mae a pop and a snap she had always been surprised by how small they seemed now trapped within the courtyard the sound of a gunblast battered around the enclosed space mae jumped covered her ears please god no one has been hurt she looked up the guns were pointed at the sky from all around the village birdcalls billowed up into the air screeching shrieking and cawing everything in the courtyard was frozen no one moved mae said at least that got the birds off the rice it was the first thing she thought mr doh mr ali and mr mack burst into laughter its true said mae confused mr mack nodded yes it was shen stood trembling rifle still raised mr wing warned him dont be a vandal shen the government man is here to see it you will end up in court and it will not be because anyone betrayed you to them eh dont be foolish shen was pointing it was hard to tell if he pointed at wing or kwan you stay away from my wife he demanded all the laughter stopped what wing looked perplexed what madness now schoolteacher silence from the western reaches of the village came the roaring of a motorcycle kwan stepped out from her diwan onto the landing he means me she said suloi and i are working together on a project mae felt a stirring of misgiving kwan and shens wife when what were they doing there is something my friend kwan has chosen not to tell me the roar of the motorcycle grew louder sezens boyfriend came through the open gate on his cycle sezen riding behind another bad boy from the desiccated village kurulmushkoy followed his machine black with grease sezens boyfriend hopped off pudgy and carrying a length of pipe sezens boyfriend said the machine stays shen was helpless he looked to the old men of his party you see the elements who will triumph from this thing shen started to weep look at them they think this is a hong kong movie guns and motorcycles this is how the world will now be with women running rampant with foolish ideas bad children running wild a division seemed to break inside maes head as if blood had found a fresh way to flow she suddenly remembered the angry driven child within teacher shen she saw him as a little soul to be protected her eyes blurred over as if milk were inside them and her throat felt gnarled rumbly it has always been thus mae heard herself say as if she were sitting back and listening to someone else the voice from inside her spoke there has always been one big change after another but we always think our first world was permanent shen my little bright boy your world came just after the russians drove out the chinese before you were born the eloi were fighting a war against the chinese guerrillas would take over our houses our husbands were shot as rebels for sheltering them we had to give our grain to the red guards before that it was the village strongman there is no old way to go back to shen my brightest little boy are you still too young to see that shen was looking at a ghost the tears seemed to have frozen on his face going creamy with salt in the sunlight mae began to feel giddy divorced from her own body her fingers were numb you cannot bring back the old world which old world do you want the central man was staring at her mack doh they all looked at their shoes maes forehead was covered in thick sweat the corner of her vision went dark and gritty i have to sit down she said and fainted mae woke up in kwans guest room lined with cushions grimfaced kwan was mopping her brow we saved the tv she said there was business at hand mae responded we had sunnis people on our side kwan nodded briskly i fight against my brother until my cousin attacks him the central man frightened them everything frightens them said kwan with real scorn i never had any respect for teachers mae chuckled you hid it well at school kwan shrugged they held the keys what are you and mrs shen up to kwan paused worked her mouth i should have told you she said mae was ready info lust it made people hide things kwan sighed suloi and i have put screens on the net mae didnt know what she meant we put screens about our people on tv mae sat up in wonder you did what kwan stared back at her a little bleary with guilt a little obstreperous what business was it of maes you sit up youre well enough now to see she said she stood up not waiting for mae to follow mae walked through the shuttered room following kwan out into the porch the tv had been moved up from the courtyard to the landing something had scratched its side below on the courtyard stones a dark stain sweltered blood grease kwans fingers danced on a keyboard words in english rattled on the screen audio karz output eloic input kwan ordered volume down then she gave orders in the language of her people her language flapped and cawed like a raven and seemed to make kwan into a different person less considered more urgent up came a photograph of eloi embroidery the television murmured as if it had a secret the eloi people are an ancient race now living in the mountainous region of karzistan karzistan is on the borders of china tibet and khazakstan these screens have been created by the eloi people themselves the screens offered arts under arts suloi and kwan sang in high straining voices in video they told old stories while english words danced around them there were screens of tattoo patterns kwans patient voice explained their meaning mae recognized the neatness and complexity of the tattoo outlines kwan had drawn them the patterns like kwan were restrained and somehow private next the meaning of the embroidered eloi breastplates was explained these collars were worn by courting men and their betrothed note the television said that the beads all form straight parallel lines symbolizing two lives in conjunction photographs of the old forts tales of eloi heroes against the cossacks the turks and the chinese a history of war a section on the heroes meaning the men who fought against the communists few people in the west even knew of the conflict it lasted for generations and ended in defeat for the communists and the creation of a new republic we thought it would be for all the people not just the karzistani majority behind kwans voice shepherds began to sing they sang of heroism about living in the hills and praying to all their various gods smoking thin cigarettes in freezing winds under clear stars heroes rolled rocks down onto the heads of troops only to find that the crushed bodies were those of their cousins conscripted into the communist armies photographs in smeared blackandwhite were shown handsome young eloi dead stared up at the sky their chins missing handsome young eloi alive around fires their eyes burning with this message imay die but it will be worth it we are the people who stopped the chinese who stopped the arabs the eloi are the worlds great secret force against tyrants where did kwan get these photos then mae remembered kwans father dear old mr kowoloia dear old mr kowoloia must have been a terrorist kwan had these photos she has kept them secret from all of us so this is why she wanted the central man gone kwan is this wise mae asked the site is locked against any instructions in karzistani only in eloi or in english on came the video of the karzistani woman in her new balshang apartment kwans recorded voice grew harsher listen closely to the eloi woman torn away from her people praising refrigerators her voice is rehearsed her eyes fearful for she knows her people are being destroyed mae looked over her shoulder what if the government man should hear she looked back and saw kwans hands were two pale fists the skin over the knuckles dead white with rage we appeal to the world do not let this great and graceful people disappear from history all you need do is show that you are interested in us as you once were when we controlled the passes through which wound the silk road to china sleep ordered kwan mae breathed out ill keep that spy away no wonder you had not told me tell the truth mae i am jealous said mae i had vague plans to learn how to do that you went and did it how after you left said kwan from four am to seven am every day kwan nodded suloi and me together wing did not know he did not care said kwan and stood up graceful dignified eloi thought mae every particle of her soul is eloi and i did not know that so i did not know her like her screens she is locked away you must speak eloi to have the key will will you teach me how to do that mae burned to know kwan looked bleary now from confession and the exhaustion that follows the tv will do a better job of that than i can she said she took maes hand and slapped it as if in apology do not be surprised you are my dear mae but you are also chinese in the end the enemy kwan lit a cigarette she pulled a bit of stray tobacco from the tip of her tongue the real question is what is the nature of our alliance with sunni mae shook her head this was all moving very quickly not very strong she replied kwan turned to mae do you want to destroy sunni she tries to destroy me said mae do you wish to see her destitute mae shrugged no i dont wish anyone in the village to be destitute why kwan was really very strange she seemed to uncoil like a serpent pushing herself away from the tv box kwan sighed tv does not come free you know mae waited it comes like calls on a mobile phone every time you choose something you pay our government subsidy pays mr wings telephone bills so the tv gets used for the entire village but the telephone company will charge everyone else we administer for them kwan unfolded a blue officiallooking piece of paper i told faysal haseem that but you know how he is uh you charge twice you try to trick me i no pay you kwan did a remarkably good job of imitating him so i didnt tell him again the first months bill is fifty riels mae felt nothing or rather she felt a balancing that left the scales at zero we need him as an ally what i was going to do was let it get to one hundred and twentyfive riels and then say my husbands company will cover these costs even though we warned you we will do this if you write off the loan to chung mae that was very kind said mae she could imagine it sunnis face held like it was fragile porcelain as mae kept the money without paying it back she could see faysal haseem glower and she could see herself in debt to wing kwan in other ways we will drop all this rivalry said mae in the end you had to support your own against the government or even the telephone company kwan smiled pleased i thought so sunnis tv set was on even at eleven at night it flickered in mr haseems courtyard showing a fashion parade mae hid her smile is that as far as sunni had got with it to choose picture shows only one person was watching mrs ali turned in her chair saw mae and blinked good evening mrs chung mrs ali said after a moment mrs ali mae bowed i wish to speak to mrs haseemmaam mrs ali considered i will tell her you are here i will need to talk to her alone said mae mrs ali did not respond except to push her chair back and walk into sunnis kitchen in the courtyard the talent chattered it would seem that bright colours once again adorn fashion in the west could it be our own local green valley designers are in the lead mae heard real voices murmuring in the kitchen she heard the rumble of mr haseem but she judged he would stay out of this unless there was some kind of argument if there were some kind of argument it would give him an excuse to be abusive he would not wish to take part without that chance mae was not here to apologize she was here to get both sides to see sense and out of that sense to get advantage for herself mrs ali was in the kitchen doorway outlined in electric light please come in she said in a quiet voice she stood away from the door and reassured sunnis whining dog as mae approached mae gave her a polite nod and entered sunnis room a modern stove had replaced the old brazier it seeped raw gas there were new white curtains in the tiny windows and a new metal top to the sink all of these things meant fresh expense sunni sat behind her table perfect as always her hair a motorcycle helmet of crisp hard shellac she looked tense insecure and arrogant mae found in herself a strain of pity for her and brought that to the surface hello sunni she said i hope it will be more of a pleasure to have you in my house than it was the last time mae gestured may i sit sunni nodded yes dismissively last time both of us were angry both of us said things i find life moves quickly these days that night seems years ago now sunni made no reply she certainly did not agree i find after the events of this morning that we have more in common than the disagreements which divide us a brief moue flickered across sunnis face it was true but it did not please her we could cooperate for the common good we both need the village to be prepared for what is to come a possible agreement is this we both do all we can to help our neighbours learn to use this new thing in the meantime both of us are free to pursue our commercial interests sunni was not really up to this kind of bargaining mae was well aware that she was talking like a man it was the only way to avoid the pits of emotion on either side and keep all the issues separate you speak as if we were in politics said sunni finally do you not think that we are you and i both value the future we are rivals yes but we certainly do not want the tvs destroyed both of us are intelligent women from the same village and we do not want our village to fall behind that is true agreed sunni there is something else said mae something i did not know until today and what might that be sunni sounded unimpressed she perhaps thought mae was trying to be mysterious there are telephone charges for using that thing mae pointed into the courtyard from the courtyard breathless commentary in a piping female voice continued again we see a new trend towards colour modern women have found time for joyful expression i know said sunni do you know how much sunnis face was blank i am sure my husband does they are always on the lookout for special touches something new which makes even the simplest dress different expressing a new facet of their personality after a year it could be as much as six hundred riels mae paused waited sunni was very good she did not flinch she gave no sign she began to sweep nonexistent crumbs of food from the table into her cupped hand still in silence she raised her eyebrows as if to say so what is your proposition for example this dress expresses the models interest in third world issues mae took the plunge mr wing can ensure that you do not have to pay them he can arrange things so that they go to his account and the government will pay them sunnis visage did not alter in any respect in exchange he wants the warfare between us to stop there is no warfare sunni warned mae no there is none mae quoted sunnis leaflet now that certain parties have been uncovered as offering false advice that is what you wrote about me sunni it is one thing to set yourself up in business it is another to call me a fraud and to invite your friends to mock me i will remind you of a certain incident on your screen said sunni darkening indeed i have not forgotten that is part of the war it must stop sunni while we play village games the world is beating down our door while we try to destroy each other it will destroy us i will demand a full public apology said sunni i will demand that we both apologize to each other in public at the same time that way everyone knows the tv people are united and i will need individual assessment of what you say about charges mae nodded i can bring the government man here no sunni not to make trouble please hear me out i can make it look like a friendly visit and you can ask him yourself the tv is new i will say you have just bought it what kind of charges would i pay more crumbsweeping there was hurt behind sunnis eyes there is one more thing sunni the loan the terms of the loan will change it becomes interestfree and this was something mae was keeping from kwan she did not want to be beholden to kwan sunni went still altogether you know i cannot agree to that by myself you can perhaps talk to your husband i will see just remember sunni the bills mount up all the time that thing is on sunni sighed oh it was like wearing the wrongsize shoe for her to be in a weak position she was not used to cutting losses sunni said i could always have a word with the central man and mention to him whatever it is mrs wing and mrs shen are making oh groaned mae in utter weariness i am talking about an alliance that will benefit everyone and you threaten me sunni how can the village learn if it has to ration the tv two machines will be much better than one cant you see we both win if we agree to this or yes we can both lose badly very badly perhaps one of us will go to jail but which one of us will be beloved in the village sunni if you are known to have betrayed mr wing to the government sunnis gaze was not direct i did not say that you said you would tell the central man sunni you meant that you could betray kwan and get the wings into trouble didnt you she was silent sunni from the beginning i have not wanted to be your enemy if you tell yourself the tale of what has happened you will see that the first hostile move was your husbands and i am not always the most pleasant person in the world when i am angry so yes i behaved badly all sunni wanted was to be first and mae was always ahead of her even now she had lost for mae was the first to propose peace and in such a way as to garner advantage curiously enough that was sufficient revenge talk to your husband sunni that is necessary the terms are simple we are friendly rivals in business we both work to teach the village we both work against the party that wants the tvs off and as a gesture the loan becomes interestfree it was all a bit of pretence mae was being clear not for sunni but for mr haseem whom she was reasonably certain could hear every word mae sat and waited sunnis face was closed not exactly in shame but in hurt how she wanted to be the village leader the maam of the village but kwan would always be that sunni would never be free not until kwan died and by then it would probably be the turn of an or someone like her mae found she did indeed pity sunni all that time with nothing to do because her husband would not let her work mae pitied her lack of application sunni mae knew was not as smart as others sunni said i have the better fashion sense mae pondered this for a moment i think you are probably right sunni for rich ladies with money to spend you are probably right but you know i think i will be the one to make the money mae chuckled to herself you are certainly younger and better looking too sunni wasnt laughing sunni was not loved by a beautiful man who cooked dinner for her who had wanted her since he had been sixteen could sunni stand to sleep with that harsh husband to be jealous is futile we are all human we all live in pain and sunni lives in more than most that does not give her the right to steal my shoes or stand on my toes sunni i know you are very busy mrs ali sometimes visits my lessons at mrs wings perhaps she could tell me what you decide since you will not want to visit my hovel or risk coming to mrs wings is it really as much money as you say sunni asked ah money the juice of life at least yours their eyes finally met yes sunni it is mae stood up to go they exchanged polite greetings and mae left outside in the street mae felt a wild joy swing out of her like when she had been a schoolgirl and flung her bag of books into the air she was free of the interest on that loan they would pay back twentyfive riels a year and use the money as capital she could use it to buy cloth or joe could invest in the farm joe would bring back more money they would be comfortable and happy she thought again that she must put distance between herself and mr ken otherwise the fabric of her life would be torn she would tell kuei that she would always love him but that it was impossible to continue she would hold the memory of him always to her like pressed flowers hidden in schoolbooks like clever old mrs tung and her secret love and she would teach the tv and she would pick the brains of the central man mae would learn to put up a screen too just like kwan only kwan would wonder how she had learned so quickly a screen of what of fashion of course the whole world would want fashion from a mountaintop in midasia that was the very thing they lacked mae laughed at herself and went wheeeeeee and spun and saw kwans screens of eloi embroidery and suddenly she saw the screen slightly different it offered eloi embroidery for sale the years most unusual fashion statement expressing the models interest in third world issues maes smile was fading instead excitement seemed to grip her stomach native eloi embroidery unavailable except through these treasured outlets either broaden what you make or extend your geography the kru had whispered videos could be sent for free to the big stores she could tell the big stores about her eloi fashion and if they liked it fine then she could buy the cloth and the bead reduce your risk at every opportunity so she only makes them when she is paid individually tailored to meet your requirements oh oh oh oh oh oh her effrontery made her giggle sell to singapore tokyo taiwan maybe even paris or new york the calls would be free from wings magic free tv mae will send her offer with her pretty pictures but it will not be fashion she is offering she will offer something real something from the mountain something from a longforgotten beautiful people love and ideas how she loved her life now visions of her screens danced in her head she saw kwan and shen suloi twirl in their embroideries she heard the words native eloi beauties model the traditional wear of their people this is the traditional wedding pattern the yellow signs promise fidelity the blue understanding of foibles maes head seemed to swim as if the air itself were a river with currents she felt herself picked up as if flying only a few inches above the road and suddenly she saw her screens very clearly indeed mae saw her screens in fact she was looking at the tv in a room at kwans house not far into the future sunlight came through the window her new screens glowed in a video wing kwan turned modeling an eloi collar this future would happen why then sitting in that room in the future did mae feel sick in her stomach with loss why was she living with the wings mae shivered and it was gone this future full of promise and loss she went into her courtyard there were two men outside her doorway a flashlight shone in her face there she is said a voice who is it mae asked blinking she saw movement and she knew who it was from the way both bodies moved joe was back shen stood with him what is all this joe demanded what is all this about a man chapter the world stopped like a truck what is what babbled mae looking back and forth between the two men what do i do what do i say do i deny it do i act like i have no idea shen the serpent looked at her with eyes that seemed green he seemed to be made of stained green copper like the statues in town of forgotten generals she hated him she knew why he had done it shen had decided to destroy her you know woman said joe and strode forward and hit mae in the face the flesh of her cheek was like a pond into which a rock is hurled it rose and rippled and washed about her eyes mae felt her nose give just to the point of breaking mae allowed herself to be knocked backwards she landed and lay still to buy time for thinking joe joe she heard shen say gently restraining wake up woman joe demanded he was leaning over her she could feel his breath you cannot pretend with me his voice broke he shook her mae kept her head limp that uh that was premature said shen she can answer nothing now she is pretending i know the vixen said joe look at that bruise said shen maes mind raced shen had seen only shoes and a shadow through the curtains in her room can i undermine his story he is a feeble man he will hate it that i have been hit can i make him retract through guilt and joe joe is weak as well but he will be full of pain i bet hes come back with no money mae groaned she let the broken flesh and its black swelling speak for her she moaned and started to cry and held her cheek she sat up on the cobbles of the yard streaked with mud and wept the two men stood over her one now constraining the other joe was shouting well might you weep well might you weep she was weeping for the happiness the happiness that had been hers just a minute before mae wept for her marriage her love of mr ken her business in the end mae wept for death many things would now die little baby possibilities that she had been nursing it was life dog eat dog joe shes not up to answering much said shen he turned and tried to help her up come on mae this has to be gone through how was she going to play it she could lie try to disguise it play the wounded and confused wife but there was one problem shen had truth on his side and knew it she saw that in his eyes fashion expert that she was her powers of dissimulation were not up to it she did not have the heart for it she felt a gathering presence in her breast a tension she had decided to draw power by telling the truth she did not take shens hand so shen so you expected my poor farmer of a husband to react like a schoolteacher did you ruin lives but avoid making a mess is that what you thought you could do mae rolled over and sat on the cobbles near the ground as if the ground could nurture her she looked at shen only what you are doing is very evil she told him shen warned her i am not the one who has done harm here you are doing this because you want to stop the machine mae said it wearily you do not care about joe you will destroy him destroy me so be it it is true joe she said turning a throb of silence whore whispered joe whores do it for money i did it for love she still sat on the ground you are not ashamed joe was failing a bit ashamed to be caught i am the only woman in the village who has been caught she nursed her jaw she would be a sight the two men rocked slightly she held forth while she still had the chance what do you do when you are away joe eh when you are drunk and looking like a comedian you go with women he looked comic now hair askew eyes bugged with both shock and sadness he would not easily forgive being made to look so foolish no he said in a wan voice i do not his voice became fierce on the last line oh joe it was probably true you probably did not more fool you who was it joe demanded shen said that does not matter restraining joe again mae spoke oh no you dont want the man to get into trouble do you shen you feel for the man and more mess would weigh on your conscience who is he demanded joe her foolish joe going dark fists clenched shen sighed does it make a difference which was exactly what mae was going to say i was so happy joe was weeping he pushed the palms of his hands into his eye sockets i had looked all over for work it took weeks finally i found it and there was this stupid thing and i had to go home all i wanted to do was go home i was happy too whispered mae oh yes said joe snatching away his hands you were skipping back from your cock you whore the listening lights of the village were on they reflected on the walls on the clouds maes eyes were on the teacher who do you think you have made more unhappy shen me or him shen did not answer it was me said a male voice and that was ken kuei oh fine oh good you come in to take your share to take your part of the blame to protect me just when it all was quieting down when joe and i might have talked why is goodness so stupid there he was her handsome stupid man against her comic sad one ranged in orange light like fire to burn joes face said in horror mae could see his thoughts my neighbour ken kuei mae could see joe think we will meet each other every day shen had covered his mouth in shock of course he would not have known who it was mae said feeling proud shen i am sorry joe said kuei i have always loved your wife oh even better how long yelped joe he looked in horror between them how long have you two done this not long said mae shaking her head in a quiet voice is lung my son squealed joe oh best yet better than anything she could have dreamed the one thing right in joes life was his boy of course she said but she could not speak loudly she had begun to tremble deeply inside she felt like being sick again lung is your son she tried to say again you pig wailed joe and launched himself at mr ken no said shen and tried to stop joe and to maes immense pleasure joe hit shen full in the face with his fist shen spun holding his nose blood spurting from it mae found that part of her wanted to laugh there will be news enough in this night to keep the village going for a year we will be destroyed will all lose station dignity voice joe tried to hit mr ken kuei caught his fist i dont want to fight you joe oh dont you thought mae you will not have much choice joe swung again and connected joe we could not help mr ken did not finish as a second blow was struck it is like a toy that you let go and watch whizzing off until its batteries run down joe wanted to fight joe wanted to die mr ken wanted to talk the two agendas were not compatible joe swung again and this time kuei swung back youre good at hitting women said kuei and swung again joe was going to get beaten up oh well thought mae here we go mae started to scream she did it quite deliberately almost without emotion to rouse the village to the point of being desperate to see what was happening they would stop the fight the scandal would be immense stop it youre killing him she wailed choosing her words carefully that truly did it beyond her gates doors bashed open footsteps clattered men shouted women cried aloud old mrs ken came running out of her house clutching at her bathrobe mr oz came running out hopping into his trousers panicstricken he trampolined towards his golden van to make sure it was safe the gate boomed back against the wall and there stood mr kemal with a pitchfork what is going on here mr kemal demanded there was shen bloodied kuei and joe fighting and a beaten woman on the ground what is this brawl demanded mr kemal teacher shen i am surprised to see you involved in this the dismayed expression on shens face almost made it worthwhile almost you should have stayed unconscious advised old mrs tung mae had to leave her house and go to live with kwan it would have been impossible to stay with joe and even more impossible that she move in with mr ken joe would have murdered them in their bed maes brother arrived about a half hour after the fight demanding she move in with him i do not wish to do that said mae she was flinging her clothes into a bag as joe was comforted by young mr doh you have no choice said her brother jumei followed her all the way up the hill making demands he did not even offer to help mae with her bags it is all right brother i got myself into this mess i certainly did not expect any help from my family she turned and left him standing openmouthed my god whispered kwan when she saw maes bruised face kwan let her sleep late about midday she came up to maes attic room with tea and sat with her will you leave the village kwan asked normally that would have been the answer mae and ken would have packed up and gone away to live in the city balshang probably god what a fate to bake in those sweltering tower blocks with no money no air no friends until they ended up hating each other as was normal mae shook her head i have to help here kwan held her hand you are not in a good position to help mae shrugged i will still have my school no one would come to it said kwan her eyes were sad her mouth firm she held her friends hand so mae had lost the school too she looked at kwans hand the hand was the village all she had left of it mae loved the village the fields she had worked in all summer were her husbands they were not hers to work any longer the rice she had nurtured watered with her sweat was hers no longer the house she had cleaned was no longer hers the pans the brazier all the old spoons that house had seen her through three children she had stirred the laundry and the soup alike as the babies fought and wailed around her ankles her home she nearly lost even the rough old sewing machine mr wing fetched it for her and had to remind joe that legally it belonged to kwan the sewing machine now sat in the corner next to maes suitcases they looked small in the empty loft room the only furniture was a couch that kwan and wing had wrestled into the space the roof had a window through which sunlight streamed wing had taped clear plastic where panes of glass had been everything was coated in a fine white dust at midday just under the tiles it sweltered in winter she would freeze swallows cried urgently to be fed from nests under the eaves bloody shen said mae joes come back with no money and who will buy dresses from me now i dont even have the loan to pay for any cloth mae sighed and shook herself still nothing broke i kept all my teeth such was peasant luck joe has been getting drunk with young mr doh said kwan people say that he lost his job through drinking siao and old mr chung will work on the construction mae groaned for him he had come back with nothing to find nothing what are they saying about shen to me nothing my dear i am your champion there are people who will walk past me as if i am not there mae pondered this for a moment what was her position in this house she would have to make some kind of contribution both in money and in attention and gratitude how long could she stay she needed to stay but every friendship can wear out god i hate being poor said mae poverty afflicts everything in the end everything that should be sacrosanct love friendship the chance to dream how you live with whom you live you can stay here as long as you like said kwan quickly to get it out of the way if i get my business back together can i run it from here kwan faltered ever so slightly she saw cloth sewing machines strangers coming into her house i can work from one of the barns i know its difficult kwan fought her way to honesty i have to ask mr wing if not well things would be bad if not well things had always been bad and a dishonoured woman in a village had to settle for what she could get could you tell joe for me about the tv charges how i bargained with sunni and that the interest on the loan has been waived that should ease his mind a bit kwan nodded and worked maes fingers in her own you are still fond of joe of course i lived with him for thirty years and mr ken the saddest thing of all is that i had decided to end it kwan sighed and patted her arm you rest she said mae fought her way to honesty as well there is something else she said kwan could not help putting her hand on her forehead what now i think i am pregnant said mae sezen came to call still blinking with black hair in her eyes sezen said you sit in bed you have work to do mae was not in a position to admonish her for rudeness merely visiting mae had put sezen in the position of being owed i will start work again soon said mae your face is a mess but no one has to see it said sezen musa and i can get the cloth for you no problem im not doing badgirl clothes said mae of course not said sezen just whatever you need the cloth for mae adjusted to this in silence sezen added aprons oven gloves things people really use what is it with you sezen why cant i understand what you want why in a word are you sticking by me sezen jerked sideways in an angry harnessed way that was entirely new i have bad news she said and her jerking body expressed impatience with herself for not knowing how to begin han an has gone off to work for sunni i saw the two of them still going around with clipboards trying to look as if you had not done it first mae judged the seriousness of the blow finally she said that is the least of my worries shes a traitor said sezen pouting with scorn mae thought she was going to defend an but found she could not be bothered yes hmm shed better stay clear of me or i will pull out all her hair musa and i can go this afternoon to buy your cloth but we will need the money to do that her hard brown face her demanding dark eyes mae felt her deadened face strain towards a smile there is no money sezen she said the girl blinked mae kept explaining the loan was to my husband its his money we will do something else then sezen said her jaw thrusting out we wondered mae that government man he must be good for money said sezen you mean i should ask the government man for money mae felt outdone in audacity sezen shrugged he keeps saying how advanced we are meaning you so ask she sniffed and then said i cant have you going soft like my mother i wont do that said mae it was a promise in the evening mr oz called his eyes said how could you do this to me this is a serious setback to our programme he said he tutted light caught his spectacles i was relying on you to be our model if only id known replied mae i would not have fallen in love i have to write my report mr oz swayed as if under a burden i have nothing to say except to tell them it is all a mess everywhere when hasnt it been said mae and thought how could they send a boy like you out on his own down below on kwans landing the men were gathered around the box mae could hear the barking announcer and a sighing crowd the sound of futbol on tv can you continue your school mr oz demanded can you still teach others mae pondered just how much she needed this young man she wanted to tell him off my main worry now mr oz is my own life i have lost a home and a husband he understood that and winced and rubbed the back of his neck mr oz do you want to help he looked up as eagerly as a puppy thats what im here to do then teach me how to make screens so i can sell my goods mae sat up on her bed i want to specialize and spread my geography i want to make things to sell abroad to specialist markets that will express the buyers interest in third world issues i want to sell my goods to new york singapore tokyo the government man was in love his pulse had quickened his eyes gleamed this was what he yearned to report yes yes i can do that for you i can set them up i can show you how i can show you how to tell people how to find your screens mae nodded but i am now a poor woman on my own with no money to invest you are from the government do you have any way the government can help me he paused to think not by myself but but i can help yes i can help i can find forms yes i can help you fill them in but you know we will have to make a case to get the grant i have a case said mae the central man to his credit was ready to move lets go now he said beaming he really was fresh from the cradle mr oz i am a fallen woman i cannot go out to those men and chase them away from the machine down below the crowd sounds roared towards a crescendo no shouted one of the men their team was losing they would be in a bad mood thats okay we can use mine said the government man enthusiastic and oblivious my van has a computer they would have to walk out through the landing the sound of the men drunken below rose up like the odour of a stew mae climbed down the ladder from the loft to the staircase and from there into the carpeted diwan that led to the landing her stomach was a knot of nerves she felt as if a layer of skin had been stripped from her just past the stone arch the men were crowded onto the narrow landing the barking voice finished and there was a swelling of jolly music the game had just ended allah please make them all decide to go home the men yawned chairs scraped on stone mr oz started to walk mae grabbed his sleeve and he looked back at her in surprise he finally understood that she was afraid okay now a movie someone said chairs scraped again and suddenly there was bollywood music mae gave in and nodded yes to mr oz she tried to be invisible she tried to waft forward like a ghost onto the landing men were crowded around the tv mae glimpsed among them mr ali mr pin and both old and young mr dohs joe was not there mae tried to slip around the backs of the chairs the air seemed full of thick halfcooked bread to delay her tuh chortled mr doh in something like disgust mae did not look around theres a funny smell said mr ali kwan should not keep pigs in her house mr pin agreed ah you should keep pigs in the basement they like rolling in shit the men chuckled mae was nearly at the head of the stairs it would be easy to push her down them the heat of their bodies warms the house said mr ali it seems hot pigs fuck even government men hot pigs must be killed said old mr doh the very air seemed to shudder mae had to glance back then in case the time had come to run young mr doh had a hand on his fathers arm he looked at mae in alarm and jerked his head towards the gate get out of here quick mae thought you are joes best friend and yet it is you who still treats me like a human being mae scurried forward her feet bouncing down the steps like a ball gentlemen said mr oz mr sincere good evening i am glad to see that you make such good use of the tv mr oz stood with his legs planted apart and across the top of the stairs mae ran mae waited in her old courtyard trembling in the dark she had bolted her gate and crouched behind it she had to hope that joe did not come outside or mr ken there was a knock it is me murmured mr oz ssh said mae and lifted the latch more gently than if it had been a blanket over a baby they tiptoed to the barn and closed the door inside his van mr oz said i will drive you back home if those dolts are still there you can sleep here in the van mae slumped into the seat she felt a weakness in her belly and had to hold her head for a moment as nausea passed over her she knew the signs yes she was pregnant are you all right mr oz asked mae was outraged this this youngster had only just noticed that she had been beaten bruised and cast out no i am not all right she said angry oz was used to kindness being returned and was confused he scowled oh for heavens sake stop being such a child and help me if you are going to he jerked somewhere just under his lungs and leaned forward he plugged in wires and something whined to life there was a tiny box with a flipup screen a kind of minitv go to info ask for government he said mr oz took mae into new provinces of info there were rules regulations advice offers of service all from her own government up came a voiceform the voiceform kept asking impertinent questions are you over forty how many children do you have all over twenty years old any dependants what is your annual income riels riels it offered no figure that was low enough mae murmured riels is that true asked mr oz quietly if you say too much you may be disqualified for some things so she told the truth one hundred riels a year the central man looked sad but his eyes did not catch hers okay let me take over here he said what do you want the money for and mae told him to buy modern oatmeal cloth that rich people like and to pay others to embroider it with eloi patterns and then tell the west and the big east that the cloth was a statement about third world issues mr oz chuckled at that and looked around at her face then he spoke into the machine translating what she had told him into official talk it sounded to mae like a news item terribly important like the way rich people talked about themselves but it didnt move or excite her thats boring she said he shrugged mae imagined someone at the other end listening bored to her answers and she reached into the patterns reached into the new glowing links inside her head and spoke with the knowledge of the kru without being the kru the proposal is to use the power of the net to extend the reach of local crafts skills to specialist niche markets most especially america singapore and japan mr oz turned around and blinked at her this will not be traditional direct marketing efforts will be focused on information finders of various types particularly fashion or craft networks he warned her dont use the word eloi traditional local crafts thats what these are do you have a horseman horsemen in karzistan had traded for centuries in the most mobile currency of all horseflesh they used their commodity also to bear news where there were shortages of horses or any other goods other traders paid them for such news horsemen like fashion experts had always been in the information business now they were people who were paid to sell and sort info they were called something else in english but in karz they were called info horsemen mr oz had names and addresses ready you have to give an address for a horseman they dont think youve done your homework otherwise he added an official report to her application it was a separate file attached to her application his voice validated his identity this is a core project for the green valleyred mountain area he said its proponent has taken a lead in instructing the village people on the net and the coming of the air she has founded the swallow school a project to train locals in info skills she has also used a wellconstructed question map to determine the views of local people on air the proposed scheme will demonstrate to this community the value of the net it will be the best possible advancement for the aims of both the yu en air project and the central bureau of information technologyministry of developments joint declaration of the taking wing initiative then he sent the form i think well get it mr oz said i cannot imagine a better case he looked calm sated knowing how fine it would look on his own record so you get something too just as well how do i become an info horseman mae asked he looked around at her and for once his eyes were adult you would need to know very much more than you do now he replied can i learn it he sighed you would need to know how wires work and money and banking mae thrust out her chin i have my kru and the people most of all you need to know the people the people in those worlds it is not for me to say that you can learn we are who we are thank you she said the central man had said no in a way that she could understand and accept right she said now teach me how to make screens mr oz crumpled it is late mae cut him off and i risked my life to come here and i cannot do it often you say you want to help then fine help helping people costs youve got to do it when youre tired go on do your job mr oz paused the muscles in his face worked like biceps his face seemed to swim up through anger to the placid surface of a smile this is very good for me he said then he grinned right you make screens with something old called html xml makes it work on tv and aml will even make it work on air that means nothing to me youll have to learn the words said mr oz in the realm of info he could command the next day mr ken came to ask mae to live with him mae was sweeping kwans diwan the carpets rolled up the men were already at the television already there were sports results a voice behind her said shouldnt you rest mae turned and saw mr ken he looked terrible abject and sleepless did they say anything to you mae asked jerking her head down towards the landing ken kuei would have had to walk past all the men some things kuei said i can imagine she said when you leave they will ask if your dick is wet i have come for a serious discussion he said kueis wonderful good behaviour disguised a lack of intelligence he was diligent kind silent and sympathetic just not very bright or were all men stupid or only the ones she knew his ballooning broad shoulders his round face like a peach his lips like something soft and chewable if he were to start on her now here in the sundrenched guest room on the swept flagstones pulling down her trousers she would dampen open admit him but no he wanted a serious discussion mae sniffed okay we talk it is impossible for us to stay in the village he said it is impossible for me to go she said very quietly he coughed gently i propose he said that we leave together take my children with us we would go wherever you like but i would suggest green valley city he looked helpless proud i would hate balshang he said i want to stay here she repeated he nodded okay okay he said trying to absorb what she meant i will need to find us a new house it would not be possible to live so close to joe which house whose mr ken is there an empty house here i thought they were all crowded with too many children and childrens children and oh such a difference mr ken to be two minutes away from ones husband passing him every day in the fields weeding his fields instead of yours by mistake i know i know kuei nodded i want this to stop mae said it has not been good he admitted he looked at her his eyes that wanted to stay a child and that wanted her but it could be good if we just say yes it is true but now we will live together open we could do that and in a year they will get used to it you dont understand she said that night huh the night before last it seems a year ago that night as i walked home i had made up my mind that this would stop i decided then she heard the men and their laughter the birds in the fields and the very slight noise of the river that flowed right across the heart of the village she looked into his dark eyes i have been doing too much i know what i want to do i have to do just that if i am to do it at all and i cannot bear to give up info he said almost in scorn this village she answered him what your grandmother showed me is that everything dies it is not good enough just to live you have to know that death is certain not not just of the person but of whole worlds ours is going to die it is dead now the only thing i can do is help it be reborn so we can survive kuei was picking at something on the windowsill next to her mother to us all he said in some bitterness if it were a different time she said if we were younger he said if it were as it should be if we were as we once were he shook himself like a dog shivered urggh he said partly in anger partly in casting anger off will you go back to joe she paused in order to think but found she did not have to no she answered no i will concentrate on this on what mr ken yelped you will concentrate on loneliness mae on an empty house a room in someone elses house working like a servant in order to say thank you mae sucked in air through her nose in a thin focused stream that hissed but was not a sigh it was a gathering of strength on clearing the floor for work kuei stared back at her helpless what work he asked again he really didnt know she wanted to hug him then hold him comfort him for he was one of the dead but it would be misinterpreted teaching us how to use that thing she said each word was like a brick that she could barely carry you can do both she held up her hands no i cant i dont sleep i hardly eat i work in the house i work in the fields and then i work on that and there is almost nothing left of me suddenly she was shouting im tired the only thing in his face was sympathy for her maybe when all of this is done she said more quietly relenting i will be waiting kuei said helplessly i waited before a year from now maybe the change would come and after that a time of calm after the massacre stillness mae nodded yes but said nothing further to avoid giving him too much hope he nodded yes as well and made no move to kiss her for both of them had agreed to end not to begin he turned and went down the stairs to the kitchen the diwan seemed full of fine white dust and she ran up the wooden stairs to look out of a high window through bleachedblue sunlight over bleachedblue rooftops mae looked down and saw kuei as if through a mist he walked tall straight holding his jacket against the heat the back of his tshirt stained with sweat and nerves past the men who ignored him they turned grinning to look at his back there goes my young man thought mae you only get one said someone elses voice remember him remember his broad back for he is walking into the past into the land of the dead even if you meet again you will both be different again strangers or friends say goodbye now for you will have no other chance say goodbye for every moment to come without him but at least you had him for once you had him and again that old question granny teacher why is love pain why such a sweet sad sick hurt a draggingdown in the belly an ache a yearning because it always goes away mr ken paused at the gate and looked both ways left and right as if considering though he had no choice then he walked on mae permitted herself to weep chapter mae got her money she was working at three am on kwans tv when it announced that she had mail i will read it for you the machine said by now it knew that mae avoided reading herself the republic of karzistan ministry of development under the terms of the taking wing initiative is pleased to inform you that it will grant funding in full as requested in your recent application under the following conditions mae was numb the government was talking to her the government knew who she was they had just given her the money what conditions her mind went dark ready to be hurt first they wanted her to keep records of both sales and replies the taking wing initiative needs to know how successfully you have unrolled your mat please save the attached suite of customer care software it will automatically record the data we need it was a question map the same information was recorded over and over any letters she got any orders she fulfilled would be analyzed by country referral and type of business mae kept listening for serious conditions but there were none no interest no percentage mae was enraged what kind of foolish government was that to arrange its business so badly how could it prosper were they all children like mr oz but praise the gods luck happiness whatever for giving them masters who were so naive she had her money she had her business back oh could she ride this life like a leaf bobbing up and down on the river in a storm mae needed to tell someone but who could she tell at three in the morning poor kwan who had nursed her but was now asleep the central man yes but that would mean going back to her old house to joe to mr ken who mae went to sezens house she knocked on the door then beyond politesse mae pummelled it this was good news there were hissed voices shuffling a childs cry a shushing slippers on the floor sezen answered she wore a little girls nightdress and the spots on her cheeks had gone blueblack from merciless squeezing may seized her hands i got the money she whispered sezen it was as you said the government gave us the cash this is a joke this is madness said sezen they gave me every last riel of it i asked for too much you mean we are going to do it yes yes they loved it sezen squealed and hugged her spun on her heel and said lets get drunk you have any booze mae shook her head rich woman you will have whisky you will have silks you will build your mother a new house tuh said sezen no i will buy a motorcycle of my own mae pronounced her wild girl look who is calling people wild eh you adventuress madam death the man in her family all these things people call you sezen bundled mae into her own poor house she threw cushions in abandon into a heap in the middle of the night at the end of summer the fleas were at their hungriest they nipped about maes ankles in a mist sezen knelt in front of a small keep in the wall here she said pulling out a bottle this is disgusting but strong father made it it is the only thing he does well its creator snored behind the curtain like a boozehouse accordion rice wine amid the filth of sezens house mae sat and drank and told sezen everything about the grant application and the answer who needs the village mae said the rice wine was milky and tasted like chalk but it seemed to creep up her spine numbing it vertebra by vertebra ptoo to the village said sezen and pretended to spit only their clothing holds them together are we naked then asked mae the naked are brave said sezen and raised her glass to the naked said mae and raised her glass to mr ken added sezen oh i want to be fucked mae was too drunk to be shocked musa she managed to say sezen held out a graphic little finger all you chinese she said hes a muslim but chinese father she shook her head and then suddenly laughed and shook her head again still laughing sezen put down the glass suddenly as if it were a great weight she could no longer bear i am a pig and my family are pigs all the men i meet are pigs and i shall have piggy children she picked up the glass and toasted her helplessness or the house or her fate the fleas around maes ankles rose and fell like flames abstracted by the wine mae hazily swatted and scratched she watched helplessly as she realized sezen was no longer laughing you only come to me because you are fallen accused sezen grumpy if you want more people to come just clean up mae said sezen looked back at her bleakly this is cleaned up she sputtered into laughter i have just cleaned up this is as clean as it gets listen even the fleas are disgusted with this place laughter ached out of her a string of sticky spittle clung between her lips i am such a lady you see i get bored cleaning it is beneath me sezen was not really ashamed in the future there will be no ladies thought mae all of the old channels we pour down will be blocked ladies peasants men women children rich poor clean dirty we will all be churned up together we will be churning clouds in the air blown by wind pierced by swallows im drunk mae managed to say poisoned more like said sezen looking at the milky wine she poured it onto the beatendirt floor maybe it will kill the fleas welcome to the maesezen fashion emporium said mae new york paris singapore tokyo kizulduh hazily sezen stood up and did a models turn her nightrobe was eaten at the hem and knees sezenmaam displays the fine cut and design features of her latest creation sezen held up the rotten hem air ventilation for summer wear illustrates the holes in miss ozdemirmaams head through which air seeps she grinned like a tigerish talent and batted her eyes this years fashion adventure mae was chuckling calmly she noticed that she had knocked over her glass that will burn a hole in your heart said sezen of her fathers wine holes in the heart are this years fashion adventure said mae sezen stopped youre crying she accused suddenly young and letdown am i wondered mae she felt her cheeks they were wet just from laughter she promised sezen who only wanted escape just from laughter mae said again and reached forward and patted sezens hand uh we need a radio said sezen then we could dance when the air comes said mae we will have music whenever we want it any kind of music when the air comes sighed sezen with sudden feeling oh when air comes i shall put the music in my head on air so everyone can hear it sezen sat and closed her eyes and mae realized she was seeing something new sezen was someone who wanted air mae was afraid of it she regarded it as flood fire avalanche something to be faced up to and controlled this was different sezen sat with her eyes closed and whispered when the air comes we can sing to each other only we will sound like the biggest band in the world she swayed as if to music mae joined in when the air comes we can dress each other in air clothes light as spiderwebs when the air comes we can see all the naked men we want mae expected sezen to give a wicked wildgirl chuckle instead she whispered so many beautiful men that it will grow as normal as birds when the air comes mae began we will all be birds we will all be naked all be brave sezen said that sezen kept speaking in a trance the clothes will drop away the fleas and the fur and well jump out of our bodies and fly and the world will all be dream and dream will be all of the world her voice trailed away she was asleep mae felt a curtain descend behind her forehead a curtain of sadness and exhaustion i will sleep here amid the fleas she thought because i have just seen a miracle a miracle comes when someone speaks really speaks because when someone does that you also hear god air will be wonderful i didnt know that mae leaned her head down onto the earthern floor it smelled of spice and corn not garbage sezen was snoring mae took her hand and managed to blow out the candle anaesthetized mae fell asleep it was still dark when the smells of the filthy house woke her up stale vegetation drying shitcakes and sour old rice in the bins the voracious fleas were sticking needles into her there was slippery queasy stirring below in addition to a blinding hangover headache mae was bleeding below she felt her breath like a candle flame blood means i am not pregnant i cant be pregnant she needed to check to be sure she would not risk feeling her female wound with dirty hands she could not do that here she could not sleep here now either sober the house did stink forgive me sezen i did keep you company for a while sezen stirred murmuring good night mae whispered mae stumbled out onto the cobbles and looked up at the mountain sky a river of stars across it as milky as sezens fathers wine the air was sweet it cleared everything yes sezen was right the air was wonderful she mae was not pregnant good things were still to come good things to do she listened again to her village to the far dogs the wind in reeds and the sounds of their river leaping over stones pregnant demanded a voice in her head the nausea came again in a wave in the morning mae was still nauseous but told herself it was the wine if she was bleeding she could not be pregnant and if she were ill badly ill she found she did not mind all that she asked was that she lived long enough to get the village on air downstairs in the kitchen kwan was worried where did you go kwan asked her i went drinking with sezen said mae abstracted by hangover kwan looked horrified she is very bright brighter than you would think she would have to be perhaps you could teach her to wash mae felt like a truck on a bad road there was need of repair we all need to improve in some ways she said kwan rumpled her lips as if to say dont be so mealymouthed and pious im not pregnant mae said kwan blinked for a moment that at least is a blessing in some ways who is to say what is a blessing these days mae sat up i need to see my government man things were still too bad for her to walk in daylight through the village certainly not to be seen returning to the home of mr ken kwan sighed mae said i fear i am proving to be a trouble to you kwan gave her head a dismissive twitch i will send a child with a message it was only after kwan had gone that mae realized i did not tell her about the government money she will think i am hiding it from her maybe i was mae washed she was still bleeding the blood smelled of woman she pushed a clean rag up herself and went downstairs she told kwan about the government money after giving an apologetic dip at the knees i was more relieved at the other news both are good said kwan blandly the government man came mae told him about the grant he smiled but he did not look overjoyed that quick he shook his head that means there have been few applications they have spare funding they need to use it mae tried to read the hand across his forehead the distracted look you are worried she asked it means no one else is finding anything he said its not working from down below came the sound of the men and the tv do women and children ever get to watch it now they were watching snooker of all the pointless things to waste a morning on stay here mr oz told her he turned and went down kwans whitewashed steps mae listened hidden behind the doorway the staircase smiled white in the sunlight suddenly there were howls from the men protests quiet demanded mr oz this is more important than sports a roar of protest from the men mr oz continued what do you care about snooker scores in balshang balshang doesnt care that you burn shit for fuel balshang doesnt even know you exist mae blinked fighting words from such a frail boy who would have thought it the men suddenly fell silent the screen made a trumpeting sound the sound of government humbled silent made small by the weight of society above them the village men waited mae could feel them wait then she heard a spreading mumble they know she realized they know about the money hes shown them on tv thank you gentlemen said mr oz naked but brave a harlot funded by the government to make herself richer than the men thats what they will call me i will have to have a face of stone now i will have to be as enduring as the mountain mountains hold up air oblivious as always the central man bustled back in with paper kwan emerged concerned curious wiping her hands the paper had printed out all the terms and conditions right he explained the funding is in the form of bank credits do you know what those are mae shook her head believability card better than that but i need to go with you to ratify them that will set up a business account in the bank we then need to set up a question mark account so that you can use it on the net then you are in business that means going to green valley city said mae her heart leapt the city she had not seen it since spring mmmhmm mr oz said oblivious again to what that meant for her and that is good too because there is a big seminar there this week for people in the taking wing initiative it will be good the wings have also been invited can we take sunni with us asked mae sunni ran out of her house to the government van she was immaculate in citywoman oatmeal with a beige scarf on her head she darted down the hill to the bridge quickly so that no one would see her she squashed into the backseat next to mae and greeted mae mr oz and mr wing plainly she wanted to be away hello mrs sunnimaam sezen beamed at her pleased to see me sezens eyes were spiked with merriment like a dogs collar against wolves mae gave sezen a little warning with her eyes good morning sezen sunni managed she flinched at sezens graduation dress mounds of shiny lemonyellow sunni put on her sunglasses as if against the glare mrs haseemmaam mr wing replied with dignity from the front seat mr oz nodded and backed the van back into upper street sunni turned to mae and her smile was from the old days it was very kind of you to ask me she said to mae mae said i felt it would be good for old friends in the party of progress to go together to see what they are doing in the city and it is such a beautiful morning said sezen reaching around mae to touch sunni on the shoulder we can stop and wave to all your friends working in the fields if those who are friends of progress are not friends of each other then disaster awaits said mae and glared indeed murmured sunni those are my feelings protected by sunglasses sunni looked fragile in defeat uncertain and frightened by the need for trust impulsively mae took her hand it is good to be with friends where is the lady an chirped sezen sunni found enough heart to reply an is studying for a qualification in fashion studies she does this through the net on my tv she is enjoying it perhaps you should talk to her sezen and see if the course interests you you could study together i would love to do that enthused sezen so brightly that it was plain she could think of nothing worse she would teach me how to improve my pronunciation and improve your manners thought mae she gave sunnis hand a little squeeze to her surprise sunni squeezed back sunni persisted such a terrible thing that people do not understand the uses of the tv to think there are people who want it turned off people who try to destroy others said sezen her voice now simple hard and dark indeed said sunni simply mae twisted around and her eyes said to sezen enough sezens smile was one of contentment she gave mae a little salute and looked away honour satisfied already their little village was gone just alongside mr ozs window there was a brutal fallingaway of stone music mr wing asked and turned on the radio full of echo and sounds of machinery was something like a song for sezens generation she was drawn silenced by what to her was a mating call a cry to be joined with the modern the old folk fell silent fluttering past like insubstantial scarves went rice fields misty terraces fat men riding donkeys women in broad straw hats considering harvest they went down into the desiccated village mae was shocked to see grey dishes and wires on most of the houses theyve had those since summer said sunni turning perhaps we are not so advanced in kizuldah installing sat ho lih tuh said mr oz shaking his head as if they all shared his amusement still its reliable old technology mae felt unable to ask what is a satellite look said sunni suddenly pointing they are already threshing going down the hill was like plunging into their future on the burnishedyellow threshing ground were big rented machines and wagons loaded with chickpeas the men were pitchforking them raw into the threshers the jets of straw the waiting reed baskets to collect the peas the women and boys bearing them off to plastic matting the little girls herding the geese away from the mats it was all as it always had been the vision was withdrawn behind a flurry of fencing and gates a good harvest ah sighed sunni as if the relief were her own they will have a good party then high feasting agreed mae it is useful that they are so dry compared to us we grow rice they grow chickpeas mmm we can just exchange sunni agreed it was what they always said suddenly the road stopped complaining under them suddenly it was smooth humming like a song the clouds of white dust died away in trails behind them like the silver tracks of aircraft sunni and mae looked at each other in wonder paved our road is paved then they both broke out in laughter sunni held her plump belly who who thought it was worthwhile paving a city road here make it easier for the donkey chuckled mae they thought of all the fat old farmers their bewildered wives the barefoot children the browntoothed brigands with ancient rifles oh indeed how they needed a highway you need it for motorcycles said sezen sharply the radio played another balshang song we will all have motorcycles mae placated her i know sezen but it just seems strange remember when grass grew between the wheel tracks sunni said yes id forgotten that and the first time down each year there was no track at all yes yes the wheels spun on the spring grass and you were always frightened the tractor would slide off the road my father always made us get out and walk he would cast lye behind him to kill the grass mae turned to tell sezen you went to the town oh only if your father was buying a horse or parts for the tractor and we would pile all of us oh six or seven children in the trailer behind it would take all day to get down we would sleep in the trailer overnight you remember the fires everyone set up camp in the market square you would cook soup over the fires and the lutes the lutes came out particularly the horsemen and they would sing remember the cossacks so handsome with their moustaches they would sing the truck seemed to lurch and sway as if on green grass mae turned to warn mr oz about his driving but as she leaned forward everything lurched swayed and suddenly she smelled smoke and saw the fires the cossacks wore spotless white shirts with high collars they smelled of smoke it clung to their huge moustaches like thieves they had wicked faces but they were lit up with kindly smiles and the little girl was sitting on the knee of one of them his face was lit up with love tender love i have a little girl the cossack said slowly in karz she is pretty like you his truck full of horses sweltered even though it was night his mates smoked pipes and her father sat drinking with them ramrod straight and slightly twitchy he was frightened of cossacks it was not maes father the little girl was not mae the cossack said i send presents to my little girl she does not always get them things are so bad the postmen take them the cossack shrugged oh i miss my little girl you are happy to live with your father you are far from the war what war the cossack patted little miss hu on her head and let her run back to her father her father was plump smoothskinned beardless he smelled of chives and garlic not smoke miss hu climbed onto his lap and was covered in kisses as hot and damp as new leaves on tender shoots ailing breathed out mr hu world war two this would be say the town square was dark except for one streetlight and there were no tall buildings indeed the square was a terrace of shacks with men sitting out front in worn torn dusty clothes barbershops bars spareparts shops teahouses there was a traffic light and mae remembered there was only one traffic light in the whole town the cossack grinned picked up his viola it was tiny unvarnished with loose wood holding up the strings the bow was made of horsetail hairs for pretty little girls he said he played something high sweet sad simple song says red children red children play he explained and began to sing it was a jolly song that made ailing want to dance jolly but somehow sad she thought it was the most beautiful thing she had ever heard she wanted to remember it forever and ever she beamed up in delight wonder at her father who smiled down indulgently and little ailing began to dance she held out her arms and spun wearing her best town dress a stiff froth of lace her hair in ribbons so pretty little princess spinning and spinning the cossacks as hard as the roads melted as if in rain ahhhh they sighed for all things homely and beautiful the moment came that miss hu loved when she ceased to be shy then she could really dance so she really danced knowing herself to be little and pretty and sweet all the cossacks began to sing the song together enraptured by the sight of a pretty little girl of home some of them came from other fires with mandolins the music mounted little ailing fell back into shyness and stopped and hid her head in her fathers trousers the horsemen laughed with love mae was rocked like a little paper boat cast out onto the ocean the music changed it rattled it was balshang music on the radio with a roar of engine and harsh sunlight mae was sick again waves of nausea she wanted to say stop i need to be sick see see said old mrs tung see what you are destroying a young person was crowded close to her with concern mae did not know who she was at first are you all right sezen asked an arm on hers hmm said mae not quite saying yes i was sleeping you were singing corrected sunni her eyes hidden in the sunglasses in another language they roared down into green valley city yeshibozkent was flung like a soiled handkerchief onto the lie of the land there was much new building now on the outskirts raw concrete in irregular frames held panels of barely mortared brick they would fall in the next earthquake the air was blue and grey they were lowered into it and heat enveloped them like a blanket smelling of old automobiles dust and fumes and toyota jeeps that would not stay in their lanes and old women that walked right out onto the road mr oz did not slow down but beeped frantically continually forcing people to jump back or taxis to veer out of his way mr wing chuckled at his driving courage i always wondered how you people got through so fast he said the city people in sharp clothes walked unconcerned as the van seared the air passing them by inches a light turned red and the van lurched to a halt pedestrians poured across the intersection sezen laughed suddenly raucous and pointed what is that a young man walked in front of the windscreen he wore soiled fruitbowl colours and long braided hair died blond streaks amid his natural black some sort of glasses marred his face like an eye test or camera lenses he turned almost blind and looked inside the van light flicked inside the lenses inside his eyes his skinny starveling face bared fangs at them his teeth were bright yellow like a row of embers sezen rolled down the window she leaned out and yelled at him what are you sunni seemed to melt with shame beside mae he yelled back answering another agenda i just took your photograph he staggered slightly for no reason dih zee toh el mr oz spoke hes an ay oh het mr wing jerked with a superior grin or he thinks he is the man still yelled at them it is a photograph of peasants the smile was nasty you are all dead it means airhead continued mr oz he cant be an airhead the air has not come here yet but he has read about it in some magazine you are a fool sezen shouted back laughing at him the air is not here yet my eyes are cameras he shouted as the van pulled away sezen was agog with both scorn and excitement did you see what he was wearing what did he have on his eyes a computer said mr oz part of it is embedded in his head the two older women hissed in pain no wonder he was such a mess said sunni shaking her head yah but imagine if it was someone handsome and clever and not a fool said sezen imagine clean streets said mae the town was richer but that just generated drifts of crushed tin and old papers in the gutters yeshibozkent clean sezen was scornful we still think garbage rots we will never be clean we are a very clean people said sunni in outrage there are only two dirty families in our village one of them was sezens sezen just laughed to someone from the west we all look like pigs the van beeped furiously a donkey had suddenly swerved from the side of the road into its path the van screeched and slid helplessly shifting sideways as the wheels locked the van slammed into the animal mae could feel the donkeys ribs its fur the knobby knees all communicated through the front of the truck oh mr wing jumped out the animal dazed kicked itself back up onto its feet and blinked who owns this animal mr wing demanded of the street plump ladies in shiny purple pantsuits looked mildly surprised sezen was helpless with laughter does it have cameras for eyes too airhead donkey mae was not sure why sezen found it so funny no one answered no one claimed the donkey it twitched its ears and wandered off as if nothing were wrong perhaps like them it was dead and didnt know the main market square no longer had a publicaddress system the familiar sound of towncoming had been silenced the smells were the same vegetables in sunlight laced with city drains the gabble of trading seemed strangely muted and the square curiously spacious there arent the people said sunni mystified mae looked around it is a saturday where are they all at the hypermarket said sezen sniffing collecting her volumes of limeyellow cloth whats that the big new store outside town justintime rescue the name alone made sunni and mae chuckle as they stepped out of the van braving public view and the eyes that dismissed them as peasants it sounds like a newspaper headline a cheap romance sezen was not to have her modernity fazed she shrugged and managed to step down from the van like a princess sezen belonged they call it that because they know everything that is bought and can predict exactly what is needed they sell out every day so does a good trader here sniffed sunni perhaps no longer there were grannies some middleaged women some potbellied men come to sit on folding deckchairs and chat with friends who stayed by their unrolled mats there were few customers to distract them from their open tins of beers mae felt disappointment she had always loved stepping out into the market the heart of the town no fires or spangled trucks no drunken cossacks dancing around the square a forest of bright new plastic signs danced opening and closing like flowers akai sony yeshiboz sistemlar a far cry from the dingy restaurants the boys running with trays bearing glasses of tea you are dead the airhead said right what is the plan sunni asked mr oz and i will go to the bank began mae me too said sezen and the hunger in her eyes said iwant to learn about money sunni adjusted her sunglasses i have some errands fashion work she did not want mae to know about fair enough thought mae mae suggested shall we meet by the van at oh two hours from now for lunch that will be lovely exclaimed sunni we can go to the temple gardens ugh said sezen mr oz intervened we dont have time if we are to get to the congress ill just order lunch now he keyed in the address of justintime rescue the central man escorted mae to the bank they were welcomed with great politesse mae had expected to feel uncomfortable but found herself immune to feeling inferior she found that money made her as good as anyone else they sipped tea in the directors office and he was friendly and polite in white shirt and tie he was fullblooded karz big with hairy arms and a moustache like a trimmed broom and he had a fullblooded karz name mr saatchi saatchi i am here thought mae i am where i always wanted to be i am a businesswoman modern respected sezen sat clenched like a fist with admiration mae felt her eyes swell dont cry she warned herself madam chung will need a cellular account she will be doing business with you always through mobile services we have had such facilities for over ten years so it is good to see them in more general use the director said determined the government should know how advanced they were mr oz had enough wisdom to nod approval under the terms you will notice that madam chung has the full backing of the tw initiative with extendable credit if she verifies any overdrafts are for the initiativesponsored business then the government will made good any losses mr oz paused the credit is therefore to be extended when she asks the directors eyes widened slightly then he nodded hmm he said the implications sinking in uh this means the government will also have full and regular access to info on this funded guaranteed account of course said the director arms held open we will need to discuss security and coding i have a full report replied the director he had a copy for mae he strolled with them to the front door an honour madam mr saatchi saatchi said such enterprise gladdens the hearts of all he shook hands with all of them he smelled of pine and through the white shirt was the brighter outline of his perfumed vest when he had gone sezen seized maes hand oh mae she said lost for words mae felt like chuckling if only he knew who we were sezen shrugged did you notice she said the director was not wearing a wedding ring perhaps i can marry him if you cannot mr oz and mr wing went off together to admire computers mae wanted to get her hair done she went to halats the little hussy was even busier and ruder than ever she snapped her fingers and sent mae and sezen to her assistants the young girls showed them on screens how mae and sezen would look with their new hair the young girls looked very smug expecting mae to be knocked sideways by science tuh said mae i do that on the top of red mountain as the girls cut and trimmed they looked all the while at the screens for instructions how can halat be so foolish wondered mae as they left how do you mean sezen asked mae shook her head she makes it too plain that she herself adds nothing fashion had shifted again there was more garish colour not less particularly on the young women fashion had gone crazy in all different directions at once but the ice cream shop was there and the old streaked cinema showing hong kong movies and the tiny shops offering acupuncture healing herbs fortunetelling lined up outside the tiled wall of a butchers shop was a row of severed goatsheads the shop of the disabled seamstress was closed mae had wanted to buy her stock of oatmeal cloth its green door had a hastily hammered board across it mae went into the next shop which sold various sweets walnuts on thread in dried fruit juice a rather sour slumpedlooking woman ran it what happened to miss soo asked mae oh she left to be with her boyfriend mae was silent she remembered the girls staring eyes the twisted limbs and she wanted to know how did she get the money what did she find when she got there the woman was blunt they didnt stay together but she found a job anyway and stayed in balshang tuh i had to board her shop up myself to keep out the vermin what happened to her stock the woman was not that interested i think it was sold at auction mae paused the oatmeal cloth she saw it now with different eyes it had been finely woven with white mixed in tight warp and weft and it would hang so well so well when weighted down with fine embroidery was anything left over oh you will have to ask around hold on hakan hakan the woman called her husband a karzistani a lady here wants to know if miss soo had any stock left over there was a bellow from behind the curtain and a murmur from a tv how should i know the woman did not like to be shown to be lowerclass poor she felt herself to be showed up by her husbands response you are a man in business i assumed you knew mae was surprised how sorry she was not to see miss soo sorry not to be able to follow her story she looked at the boardedup shop and its closed and shuttered windows the plywood was already streaked and cracked mae discovered that she had liked miss soo very much and admired her and it would have been useful to have a friend in the balshang fashion business if she ever comes back said mae do tell her that mrs chung sends affectionate regards sezen asked as they walked back to the van so what now mae sniffed i have credit now i will order cloth online everything ends said old mrs tung the meeting was held in the mudharet the town hall with its cracked tiles and filthy toilets the meeting room was laid out like a theatre with a stage and rows of seats it was crowded unbearably hot and roaring with sustained talk on the wall was a blank panel of patterned teak with some twist of black iron pinned to it like an ugly brooch sculpture there were no seats left except in the very front row as if the participants were schoolchildren wanting to avoid the teachers gaze mae walked down the aisle and along the front row and saw faces a young sharp eagle of a man sat in a suit that looked expensive and cheap at the same time he smiled slightly while his eyes glared he is a shark thought mae he eats people beside the shark a masculinelooking woman with no makeup short hair a sleepingbag jacket and army boots was talking to herself into some kind of microphone a fat man with pink hair was blowing his nose the boy next to him provocatively pulled up his tshirt to display tattoos all these people mae realized have new faces i can only just read them she began to feel a tremor again the tremor of fear the talent who read the local news walked onto the stage to a mixture of polite applause and boos she was immaculate in fireengine red she was prettier than she looked on tv and far more steely she gave a television smile and welcomed them but there was no polite silence if anything the noise from the crowd got worse good afternoon i am pleased to welcome you to the afternoon session of todays important discussions she explained that they had been enlightened and enthralled by the first set of speakers they were now to usefully discuss and come to some conclusions about the use that the green valley should make of new technology someone shouted at her dont bother with all of that why has the government accepted an outmoded format for air mae looked around to see a scrawny middleaged man the talents smile did not falter the un format is the agreed international standard karzistan is not in a position to choose a different format than everyone else there was a groan of protest mingled with raucous laughter a scrawny man who was all white city teeth grinned not in tokyo this is not tokyo said the talent with icy forbearance in tokyo they use both just dont make it practically illegal shouted the army boot woman please said the talent holding up her hands this meeting can do nothing about the un format they are running the gates format at the same time in new york another head shouted look this meeting is to review local efforts here in the happy province what efforts the fat man yelled still eating he was enjoying the atmosphere this among them began the talent this is supposed to be a discussion give us focus focus someone else yelled the talent turned and snapped her fingers mae found herself admiring her the talents voice was suddenly louder okay we each have the focus in turn but please stand up and say who you are you first sir the fat pinkhaired man stood up ali bey turkoman i ask again what efforts there is only one taking wing officer for all of the red mountain area is there a single email address for all those villages yet is this a concerted government effort he wants to sell us things thought mae it is precisely the lack of email that air and related technologies are meant to address next question the talent tense pointed to someone else a scholarly looking man bowbacked spectacles unfolded upwards from his chair professor li ho department of medicalcomputer interface he took out a written statement and there was another squawk of laughter he droned mae wanted to understand it was the first time she had heard a professor talk and she expected wisdom and it was no surprise to her that she could not follow what was said but she did begin to find it difficult to breathe there was something called juhee em another english word was all the world english gm was something about very small things it was about growing things it was also somehow about making people smarter the professor wanted to change things in people he started talking about children who could read after six months who were doing advanced mathematical work at thirteen that she could understand that she could picture he was saying that people were stupid but they could be cured he was having to raise his voice gm is one area in which karzistan could push ahead becoming a new centre of advancement for the world more like a playground for crooks someone shouted karzistan is not a garbage pail for the rest of the world the professor was shouted down were here to talk about air go play with your own juh nee sus an airhead got overexcited he leapt up like a dancer and he didnt need the focus he yelled voice breaking air can do anything gm could do in new york they merge minds for a hobby to make new music we are still talking about it as if it were television we still use the word screens the blind could see roared the army boot woman next to mae schools out no more need for teachers or talents thats her real problem is this a war mae wondered the shouting was so unlike the karzistani way it was ugly showed lack of control lack of harmony even lack of islamic discipline lack of everything who were these these children in their goggles and crazy clothes and were people so very stupid that they all were to be erased made better the shark stood up he smiled slightly and flicked a finger toward the talent the air around him seemed to brighten hikmet tunch green valley systems his voice typically karz was gravelly but surprisingly high almost like a womans he said nothing else but immediately the noise in the hall reduced professor li ho is correct of course gm is a technology with immense potential and one that karzistan must not ignore at green valley systems we are looking at all aspects of medical interface we have a programme to see how the gates format could be used in our cultural setting perhaps alongside the un format one of the applications we are looking at is the use of air to artificially augment intelligence which does avoid some of the ethical issues surrounding gm there was an admiring murmur and a scattering of applause the next question was respectful from a colourless young man in a loose grey shirt and not a trace of airhead finery i would like to ask mr tunchsir what is he finding out about the gates format and the ways it differs from the un format that thought mae is someone who was told to ask him that question sharks have little fish that follow them for scraps for some reason people chuckled the army boot woman gave a kung fu kick of joy the gates format is very confusing began mr tunchsir and there was a fresh wave of comment as if there had been some kind of admission the talent gave the same embarrassed grimace as mr oz mr tunch seemed very aware of the effect he was having his face became hooded hazy somehow smiling like a mask his eyes screened once you are beyond the gates everything merges with no neat divisions it is a little bit slower than the un format but once the gates are open it becomes very intuitive for all of those reasons we hope that augmented functions will be able to merge invisibly with the users own functions he smiled again and mae saw teeth mae felt vertigo she understood none of it not the words not the disputes not what people wore or even how they moved her future had seemed settled and in order it had felt like a staircase up to a door that was clearly labelled air you only had to make that climb once instead the future was a pit it went down in layers each layer stranger than the next and there was no bottom to it the talent intervened smiling embarrassed heightened in the focus i am sure that we are very interested in mr tunchs insights into the gates format which of course he has never entered himself as the creation of second imprints is illegal a murmur of laughter and collusion panic gripped mae here a scant thirty miles from red mountain people were talking a new language about things she had never heard of dreamed of all of them were lazily familiar with it it was a whole way of which she knew nothing nothing except that it was death to her village death not only to her village but to all human beings as they once had been blood seemed to drain from maes head did none of them love being human did they all so badly want to become machines to be measured maes fingers and knees buzzed why do you want us all to die mae was suddenly aware that she had spoken aloud she had spoken aloud without willing it she tried to say to sunni i did not say that i shouted but it was not me and she couldnt she mae couldnt speak she sat frozen in her chair unable to move everything numbed except her mouth her mouth seemed to snap by itself like a turtles she heard herself shout we built you we built this city we put in the drains we nurtured you and now you want us to die you want us to put ourselves to the knife fade back into the earth to be despised by you you automobiles you you streetlamps you you radios you parrot radios its happening again sunni said quickly its never been anything like this said sezen sitting up in alarm look shes fighting it shes trying to stop it mae mae its not you talking is it mae managed to make her body nod once yes mr oz looked appalled embarrassed mr wing crouched around out of his chair and knelt in front of mae and looked deep into her eyes we will not go without a fight humankind will not go without a fight stop it mae pleaded sunni maes wide eyes tried to say mutely icant and sezen suddenly stood up jaw thrust out and signalled the talent the talent saw they were peasants saw it was an emergency and yearned for order the talent acquiesced and passed the focus all you city people said sezen mae kept shouting in the olden days ancestors were worshipped you talk as if most of your own people do not exist i am a peasant i live on the top of red mountain my mother keeps a goat in the living room and we sit on the corncobs we eat for furniture iwant to go home i want my home fighting made it worse fighting made the thing resist mae decided to try to calm it sssh mrs tung dear old mrs tung quiet my love i am sorry you are dead but all things die how many times has our village died one people after another you said that yourself something was halted and grew confused where is this what is this it asked in miserable confusion the hall itself had fallen silent sezen had turned to the room and was pointing at mae that woman my boss was in your air when you tried your test and another woman died in her arms because of your test and the other womans mind still lives in her are you happy are you proud of juhee em now the talent grew concerned in a professional voice how how was this not reported sezen answered we live thirty miles up a mountain there is no one to report to there was an unreadable noise of reaction in the hall sezen kept shouting we here are the party of progress in our village ah but there is another party it goes around destroying the tv sets my brave boss mrs chung mae tries to teach our children our women our men how to use air when it comes she teaches us on the tv and the schoolteacher prevents her the schoolteacher actually tries to stop us learning he breaks the tv that is what we face while all of you are going to the moon sezen stood enraged quivering and there was not a sound in the hall none of them had any answer to that at all helpless in her own body mae felt back deep inside herself with her mind once more she reached back to some heavy mighty implacable thing in which she was rooted and she felt herself there felt this root and it was gnarled twisted confounded two of us she realized there are two of us there entwined like a ginger root mae was nearly at the point of understanding then she was called back mae it was mr wing mae someone is here he wants to help you the shark in the suit the man with the gravelly voice was kneeling over her his pinched face and his coiffeured hair seemed to shift inside maes eyes as if a membrane had descended over them his face seemed to turn green and twist into a sardonic grimace she saw him suddenly as the devil or someone did and that person roused herself and rose up to her feet and saw in him everything that was destroying her world mae felt her own body seized from her she felt herself pushed away and then drift upwards like a boat no longer moored mae floated free of herself everything went dim and still and calm and she had no fear or anger it was suddenly clear that none of this really meant anything she viewed it all with the detachment with which she would one day view her own death mae saw her body strike the predator in the face a tiny dogged woman hitting a city operator she could even smile at it it amused her the smile was metaphoric because she was no longer in touch with her body mr wing held her by the arms and was pulling her back the body started to sing it bellowed an old war song loud and defiant a song of war against the communists sezen and sunni stood between her and the man who held his bruised face they stroked maes hair distracted wildeyed the face continued to sing the old songs the dead songs the songs her beloved warrior had taught her fifty years before old mrs tung was fighting to live the only life she had was maes chapter mae woke up in a strange bed the walls were pale blue with white cornices sitting patiently at the foot of her bed was a man his face was familiar it was mr tunch the name meant bronze he seemed to be made of something burnished he was wearing a different suit zigzag black on beige like the other one it was shiny good morning he said pleasantly mae sat up the hotel room had flowers a tv and a chest of drawers made of polished red wood where are my friends asked mae they have gone home you have been somewhere else for many days what do you mean somewhere else ah he shrugged mrs tung has been here instead for what days days mr tunch nodded he tried to look sorry but instead looked rather excited mae was prickled with terror how did i come back it was the most urgent thing to know she wandered off said mr tunch or rather she simply could not understand what she was doing here she couldnt remember where she was so she kept trying to leave and finally she did he chuckled she got very frustrated mae murmured they do after maes father was killed her family moved along with the bloodstained diwan cushions to the house of the iron aunt wang cro at first mae did not understand what was wrong or why the adults whispered the iron aunt was nearly eighty and strong enough to move oil jars but she always thought it was thursday cooked dinner at nine in the morning and could not remember that mae was not her mother the children could tease her into a fury mr tunch explained your friends thought it was best if we did what we could here yes yes i can see that murmured mae yes i can see you now in your bronze suit playing the big man you even soothed sezen into leaving me can you do anything mae demanded mr tunch leaned towards her and put a hand on her shoulder and made a slight gesture of helplessness we need to know more you cant help in some ways mae was relieved mr tunch smiled not yet in that case said mae i want to go home i have business to do what business chuckled mr tunch with something too much like scorn look there is nowhere else in karzistan that has as much knowledge about the air formats as my company we are experts in humancomputer interface medicine do you know what that is with a sudden chill mae knew you put cameras in airheads eyes tunch blinked gotcha thought mae i dont like you he recovered right now we are far more concerned about the damage the test did we are very concerned about the format that was used in that test and we are horrified at what happened to you mrs chung we all have business interests but your health is more important forgive me but you did not do much business these last three days you oil your words like dr bauschu thought mae you do everything for reasons of your own but perhaps just perhaps i need you mae was driven to yeshiboz sistemlaralong a new empty road suddenly there was a wire mesh fence with what looked like a white airport hangar beyond mae noted that it was built just outside the jurisdiction of the city gates were raised and lowered bright young people the brightest mae had yet seen in yeshibozkent looked as scrubbed as the painted metal walls of the hangar and somehow just as cheap they performed the function of people without the solidity or the beauty they would age badly mr bronze was king inside the front lobby girls smiled and modern as they were dipped their heads in traditional respect this is madam chung mae our patient he said to a woman at the first desk with a quick grin no covered heads here no broad straw hats with the rims white from dried sweat the people looked as though they had come from florida disney world thought mae i bet the offices at disney world look just like this youll excuse me mrs chung like you i have business to attend to but madam akurgal will take excellent care of you madam akurgal was not yet thirty and dressed like a nurse with a rubber tube around her neck she kept calling mae by her first name as if she were a servant just come through here mae we need to disinfect you she said with a winning smile and a tvtalent accent that came from nowhere specific she led mae into a corridor and there was a blast of air and a sound like vacuum cleaners and purple lights that made the white nurses uniform glow white she sat mae in a chair and told her to relax and lowered a kind of metal hat on her head mae waited for a sensation none came they sucked blood from her arm like at the hairdressers mae was given a magazine to read doctors looked at paper being printed and shook their heads and called each other over to look they ignored both mae and the nurse finally one of them tore off a sheet of the paper and showed it to mae he was a chinese gentleman one of her own probably a buddhist and she hoped for understanding we have found nothing he said beaming pointing the paper was printed with jagged lines so mrs tung is not here he jabbed a finger at the paper everything is working as usual except see here this line covers activity in the area of the cortex we think corresponds to communication with air we think you are constantly checking for airmail he was rather pleased this is very encouraging it means we speedily learn to use air even without realizing it what does it mean for me he shrugged it means that things are basically okay in your physical brain it confirms what we had all thought that the problem is with your imprint in air somehow yours is linked with another imprint well okay then just wipe out those imprints in air ah he said delighted with the beauty of the thing everything in air is permanent another doctor entered and the first greeted him effusively waving the paper then he turned back nodding politely oh and one thing to cheer you up your blood test shows that you are expecting a joyful event it will be a son good day madam akurgal shook her head stupid men she hissed and looked stricken into maes eyes what does he mean im pregnant i cant be pregnant the woman looked serious oh yes you can ive had my period mae was whispering frantically but even so the male doctors turned do you understand i had a normal period the woman shook her head then there must be real problems is the bleeding just today recently i have not miscarried it was just a period and now its over the woman stroked her forehead then there may be something really wrong we can have you tested i dont want to be tested again i have had too many tests just give yourself time to think my name is fatimah fatimah akurgal i will always be nearby what does it mean that they found nothing wrong with my head fatimah sagged under the weight of so much evidence of things gone awry it means that you are the first of a kind there is little that we know i dont want her taking over mae was nearly in tears she is trying to take over we will be looking at the format to see if there is a way we can control it even stop its communicating with you fatimah paused i am so sorry i wish i had better news mae did begin to weep then she hid her eyes the doctors kept talking about her mae spent the rest of the morning having magazines passed to her she could not read them she thought about what these people had said and the way they had said it fatimah took her to the bright noisy canteen and bought her a lunch of spicy red leaves that mae had never seen before well see about getting a car to drive you back to the hotel fatimah said be sure to tell mr tunch for me mae said that i will be going straight back home to kizuldah fatimah protested just ask mr tunch to talk to me said mae mr tunch drove mae back to the hotel himself the car was bronzecoloured and inside it smelled like a toilet all false pine you are going to have to give me something else to keep me said mae i beg your pardon coughed mr tunch you cant cure me why should i stay why should i want you to stay mr tunchs eyes twinkled it was cool in the car airconditioned people outside squinted against the sun walking on empty baking streets you want information from me and information is like sugar it is to be sold how very wise replied mr tunch sounding very pleased as if she were a clever pupil you always sound surprised when i am not stupid thats insulting he dipped his head in respect im sorry but i would have thought that a possibility of a cure was reason enough for you to stay possibility of a cure thats not a lot what do you get i get to understand your unusual situation that will tell me a lot about how air works then she sighed i am afraid this is not a fair trade i do not want to spend time here being explored by you only to find that there is no cure i have work to do what else do you want he asked blandly to learn everything you know she said about what is coming he chuckled my dear woman why would you want to know that so i can prepare my people mae paused not your people my people there is a difference his face did not lose a mote of its benevolence you could not possibly learn all the things i know i want to know about this juhee stuff and what these gates are and what will really happen inside peoples heads what the great powers are using air for what they are going to get out of it mr tunch smiled is that all he said his irony losing its airy touch one other thing what is your full name she almost saw his tongue flick surely a modern woman such as yourself does not believe in the wisdom of names you do mae realized thats why you dont want to give it to me i am just a peasant she said it is not good to do business without knowing your clients name he shook his head slightly i am your client am i in your professional hands he relented my full name is mr hikmet tunch mr wisdom bronze a wise criminal has no need to soil his hands and so stays shiny people mistake the polished bronze for gold a wise criminal can sometimes even help his people but always for a price mae you are flying with hawks watch out for their talons so okay the deal is this i stay here one week not one day longer we spend three hours a day finding out what you want and three hours a day finding out what i want okay agreed he said after a moment i have the mornings she said doors bleeped and blew and said hello to mr tunch sorry about all this but we try to get rid of all the dust he said his office walls were covered in wood and it was cool without windows and the electric lights were phony made of bronze to look oldfashioned the surface of his desk was covered in glass mr tunch touched it and spoke to it and it came alive with the familiar interface in order he said intro background briefing on genetics cosmology and air history resistance to gm and its relevance to the development of air the nature of the un format and background history the nature of the gates format and background history speculative futures he paused is that what you want to know i will check my list good i will be back here at lunchtime he caught her scowl i did not agree to teach you myself that machine is far more used to teaching than i am and much more patient but please let me know if there is anything it cannot tell you i dont know how it works no but it knows how you work good morning mrs chungmaam and he was gone through another jet of air the machine began to speak and show pictures they had apparently unthreaded humanity like a carpet inside the beautiful white semen nestled inside the warm home of the womb were threads one from the male one from the female they now knew what made the threads and the meaning of each stitch as if it were eloi embroidery they could place each stitch or replace it with better ones this was miraculous stuff to learn mae could imagine the souls of the unborn blossoming in new forms like flowers bred for new colours or perfumes they could make people prettier stronger and smarter mr tunchs desk repeated the arguments against doing this favourable modifications would be available only for the rich an even greater gap would open up between haves and havenots air however would make everyone a have so they said these everyonehaves would have their memory their knowledge and their skills increased their ability to calculate figures and link previously unrelated information would all be enhanced by using info through air it all sounded so calm and clear and reasonable a briefing for the disney people of yeshiboz sistemlar mae knew when she was being sold something you are trying to scare me with all this talk of rich people buying smarter babies you want me to buy air instead she sat forward already the bland neutral voice was slipping in warnings like old village gossips trying to get their way unplugged security problems that might mean the un format may not be controllable like her kru they put him in air and they cant turn him off and all that knowledge goes away for free no money to be made what you need me for mr tunch is to learn how to turn off mrs tung and turn off my kru there was a tickle somewhere the tickle was a way of looking at the world a narrative it was impatient the benefits of air for social inclusion are evident said mr tunchs desk but questions of safety for users must be paramount and intellectual property must be protected the tickling grew as insistent as a headache it was fear it was hopelessness it was a dread of the world beyond kizuldah the desk said liberal economists wanted to open up air to the competitive marketplace others argued that there could only be one air and that it would be wrong to grant a monopoly to any purely business interest with two competing formats users could choose they want to own our souls you see you see her shes here the desk said an international consortium of software houses agreed to set standards the antimonopolists soon claimed that the consortium was in fact controlled by the company its always the same with these people showdown thought mae its you or me tension increased when the director of the international air consortium resigned charging the company with bad faith the desk still spoke before there was time for conscious thought to signal what she was doing mae said it is so sad about your daughterinlaws death what the old one did not like surprises it was then that the directorgeneral of the un founded a new consortium to continue development of air tui she died the same day you did someone answered mae aloud what thats a horrible thing to say mae replied she threw herself down a well dont you remember i know youre dead but you have been told about it many times the day of the air test it was months ago she died by the way who are you speaking to the desk said but the new consortium struggled for lack of funds this is a terrible thing to do to try to scare an old lady this way scare all i asked was who are you talking to ii well mae of course mae remembered aunt wang cro she would pretend and pretend that everything was fine there were no mirrors in the room mae where is mae can you see her in this room mae leaned back in case the old one could see her reflection in the desk the desk stopped teaching excuse me was that an instruction i do not understand mae pushed again okay who are you i am the thing stopped for a moment it had no identity i am i am madam tung ailing then who are you talking to mae thrust words like a knife excuse me was that an instruction i dont know i cant see im blind this is terrible to do to an old blind lady make fun of her why are you doing this the thing tried to stand up it tried to look about mae could feel a twitching in the nerves of her legs and neck and eyes she needs my body to live mae thought she wants it so mae asked airily do you like being in yeshiboz sistemlar excuse me was that an instruction no mae told the desk please continue lesson who are you talking to mrs tung demanded in triumph an intelligent desk they make them these days its giving me a lesson in the un format i dont know what you mean of course you dont you cant remember anything from one minute to the next you are here in karzistans most important medicalcomputer complex where did you think you were i dont its of no importance when international fundraising efforts failed the major company offered to pay for both formats promising to keep both workstreams entirely independent on the screen important people shook hands and half the un general assembly rose to its feet applauding others notably stayed seated see this desk the whole thing is a screen yes see the people applauding yes of course so who in kizuldah has such a thing mrs tung fought to keep her equilibrium as had the iron aunt by disguise and improvisation kwan kwan we are in kwans house everyone says she has made her house very modern you see the desk yes of course i see the desk how you are blind i i my eyes have got better how long have they been better since yesterday since yesterday oh there was a miracle yesterday what else happened yesterday mae was shouting the consortium proved to be shortlived amid technical disagreements and charges that the company was rigging air structures that would only work with its other solutions old mrs tung faltered i i you came to see me who who came to see you who are you talking to she chuckled embarrassed its so silly i cant theres no one here where are you i dont know mrs tung wailed aloud mae bellowed i just told you why cant you remember old mrs tung broke down into desperate tears i cant i cant she shook maes head revulsion flooded through maes body like a case of food poisoning something was sickeningly out of place wrong i am like a ghost i am invisible i have no body i cant move wailed old mrs tung mae began to weep for her for the neat dead system of responses on the other side of the screen of the world mae felt the terror and the sadness and the horror of being dead and so the thing gained strength it spoke as if mae and she were one well lose everything this is a terrible place we must get away mae struggled back her voice more feeble what place is this i dont know dont start that again where are you what day stop pestering me who are you to come at me with impertinent questions work began on the new format from the beginning some engineers felt the schedule was too ambitious mrs tung barked what is that thing talking about i told you the un format but you cant remember shall i explain it again to you no i dont want to hear about it of course you dont because youre scared of it and youre scared of it because you know you wouldnt be able to remember it you can remember nothing where are we cant remember i just told you where we are but you cant remember can you can you you cant remember what day it is or where you are or even who you are the thing howled and stood up and mae stood up with it the thing was in a rage mae felt it thrash inside her with frustration if the thing had carried an old walking stick she would have beaten mae with it the thing spun in confusion and anger and disgust and terror around and around the desk and it threw mae against the imprisoning walls mae felt a buzzing in her brain and her body as if there was a great numb abscess in all of her being suddenly maes hand reached up and slapped her own face mae clenched and fought her hand shook in midair wavered as if pulled by magnets mae shouted whose face did you slap you slapped and you felt it yourself how could you slap someones face and feel it yourself i dont know let me go let me go excuse me i am hearing sounds of distress do wish me to call for help the hand slapped mae again even harder mae fought with words you slapped a body whose body the thing howled in terror and struck maes face again and again left hand right hand left hand beating her about the face mae pushed youre sick youre old youre mad youre crazy the thing stumbled wounded and disorientated i dont know i dont knowhoho the thing wailed in complete despair you cant remember youre senile youre dead youre dead and senile and sick you have no hands you have no eyes you are nowhere you do not exist let me go the thing heaved with sobs it could no longer speak for grief and despair and horror its voice rose to a despairing shriek and it picked mae up and flung her across the desk and like the passing of a tornado suddenly everything was still mae was left panting alone in mr tunchs office do you need me to call for help the desk asked no mae was able to croak her throat was raw from shouting she had been speaking for both of them tears and spit were smeared all over her face and splattered over the desktop the cheeks and the palms of her hands stung she sat up and looked at her own reflection in the glasstopped desk a fresh bruise was coming up on her cheek suspicion made mae look up and she saw a camera in the corner of the room tunch will have seen all that she thought hell have been spying well if hes seen all that then thats all hes going to get from me mae pulled in deep shuddering breaths she stood up and wiped her face and tried to straighten her hair ive seen her off i know how to see her off and i dont need mr tunch time she thought to get down to work continue with lecture she told the desk mr tunch joined her for lunch i thought you might like to try the new food he said because of her lecture mae knew what that meant new proteins new tastes grown from new organisms they are designed to be delicious he said the soup was bracing and solid like lentils laced with lemon and made hearty with something like tomatoes and pork it was sour and sweet with a bitter undertow like coffee you see he said chuckling good isnt it yes mae had to admit yes i wonder if i will be happy to go back to cold rice he laughed again and said maybe you wont have to i am in part a question map for his future you are experimenting on me she told tunch coldly the food is specially formulated for expectant mothers he told her its nutrients pass within seconds into the bloodstream through any tissue layer in effect it is being digested the moment it enters the mouth does that mean its shit by the time ive swallowed it mr tunch only chuckled he touched maes bruised face mae were trying to help you for a moment she almost believed him in the afternoon fatimah led mae to what looked like a flying saucer mae lay down in it and again there was no physical pain fatimah clucked once with her tongue she turned the scan off helped mae down what what mae said the child said fatimah dazed the pregnancy is in your stomach mae blinked in karz the words belly or womb and stomach could be confused your food belly said fatimah how mae knew what she knew that was not possible your machine is wrong she said no chance said fatimah here she replayed the file of the sounding the screen showed a shifting mass of what looked like translucent grey porridge shapes seemed to bubble out of it pumping and alive something sighed and shrugged inside her fleetingly mae even saw something like a head thats the child it has grown the usual protective sac and appears to be healthy for now fatimah turned back and looked at her the downward slope of her head crumpled her chin and neck and made her look older sadfleshed like mae it is in your stomach so how could it happen maes voice was raised fatimahs deepbrown eyes kept staring down into hers as if to offer her a stable place pregnancies can take root anywhere in the body once the egg has been kissed the question is how would an egg and the male part meet in your stomach and mae knew how ilahe illallah she gasped though nominally a buddhist and covered her mouth she had swallowed ken she had swallowed her own menstrual blood she felt like a flurry of scarves all fears and horrors she was stripped and bare her sexuality exposed her private secret bedroom found to have one wall missing the whole village could look in scientists peered over mr kens shoulder prying into her strange habits has this ever happened before mae whispered fatimah shrugged if it has it would miscarry by now what will happen mae was following the consequences of this monstrosity birth through the throat surgery the child cannot be healthy said fatimah as for birth it should be by surgery but i cannot recommend that we we can help you quietly telling no one her voice trailed away a warm hand on maes chilled arm in the raw villages of karzistan unwanted winter babies were left to crystallize in the snows third daughters were whisked away and dispatched before the mother could see them and love them fatimah seemed alarmed by something her voice was still low there can be no question of your keeping it mae felt as though she were clutching a cloth over herself to hide naked breasts if the village knew this what would they do she was already a monster for simply falling out of marriage a woman who talked too much and then gave birth to a monster through her mouth they might drive her away with stones you must understand the stomach is full of strong acid to dissolve food we dont know what that will do to the child mae was seeing mr kens face her young man young either one of them yes at heart they were young at heart and in memory they would always be in school together longing and shy they would always be the lovers who found each other late in life that heart and memory would only be as real as long as they lived but if there were a child that meant that love would outlive both of them and that was what love was for all the waste and the pain and the inconvenience and the awkwardness and the ugliness it was to draw together and build an island of love in which children could grow and love can be passed on mae mae you cannot be thinking mae was thinking of redemption in karz the phrase for it was unexpected flower it was seen as late indian summer surprising the world with roses my unexpected flower she called the child the machines were silent and blue around them i need to think was all that mae could say you wont be given much of a chance for that said fatimah the rest of the afternoon session consisted of qualitative research mae was introduced to a bald eager stranger with spectacles this is mr pakansir he will ask you questions hello mrs chungmaam please answer the questions quickly no need for deep consideration the name pakan meant real man mae sat legs crossed arms crossed trying to find cover the questions began easily enough occupation marriage was she a happy woman how did things change after formatting after the test how did things change would you say that your sexual habits changed after formatting no said mae but uh you are pregnant in an unusual way no one knows how such a thing is possible replied mae we understand however that your marriage broke down mae sat silent is that true you have just said that you were happily married how did it become unhappy mae smiled silently mr real mans grin went a bit fierce mr tunch has said to remind you perhaps of your bargain that you will help us understand in return for training your mind was interfered with by the un format we are trying to understand what happened to help others mr real man went back to his sheet of papers they were printed but not entirely square on the paper did you find yourself performing sexual acts that were not part of your previous repertoire silence please mrs chung these are medical questions poor man you do not know who you are dealing with thought mae had you ever heard of or known about oral sex before the formatting mae couldnt help but answer how on earth do you think peasant women avoid being pregnant all the time he looked disappointed oh so you knew about sex with the mouth before the formatting there is no chance that the formatting planted the idea mae did not answer her heart was growing as tight as her masklike little smile was it something that you practised frequently mr pakan slouched forward groin thrust out unconsciously he began to rock back and forth as if having sex with the tip of his long tie mae stood up thinking of mr haseem and kicked mr real man between the legs he groaned and doubled over she struck him in the face his glasses slipped lopsided and he slumped forward on his knees he crawled out of the room mae kicked him on the bottom and sent him sprawling over the polished padded floor outside the room and then she slammed the door behind him she waited her breath quivering as though it were fire she was not an ignorant peasant or some farm animal made to reproduce as they wished they were going to have to learn to treat her as a person of consequence mr tunch came early he looked amused you are confirming important data for us am i really said mae she felt as though her teeth had been filed into a saw you were not violent before the formatting were you mae paused i never met such bastards until the formatting mr tunch was still smiling he was amused i wish i could have seen it poor old mr real man asking his neat little machine questions and meeting real life by mistake mae was unmoved unfooled he was doing your bidding are you going to hit me tunch asked in mock alarm mae considered i might kill you if you go too far even mr tunch blinked oh he said darkening i am a direct person are you going to blame that on the un as well mae batted her eyelashes at him it was his turn to grin masklike mae sat back feeling hearty like she was surrounded by friends and picking on an enemy thats why you do this mr tunch you want to sell the gates format you have to say the un format is bad it is bad because it gives away too much to people like me is the gates format paying you mr tunch closed his eyes and his smile went gentler amused and rueful he looked at her in something like affection and said unexpected flower mae felt a chill just how much had mr wisdom bronze penetrated with his machines and question maps he sighed whenever i despair for our people and think there is no hope with the ignorance the poverty the deep divisions the lack of resources someone like you surprises me and i know i know karzistan could take on the world the two looked at each other both surprised you are very damaged you know he added you want to rifle through the pages of my life hold my underwear in the sun to show stains mae gathered herself up and asked brightly did you make the money for all of this from drugs his face hung suspended she shrugged look you cant shock me a wise man makes money where he can you are not from yeshibozkent i can tell that from your accent you are from far down the valley where soil sun everything is hard the poppies grow there he was staring at her almost wary am i still your unexpected flower she asked his face had recovered but at least he no longer looked amused by her even more so he said you see i know you you are wise gangster godfather mae mimed a ratatattat so yes i am afraid of you i know what you could do to me i do what i have to do he said then he added hastily that was not a threat to you i meant i do what i have to do to help our people mae was considering wisdom bronze said how else was i to build this she believed him how else and you hate the foreigners even more than you hate us he looked uncertain after all we are ignorant poor deeply divided mae sighed so many of us must get in your way i am trying to be your friend he said softly ah said mae looking at the floor do you know how terrifying that idea is he smiled one last smile before leaving her but he also pointed a warning finger mae found that she knew his story she could see it fate and his fathers seed his mothers egg conspired to give birth to someone very smart indeed hikmet tunch would have been a clever clownish farm boy wickedly sharp and sometimes brutal she could see him scowling with thought as he forked chickpeas into the mill or kicked geese away from the grain this is for fools he would have thought seeing the hard work that produced only pennies a day he saw the daredevil thugs in their shiny track suits and heavy jewellery he joined them volunteering asking for the most dangerous jobs he carried the stuff across borders he did this so he could see how the rest of the world worked hikmet tunch at seventeen would have looked like a truck driver stumpy hard unshaven smiling ingratiatingly to the guards at the borders all the time he spoke to them his merry eyes would be innocent even though he knew the gas tank was half full of white paste hikmet would have seen berlin prague and st petersburg he would have studied the world by screwing its women to discover from them their languages how they thought what they valued he would have come back and hated the way the buildings in karzistan did not sit straight the way the dust gathered in the road he would have hated the peasant clothes and the paintings on the trucks and the old wooden houses wise gangster would have built up friends loyal men from his village big hefty criminal men nowhere near as bright but who followed him and threatened others he would have killed people not often but you do not take over the drug trade from a position of mere carrier without knowing when to strike and to strike so hard that the enemy can never recover wisdom bronze was a man who would have burned fields whole villages killed male heirs who were only five years old and yet thought mae underneath it all our aim is the same to help the people what wise gangster knew was that info was the new drug fatimah came into maes room looking only slightly shifty have you thought about the pregnancy fatimah began she was genuinely concerned but she had been told mae could see to get the same information as mr real man i have become an unexpected poppy to be milked for juice could this have happened to you before mae decided to lie they want answers so ill fuck them up by giving wrong ones oh yes of course we all suck in my village that meant fatimah could say she had done her job to her credit the thing that most concerned her was maes plight i have something that will resolve the problem for you she murmured do you really think i would do anything here in your clutches to be entered into your records what is it mae asked if it was a pill she could pocket it but fatimah took out a needle very quick one injection then it is gone with no chemical traces a natural dropping especially given where the pregnancy is no said mae look mae said fatimah the earlier the better the easier in all ways physically emotionally mae looked at fatimah and found she knew her too a pretty woman very smart she had a rich father good education but where could she use her skills in karzistan where else but here where shytan himself rules a kind woman too as rich women often are but small being rich inflates smallness like a balloon being rich stretches it thinner dont you believe in love mae asked her i i fatimah fluttered that brought you up smartly city woman you dont think love is of no concern in medicine do you no said fatimah hurt no no of course not she prided herself on her care her concern and her sensitivity then why are you so blind and deaf to the simple fact that a mother might love a late and unexpected flower mae waited and then added especially when the father is the only man she has ever loved mae knew somehow that fatimah had never been loved and part of mae wanted to hurt her fatimah seemed to wilt i i did not understand the situation perhaps you would care to help me instead fatimah looked thoroughly chastised her eyes were downcast if youll let me i have to know what you feel to help so sighed mae is it the case that i am supposed to let you questionmap me and only then you will care fatimah looked chilled to the bone you want to be a good woman said mae smiling ruefully perhaps it is not possible to be good here fatimah rallied is it possible to be good anywhere okay so we get down to something true we all do the best we can said mae so you tell me how do we save my baby fatimah considered it might not be possible if the child is small some kind of birth might be possible otherwise it will be surgery when would you say it is due its development is strange say may or june would you be able to come back here fatimahs eyes were pained askance i am sure that this place would help you have it it has the most advanced medical and scientific equipment in karzistan what would they get out of it probably nothing further they will have gotten enough for them to be generous what will they get out of me fatimah sighed scientific fame a high profile in the industry she smiled sideways medicalit interface in karzistani the word for interface was twoface which had an implication of betrayal neither of them needed to comment on the appropriateness of that you must not do physical work said fatimah if you do miscarry vomit make yourself vomit all you can do not let anything stay in your stomach and call me i will do what i can to come to you there were no windows in the room and no clocks but mae felt it was late i would like to go back to my hotel now it was as she had feared fatimahs face went still with shame im sorry fatimah began but given your condition it is felt best that you spend the night here i want to spend it in my hotel fatimahs eyes were sorry indeed it is very comfortable for our guests here i know too much said mae i said too much very quietly indeed mae had become a prisoner the roomsare very comfortable in the palace of the devil considering there are no windows a guard brought mae her dinner he was huge so tall his bulging belly did not look fat he had hairy hands and eyes like camera lenses mae knew him too she saw him as big farm boy playing in the same stubble fields as wisdom bronze did you know mr tunch when he was a boy she asked nothing in his face moved he watched her eat and took back the plate and the knives mae saw the tiny blinking red light that watched her she waited until all the lights were off and they could not see her she whispered to herself without even moving her lips mae mae mae mae mae she traced the gnarled root of herself back down deep she felt the settling peace the calm and the end of fear and terror as she fell away from it the white walls of yeshiboz sistemlar looked as thin and frail as eggshells mae settled as gently as an angel into the courtyard her clothes seemed to trail after her in ribbons like silk underwater the courtyard now looked more like kwans grand house instead of pens the blue walls were lined with beautiful new businesses all glowing golden with light they had modern plastic shopsigns that looked like poppies opening and closing info help thats entertainment mae entered help and there was mae herself dressed as a talent assistantmae knew what she wanted she wanted to see the gates format for herself iam afraid there is no programming that allows communication between the un and the gates formats you will not be able to find any gates format imprints mae asked the mask does this system contain any information about the gates format maeassistant smiled like a shop sign the help function contains information about functions in this format only is there anything in info i want to know what imprints are and how they work i want to know what the un format is and how it translates thoughts i dont want to owe tunch for anything the assistantmae replied smoothly the info section was developed for the pilot project and contains only examples of proposed kinds of content mae regarded her own face is my smile so unhelpful when i turn it on my customers why doesnt air contain anything was the smile more broad it is a common failing of it projects to underestimate the difficulty of providing content and the time scales required air was pigignorant mae was not fooled either by her own face these things the courtyard the shop fronts they are just for show this is not air itself they are the traffic signs towards it so mae turned without another word and walked into air air she knew was eternal mae walked deliberately this time into the blue of information she merged with the blue walls as if they were glowing blue fog she kept on walking the walls faded into night she stood in chaos and kept feeling the gnarled root deeper and deeper until even the sound of her own thinking was hushed and she felt even herself fade the root seemed to get thicker and thicker as if it had become the trunk of a tree it would eventually become everything it would become the world and all the worlds in which the world sat mae herself was the thinnest possible little trail back towards the fiction of the world she could no longer remember what she was looking for i dont want to go on she managed to think blindly she felt her way back the blue light shone her fingernails glowed as white as her hospital gown as if everything were smiling mae stepped back into the courtyard she walked quietly into thats entertainment there were games machines and radios all along the walls there was soaring operatic music in front of a tv set old mrs tung sat watching turandot hello granny said mae gently mrs tung turned and smiled eyes twinkling she could not remember the last time she and mae met all she remembered was the love deeply imprinted there you are dear i was just thinking i hope mae comes to pay a visit isnt it marvellous the tv how ive yearned to see turandot they say it happens in karzistan you know and you have seen it over and over and over because it is the only thing on tv in air but you cant remember that heaven is the place where you cannot change and nothing can ever happen so the things you love are always eternal hell is exactly the same the hero kalaf was singing no ones sleeping no ones sleeping i just wanted to make sure said mae i just wanted to make sure that you were well i just wanted to make sure that you were as beautiful as i remember ohhoohoo the hooting laugh now eternal and old mrs tung reached across and took maes hand mrs tung thought she still had a hand is the beaning going well this year i used to so love it all of us on blankets doing the shelling together yes said mae it is still going well then mae said though she knew mrs tung could not understand i know it is not you who does these things to me it is the error they made whatever mistake it was i just wanted to make sure of that and old mrs tung hooted again as if she knew what mae was talking about and mae began to repeat her own name over and over her and mrs tungs metaphorical hands disentangled like roots in the morning the guard served mae breakfast on a tray the food iridesced like a rainbow and the flavours veered between pork and jam and all the flavours of breakfast at once it was delicious she threw it up into the wastebasket it continued to shift colours in the bin mae covered her eyes and wept and then cast off the water from her cheeks she was led out through all the disney world people all spanking new and polished do you know they keep prisoners here she asked their pristine smiles she was led to the desk time she told herself to learn the desk began by showing her the inside of an eye early efforts at interface had beamed coded light signals onto the retina and recorded differences in pathways residual patterns of neural activity appeared that were nothing to do with the light other information appeared to be passed the brain was responding to low levels of electrical charges from outside the body animals were given sudden peak charges that stimulated all areas of their brain every neural pathway was stimulated at once the mystery was that once stimulated the charge continued the brain entered a new state always charged always open the charge continued to exist without any further source of energy how could this be there could be no perpetual motion no undying source of unreplenished energy unless the brain existed in a realm with no time once imprinted it stayed charged it was like a radio switched on forever but not in our world there was another world of seven other dimensions beyond time and air existed in those air had no spatial dimension in air one mind occupied the same space as another stimulation of one imprinted brain correlated to increased activity in another but attempts at shared thinking resulted in disorder and discomfort one brain works in a way very different from another what was needed to make air work was a uniform format for information in theory at least this format would simply be information too it could be added to the imprints providing a shared mechanism for making messages compatible and so able to be shared the first formats were crude mathematical formulae that made only the simplest kinds of neural impulses to be communicated the first successfully shared air message was plus equals it took the form of nervous jolts two jolts two jolts and then four in succession if air were to be used for any commercial purpose it would have to do more than that synaesthesia was a phenomenon long known and little understood some people saw sound tasted colour felt words in their fingertips the brain so delicate so responsive was responding to minute charge differences caused by other phenomena infants experienced them then learned how to block them from synaesthesia a means of stimulating images sounds and even tastes was developed a means of translating this system into first protocols and then encoding for those protocols was some years in development end of lesson lunch came again it was the silent guard who brought it and mae knew then that despite all his smiles hikmet tunch was frightened of her lunch moved it was delicious new organisms that could talk bits of lunch piped up in merry little voices we are designed to provide full vitamin and other protein content undiminished by death or cooking think of us as the perfect form of happy nutrition then they sang a happy little song waiting to be eaten they looked like limbless prawns without shells with little carbon crystals perched on top like jewels take that foulness away tell mr tunch that i will starve myself rather than eat anything other than normal food the silent giant nodded once and left the room with the lunch still pointedly on the table still singing like little intelligent bells he came back with a bowl of ordinary soup he sat and watched mae eat it as if making sure she did he looked at his watch it was only after several mouthfuls that mae realized the soup had an aftertaste is there something in this she asked the giant left colours began to sharpen mae felt her unease with a new razorsharpness the door opened and mr pakan came in with a dog the dogs head was shaved and a neat little metal cap was bolted to its skull the cap had a speaker in it mae hello mae the dog slobbered in affection i have a job people trust me with a job they have made me much smarter and taught me how to talk there may be a future for dogs if we can tell jokes and love our masters it came toward mae backing her into a corner please let me lick your hand i only want to lick your hand maes head was beginning to buzz and there was a kind of gathering tension as if a bubble had swollen and was about to burst you bastards she managed to say they were doing this deliberately to bring mrs tung back dont you like me please like me the dog was pleading wanting to whimper but the whimper was given a voice who will feed me if i am not loved where are we dear mae heard oxygen rustle in her ear and she understood so clearly everything that mrs tung was feeling the floor was shifting underfoot the room was melting lets go home do you know the way mae settled onto the floor mr pakan nipped forward and began to wrap velcro around maes arm the last thing mae saw before losing her body was the dog eating the singing food gosh this is good said the dog mae was buzzed all the way to the back of her body mrs tung stood up and sat in a chair and asked mr pakan would you be good enough to find a blanket for me dear who is that man mae tried to ask her you dont know who he is do you the colours chuckled and mae fell silent but oh mrs tung thought its so good to have joints free from pain and to see so clearly my books i shall be able to read my books again mrs tung hooted with pleasure now she thought if only mae were here mae awoke feeling limp as if every bone were broken she was in bed in a room that was like a hospital but it was a room for one sick bay rules said a notice on a bulletin board she was still being held a kind of ringing went off a young male nurse put his head through the door his eyes skittered over machines how do you feel he asked in a high quiet voice he might have been hikmet tunchs brother how do you think i feel mae thought not too good she replied do i still have my baby he paused for a beat i think so he wasnt sure someone will see you soon he turned and left somewhere music was playing the buzzing strings the slight wheedling flatness of the flute marked it as karzistani the melody was in a european scale sad and measured with its wavering muerain singing and electronic sounds the music was perched exactly between asia and europe the old and the new like us thought mae how like us it is it was yet another song of lost love i am missing the harvest thought mae the valley floor will be cleared and mr wing will hire the green machines and the rice will be separated from the stalks the rice will be piled high in mounds someones car will be running with the radio on to make music this song perhaps mae saw them in her mind the yellowbluegreen of the old ladies aprons over their blue trousers all faded with washing age and dust fatimah was back in the room you did this to me mae said she knew they had deliberately provoked old mrs tung to return fatimah blinked im sorry do i still have my baby have you taken my baby fatimah was getting weary of this no we havent she said quietly did you learn what you had to fatimah sat on the bed we now know what happens when the other imprinted personality takes over it requires emotional synergy when both personalities feel the same thing for example when you both feel fear tell me something new thought mae something in the way mae shifted on the bed made fatimah stop we have given you a drug that will help you keep the other personality under control fatimah was holding a foil in her hand her eyes said see we are trying to help she was amused by something at the same time these pills are so new the paste is still drying what does the drug do mae asked it reduces emotional synergy fatimah shrugged the only words she had were big ones either she didnt want to or couldnt say clearly what it did but mae knew she could feel it it scatters me like leaves she said fatimah sighed and breathed out once hard thats it it might have side effects like that i would not be part of the harvest anyway the village would shut me out i have no rice to harvest it is all joes rice so i would hang around outside the threshing field like a ghost if i try to tell people what i have seen here the drug will make me vague or mrs tung and i will rise up together in front of them mad then i will give birth out of my mouth and be a monster you rest said fatimah and patted her arm part of mae wanted to weep and say i want to go home but she was blocked from that strong emotion or clear thought melted away at some point fatimah had gone and mae was alone where is my good dress she wondered i took my good dress to the city and my talent jacket she looked around the room and saw nothing that was hers the good dress and the talent jacket faded in importance mae swung her feet out from the bed she stood in a surgical shift there was nothing in maes mind as clear as a decision to escape she simply left she did not consciously say leave the drugs better the war the pain and the clarity the foil of pills remained on the table by the bed mae opened the door and walked out into the corridor and the dog was there go growled the dog ears alert teeth bared rising up back mae assumed that for all practical purposes she was talking to mr tunch weve completed our bargain she said in a faded weepy voice it wasnt fair shed done what she said fair trade you are supposed to stay there his voice was even mechanical with strange jumps of tone and texture why mae asked the dog cocked his head to one side because you are sick now im well the dog loped forward and snuffled her and licked her hand sorry i bit you he said he looked up at her needing direction mae touched the box on his head too scattered to feel disgust the drugs made her feel wonder she thought of her kru it is like this for the dog they imprinted him and plugged him into the skill of language or maybe the skills of a whole person maybe it was tunch you can understand things now do you remember what it was like before a little bit said the dog there were only smells i remember smells now i remember other things you can choose said mae you can decide things she thought of getting back the world swam around her the task of leaving the building walking across the town finding her way back up the mountainside it was all impossible without help you can help me get back home the dog cocked his head his tail wagged suddenly twice what hes doing said mae to no one in particular is things that would not be allowed in any other country thats why theyre paying him so he can do things for them and find things out like me said the dog he had to make you as smart as he could there would only ever be one the dog stepped forward head lowered tail still wagging you cant get out that way the dog said they will see you this is the way he put his nose to the floor and snuffled he was following a scent all mae was aware of was that it was pleasant to have a companion when she was a child her iron aunt had had a big rangy dog called mo who was a bit crazy mo peed everywhere he would come up and join mae and walk with her for a time but only at his own choice it felt like that now they turned down corridors the dogs ears pricked up and he spun around once and tried to bark who the mechanical voice said a man in white came up chuckling and scratched the dogs ears not mr pakan hello ling he said where are you going boy mae still swam on tides of herself and it was in both innocence and a bit of cunning that she replied ling is taking me where i am supposed to be going oh very good wonderful isnt it have you talked to him about smells it is like entering another world i have a bit said mae and it is wonderful how are you feeling the drugs have taken very powerful effect said mae his smile went a bit steely perhaps it was the drug but his teeth seemed to glint thats good he said he bowed and left we did not tell the truth said ling the mechanical voice could convey no emotion were learning said mae there was a booming and a bashing ahead of them mae thought of thunder then drums ling stopped and waited and inclined his head in a universal crossspecies sign scratch my ears mae unconsciously obeyed the sound came from huge metal barrels men in blue overalls rolled them past mae ling growled establishing he was a loyal guard dog good boy chuckled the deliverymen gazing in blank lust even at a middleaged woman in a shift rather you than me ling they said deciding maes lack of erotic charm made her an object of scorn ling sat panting patiently he lifted up his nose tasting the air lapped maes hand and walked on his claws clicking slipping on the polished floor he led her to a blue door he nudged the long metal handle with his nose mae was numbly grateful thank you she pushed the door and stepped out into a full parking lot in blazing sunlight full of burnished company buses and three limousines ling followed there was a fence it was high and made of crisscrossed metal and was crowned all along the top with barbed wire mae was dim and detached she felt her root into air it was easier to do on drugs for she was as a calm as if she were in air this is all a joke she said and suddenly smiled it was true the world was a joke it was a story twisted by gravity out of nothing it was an accidental byproduct of air of the eternity where air was she could feel this eternity she could take the story into her hands she could feel the metal fence the fence was mere fiction so she tore it reaching into air mae seized reality as she herself had been seized and very simply very easily maes mind ripped the metal of the fence apart she giggled at how funny it was that everyone should take the fence so seriously she tore the mesh like a strip of cloth this season she said airaware young ladies will wear the fences they have torn down as sign of their strength the torn edges of the fence danced as if in wind sing she told the fence and started to chuckle why not and the snapped sharp edges of the torn wire began to tinkle just as lunch had done anything was possible wind blew the dust the fence danced and sang and mae stepped out into the desert followed by a talking dog beyond the fence was hot valley scrubland full of bracken and thorns grown to maes height the thorns and bracken parted and bowed before her she walked barefoot through them they rose up again behind her to shield her she heard lings feet behind her in the dust overhead was sky unchanging clouds as they had been in the time of the buddha youre coming with me she said yes said ling it is my job to stay with you how will we get home i will follow you there a lizard scuttled across their path into shadow and froze watchful its throat pumping what do you see mae asked him many corridors said the dog no ceiling that is called the sky said mae the dog paused and then was pumped with info oh yes he said i see it is the sky now they walked overhead hawks circled looking for desert mice i want to hunt said ling no not yet later you have a job said mae ahead of them were the mountains soft and rounded in the nearer layers then rising up one after another back into the hills back to the sharply folded crags the snow mae had a vague plan to walk through the undeveloped plain around the town already they were pushing their way through a hedge into a dust track leading to the outskirts of a village a handsome green mosque rose up above mud huts and there was a smell of billy goat two women were making dungcakes they turned leathery desertplain faces to her not quite believing what they saw a naked chinese woman they would later say with a dog wearing a metal hat mae pushed her way through another hedge and walked across a field of straw when do we eat ling asked i dont know said mae something seemed to go pop in her head her thinking was clearing ling feels unloved if he is not fed warned the computer on his head he becomes anxious and unreliable there is a big juicy steak at home and a bowl of water promised mae water dripped from lings panting tongue that sounds good he said i can see the steak he said i can smell it the computer was feeding him good dog good boy said mae feeling sorry for him for being fooled for being possessed it made her feel they had things in common the city had spread beyond its old boundaries mae paused at the edge of a road there was nothing for it but for mae to keep walking the streets were bright broken traffic idled past her heads turned a woman shouted something about covering herself up drunken woman the dog turned and growled baring teeth in black jaws why are they all so worried wondered mae my shift is as long as my knees and some of us are still so poor we wander barefoot a teenage boy all in sleepingbag clothes stepped out then stepped back into a small bookshop and called to his friends a man helpless in a barbers chair stared at her as she passed his face going slack and open the world is so big said ling a man in old stiff clothes and a peasants cap dropped a bag of tools these are all houses for people said mae where does the world stop asked ling the man began to follow it never stops said mae your your dog is talking said the man ling thought he was being praised and turned back to sniff the man he was a hard karz villager with a face that looked as though someone had smashed it with a plank of wood stubbleblack chin merging with huge moustache he backed away in alarm they do it in the air said mae explaining wanting him to know it was nothing extraordinary it is like a radio in his head and in his throat the man began to shake his head over and over he wiped away the world with his hand i fix cars he said he turned back the dog understands i want to said ling the man gazed into the dogs soft black eyes as if he could fall into them and disappear tuh was all he said the sound of his world changing suddenly for real he picked up his bag of tools ling sniffed them experimentally dazed the man scratched his head and turned away the boys from the bookshop stared mae gave them a little wave and walked on the streets began to climb steeply how far to the steak ling asked oh perfect boy lovely fellow said mae it is a long way but we will talk what is the world like to you ling asked her right now i am drugged so everything is very strange like it is for you a woman came up to her and wordlessly pressed into maes hands a pair of plastic sandals the plastic was clear and full of silver flakes that reflected and caught the sunlight the womans eyes were ringed with mascara full of outrage and pity she wore a purple jacket and westernwoman working boots may i suggest a light mauve scarf with a such a strongly coloured jacket said mae mae she told herself your mind your mind is not working properly yet the womans face did not change but she walked away quickly mae walked on in her silver shoes to where the road turned off towards the sign for home and she looked back over the city with its trees and light shadows were slightly longer sunlight and shadow were balanced in the foul blue air it looked cooler golden mauve rising up out of the light was the great saudi mosque made of frosted crystal dancing quotes from the koran catching the sunlight to be illuminated from within a long bronzereflecting limousine coasted to a halt beside her a window slid open like the protective lens of a lizards eye and mr tunch leaned out mae felt terror only the terror could not fight its way to the surface of her face her limbs or down into the pit of her stomach im caught she thought blandly hello mae said wisdom bronze they both waited he pushed open the door on the other side of the car let me drive you home mae could not move part of her wanted to cry her eyes tried to cry but the drugs prevented it ling looked back and forth back and forth mae he pleaded for direction get in she said in a voice so soft only a dog could hear he said were going home said the dog he climbed into the backseat next to maes old best dress mr tunch was doing his own driving i meant what i said mae his eyes were blanked out by glasses theres something i want to explain something seemed to pop in maes head again something told her the walking had been good it had made the drugs worse but theyd be over with sooner the thought meant she had not yet got into the car dont be silly mae you are not important enough to me to hurt you she got in the front seat me whimpered ling and claws clattering climbed onto maes lap his feet dug in for something to grab ouch said mae hold me said ling and she realized he was afraid he ached for the window where there were smells the world he truly believed in mae hoisted him around so that he sat on her lap comfortably all in asked tunch as if they were a family on an outing the car went in the right direction what will happen to you back home tunch asked mae considered i will be an outcast it will make helping the village very difficult for they will not listen to me pop went her head clearing again she began to be aware of the light breeze of fear blowing through her you wont take the drugs he asked mae shook her head he had to change gear glancing in the mirror at the future behind them that is probably wise it will leave you with a clearer head but when you and mrs tung feel the same thing she will emerge i can beat her off said mae except when people interfere sorry said tunch mae could have said a lot of things do you say sorry to the wives of men you kill or do you just threaten how do you keep all your separate selves apart i hope you manage to keep the smalltime assassin separate from the man who wants to rule pop tunch went on one of the side effects as the drug wears off will be a period of uh greater sensitivity someone needs to be with you pop you know my address in air will you be recording that too pop and sell the information to the foreigners or have they already paid for anything you might find out it depends murmured tunch on the information ling said mae he may try to kill you too many people have seen you boy and you are not supposed to exist do you understand me boy yes said the unreadable mechanical voice mae buried her face against his furry cheek and the bare shaved forehead im sorry i didnt understand i should have left you in the compound watch him ling he has masters too like you do he has to be loyal to them or he does not eat you and he are the same i understand said ling good boy ling said tunch just be a good boy i always am said ling mae said you will turn karzistan into the garbage pail of the world karzistan has to make a living he said the car drove on grasses blurring by what was close was lost in speed you do not understand me mae said tunch i am slightly relying on the drug to help you accept what i will say what i am about to say is said using very carefully chosen words used in a very precise way im ready said mae i am a hero said tunch lings nose was pushed out of the window this world smells different he said mae was unimpressed i am waiting for the precise meaning of the word said mae a hero mediates said tunch he brings together good and evil he uses the tools of evil may even be evil to do something constructive people need heroes they yearn for them that is because people who are not heroes think that heroes are good and evil is done by people who think they are good good people do harm by being gentle and not stopping things good people fight wars out of love they need heroes to break that cycle to defend them to build things black shadows danced inside maes eyes and mrs tung tried to gather her thoughts it is terrible but it is the only way forward heroes are not like in stories where they wear a mask of nobility all heroes do evil terrible things robin hood was a thief and murderer john kennedy ordered invasions and wars so did lawrence who fought like a wolf for the arabs ataturk destroyed the mosques and killed the clergy wonderful terrible people are both good and evil the drug made it difficult for anyone to gather their thoughts you are trying to tell me why you will never do me harm she said now that you have learned from the harm you have already done me exactly you are too valuable i want you home in your village you know why yes mae said meekly you think i am a hero too tunch simply gave a thin satisfied grin how did you tear the fence he asked mae told him air is real and we are not wisdom nodded once something confirmed mae told herself what she did not tell him what they have done is make an artificial soul you and your format want to sell our souls back to us you are about to find out that we have always had them they drove on into the night ling rode with his head out of the window halfway up the hill the dog asked why are there stars they dont smell tunch replied they smell of heat so fierce it burns away the ability to smell are we getting closer to them said ling looking around not yet not for a good few many years said tunch mae suddenly understood that tunch intended to stand on the stars however many centuries it took tunch asked the dog do you want to know how the universe began oh that would be good to know said the dog looking around dreadful pride said mae tunch was very pleased with that and grinned when there is nothingness he said gravity does not attract it becomes repulsive ask what those words mean obediently the dog consulted air sweat dripping off his panting tongue after a moment ling said gravity pulls everything together it makes us heavy so we stay on the ground otherwise we would float off to the stars good said tunch so my nose wont burn out no the dog seemed to grin panting tunch continued before anything existed gravity had nothing to do except pull apart it pulled and nothingness stretched like a rubber band until it broke when it broke there was a burst of light and heat so energy was created and out of energy things were made so far so good said the dog so with something there instead of nothing gravity then became an attractive force it pulled together as the universe exploded it also pulled and twisted things into shapes clouds of gas then balls of gas then stars is gravity a hero too asked the dog yes said tunch pleased how asked mae we know that mathematically there must be eleven dimensions like height and width except these other dimensions were not affected by the explosion at the beginning they are still the same size coiled at the heart of the universe where nothing really changes think of the point right at the centre of a wheel the wheel turns but the point does not whats a wheel asked ling were riding on wheels access the mathematical definition of a point okay boss in those coiled dimensions we know that the same equations that describe electromagnetism describe gravity in the timeless realms outside our universe they are one now ask again what is thought ling had the answer ready an electromagnetic phenomenon differences in charges produced by chemical reactions gravity is like thought it has power over everything in this universe but it is not in this universe there is no gravity wave no gravity particle it exists outside time it makes things it loves things it tears things apart he let the car speak for a while the roaring of its wheels on the rough surface the hum of the engine you know what were going to do people like you and me mae again the disembodied grin adrift from the sunglasses lit from underneath now by the dash panel lights were going to prove god exists well send it messages mae thought i am trapped in a car with a madman who happens to tell the truth i am trapped in a car with someone driven so crazy by a big opinion of himself that he thinks he will live forever he thinks he will shake gods hand by machines the truly awful thing is that he might just do it mae saw clearly that his system was so greedy it would eat anything anything she did or said kick mr pakan befriend ling argue with tunch or agree would be wound into his bronze madness feed it the only thing she could do that would not help him would be to stay silent staying silent would prevent him from wanting to know anything more about her if he felt there was more info to be derived he would imprison her again until he had it mae pretended to go to sleep the car crackled to a halt over loose gravel mae blinked around her this is it she said she petted ling treat him well she told mr tunch he has been promised steak ling looked up into her eyes i want this box taken off my head he said i want this voice taken out mae looked at tunch would he we can do that mr tunch said and gave lings head a casual scratch mae said curtly thank you for driving me she got out stepping out of the smell of luxury leather and polish she smelled drains the little river and the mud the future will be wonderful mae he passed her her best dress covered in hearts she simply

of you had behaved properly and stayed together i regard this love as a kind of disaster but you cannot be angry with the victim of a flood i see you alone living in kwans attic with no position and i grieve for you then i see your screens and feel that you are also in some way happy and i have to ask what has happened to my mother how is she able to do this i showed the screens to some of my fellow officers who thought them very impressive some of their wives were also impressed and thought the clothes looked very modern others said that it made karzistan look undeveloped and uncivilized i noticed it was the more intelligent ladies who said that no it was like americans talking about their indian heritage one woman said you know when you love something that you have truly bested it and are mature they regard our peasant days as something to be overcome are the clothes selling audio file from miss soo ling october mrs chungmaam i must say i was enthralled by your screens both the

kindness and blessings videomail from bugsnouvelles november hiya no terms and conditions except one let us know if any stores get in touch with you and tell them to go through us we charge them a finders fee and take a cut on sales to our people we started out believe it or not running the software that found people the tv shows they wanted to see we got real big and started different kinds of tv interest groups like fashion we then realized we could use our software to find anything not just tv shows we got the idea of selling information to suppliers and then telling our groups how to buy the stuff so you pay us nothing audio file from chung mae november lung please tell your officers wives that nouvelles magpie in new york lists us as an important fashion resource tell them that we are big news in the new york fashion world tell them they are undeveloped for not knowing the future is upon them and that they should have shame for not doing something about it i have clipped onto

plenty of comments in our newsgroup about you guys can i make a few suggestions put who you are and your address on each screen incredible as it may seem some people still print out screens usually they give them to other people but if the address doesnt show then people cant find you second people love you they want to know more about how you live how things are going in your lives really so more hot gossip also forgive our ignorance but people here know absolutely nothing about karzistan your president looks like a lovely man but we have one of those ourselves so a few more links to other sites about karzistan would be go down well finally do you have any music you can put on the site the collaborationist movement here is desperate for new sounds to share and build on and something from the roof of the world are you guys in tibet would be very popular and remember we love you so give us more news videomail from mrs chung mae november dear mrs bugsymaam it is very strange because i am speaking karz and my lips are doing one thing and the voice is coming out in english i do this for the first time because this is a special occasion we have a deal from big new york store and they say nouvelles drives people crazy for eye of the beholder screens this plays our hearts like a harp we do feel you are family and mrs wing kwan offers suggestion for a special token native women make a circle of friends a circle of women all work together they spin wash crack nuts sort beans beat old tough lamb sew do everything but clean house together so they can sing and tell stories and smoke pipes each woman wears a special collar for that circle which they all embroider together it is a small sign of belonging among friends would readers of nouvelles like to join our circle and have a collar we promise special low price to cover cost available only to friends of nouvelles through big new york store oh and we clip on a file of our access statistics which show how powerful nouvelles is as a way to make new friends in many lands one final request can you send me any information you have on air and the difference between the formats voicemail from bugsnouvelles november maehoney itll drive em wild no sooner said than done but i need a shot of the design i have to say despite the mismatched lips you look and sound great you should get on tv more often but hey wheres my news from kizuldah screens like i said gossip girlfriend gossip but hey ive been speaking english to you what language have you been hearing sizzling sezens pop picks hello young people this is hairineyes sezen who is impatient with everything except my auntie mae we may not be having madonna sixtieth birthday parties but we are full of music here in karzistan and it is great mix of modern and old we got arabesque we got lectro we got traditional many different musics and this is where you can hear what we sound like and use it in collab give us money you can listen but dont keep the music unless you pay our musicians are poor okay so try to send us something we are starving up here well not starving but my mother keeps corncobs in our chic diwan and our neighbour keeps a pig in her kitchen and it is very badtempered so dont steal these poor peoples music or you are dried shitcake that noise was auntie mae telling me off for being rude i talk too much anyway so here are my pop picks balshang by chen tui start with my favourite tui is chinese girl who writes all her own stuff she plays karz flute and the violin she used to do lectro dance but this is both real and air music at once and its so beautiful about girl who falls in love with a married man and his city at the same time so she talks about the city and the man using the same words at the same time they say there is an air version full of pictures and memories as well i want to see what her beautiful beau looks like kish mashali by erchan peker how is it that fools can make good music this guy thinks he is pretty and pastes his face all over everything he is goodlooking but we should discover that for ourselves this is a fun song about school the words are really good and he wrote them but he is a balshang otter which means he is small smooth and vicious listen to the rhythm and the way his voice jumps about that is pure karz like he is klasikleri by musa just how smart are you this word comes to us from europe it is your word you should just say it and you will know what it means this is new song but played in completely traditional way and it is about all things classical and karz that are going away like musa himself soon i hope musa is how all karz men would like to be big fat hairy full of bristle and moustache and everyone says how handsome he is but i think he is old and ugly and he says some very dull things about new music but everyone loves him and so do i in a way like a good father one of his other songs is called yorgun which means tired and that is very appropriate mut by yulduz mut means destiny and the singers name means stars so she has high opinion of herself she used to be backup singer with chen tui and she would like to be chen tui but chen mixes chinese karz and new york air yulduz is just another balshang fox most of her stuff doesnt work but this is really good nearly as good as chen she imitates it is about our country and how it mixes things and how it is lost now but will find itself harp hatamahlari by bulent doudan war memories this is the story of our country in the s when there was a terrible war my auntie maes father was murdered she has to run from the room whenever this song is played so the song is harsh big it roars at you now look at the picture the only one on this page isnt the singer beautiful all makeup polished hair lipstick a woman as shiny as the front of a new car you will get a shock when you hear the voice because that person used to look like musa and one day bulent suddenly looked like that instead no explanation the voice stayed the same the name didnt have to change either nobody cared dont you find our country is surprising place goodbye and remember to pay so that is some of our music we dont have many books our television is all kung fu all our heart and soul is in our music its where all our brains are too in the little tapes they play around our heads like swallows even here in a dump like kizuldah audio file from bugsnouvelles november just thought youd like to know that theres a collab sharemind base called the sezen drop you cant go into any new york club without hearing karz music your little girls a fashion leader oh brace yourselves got the collar offer up on my home and thanks again for telling us about the store attached to this you should find an article about the difference between the formats and whos behind it you may be interested to know how hard the cable people fought against all this thats my old industry email from lieutenant chung lung november mother it pains me to write to you like this but i feel i must point out that the things you put on your machine are open to the world sezen ozdemir recalls my grandfathers murder there are people here who misread the site as being full of backsliding minority nationalism i urge you to have a care and to be less of a wild woman audio file from mrs chung mae november son it pains me to write to you like this but i am not entirely cut off like a thread from the world and news does reach me you married and did not invite me or even tell me i would have understood that you could not have your mother there and that only your father would be invited if only you had explained i am adult enough to understand you chose not to tell me at all i am open before the world you are hidden even within the family so is that the difference between good and wild behaviour so go fuck yourself is that wild woman enough for you by the way all my mail is private unless you have been using army decoders to read it have you are you a spy as well tell your army friends that they will find a world they cannot control and that i am glad that they are all asleep audio file from mrs chung mae november bugsy you are the only one who can help us bugsy we have over five hundred orders for the collar we make our embroidery special we cannot make five hundred collars not at special deal price we were very foolish not to think of this and apologize humbly for causing our good family friend such difficulties it is not our way to make native designs by machine it is not what our business is for what can we do also why is your name bugsy audio file from bugsnouvelles november first things first bugsy is a gangsters name and people call me that as a joke because they say i remind them of a gangster second i attach info about a machine that embroiders to order yes its a machine but listen you give it the id files of your guests and it will weave their names and or a message into the collar it wont be handmade but it will still be special and the design will still say a circle of friends now on the distribution ive talked to the store and hey live the changes nouvelles is now a distribution centre what you do is send all the collars once to us and well send them out but we need our own customers barcode on each one to be read and shipped attached is a file with all the customers with our barcode details for each if you can get the machine i suggest it will also weave in the barcode in the back of the collar just where we need it now listen up if you get the machine its so smart that you will be able to do individual things for your customers customize live that change youre in business not a museum dont apologize for not making everything by hand love the new screens audio file from chung mae november bugsymaam i will not lie i need a friend kwan has been better to me than a mother would be but even a mother can tire my business is in her barn and she lets me live with her there are people in the village who want to stop the future and so they tried to stop me they stopped me with the truth they told my husband i was in love with another man it was true and so i became a fallen woman and only my little tribe of women will talk to me they suffer too especially brave shen suloi it was her husband who tried to stop us and who told my husband about me mrs shen is eloi and is loyal to me because i show the traditions of her people to the world she believes that the soul of her people is growing in the world through me her husband is chinese and does not understand many of the husbands think this thing with all the women is strange so shen suloi and i work and laugh and help each other and there are things we cannot say we all have to put our feelings in little boxes in this village or we would end up killing each other kwan tells me i should go out i do not have the heart people treat me like i am a ghost they try to walk through me all i try to do is help them but they are so suspicious now and fear even to be seen with me so i stay in and talk to the machine i am lost to the machine i spend all my time on it i am trying to find out about the gates format i am trying to find out about the air before it kills me i can see why the un format was tried but i agree with those who want the gates opened un imitates the machine the gates open like our own heads also i have personal reason that i will not unburden to you to hate the un format i am become its opponent can you help me by telling your powerful friends that those who are as dependent on you as children should at least be asked what we want done to our heads the test killed people in kizuldah can you please get them to understand that we are real that we are here we are frightened and ignorant and we are trying to catch up i hope opening the door to all this misery does not lose me friendship audio file from bugsnouvelles november every time you write me i wonder what have we done to the world three billion of us live in a world with lights cameras action the other four billion cant get clean water let alone bandwidth there are times when i want to do an article maes story then i think what a nasty thing to do turn a friend into copy but mae you got me jumping wanting to tell people look look over there look what youve forgotten but what i want to show them is too big i cant do it only you could only you could tell them if its not too much to ask could you do a talk about your life and let me magpie it bugsy audio file from mrs chung mae december listen western woman all painted in finery we survived the japanese who at least look human we survived a war of liberation that cut off our mens heads and left them in a row by the roadside we survived childbirth disease joints worms hunger winter winds drought the red guards who ate everything the guerrillas who made us pay them tax as well as the government we ate rotten seed rice we boiled up grass we pulled out our own teeth sewedup our own wounds with thread do you really think you can obliterate us with your lights cameras action your shows your wires we who are rooted in the earth like trees who do you really think is stronger who will be dead in one hundred years you or us i hope you die like vermin all of you audio file from mrs chung mae december bugsy that last mail was not from me i heard it with horror but i see i must explain at last i said that the air test killed the air test killed my neighbour mrs tung who was ninety i saw her every day and i loved her for she was kind and gentle and was my teacher from earliest days she always saw something special in me because she loved pretty things and i was good at making things pretty we talked every day as if i had a good angel of a mother when the air test came she was visiting me we were all in panic and in terror and the shock killed my friend my dear old mrs tung and i called her called her and the mail put me inside her and i died with her and when i woke up she was copied inside me at first it was like having a wellwisher inside my soul but it is not wholesome and she has curdled like goats milk into hatred she wants a separate life i have been studied i have been told such a thing could not happen if air came by the open gates that is why i hate the un format why i study it why i try to find ways to undo it it turned my beautiful friend into a monster it turned me into someone who can be surprised by a dragon erupting out of her own mouth the past talks out of me instead of the future i am fighting for the future she fights for restoration of the past please please do not think i am mad sick in the head if you do not believe me talk to yeshiboz sistemlar in yeshibozkent they did the study on me beware for that place does things that would be illegal in the west but satan sometimes tells the truth while goodness hides itself in soft lies it was not me who said those things audio file from bugsnouvelles december that does it mae i am writing my article i dont do it to embarrass you or your country but because my own people must know what is happening your old mrs tung was right we are so far from the soil mae i dont know what to say to you except im on your side too kid ill let you see the article before i send it out any news about the machine audio file from mrs chung mae december wise criminal you recall me to business no we do not have the machine i have sent repeated messages to mr saatchi saatchi at the bank and i believe the thing has been ordered and even paid for i fear the worst the worst is that in this country someone has paid someone else to lose it on the road so we cannot deliver collars as planned our circle is sewing day and night even i am sewing day and night which means i have less time for miserable reflection email from mr oz oz december mae many thanks for your voicemail i am very sorry not to have replied to your others but i have not been in a position to help anyone until just a few days ago you were so worried about brigands in hills so was i but i felt secure in the main pass down from yeshibozkent i pulled over to sleep late at night on the road and woke up with a gun in my face mae they took everything the van the computer all my clothes even the beautiful coat you gave me i was left barefoot by the side of the road i walked into sogan dilapidated which lived up to its name and did not open a single door except for the police who put me in jail i am young mae and like a child i wondered why they treated me like a thief i found out soon enough for i was going to be treated like a thief by everyone i didnt know but it is a racket government officials go out and come back shoeless saying everything is stolen when in fact theyve sold everything especially the computer i was the third taking wing operative that had come back that way and the government was sick of it they held me under house arrest until the computer was sold to a foreigner in balshang the thieves were so dumb they did not even know about the harddisk watermark and thank heaven it was an honest bumpkin of a thief who said that yes they had stolen it from me he was so foolish he even said that he had been the one to persuade the others not to kill me thinking it would save his neck it saved mine the government expects its operatives to be killed defending its property or spend time in jail it was allahs will all my material on your village including both your and sunnis question maps had been sent online and were received as a model of what the operatives were supposed to achieve so having been a thief and in serious trouble i was restored to my former favoured position as the only operative who had succeeded in doing anything thanks to god who sent you to me mae it is all your work and i have tried to tell my boss that it is so and he waves it away after all you are an ignorant peasant woman as far as he is concerned still i have written a further report on you and i have not been short of wind in describing what teacher shen did to you i expect that there will be a result there this is not cheap revenge mae for truly we cannot have teachers who block the education of our people it also means i am back in a position to chase your machine as an honest victim of theft i am in a strong position to denounce corruption so i am making a big stink we have traced your machine to a depot in balshang where we have a signature naturally the signature matches no one who works there so we arrested the shipping agent now i know why the government arrested me the shipper is a tough but civilized man he keeps saying he knows nothing and probably does not but we keep him in jail and have seized all his goods and thrown all his people out of work so they have no money the idea is simple with no job one of the employees will rat on the one who did it all we can do is wait your site makes full use of audio video and customer database so everyone at taking wing is proud of you but a suggestion perhaps you could have something more about how much the government has done for all the united peoples of karzistan i know your simple heart bubbles with gratitude for the government for i heard your words and saw your face when we opened the bank account but some people here do not know you and are concerned that people abroad might get an unbalanced picture of the variety of peoples in the happy province your friend in waiting mr oz audio file from mrs chung mae december mr ozsir my heart delights in news from you and i add to the chorus of voices that can confirm your innocent youth and innate honesty i am overwhelmed that the government makes such efforts to restore my machine to me i really am not worthy do make sure they know how much i owe to you and how i would not have known what to do without you your coming was like an angel from the lord for us i knelt and praised allah for i saw that the government of karzistan had given me hope i did not feel it was the place of humble fashion expert to describe the work of government which passes my understanding but your just admonition has shown me that however embarrassing my crude efforts would be to myself i must add my voice to the chorus of earned praise please see the new addition to my site and please express my gratitude i attach a letter for your boss and if it is worthy please show it to him email from lieutenant chung lung december i am not a son to choose to lose a mother even when she is lost to herself your material at your home site has recently much improved i trust that it was because you listened to your sons advice encouraged i write again yes i married and in confusion did not tell my mother and my honest sister in an innocent card told the truth for me and that is humbling ive clipped on a picture of your new daughter her name is sarah you see perhaps why it was a bit more difficult to tell you sarah is from canada and has chosen to cast her lot with your son though i cannot think why she is beautiful and intelligent and regards your son as an educated man because of army college she stayed in the american institute here while studying the history of attila the wonderful she is not a model of karzistani femininity but she opens a world for me she is very good with the other officers wives who tell me they find her delightful she has seen your screens and your last letter and likes both very much i did decode your personal mail either i did it or someone else would your friendship with the fashion magpie is well regarded by officials here i thought i would set your mind at rest your son lung audio file from mr oz oz december mae your letter was well received here all our hearts were warmed by such simple truthful words from a good karzistani woman who works so hard for her people we know what happened to your machine you will not get that one again but we have arrested your mr saatchi saatchi he will be executed next month the warehouse boss who i thought was innocent was not my boss has personally approved a repurchase for your business it will be delivered by the army audio file from mr hikmet tunch december mae i am sorry to slip back into your life perhaps unexpectedly dont worry you will not need to escape me again though you should know that i have watched the development of your fashion screens with interest do you really intend to become part of a romance for americans they do so like foreign pets and how is your little inner friend both of them a file is attached it is a scientific paper about you it is about to appear in the journal of medicalcomputer interface it shows that no physical change has happened to you it shows instead that a mangled imprint of two selves have been united in air it shows how this could happen due to real flaws in the un format it also proves that such a catastrophe could not have occurred if the formatting process had been achieved by opening the gates it suggests that elements of the gates format be copied across and made part of the un system one further thing i meant to tell you when i drove you back you are in the information business mae that means everyone you know will betray you you can relax with me i already have done that your guardian angel hikmet tunch audio file from mrs chung mae december bugsy i was pleased to hear about your new apartment i understand how lovely it is to have a place of your own and how living even with best friends produces sadness i was so happy for you to think of my good friend in her own place please send me pictures of your apartment it will ease my heart oh woman i am avoiding telling my news because i do not know how to begin it is so strange the workings of life i do not say the workings of god because i am not sure he would do anything like this last night the electricity was shining in kwans barn the circle has been sewing our beautiful collars late into the night naughty girl sezen brought in some rice wine from her boyfriends village why not her mother hatijah who was frightened to join the circle at first is becoming lively and outgoing it is now hatijah who warms up the wine and it warms us and soon we are all singing then the door is thrown back with a loud bang and in comes mr hasan muhammed he is strict muslim gentleman white lace cap and long beautiful beard but he is carrying a whip he strikes the whip against the walls of the barn and we all scream and clutch our work for we never lose our embroidery place there could be an earthquake and none us would lose a stitch so we all are pressed against the wall and he prowls and curses us as wicked women all little singing old women who sip a bit of wine well kwan is courageous and she arrives and says mr muhammed have you left your brain behind why do you frighten guests in my barn as they work so hard and he says this all the work of shytan all of the women have gone mad since this thing has come most especially that bride of shytan and he points at me i hardly need say that this is not an amusing thing but listen to how destiny plays like a cat with your friend mae mr muhammed still jabs his finger like a knife towards me and says that devil woman leaves her husband and now my wife has left me to live with him and he cracks his whip and all us women try hard not to laugh even kwan for you see we all know his wife tsang tsang is a pincushion she has had every man she can get she is plump ripe shameless lots of fun and about as devoted a wife and devout a woman as a gerbil in my fashionexpert days i was always giving tsang a makeover for her latest paramour poor old mr muhammed has finally discovered what the rest of the village knows so there is now a closing of tsangs alwayswelcoming doorway that tsang finally should have taken wing with my dull old husband strikes our humble peasant sense of humour like a blow to the elbow poor mr muhammed yells like a character in an old play they have run off to live together in balshang it is terrible but we all have to fight not to laugh though the poor man is in agony kwan says kindly it is not maes fault that your wife strayed we are all scandalized by such behaviour and mr muhammed points again at me and says why then do you welcome that viper into your midst and kwan answers him because though she strayed she helps the whole village build business he screams back she is the mother of all whores my sweet and faithful wife has had her mind poisoned by

emailvideomail no sender they have found the eloi site they will raid get your business off kwans machine now move it onto mr haseems if you can now tonight but move it in any case chapter who would send her such a message maes mind raced as her slippered feet slid in the dark on kwans polished wooden floors mr oz hikmet tunch she went into kwans bedroom and smelled the savour of husband and wife and sleep kwan she whispered kwan wake up there was a groan kwan please this is urgent it must be done please wake up the movement the sound ceased and a calm alert voice said what is it mae i just got an audio file came on looking like a packet from america only it was just a scramble of you know symbols then it started to wake up as words it said it was a selfdecoding cipher so whoever sent it would have to know the watermark on your hard disk what did it say that they know about the eloi home that they will raid it said get your business off kwans machine can i see the message no it burned itself up there was quiet outside a nightjar was singing mr wing spoke next if they know about the minority site there is not much point removing it now he said with the same cool voice he used when repairing plumbing what does it say kwan it tells what is being done to my people said kwan wing breathed heavily once in and out you are a woman perhaps they will treat you gently pretend you are foolish and emotional mae whoever your friend is they are clever and you must upload all your data to sunnis machine and wipe it from ours do you know how to do that not if you dont the tv was now kept in the diwan already secretive they did not turn on the lights but huddled in quilted coats around the screen mae tried to copy her business onto sunnis machine she kept repeating different likely instructions finally she found one that worked the tv said making contact with htvlsunnitakingwinghtvl mae told it volume down can you make it look as if the files have always been on her machine the tv made noises like mice were at work inside it then it murmured can make it look as if your site has an alias on htvlsunni mr wing told mae do that you can say you had it on two machines in case one of them went down okay go ahead said mae the machine made nibbling noises as if mice were at work mae turned to kwan after this we wipe the eloi site the site stays up said kwan mae protested kwan the site will be wiped anyway but perhaps if its not here when they arrive we can have some story ready kwans face shone as white and cold as the moon it is too late mae i have email from professors about the site i have answered them if the government are reading my email they will have all that too they have me mae the two women stared at each other in silence blows are like this thought mae at first you are dazed and do not feel the pain mae found she was listening for the stealthy rumble of an army truck the tv murmured low permission denied mae said mr wing lets at least save your business wed better go and ask sunni for permission now right okay i do that but both of you go get away where to mae demanded kwan you think we should hide well take care of ourselves but first we will go with you said mr wing mr haseem may not talk to you they threw stones against mr haseems shutters to wake him he threw the window open and they heard the click of a safety catch mr haseem had a gun mr haseem rumbled get away from my house mae i bough your husbands place fairly of course you did wing intervened this is trouble with the government let us in faysal they were allowed only as far as the kitchen sunni automatically bowed to kwan sleepily mistaking this for a social call the government has found our eloi site said kwan mr haseem looked unmoved that was their problem raising stuff like that sunni looked alert and watchful mae spoke i need to copy my business site onto your machine tuh said haseem after all that has passed between us his heavy face assumed its most natural expression of scorn and sunni her eyes met maes and something passed between them sunni turned to her husband and shrugged it will cost us nothing and mae told us about the wire charges and saved us much money it is a simple favour to return i dont want trouble with the government grunted haseem have you seen maes screens she has a link to one government office and another government office and there is a part on it in which mae sings gratitude to the government having such a site on our machine will be protection against the government mae and sunni exchanged a long look now you are repaid sunni seemed to say mae pressed her advantage your server is running but my machine needs permission to download sunni nodded once who sent you the message someone who masters privacy either mr oz or my friend mr tunch we better move mr haseem sunnimaam said mr wing mr haseems leaden face looked up at him appraising challenging but not triumphing what will happen to you he asked wing haseem regarded himself as a man and men were serious the villagers were seriously against the government as they were against blight on crops wings eyes brows flickered and he gave a brief buccaneers smile inshallah he said men were also brave many thanks sunnimaam said mae kwan spoke wed better leave we have enemies who might say they saw us conspiring later kwans tv spoke permission extended uploading begins they waited listening to the very faint sounds of moving heads inside the machine the wind and the future whispered in shadow kwan was calm i could move into the hills go visit sulois relatives until all this is past she turned to mr wing and smiled you could say i became a wild woman and left you mr wing shrugged you are allowed three books in prison he said the koran the buddhist texts and the mathnawi of the mevlana i have been saving myself for them i will do a comparison of all three and learn thereby the truth they are long enough for a life sentence said kwan with grim humour then i hope my life will be long enough said wing i would prefer a life sentence to death swear said mae suddenly swept up in superstition swear now that if you are not sent to prison you will begin to read them now anyway i would swear to do that mae chuckled wing if i thought it would do any good mae felt a gathering in her mind as if a tree had sent down roots into it and then bloomed she had an idea she asked the television can you do the same thing as that message arrive and then disappear there was a whisper inside huh the tv replied a technical term meaning it did not understand the request mr wing shook his head they would be able to see through such doctoring mae what i want to do is send the whole site to bugsy and get her to host it that way it stays up but off your machine so we can wipe it yes thank you said kwan but bugsy does business with you that will get you into trouble and mae you do not have the encryption code so that is that mae kept on look at least wipe the site maybe it will be enough for them if you take the site down mr wing started to rub her back mae mae i would only put it back up after they left said kwan the world has to know about the eloi so youve had the site up and now the world does know not enough of them mr wing was smiling with quiet pride mae kwan will never give up fighting she will never rest until justice is done why must it be you who fights wings smile extended slightly because we cannot let the goons who run this country stop us telling the truth what are we supposed to do run and hide and say oh wondrous masters we owe you so much for letting us live and battle the land for grain which you take from us as tax mae had never heard such talk she recognized the constriction around her chest for what it was fear this was genuinely dangerous talk they are destroying an entire people only because their own ancestors failed to conquer them the eloi show it is a lie to say that this country can be called karzistan that it is a muslim country of turkic peoples so they try to make the eloi disappear mae felt a little bit sick she thought she was brave but she did not have that kind of courage to face the men who controlled the torturers the lists the surveillance and say i am going to do the very thing you say i must not do and yet they were right how were things to get better if no one fought she looked at mr wing and thought this man could become a terrorist if there were more of him my son lung might be sent to fight him they might kill each other through a screen of dust and smoke and mae felt a dull buzz inside the core of her head the echoing all this had triggered another attack its coming on again said mae the old lady feels the same way he said still looking amused she has strong memories of the war mae took a grip she began to chant to herself things mrs tung would never believe thank heavens for the machines they give us an ear of the world and then save us from our masters something in her head opened up a bit like a flower a bit like a radio tuning if this is starting up again you must hide if you fight them directly they send in their soldiers and mae told it the government will change itself its very soul will be blown by the air they come and cart you off in the middle of the night or pay the neighbours to turn on you we will be a world of people beyond governing both sides end up eating their dead the rice wine when it came was as transparent as water but it burned they sipped in silence mae could think of nothing to say from the television came a sound like a rooster faint and faraway mae said kwan somethings coming up on the screen words on the screen read emailvideomail no sender there was an egyptian dance of hieroglyphs which suddenly resolved into letters and words and sideways v signs thats computer code said kwan mae sat forward she knew what it was someone had sent her the encryption code she told the machine to save it use it and kept talking to send a message audio file to bugsynouvelles bugsy sorry to arrive in this way but this is no laughing matter clipped to this message is an entire site it is very political very dangerous about the eloi people the world must know what is happening to them but it is too dangerous to hold here please find a machine other than your own and put the site up there do not do not put it on your machine okay and never talk of it and do not reply to this email in any way okay sometimes you will get encrypted message like this it will be an update for the site like this message it will then eat itself and please do not put anything about this in an article and dont reply your chum okay endmail mae turned and looked up kwan will that be okay can we wipe the site if this works kwan hauled in a thick breath through thin nostrils okay she whispered nodding okay the sun rose mae tried to sleep despite sunshine blazing through the windows kwans warm wine had been a mistake it burned her stomach the acids churned like the fear of the soldiers fear for kwan fear of mrs tung fear of everything her stomach was as panicked as her soul and she began to gag she felt something tear my baby my strangely nested newasair bornfromair child im trying to kill it her stomach rose up like a fist she could feel something heavy but alive bunch up and cram against the top of her belly no no i dont need this now mae saw mr kens handsome face it will be such a beautiful child she thought she struggled to pull in a breath the flesh pushed harder against her oesophagus she felt something gulp open inside her as if kwans wine were fire a blast of juices burned her throat and seared tender nasal tissues her child slammed up against her again her breath was knocked away no maes face twisted like a rag she wrenched herself and also something else deep in the world she twisted and dragged and wrung it the world felt like silk ripping in ragged line from all around her came the sound of tiny bells was that blood in her ears mae remembered the fence the fence she had torn when she escaped mr tunch the fence had sung when she tore it sing she told the air it did the air around her crinkled like tin foil and light seemed to come from the singing light wavered in patterns on the walls as if reflecting from water the light was confused with the thin tinkling sound from nowhere mae thought of all of them tunch old mrs tung fatimah the village women no you will not take my child from me soldiers armies people who will not learn people who hate the future no you will not get him my last late unexpected flower he is going to live mae swallowed and swallowed again the room went dark maes fingers went numb mrs tung was coming drawn by the fear mae felt her arrive mrs tung seemed to come into the room and sit on the bed next to her the old woman was charmed by the homeliness of babies and indigestion old mrs tung offered advice yogurt is always good for an upset tummy the voice was as kindly and as sweet as pear drops mrs tung had always been kind mae remembered her sweet blind face yogurt it is thought mae and remembered the tang of it yogurt she thought remembering its creamy sting and the yogurt sheds with their smell of wood smoke suddenly the light and the singing smelled of yogurt the whole room smelled like those old sheds mae swallowed again and was soothed like a storm at sea when the wind suddenly dropped the acids in her stomach seemed to calm they burned no longer like a barque clumsy on the waves the separate flesh inside her settled calmly down into the waters of her stomach mae could even feel the foam of the waves mrs tung was smug the old remedies are always the best now i think we should all just get some sleep dont you she seemed to toddle off to bed everything went still suddenly kwans attic was just a room quiet and full of sunshine a room full of peace even joy mae cradled her stomach i will build you a safe harbour little boat i will fence you in with docks and sea walls they wont frighten you out of me if i have to call on all of air you will stay mae felt her face stretch with a relieved smile she slept the army did not come that day mae still had to find a place to work she and sunni had made amends but mae would hardly be welcome working on sunnis machine day and night as she needed to and it would be better if the circle did not operate out of kwans premises so where how audio file from mrs chung mae december dear mr ozsir it is plain that my business has reached the point at which it is necessary to run it from our own machine the grant has been more than generous especially as regards our beautiful knitting machine would money be available for me to operate a service centre of my own audio file from mr oz oz december dear mrs chungmaam it is possible form for grant is attached partially filled in for you but do not submit it until i can take soundings here your course of action is wise mae scanned the message and pondered its every word for any sign that mr oz had sent the two encrypted mails she decided that he had the soundings he spoke of were to find out how the government viewed maes controversial connection with the wings mae felt like a traitor to kwan your course of action is wise meant simply that she had done as she was warned and moved her site mae stared at the form filled in completely by mr oz except for a white box which read reason for expensebenefits for community she could say that she was running a service centre for the whole valley so more commercial sites could be implanted she could say that she was offering her own expertise in building sites and publicizing them in fact that was not just an excuse in fact that was a very good idea indeed mae sat pondering it seeing it clearly mounting sites for mr ahs car repair setting up an electronic voting station providing a link for mrs mack to her christian church she saw specifically sunnis valley fashion service she saw again the swallow school now on the web itself giving advice explaining terms trading info with other net traders she sat staring into another new branch of the future happy the machine made a noise like a rooster you have followup message said the screen mae said mr oz in video mode my friend the most amazing thing has happened open a second window and i will transmit she did so the window was full of writing in the roman alphabet and a photograph of the circle kwan mae sezen suloi mrs doh hatijah we look so happy mae thought we look like the kindest people in the world and the happiest mr genuinely sincere kept talking mae it is an article that has appeared in the new york times both online and in disk it is called maes story and it is by one of your customers you know her an editor of a new york magpie mae it is all about your life and how you fight for info and how mrs tung was copied into your mind by overhasty formats it quotes your friend mr tunch it quotes you saying you hate the un format but mae it is a perfect reflection of the government line how the west must not take us for granted but must consult on info it could not be better everyone here is so pleased they are calling it a diplomatic coup for karzistan mae looked at the photograph of kwans beautiful face have i managed accidentally to save my friend does this mean i get my own machine mae asked mr oz laughed i expect so and suddenly mae was sure oz was not the one who had warned her he would never be so cunning or so quick she was relieved she had been so discreet in her mail to him it was tunch she realized tunch who had intervened let me complete the form and send it to you and that meant the encryption equations came from tunch as well that means tunch watches me in air guardian angel indeed oz jerked with pleasure like a colt mae thought being robbed and thrown in jail by his bosses has not made him older he will always be a boy he asked her you okay on what to say on the form i know exactly what i want to do with it but you advise me okay okay you want to save the article your machine can read it mae paused and reflected no she said quietly i would rather not he looked a bit perplexed then the windows closed mae completed her application and sent it to him then she asked the television to write a proper letter to sunni my old friend how strange is life i keep saying that these days especially thinking over the last few months now here comes something just as strange as everything else that has happened can i rent my old house from you consider the real value of what you have purchased resides in the land and there are plenty of farmers hereabouts to whom you can rent the land that is very good business for you especially as you do not need to give accommodation as part of the deal it is pure land rental so what do you do with the house rent it to mr ken for his hens how much is he going to pay you for a barn ah but sunni a workshop for my circle now that is a business premise and you can charge far more for that and i will have the money to pay once my machinery arrives i make a proposition to you i offer riels a month rental that is in place of givenaway accommodation on which you make nothing or riels a year for a ham riels a year do we need to talk further and sunni for me the old days are dead forgotten forgiven my hope now is that you can forgive me the wrongs i did to you your friend mae mae sat back and looked at the letter so she thought my battle for the future begins again im doing it for my baby new song new life chapter mae looked out of her attic window and sawsnow was falling winter is here she thought with excitement winter was dark enfolding and safe she saw her new winter very clearly long happy hours alone in her old house with her own glowing screen in the grey morning snow blew like feathers it nestled along the top of the stone wall and on the roof tiles this was good heavy snow that fell with a gentle hissing sound and mounted up quickly as if the town were being padded with thick white pillows it had been so long since mae had been outside in winter everyone stayed inside no one would see her the snow would be a veil mae threw a scarf over her head and wrapped round one of kwans eloi sheepskins it sat slightly askew around her shoulders bulky and still smelling of lanolin outside on the landing she snapped on a light the staircase stayed dark kwan called up through the darkness theres a power failure mae felt her way down the staircase the main room had its front door open to let in grey light im going out in the snow mae announced come along kwans answering chuckle was both affectionate and edgy there had been no sign of the army but kwan was still cautious ill stay here said kwan mae eased herself down kwans slippery stone steps the snow was already sealing over the dungheap next to the barn maes own breath was a sheltering scarf of fog all sounds were muted on the chilly stones of the courtyard the snow looked like lace its delicate patterns refrigerated from underneath mae pushed the courtyard gate and for the first time in weeks stepped back out into her village everything was being tucked into a bed of snow as if by a mother the houses and terraces were all outlined in white from the high hillside came the tuneless clanking of twenty or thirty sheep bells someone had left his flock out to pasture too long mae smiled the same happened every year was it old mr pin lazy mr mack who would sit in a corner of the teahouse smoking a hubblybubbly and grinning with embarrassment mae walked up and over the bridge the invulnerable ducks still paddled in snowrimmed water mae passed the door of mrs doh and her fearsome dog mae heard its breath and the scratching of its giant claws against the other side of the doorway she caught a gasp of food odours from mrs dohs kitchen window garlic bean sauce rice the next door opened just as mae was beside it out came sunnis friend mrs ali oh she said startled then she saw it was mae her face faltered and then recovered hello she said it snows this was awkward village manners would not allow them to part without talking mrs ali slammed her door twice with her customary thoroughness she was bundled up against the chill tall skinny regal and slightly absurd like a walking telephone pole it is very beautiful said mae it makes me feel like i have come home then the old rake did not know what to say for mae plainly had lost her home several times over she was discomfited but not hostile well we all have fond memories of snow mrs ali paused i hear your business does well they both started to walk down the hill together yes we have orders from america for five hundred collars i dont know how we will do all the work that was so far beyond mrs alis imagination that she could not be sure she had heard correctly successful indeed she said and her smile froze that brings in money it is a special deal we have a good relationship with a new york fashion magpie so we said join our circle and wear our collar for only ten dollars each yes thought mae that does make five thousand dollars so amidst all the terrible things that have happened there has been some good the ladies of the circle share the money sunni and i are friends again mae shrugged with her eyebrows a kind of peace offering dont forget that i have been hurt too they were at the okans the last house on upper street mrs ali paused i have noticed said mrs ali that your friends tend to benefit she looked back at mae and there was something completely unexpected a rueful humour as if mae were one of lifes bitter jokes good day said mrs ali i have no lard and winter is upon us and i go to beg some from sunni she turned and began to trudge uphill towards sunnis big house there was a rumble as if from the sky mae scowled something shifted gears and roared and suddenly a truck came round the hill and up upper street straight towards her a big green truck with huge devouring tyres army mae thought and it was a though a fist had seized hold of her heart and stopped it pumping she ducked to the side of the okans house army army army army struggled her heart as if to breathe the truck roared past green canvas over camouflaged sides lashed down bolted huge army army army roaring up the hill slowing to shoulder their way over the bridge towards kwans house mae ran without thinking her feet slipped on the snowy cobbles the cold reached down like deep roots into her lungs please please it was a prayer she had to be there to tell her story to explain i am new york times i am new york times mae ran out of breath and had to lean forward onto her knees fire from her pregnancy shot up her gorge into her mouth she swallowed pushed herself upright and struggled on up the hill kwans gates gaped defencelessly the courtyard already full of truck mae stumbled into the yard there was a bloodcurdling yell and the green door of the cab swung open a bull of a man burst out of it in piebald camouflage before mae could think he was running towards her full pelt male huge fast young and strong she managed to skid to a halt and was about to turn and run he grabbed hold of her and then swung her round and round and round her string shoes with their slippery leather soles left the ground she flew kwans courtyard became a merrygoround spinning around her and the man was laughing mae wanted to be sick he kissed her surprise he called as if out of a nightmare maes feet were helpless as flippers as she fought to find footing she looked up at him she saw his teeth grinning its me he said the world shifted gears like a truck her breath left her she clutched at her chest all was confusion lung she asked lung for one further terrible moment she thought her own son had come to arrest her best friend he laughed not expecting me were you no she said weakly what are you doing here he laughed again we are bringing you your knitting machine as big as a tree branch his arm was flung towards the cargo under the canvas oh she called out clutching herself in relief oh oh your mr oz told me the machine was going and said it would be a good chance for me to see you again also we have the new tv for you did no one tell you relief spilled over sloppily loosely into other emotions oh lung she said again and hugged him held onto him as if he were a new village tree to root things in place suddenly it was joyful to see him out of confusion relief and love her eyes were suddenly full of tears he chuckled and patted her back meet my colleagues he said two more soldiers lurched out of the cab one was small and wiry with bad teeth in a cheerful grin the other looked uncomfortable smiling he was slim in the hips but fat in the face fat and brutal was how he would swell into the future both bowed slightly in politeness this is private ozer and sergeant alkanuh said lung this is my mother mrs chung mae mae was shivering with cold and nerves but managed to bow to each of them she looked back at her son the cold was bringing a beautiful pink to her cheeks the two soldiers were chuckling the tears and emotion were what they expected from a homecoming mae saw kwan pale grey at a window kwan mae called it is my son lung he has brought our knitting machine she pushed the tear out of her face and smiled smiled as wide as she could so that kwan would see everything was all right kwan come out and see my huge new son i mean machine they all laughed because it was true lung was a monster he had left home as a skinny spotty seventeenyearold off to army college and refusing to admit that he was shy of the future army food and training had made him tall and broad and fit and he was handsome oh how handsome lung had become she stared in wonder at his perfect face his perfect teeth his perfect combed jet black hair why didnt you tell me she said and hit him lightly on the arm his colleagues chuckled again i thought mr oz would tell you he said coyly charmingly the skinny one spoke lung wanted to surprise you he surprised me all right i thought i would die her eyes betrayed her again she wept again it has been three years since i have seen him shaking like fine china on an unsteady shelf kwan crept down the stone steps of her house clutching her coat kwan looked as though she had been punched in the belly mrs wingmaam said lung with a practised adult politeness that would have been beyond him when he left home he bowed and beamed and enveloped kwans frail hand in his own it is so good to see old friends he smiled he held onto kwans hand and said to mae come quick see your beautiful machine he escorted them both to the back of the truck and flung back the tarpaulin with one huge gesture the weaving machine like her son was huge brown and khaki lung chuckled mrs wingmaam he asked the owner of the barns where do you want it mae spoke instead oh not here i have rented our old house it needs to go there lungs smile faltered he did not look at her but he managed not to look sad or ashamed the beefy one with the dark chin said we better get it there lieutenant said the sergeant before the snow settles too badly and theres a power failure warned mae lung barked with laughter of course there always is the first snow of winter come on lets get this in he bowed again quickly to kwan and was striding back to the cab on legs as thick as prize hams come on mama we need to stop at sunnis said mae he pulled her into the cab and for lack of space sat her on his lap it was strange to be so supported by your baby i remember when i used to hold you like this she said he looked like a barrel full of apples all round red she knew she was looking with a mothers eyes but there was no doubt he was so much better looking than the other two they were invisible next to him as if you were blinded from looking at the sun no wonder a western girl fell in love with you mae thought they must all fall in love with you she felt herself fall in love with him all over again so this is what my son grew up into lieutenant chung mae realized that her son was the best looking man she had ever seen better looking than a movie star but he smelled different from those pretty boys there was nothing wispy about him this was someone you could tell who jumped from aeroplanes who built rope bridges across ravines mae thought of joe no wonder he had been so proud so amazed at what had stepped out from his own loins no wonder he wanted to talk about nothing else lung was the one good thing he had done we stop here lung told the skinny driver and the truck whined to a professional halt not skidding in the snow sunni greeted lung graciously just as if the family chung had not been shattered by scandal her kitchen still smelled of gas and was lit with a gas lamp mae murmured to her about housing the machine in the old house sunni waved a hand in a grand ladylike way that was also slightly crabby mae suddenly saw how she would be when she was old saw that sunni was already getting old but that somehow getting old would be good for her oh sunni said i already told that man of mine i said we will get nothing else for that old place its only good for giving to tenants and who needs tenants they are trouble you have to give them the house for free with the land pshaw fifteen riels a month twelve said mae twelve said sunni but only because i want to see to see the machine loaded both ladies got to sit on lungs lap one thigh each the snow still fell shooting past the windscreen as the truck moved through it the snow looked like shooting stars as if they were travelling through outer space their old house turned as if to greet them grey as a ghost ill get the gate mae said and stepped down from the truck she lifted up the ground bolts and wondered why she did not feel more snow power failure lung machine there was too much going on to feel the pain and the loss of what had happened that was good as the gate opened amid a spangle of illuminated snow it was more like a festival the huge green van bounced into the courtyard just missing taking off the lintel from the gate all mr kens hens were inside out of the cold or surely some of them would have been crushed the great truck swung around and backed up mae saw mr kens house darkened as if deserted her washing line was folded her kitchen door was locked and the stump for chopping wood lay sideways mae went to open up the barn the bolts were cold on her hands the old doors groaned as if in protest at being awakened the earthen floor had been beaten flat as polished flagstone the floor sloped down as did the entire courtyard lung stepped out of the truck holding what looked like a remote control sunni hung back behind him as if afraid mae walked out then weve got to put it on something first she said why there are floods said mae mae felt as if elastic braces were drawing in around her heart as she knocked on mr kens door she looked at the old grey wood of the door and waited unable to breathe feeling lungs eyes on her back she heard footsteps the door opened there he was mr ken he looked older than she remembered more rumpled but then she had seen hikmet tunch and her son lung since his eyes quickened when he first saw her widened darted over her face then looked behind and saw the truck he tried to straighten his hair he looked embarrassed befuddled hello mae he said whats going on there was no time for yearning remembrance or even any sign of what happened not with joes son looking on hello she said with restraint i am sorry to bother you like this but we are putting a new machine in the barn my mother needs to talk to you about this mae cut him off it is actually sunnis barn and i rent it you once said that you had no use for the stone drinking troughs can i have them he looked at her with an expression that was impossible to read you and i meet again and we talk about this im moving back in she told him ive only just decided behind her sunni said to lung i have the keys lets get the tv inside kueis hands did a helpless little wave have them if you want they are very old what do want them for it would not be right not to warn him there will be a flood everything will be washed away i need to have my machine on a platform to save it his whole face was wary this is grandmother talking he said every winter she would always warn us about the flood this time its true all right dont believe me she thought i have no time to argue the trucks engine is running and so is lungs she glanced behind and saw her tv lowered from the back of the van may i have the use of the troughs i can pay you for them whatever you ask mr ken held up a hand take them take them mae nodded smiling hoping her eyes were also able to jam into such snatched time a form of remembrance ill have them back when the flood does not come he said darkly and shut the door on her mae blinked for that had been too sudden she turned slowly followed her tv as it was huffed and sighed into her old house here here into its new home enthused sunni too bright too glowing she was covering for mae the house was small and dark and smelled of dust noodles had stiffened on plates left on the table some of maes old dresses still hung from the wall as if preserved by the cold lung glanced down ashamed does it convert to aircast sunni asked tapping the top of the tv oh yes i expect sezen will use it to serve collabo can i rent it sunni asked mae hesitated i want to serve high fashion we can split the market it has possibilities said mae well talk tomorrow the two fashion experts nodded eyes hooded then something happened listen to us both they seemed to say and both burst out laughing at themselves captains of industry said lung but he was smiling the truck roared back into kwans courtyard to find it full of preparations for a party a tractor ran its engine and its lights and mr wing and mr atakoloo were moving tables children stuck their heads through the gate and turned to run back home there always was a party with the first snow this year it would be at the big house the forecourt quickly filled with people hot wine was left on braziers that smoked as much as most peoples mouths steamed men took cups of warm wine and stood on mr wings steps lung strode into their midst shaking hands remembering names mae as his mother accompanied him ah youve grown said men snatching hats from heads out of politeness mr ali squared up to lung your father tells us much of your doings you are a lieutenant now i hear yes luckily enough i had early promotion your father is very proud of you said mr ali glancing in maes direction the fallen mother that is good to hear he lives in balshang now so i see him every day lung smiled and plainly moved on good evening mr ali said mae deliberately sounding pleased lung has bought me a huge weaving machine it is automatic and intelligent it will help the ladies circle meet all its orders mr ali was as heavy as lead he glowered at her and did not answer and you are looking so well mr ali said mae in a little belllike voice so plump if you dont mind me saying mr ali pushed past her as if to go for more red wine mae saw her own family arrive jumei his wife maes mother and after some deliberation no doubt siao and old mr chung lung lung called jumei uncle mae deliberated too and decided to let lung greet his uncle without her the two men hugged and clapped each others backs jumei wore a heavy russian coat and pork pie hat he looked like a party chairman lung paused when he saw his uncle siao and blinked in some surprise that the two families were friends siao shook his hand and winked he and lung hugged too but the hug was gentler less showy lung had grown up with siao who was more of a big brother to him than an uncle siao looked up his eyes caught maes and he gestured for her to come near them very well thought mae for your sake siao she remembered siao has never fought me or called me bad names she was surprised she realized that she knew in her heart that siao would keep things calm and good mae saw her mothers plump face close up like a purse as she approached old mrs wang retreated from mae behind jumeis russian back his face looked like polished soapstone siao spoke first mae how are things with you i am happy to say the business goes well and happy to see lung said siao indeed chuckled mae old mr chung blinked like an ancient tortoise and bowed sweetly to mae out of respect or mere good form we are all happy to see you lung jumei grinned awkwardly and jabbed his upper body up and down like a crow pecking at road kill he was trying to bow with respect to his officer nephew none of them were comfortable mae glanced up and saw a tight little knot of alis and dohs peering at them over their shoulders they were a spectacle the family of the deserted husband in company with the adulterous wife and her brother people are staring said maes mother miserably mae felt sorry for her so small and worried pay them no mind mama it is easy for you to say you are a woman who has no face left to lose said her mother you do not even come to call on us so which is it mama are you ashamed of me or mad because i do not call or are you just looking for another reason to be miserable siao intervened perhaps it is because mae is embarrassed that her husbands family are staying there with you mrs wangmaam you credit her with delicacy said maes mother jumei i cannot bear this i am on show i have been an object of show all my life i thought all that had ended but there is always something i so look forward to the first winter party but i must i must mama had stared to quaver again you stay here mama said mae i was just going back into the kitchen lung looked dismayed ill be down in a while mama he said mae smiled with gratitude at lung and said goodbye to them all in turn standing as straight as she could mae turned sideways to slip through the crowd and down the stairs to kwans kitchen kwan was at work wearing her best dress the tables were already full of food its a good thing i guessed the party would be here kwan said whenever there was a power failure there would be a party in someones courtyard maes stomach suddenly felt heavy and she had to sit down they were alone so mae said quickly i dont know what else these soldiers know so it will be good to stay cautious in the halfdarkness the two women looked at each other it was plain where maes loyalties lay from outside there came a swelling of laughter lung had finished a story can i help asked sunni without missing a beat kwan smiled sunni hello yes i am sure there is much to do so there they were the three of them in kwans kitchen with the ropes of garlic around the wall and the pile of round village bread shall i restore the bread for you sunni asked village bread was dry and needed to be moistened mae offered i could string the beans oh it will be fun with just us three said kwan kneeling she hoisted out a bucket of water and a tray for soaking bread yes it will be good to sit and be convivial said sunni and smiled at mae the kitchen smelled of pork and rice oh soy and lard on boiled rice oh that takes me home sunni though muslim had grown up in a liberal household mae strung and snapped the beans sunni took out her corncob pipe and so did kwan look at us we look like old grannies said sunni we are nearly said mae oh you talk said sunni lung is to be married soon said mae not quite telling the truth how could she admit that she had not been asked to the wedding you bet said sunni he is a prince and any girl with brains would get him as fast as she could she is a western girl said mae she is very pretty educated and says she likes me this is because of my screens how can you like someone for their screens oh said sunni and looked sad then we will lose him mae let this sink in yes she said i am sure he will stay in balshang at least and who knows he may even go back to canada with his wife has he talked about what has happened kwan asked she meant the end of maes marriage yes mae played with the beans and with the truth of the situation mostly he tells me he forgives me for what has happened but i dont think he really has ah said sunni getting down to the meat of it i dont think he really understands it said mae i dont think i do said sunni kwan said nothing her back as she worked listened and was tense it was love murmured mae oh i understand that i understand why you married joe and i understand why you would tire of him speaking frankly indeed said kwan for sunni was being very frank there is no other way to talk about these things what i dont understand now that joe has gone off with the pincushion is why you are not with mr ken ah said mae she had no immediate answer sunni patted maes hand joe has left you that evens things up go live with your mr ken the rest of us will get used to things in the end im not scared of the village said mae but i do sometimes wonder if i love mr ken because his grandmother does ah said sunni and her hand shuddered i think i see him sometimes through old mrs tungs eyes the room seemed to hold its breath with the cold lung strode in booming and what good things are you ladies cooking back to work the ladies carried out vats of quickfried beans swollen wet bread and pots of rice with tiny chillies burning within it the army truck played lectro on its balshang radio its vast army antennae could pull in signals from the capital kizuldah heard advertisements for hypermarkets toilet paper and clubs that could play airfiles on giant tv screens the villagers hated the music a cable was strung from the army vans battery to a cassette player and more traditional music was played for the adults all four hundred people were crowded into the courtyard and barn despite the snow that was still falling as if the stars had given up clinging to heaven they chuckled and sipped tea from mugs the mugs were then filled with rice and beans kwan sunni and mae moved among the people passing out the food the men had to take beans from mae the situation allowed no other response they looked at her said nothing were grumpy out of loyalty to joe but joe was not here and joe had gone off with mr muhammeds wife they took the winter food in silence and maes presence was made more normal if unwelcome some of the younger men overcome by the cold by energy by the end of the years work began to dance the girls squealed arid pretended to be overcome with embarrassment hiding their cheeks turning their backs and turning again to look the married women smiled ruefully and shook their heads the older men held their hands over their ears as if hating the music and wavered and wobbled in secret rivalry i always knew men were more interested in each other said mrs mack mrs mack mae laughed and touched her arm mrs mack less aloof towards mae than others responded with a chuckle at herself did i say that i am afraid so you are wild western woman joked mae oh said mrs mack not so pleased with the stale view of her christianity yes i look like the motorcycle girl im sorry i am the village fallen woman remember tuh these villagers said mrs mack they forgive murder faster mrs pin said pay no attention to them mae mrs mack leaned forward i understand that you are shorthanded in the circle i sew well mae still needed allies yah sure you want to join please why did you not say so before mrs mack was too christian not to be blunt i didnt know you were making all that money there was not much to say in reply to that and they say money cant buy friendship said mae it cant replied mrs mack blunt again mrs doh who could practise tact ballooned out her eyes at the behaviour of her two friends mae paused ill take that to mean we are friends beyond the money mrs mack paused if you like but you have not previously regarded me much no one in this village does her eyes were sad we will be at work tomorrow in my old house said mae come and join us all of you you are kind to extend such a valuable invitation said mrs doh the fine lines on her eyes and forehead wincing at mrs macks christian manners there was a sudden involuntary stir amid the people oh said one of the girls lung had joined the dancers he hopped in no embarrassment looking incredibly pleased to be there and began to dance as a village dance should be done broadly happily rolling his shoulders hips and arms in one great sinewy motion it was what was needed to finally make the party warm some of the women ululated in high warbling warrior tones the men joined in the slower and fatter men finally hopped into the middle white beards mocked themselves or showed that once they could dance with the best but no one could compete with lung he began to clap his hands high over his head he spun around on his heels the other younger men in the village began to gather round him to dance just as vigorously in the cab ozer snapped off the lectro the flutes the violins the tablas of the traditional music flooded the courtyard lung began to sing along he could sing too and his voice when lifted up was not that of a balshang otter or a karzistani soldier it was the voice of a happy peasant who had eaten his fill and was dancing to keep warm in the winter every village had one a tatlises a sweet voice lungs voice slipped around notes as if escaping them escaping order to follow the flow of blood of the heart gel gel goomooleh gel he sang come come to a house of welcome they all danced they all clapped even the women began to dance in the snow amid the sound of who they were and maes heart that had been starved of company was suddenly stuffed full she could feel it strain like a belly with the light the noise her people and her son joe was a village hero too mae suddenly thought when he was young the airs warmer it always is after the snow comes too warm warned mrs tung thats all she could say too warm over and over finally people left late bustling children to bed discipline drilled into them the soldiers did all the clearing up gathering up the basins mugs spoons the women were helpless before their speed kwan shook their heads we are surplus ladies she joked why cant we have the army all the time mrs nan said in the kitchen the three soldiers scrubbed the cutlery and boiled water in the pans scalding off the fats and oils and congealing beans well sleep in the truck said lung kwan insisted that she had spare rooms the soldiers nodded in polite gratitude shaking hands before going to get their bags i will walk you upstairs said lung to mae i am unlikely to come to harm said mae smiling but all understood he needed to talk the joy of the evening fell away behind them as they climbed the stairs he carried a candle mae had to take his arm in the dark she began to remember their recent unpleasant exchanges by voicemail he helped her fold away her scarf and sheepskin you got my warning then he said in the dark it was as though mae could see the steam of her breath glowing it was you her mind raced if it was lung not tunch then the army knows did he send the second encryption as well if so was he a friend if not she must not tell him anything else lung whispered yes ssh mae began to calculate you know about kwan yes he said simply is she in danger mae asked she began to feel sick lung sighed i dont think so now those screens have gone she should be all right after all you have made kizuldah famous what you might ask her to do which would be even better is for her to put up some new screens that tell both sides of the story like milk the very air seemed to curdle go sour lung elaborated you know how the government houses the eloi gives them homes refrigerators in balshang murmured mae yes he sounded pleased she could almost see the teeth in his smile that way the world does not puzzle over where the site has gone mae added you are very wise said lung but then you always were wise mama she was thinking you came here to accomplish this to get kwans site to do the governments work no you came here to protect your own career in the army lung relaxed he felt he had done his job who would have thought you could do all this the site the business where did you learn all this mae was narroweyed in the darkness what was he trying to find out now oh she said airily your mother is not so stupid it is all available on the tv and from hikmet tunch said lung lightly indeed how did you find him he found me it was strange being interrogated by her own son in a dark and unheated room as if they had both died and come back as evil dead her dead son gave a short slightly edged laugh no i mean what did you think of him what do you think of him i think you should stay away from him mae decided not to ask him is that what the army thinks she decided to deceive him to protect kwan herself her circle why she asked in innocence look the government likes him being here he brings in money but he does things in that place that are illegal everywhere else you know how he started as a computer student oh mother he was the countrys biggest drug smuggler they let him off because he runs a computer business our government would do such a thing mae sounded shocked our government does many things said lung quietly and you are its servant thought mae you look at what you do full in the face and you still serve it so that you can be a lieutenant and kwan will never put up a site to do what you want we could all end up looking at you my son from the wrong end of a gun come air and blow governments away then her son said what are you going to do about the pregnancy maes whole face pulled back until it was as tight as a mask the usual things it is not a usual pregnancy mae watched the wreathing of her icy breath who told you that lung blew out that man tunch well a nurse called fatimah lung jerked with a chuckle amused by his mothers quickness yes she at least seems very concerned for you yes she is perhaps we should both avoid that man tunch she couldnt read lungs reaction he shrugged and laughed and nodded no disagreement there then concern are you okay well mae decided not to let him off the hook no i feel sick and as you can see i am not welcome many places in the village his eyes could not meet hers he ducked and ran a hand over his hair mae asked him how is your father ugh said lung involuntarily seeing a lot of him he visits you often she asked i cant hide from you mama he is there all weekend every weekend sometimes i have to say to him look dad i am having all the officers over for dinner dark dark and cold in this attic room not her own and the officers do they find him interesting dont mama no they dont find him interesting he gets drunk and tries to talk up what he has done and pretends to be a businessman and tsang thought mae i wonder how you like the overripe peach that people must mistake for your mother but he also visits your sister ying yes yes he bounces between the two of us but she is married to an officer too mae saw it all poor joe desperate helplessly in love with his son yearning only to see lung and how strong and smart he was and trying also desperately to avoid seeing that he was in his sons way his daughters way you are not so smart lung you are enough of your fathers son i saw that somehow tonight this is as far as you will go and then you too will start unaccountably to fade you want some advice son mae moved through the winter silk of the night she took the hard band of muscle beside his neck and worked it the army will not like it that you have a western wife they will be disappointed in your father you know what you should do though this pains me i cannot think only of myself you should be your wifes husband and go back with her to canada lung sighed i know and then thought mae you will not be a spy on all of us chapter audio file from mr hikmet tunch december new york times how useful for whom for me certainly thank you for making such an emotional case against the un the government will also be pleased to be shown in such a good light and your friend bugsy how do you serve her you bring visitors to her superficial and decadent magpie do you really think american ladies for whom a shift from chiffon pastel to black cotton is big news are capable of being one with your circle remember mae that is an election year your friend is a democratic journalist she is using you and your praise of government subsidy to attack the republican president you are not a stupid woman mae so it interests me to find that you allow yourself to be acted upon finally you may be wondering who supplied that interesting code that arrived so happily a few nights ago you should avoid thanking anyone else for it so who is watching whom breakfast was late and boisterous and prolonged lung was still pumped full of love from the night before and didnt want to go he joked and kicked his bigbooted feet and accepted one cup of tea after another he and his men had gone out before anyone was up and repaired the powerline we found a frame for the wires just hanging in midair the wires were holding it up and not the other way around we just stared lung mimed a village dolt scratching his head then we saw burn marks some old farmer had been burning off straw and burned the pole as well kwan scraped dishes her lips drawn there was a vertical grey line down the middle of her cheeks and her hands suddenly looked thin frail and veined ill do that said mae lung was merry and oblivious his cheeks still glowed from freezing morning air he looked like a polished apple kwan sat arms folded her eyes dim and small finally mr wing came in bundled in sheepskin his eyes measuring like lasers its started to snow he said the little private looked anxious we could get snowed in lung moved slowly regretfully kwan stood up and delicately shook his hand and could not look him in the face she was scared the sergeant and the private flew up to their rooms and hopped back down swinging khaki bags mae speeded things along by getting lungs bag for him in the courtyard lung recovered his poise sergeant albankuh already had the engine running and lung had begun to understand that he was not quite at home he spent time thanking the wings handsomely for their hospitality and also his hand covering kwans for their kindnesses to his mother kwan had recovered as well she replied with exquisite politeness knowing that he had come to warn her off and perhaps to report on her mae marvelled at them all the maintenance of form and the retention of humanity it is the village that allows us to do this she thought we know each other and we all hope that that knowledge keeps us each in balance within limits then lung turned to mae and both of them seemed to relent they collapsed into a hug for mae it was like hugging some huge stranger he kissed her forehead called her his clever little mama then he stepped back from her he shoved on his army hat and that was somehow heartbreaking it was a boys gesture innocent and eternal all the soldiers throughout history had pushed on some kind of boot or glove just before they left their mothers to die or to come back for ever changed this was the last of her boy he would swell even bigger like a great fat boil and she saw how he would coarsen as he aged until his astounding beauty could not be credited you remember what i told you he said suddenly serious pointing a finger at her you remember what i told you she said equally serious he nodded and hopped into the cab and nodded to the sergeant to release the brake with it seemed to mae a kind of relief the truck crept forward and suddenly lungs face was flooded with a grin wide and white between two cheeks like peaches it was how both of them wanted him to be remembered snow clung to maes hair it seemed to be wrapping the village in lace lace was wrapped tightly around things in drawers to preserve them mae stood in the courtyard for many minutes listening to the rumble of the truck as the snow fell she heard each acceleration braking or change of gears the sound trailed away away farther into the valley step by step deeper and deeper down away from her mae turned to kwan and said im going too kwan blinked what why mae said im renting my own house from sunni ill move my business there i dont want to be a nuisance youre not a nuisance said kwan and took her hand then i want to go before i become one she went up the long staircase to the freezing attic room and packed her bags again she redirected her mail to the new tv of her own she went back down to the kitchen kwan was putting together an evening meal from the remains of last nights feast you wont have any food in the house explained kwan i thought you might like to have this we have kindling and shitcakes in the barn take some of those too to warm the house you have been so kind kwan looked sombre we have been through a lot together oh you could say that ten times and it would still not be enough but we came through we came through kwan hugged her you can still stay you know mae touched her arm i really do not know what i would have done if my friend wing kwan had not been so kind there would have been nowhere else for me to go but the time comes even with family when one must leave kwan nodded so mae took her one carpetbag and another bag of food and fuel and set out across the courtyard her slippers scrunched on the snow and her breath rose up as vaporous as a fading memory she knew kwan would be watching from her diwan mae held up a hand and waved goodbye without looking back the wang household was the first door she passed on the corner of upper and lower streets it had been her home through most of her childhood mae stopped and looked at the doorstep the single step would always get muddy and she and her older sister did not want anyone to think of them as dirty so every day for ten years they had scrubbed it the water in the plastic bucket was always cold mae now brushed the snow off the step with her slipper here in this house mae had slept in one tiny bedroom with two sisters their mother had slept on cushions on the diwan her brother and an uncle shared a room the iron aunt kept the main bedchamber for herself it was a fatherless house full of work and worry mae realized she felt guilty for neglecting her mother she felt a sullen resentment that her mother had not been to see her she felt awkwardness and she felt a kind of twist of triumph she felt many things she did not like herself feeling come on mae she told herself she knocked on the front door her sisterinlaw opened it to a sudden swelling sound from within of a baby wailing her sisterinlaws face drooped and then froze mouth open liliang may i come in mae heard herself ringing a sweet little bell voice which was designed to put rude people in the wrong uh mae hello her sisterinlaw was not an independent person if there was a surprise she could take no action without jumei jumei she shouted your sister is here and still outside in the snow mae thought smiling like a row of tinkling windchimes my family really is as bad as i think they are she decided the sisterinlaw stepped back out of view leaving the door hanging open and mae standing outside mae heard steps her brother jumeis voice was dim why is the door open mae was not in a tolerant mood because your wife does not want to invite me in and does not have the courage to slam it in my face said mae i had my baby to look after said young mrs wang jumei swelled suddenly into the doorway he needed a shave his shirt was untucked and mae knew they did not want me to see them as ordinary scruffy and so hated answering the door that is the wang family way to be rude in order to preserve good appearances i am probably the same i am moving back into my old house mae announced i can afford to rent it from my friend sunni haseem jumei snorted friend haseem and yet there was doubt what if they were friends again my business will move back there as well mae kept smiling i am sure you will be pleased that it is doing very well and since the house has so long been in the family chung i was wondering if old mr chung and my brotherinlaw mr chung siao would not like to occupy it with me mae smiled so you see i have not come to trouble you i really wish to speak to the chung family and not your own family growled jumei my own family does not invite me into their house even when it is snowing from that i conclude i am not welcome i do not wish to intrude jumei was very angry with her very well he said and closed the door in maes face mae heard a singsong wailing from behind the wooden door that she realized would be mama she had time to wonder if jumei had actually wished to spare mae a scene with mama mama presented her life as a continuing tragic opera then the door was flung open and maes mother wearing her quivering flower face stood trembling in the doorway she held her head back with defiant pride how dare you how dare you show your face at my doorway mother youre being silly said mae you talk to me you judge me when you have behaved as no woman should behave when you brought shame to me yes me what do you think people are saying about me there she goes the woman who cannot control her wild daughter who brings down respectable life in the village i cannot believe you would do that to me i didnt do it to you mother i did it to myself everything you do you do to me when your father was killed here we go sighed mae you can tell the truth so often that it becomes a lie mae had not spent a day in her mothers presence without mama telling yet again the full story of how their brave father was shot by the communists and how she was left alone in the world with three young babies then followed the sacrifice the work and the endless worry only to be repaid with desertion and coldness then and this was best of all how she had never complained was always silent had left the past behind her but now now because of maes behaviour was forced to speak of what had been left behind you you you have made me cry you have made me remember you have broken my triumph over these terrible memories i need to speak to mr chung repeated mae her mother by now was wracked with sobs and jumei was holding her patting her and glowering at mae you seeheehee her mother sobbed she cannot admit she was wrong i was wrong said mae you see she has no remorse it was a disruptive thing i did she has no feeling she has not been to see me once she was staying next door and she would not deign to see me she does not care that i am old and sick and alone suddenly siao in his tshirt had inserted himself sideways past the wangs and his steady face was wrinkled in an embarrassed smile there was no accusation in the face at all mae saw at once he had absolutely had his fill of the wangs she also saw his karz bluegrey eyes and his fine dark beard and his slim workmans arms she found herself thinking he has grown up come home mae asked him siao nodded yes very slightly it would be pleasant to be in my old house he said i am sorry for what happened mae said siao stayed smiling and calm while his shoulders equivocated it was a terrible thing you did mae nodded yes siao turned back to the doorway mr wang he began i must speak to my father you cannot go back with that woman after what she has done roared mr jumei siao rocked slightly in place i am so grateful for what you have done for us but i am aware that we cannot stay as guests for ever it is a burden for you please i am very cold we all are can we not simply ask mae to come inside never wailed her mother jumei stood up straight you heard what my mother said his wife chipped in the baby is freezing siao nodded once politely and smiling stepped inside just a moment mae i will not be long he said bowing slightly he closed the door when he opened it again he had old mr chung with him the old man looked confused now he had on a filthy quilted jacket with his box of tools is it a job he asked looking eager still in his tshirt siao stepped outside with his father into the snow and closed the door after him your family has been very generous to us he said to mae mae saw his bare arms and took off her coat and put it around siaos shoulders they were all cold mae spoke quickly the house is restored to you as long as i can pay rent the business is now in the barn how are you old mr chungsir ready ready the old man said stepping in place as if held back by a harness they are driving me crazy father that is rude old mr chung looked at mae i know they are your family mae heard herself say you are my family whatever was between me and joe i always loved his family the old man blinked we loved you the door blurted open like an awkward remark jumei stood glowering at the door you keep a poor old man outside he accused mae then perhaps you can let us inside said mae mae won reluctantly jumei admitted her her mother sat enthroned and avoiding her gaze young mrs wang had taken the baby elsewhere the inside of the house as always was as empty and as clean as an iceberg the tiny brazier did nothing to warm it on the wall was the framed photograph of all of them as children and another photograph of her father so familiar that it looked nothing like him maes mother cowered in black trousers and jacket and a long flowered scarf she looked tiny and frail and unhappy there is nothing in her to be frightened of mae thought then she thought frightened siao said bowing we have decided to take maes kind offer something in the way he said it made mae realize siao is head of the family now joes going has been good for him jumei glowered i cannot believe you will accept any help from that woman we have taken much already from her family who owed us nothing and were so kind to make space for us in their home said siao we are impoverished and through our own efforts have lost everything we inherited at least this way there may be some small illusion that we live in our own home jumei glowered at mae your sentiments are noble siao and i can only add that i am deeply ashamed that my own sister has left you in such a terrible situation you have been an ideal guest ah thought mae theyve all been driving each other crazy and i feel that as a mark of my respect and affection for you that i will assist in carrying your cases and goods he wants to see what is going on thought mae and he did jumei went into the barn and saw the giant weaver with its lights and display and its speaking voice his eyes boggled you make money from this mae used her little formula five hundred collars at ten dollars each jumei looked so forlorn that part of mae wanted to hug him he looked like such a disappointed little boy he pouted and looked sad and yearning and hung his head jumei had always thought that if someone had something they had got it by stealing it from him tuh who will work for a woman like you about half the village chuckled siao since it makes them so much money your sister has appeared in the new york times he even gave his sisterinlaw a little hug about the shoulders hmm and you think you can run a business of this size by yourself oh i do not think that said mae ringing her little bell voice i know i can so i will not be needing your help mae moved into the attic she wanted it that way to keep her new tv out of the way of thieves she said she did not mention the flood to siao that will be fine said siao i was tired of that attic but hoi mae let me tell you that attic is cold are you sure you want to be up there siao i am a fallen women people will be more comfortable coming to your kitchen to offer you work if i am not there his eyes looked briefly pained and then he nodded yes as if to make it up to her siao made a pulley it had a strong net to carry things and strong wooden wheels and it could hoist her tv up and down from the attic in case you want to take it outside in summer to teach he said siao was plainly overjoyed to be back he scampered bringing in charcoal for the braziers making a new bedspace for his father beside the fire and screwing hooks into the roofbeam he ducked and climbed and dangled as lithe as any monkey mae warmed whisky and around their old wooden table they all toasted the chung family and its house the new house they called it as if it had been rebuilt and then alone and wearing every single piece of clothing she possessed to keep warm mae sat alone in her attic in front of a television of her own please say hello it asked her to start the process of getting to know her hello replied mae it was like meeting a female cousin for the first time and knowing you were going to become friends she entered a new email address the one she had told kwans machine to forward email to and at last began to work on her own she sipped yet more warmed whisky and went to work audio file from mr hikmet tunch december i have been looking at a particular site in america about history and have found it very interesting perhaps friends of yours would like to know it is available strange indeed are the uses to which we all are put i myself come from a long line of peasant soldiers of the karz throughout history we have laid down our rakes and picked up our axes to march off to bash the happy province into submission but it is like a walnut that does not break open but is only driven into the mud so that it sprouts again i seem to have been used to help plant it afresh once there was a dictator he drove millions to various kinds of deaths by war in prison or simply in harsh deserts farming their lives away he destroyed temples burned books and ruined the art of calligraphy he wrote terrible poetry and forced everyone to learn it so destroying the literary taste of one quarter of humanity he remained a warrior even as chairman he was at his best as a warrior because as a warrior he was fighting for his people dreaming for them after that he only ground them down but i forgive him for saying one beautiful thing women hold up half the sky chairman mao tse tung chapter audio file from mrs chung mae december mr oz kwan has an email saying that teacher shen has lost his job and is to be replaced how the snows have come you cant get even a tractor up our road now so is teacher shen supposed to go on teaching unpaid how will it help our children if there is no school look okay teacher shen gave me a big blow and did the party of progress great harm but this will do no good please listen to his wife our friend shen suloi mr ozsir i am mrs shen suloi the wife of teacher shen gracious friend you have been all kindness to us and we need your help again my husband is wrong about the tv and air he sees these things as a great flood that will sweep everything away but he is a good man and he wants the best for the children of our village gracious friend it is a very bad thing that the message he lost his job came through the tv and came after your visit this makes many men here think of the tv as an enemy they think it spies for the government they think it takes away a mans whole life many say they will not let their children go to school if it is taught by a government replacement woman my husband goes on teaching now for no money but he is brokenhearted we are poor people mr oz okay that is hard for us to admit easier perhaps for the women we have four children ourselves and no farm my husband goes to the school with his shoulders hunched he does not comb his hair he sits at night by the single candle and weeps all his life he trained to be teacher it was a great accomplishment for a boy from kizuldah and now that has gone and his wife makes more money than he does so can you talk to the people who did this and explain we have no teacher can you get them to give my husband back his job this is mrs chung tell them this mail comes from me whom he harmed winter is when our children traditionally do their lessons it does no good to have no teacher here now audio file from mr oz oz december mae i am angry too they didnt even tell me it is like that you make a report and they go off and do something and dont even consult with the person who was there it is typical of the central office to work in that way i dont know why i stay with them they never listen they have no management skills i feel terribly embarrassed but it is not my fault what can i do audio file from mrs chung mae december i dont care about all of that what are you going to do now email from mrs wing kwan december dear secretary goongoormush i am a partner with madam chung mae our business was recently featured in the new york times the attached files of access statistics and business turnover shows our venture to be one of the most successful under the taking wing initiative my husband is manager of swallow communications also funded by the initiative i say this only to show that i along with chung mae and others represent what we here call the party of progress your representative mr oz oz accurately reported that our efforts have been hampered by the local schoolteacher mr shen yoh however removing teacher shen from his post at this time will slow progress his replacement will not be able to get up our road in winter this could leave our children without schooling during this crucial year of taking wing teacher shen has not seen the benefits of info but he is a good man and we of the party of progress request his reinstatement yours mrs wing kwan audio file from mr oz oz december mae are you crazy a letter from kwan she is not the bestregarded person in kizuldah i have raised the issue but my boss tells me it is all down to the office of discipline and education and their own vision campaign so you see how i am prevented at every turn from helping audio file from mrs chung mae december i do indeed see what stops you helping us it was dawn and in her loft mae could hear the weaving machine at work it made a neat whirring sound that reminded mae of hummingbirds she could hear it through her walls as she worked she could imagine it extending a tongue of beautiful new knitware her new tv was strung in a hammock and held up by siaos pulley it was early morning and mae was building a new site it was not going well well at least one screen worked old cars never die they just go to mr pinsirs dynamic car surgery also their cousins tractors trailers and vans all vehicles are charmed by the car surgeon s bedside manner and kind skilled hands mae had written letters telling everyone about her new net services her first customer mr pin had shown up two days ago mr pin did not want to speak to madam owl he sat with siao ignoring mae and twisting the letter in his hand he had no more idea of what to do with the net than use it to make himself seem more modern that meant more modern than his great and murderous rival mr enver atakoloo siao kept trying to defer to mae to direct mr pins questions to her finally to relieve everyones embarrassment mae had gone back upstairs into the loft she listened from upstairs and was surprised at how useful siao was mr pin was a difficult man to help he did not understand what the tv was for and was frightened that the government would see anything about him siao kept explaining it took hours and a bottle of warmed rice wine siaos idea was to put a list on the machine called mr pins helpful service that answers your questions it would give people advice on how to check the car was working or to make simple repairs themselves mr pin did not understand the principles of info matunrolling giving something away for free siao evidently did he explained that free info made friends with the customers and showed you were expert more importantly it got rid of the less profitable parts of your business by giving away all the little pieces of advice that made no money pin drunk by now finally got it ah mr siaosir what a brain you have you should be running a bank sir siao coaxed out of mr pin everything that could go wrong with a car and whether most people could fix it themselves and if not how much it would cost siao then clambered up the ladder with a written list his manner had no pride in it businesslike he had read it out to mae and into the machine mae was using that information to make her first intelligent voiceform it was supposed to ask questions and leave time for the innocent to reply into the microphone nature of the problem the car wont start when huh please repeat the nature of the problem wont start huh if you are having difficulty please make an appointment with mr pin can you bring the car in answer yes or no no can you bring the car in answer yes or no yes the voiceform did a kind of flip and started to repeat over and over answer answer answer shitcakes said mae and thumped the tv stop save mae arched herself backwards to bend her spine in the opposite direction create email to sloopkarzphonecokz attach program file pinform three mae sent the form to the sloop the telephone engineer in yeshibozkent who had first tried to explain tv to her he helped her with difficult encoding for a fee how was she supposed to make money from this mae sighed and thought about breakfast she went downstairs and was surprised to see siao and old mr chung were up this early and at breakfast then she saw the time it was eightthirty am siao had his head in his hands siao held out a paper towards mae your brother he said shaking his head what has he done now mae was prepared to be breezy about her brother he was inconvenient like burnt porridge and a pan that needed to be scrubbed siaos face curled inward on itself lips disappearing you will not believe it he is claiming your business what how can he do that mae made the face she got when she shooed midges from her eyes a squinting and a shaking of the head siao read the letter to mae it was a from a city lawyer under section of the worldly property act it is evident that madam chung mae having deserted her husband has no claims on the family property the residence down court on lower street having been sold this leaves only the familys business interests since mr chung joe has residence in balshang plainly the family business in fashion net design and clothes production has been taken over by his deserting wife who has no legal entitlement to it mrs chung has shown continual lack of judgement and bizarre behaviour since an unfortunate incident resulting from the air test this has been fully documented see affidavits from dr bauschu who attests to an induced schizophrenia following the test mrs chungs bizarre behaviour has included attacking a village elder with cleavers desertion of her husband an illicit love affair and a complete rejection of her own maiden family causing her elderly mother great distress as male head of her family i therefore claim immediate control of all these business interests in order to preserve and protect them and to put them under rightful management hatred came to mae pure and whole and allconsuming she sat down with a bump jumei was very lucky that he was not in the room for she would surely have picked up her cleavers again i cannot believe this he can do that it is an old law it is to avoid women taking over things but the law exists i will kill him that will just leave you in prison siao lit a cigarette and looked mae in the eyes how much do you trust me he asked mae blinked at the unexpected question i dont know i have never had to trust you siao he nodded and his eyes turned momentarily inward towards himself he had not made himself present before we could say that this is a chung family business and that therefore mr wang can keep his nose out of it mae could see why he had asked we could indeed and she did indeed feel mistrust she did not want joe or siao taking it over either i could say it is chung family business and that jumei may be a head of family but it is the wrong family we could say that whether you are suitable or not is not for him or his lawyer to say old mr chung shook his head they take everything away not if we dont let them papa said siao we will need a lawyer said mae lawyers know people they know how the government works inshallah she put her own head in her hands oh i do not need this i tell you all of this will drive me mad i should not say things like that for a while said siao mae went to her machine and voicemailed kwan kwan gave her the name of a lawyer and suggested that it might be better if she kwan wrote the letter mae when you get angry you sometimes say things i never want to see any of my family ever again that is exactly what i mean kwan produced a draft in her own name writing as a member of the circle it was the complete expression of a reasonable ladylike person setting out a situation in which she herself had rights the business apparently belonged to everyone in the circle including kwan i hope mae thought i am not about to have trouble with her too siao looked pensive that is another line to take and perhaps even better than saying it is a chung family business but consider it could be that jumei does not do this because he thinks he can get the business maybe he just wants a cut he wants a cut all right ill give him a cut he knows nothing about info nothing about air nothing about anything he is just jealous and always has been he is those things you have to accept that you cant change who your brother is siao knew something about accepting difficult brothers mae said nothing siao said mae i dont think its money he wants i think he wants respect that is why he is always in city overcoat and city hat it is why he is an insurance agent up here in the hills even though none of us can afford insurance mae was furious i will never talk to him ever again for me he ceases to live a toad has more of my notice than that city suit of pretension and jealousy you and your sister ran the family said siao all he sees is his powergrabbing sister who is always always ahead of him and he yearns just once to win i would say that what he wants is for you to need him tuh him you are too nice siao jumei wants success and loot what a man wants more than anything else mae is to be needed siaos voice was very quiet if a man is not needed he does one of two things he gives up and becomes quiet and angry or he rages and becomes loud and angry both are the same siaos eyes said know and mae thought he means himself she said jumei has his wife and child to need him siao shrugged that will not be enough if you are a cloud over his head so what do you suggest we do i suggest you spend no money on lawyers that is what he wants you to do so that he can go to court and humiliate you siao was thinking you can apologize what siao could not help but smile aha you see you like being right too you are both from the same family apologize for what lying to him i never lied to him did you tell him about your plans for the business what no of course not ah so you did not tell your own brother the truth and what is not telling the truth mae mae was flabbergasted but but it it it it siao was starting to chuckle you hid the truth hiding the truth is a lie but it is not like i told him i was not doing any business what business is it of his he is your brother what he is doing is trying to make the law enforce that yes he wants to do it in a way that hurts you but thats because you have hurt him and he thinks you must have done it deliberately i know you didnt do anything to hurt him deliberately but you hurt him what is he looking for here to be head of family and to be your brother he knows in his heart that you married and are no longer a wang tuh he knows in his heart he wants money i know in his heart he wants much more than that i tell you let me write the letter siao could not resist a little joke women are so insensitive they cannot understand a mans finer feelings nonsense said mae siao touched the tip of the pencil to his tongue to begin writing siao enjoyed writing mae had never noticed that before my dearest brother i am sorry to have concealed all my business dealings from you it was not honest to do so i have lost much because of this i have lost your aid and your counsel instead you have become my enemy at a time when i most need friends i have a wonderful idea but i do not know how to progress it because i am so ignorant of the insurance business and here at hand i have a brother who knows all about it i think you and i together could come up with very intelligent ways to use the tv to get our local village people to see how important it is to have insurance ineed your help please can we meet so that we can talk all through this your sister mae mae was scornful it says nothing about the case it does not even ask him to give the case up ah you noticed you are asking me to lie down and be screwed by my own brother i am asking you to give something up so that he sees it is in his selfinterest to give something up too so that he will be on your side as a brother should be i am willing to bet mae that he would give anything to be by your side as a brother should be mae snarled hmph okay we send your letter eh and just see the reply we get from my charming younger brother mae your idea for television insurance is interesting of course it would have to be linked with yeshibozkent home guardian whose interests i represent but i am sure they would have no objections to screens that carried their brand and sold their products in a way that suits our locale i will need to discuss this idea with them first i do have doubts whether we can work together your behaviour in the past leads to grave concerns about your state of mind however families must show solidarity in the face of adversity if you are willing to allow my greater knowledge of the field to direct policy then perhaps we can consider this further your brother mr wang jumei happy province sales conqueror yeshibozkent home guardian mae was furious my behaviour my state of mind what about his suing his own sister trying to take away all that she has done siao sipped his tea shall we look at what he really said first he has grave doubts about the two of you working together is that not something you can agree with mae puffed out air poh yes that at least so shall we regard that as a simple statement of fact mae shrugged her shoulders he sued me i did not sue him he hasnt sued you he has stated his intention to in fact he gave you fair warning isnt that so mae it is so you are a man and you are on his side you are perfectly right to call him jealous and scheming lets just look at what he says in the letter now he then mentions your behaviour and your state of mind have you not chased a man with cleavers did you not have a careless affair with the neighbour did you not threaten to kill jumei mae did not like this she wanted to fight but there was nothing to fight siao whispered he is frightened of you mae he is terrified of you you are his big brave older sister and he knows you take on the new york times and that you chased big strong mr haseem out of your house and he is scared there was something in what siao was saying that made mae laugh im frightened of you mae the whole village is terrified of you so okay madam owl who is violent and aggressive hates him people know when you hate them mae they also know when you love them mae was still smiling so he is saying he will talk to his company he is saying families must stick together mae youve won so now you must act like you have won mae started to puff out siao said you must go and visit your family and make amends mae was left to wait alone in the icy diwan her family burned tiny amounts of coal two grey chunks of it smouldered on the brazier mae sat on the cushions and tried to warm her feet and still her butterfly hands her butterfly stomach mae mae why are you so scared she heard them whispering outside the room why were they so scared why was the whole family wang frightened of itself its like this for jumei she thought he shows up in peoples houses they dont want to be discourteous so they show him in into the diwan and have a quiet fight hissing behind curtains trying to make each other be polite to him he sits alone and pretends not to hear but the least you can do is let people wait in warmth if coal is such a luxury then burn shitcakes except that the family wang cant be seen to burn shit only peasants burn shit we used to wrap birthday presents in the red paper napkins that came with the tea at the teahouse we would wrap up something precious like an orange and we would carefully pick off the tape so we could use the napkins again every little present came wrapped in the same red napkins poor mama all we ever had to eat was soup one bowl of soup a day and i remember one day we had to eat grass stew just to fill our bellies the next day mama went to every house in the village and begged someone gave her hensfeet someone gave her an onion and she made us soup out of almost nothing and then one of us little monkeys spilled kerosene from the lamp into it and she fell on the floor weeping she did not even punish us she just lay there crying mae looked at the photographs on the walls there they were all children lined up in white shirts white dresses in the golden age as mama called the time when papa was alive even then she would have beaten those clothes white on the rocks under the bridge there was papa with a photographic face like burnished bronze in a city suit with a moustache and a pipe mae remembered the day it was taken they had all ridden down from kurulmushkoy in a cart and he had sat up straight and proud in his best clothes he was the local candidate for the party of national unity and that was why his picture was to be taken that was why he was killed it was okay for missy and me we were girls we could go on being girls it was jumei who had no one to show him how to be and thats why papas picture now hangs in the middle of the wall mae remembered jumei didnt talk for six months after papa was killed he just sat in silence looking at his little scuffed shoes mae remembered it was jumei who had found him dying in the diwan we had to keep using the cushions with papas blood on them suddenly the diwan curtains snapped back as if jumei wanted to tear them down his chin was thrust up he was in full city regalia and he had on his glasses suddenly she remembered her fathers dead face and the answer came he is frightened of the past he is doing everything he can to escape it and the more he fights the more hes trapped in it and so am i something in mae seemed to snap and unwind she uncoiled and relaxed poor jumei you can never give up fighting not even for a moment mae stood up and gave her brother a respectful bow even she was amazed she did not feel a tremor of resentment brother she murmured sister he growled curtly and jerked his head up and down it was more like he was hitting her with his head than bowing in respect he didnt know what to say they both stood staring for a moment may i sit down mae asked i am amazed that you have to ask he growled back he thought she was trying to show him up for bad manners which meant of course that he knew he had been badmannered at leaving her alone for so long mae sat down and looked at the walls and thought the karz equivalent of to hell with it she gave up trying to do anything at all your photographs reminded me strongly of the old days when we lived here with our auntie tuh i am too busy to think about the past me too mostly but you know it was not all bad it is good to remember how dedicated mama was to keeping us clean and fed how we all worked it is pleasant to hear you acknowledge mama for something mae couldnt be bothered with fighting she will always be mama it was very difficult for her she relied on papa for everything in those days it was possible to believe that if you were a woman you would never have to grow up you could just go on doing what you were told and suddenly poof no one there to tell you she has never recovered from fathers death none of us has we are so far gone we would not know what recovery looks like who we might have been if papa had lived is so far away we cannot even imagine it only i think we keep thinking we will one day grow up to be that family jumei suddenly stood up what do you want he asked roughly mae couldnt figure out if he was angry or threatened or impatient or bored or sad she might as well answer his question for real she sat and thought for a moment and the answer came as a surprise a little peace and quiet she said tuh there is little chance of that for anyone else when you are around and there probably was some truth in that maybe thats why i need some myself jumei stood up straighter we are here to talk about a proposition maes eyes felt heavy she had a choice she could let them have the argument jumei wanted or she could choose to hold on to what siao had shown her something new mae found she was doing this for siao insurance is too big a word for people who make their own candles she said they have to see it they have to see themselves so your company will have something called day tah it is info the company uses to calculate answers to insurance questions maybe the company has videos maybe about real people the company has helped it was like a fire kindled in herself mae suddenly sat up so what we do is pull all this stuff together into a show and we have number one expert thats you maybe we put the show on in mrs wings courtyard we make it social maybe in spring food flowers everything is abundant ah and you come and you explain you show some films but also you invite people to talk to the tv and it gets answers especially for them shed done something wrong jumeis face was closing down ive been selling insurance to this village for many years mae i dont need you to tell me how to do it i have made a mistake here i am the big older sister telling him what to do i i have let my enthusiasm carry me away she said plainly this scheme would rely entirely upon you you have never bought any insurance yourself he said what i should spend all that money with you because you are my brother mae had to quell the risingup of anger after all mae his wife bought your dresses families buy from each other solidarity that was my husbands decision said mae joe joe never made any decisions jumei is being more honest in this encounter than you are mae i never thought we needed it said mae until now they needed it now and for a reason i dont expect you to believe me jumei but i have only just realized what i want out of this money he said flatly dourly without hope i want you to get our village insured against flooding she thought for a moment and i want my family back she felt a little sting of tears around the base of her eyes mae thought it was to no avail it ended like a business meeting with jumei promising to consider her proposal before she turned and left she looked about the house there were small thin rugs on the floor and a picture cut from a magazine in a frame the shelves were empty except for an encyclopedia jumei had bought second hand for his childrens education the room was clean and tidy so much work and so cold her mother did not show her face mae got home and decided to buy some flood insurance she made tea climbed up the steps to madam owls attic there was an email for her sister i have talked with the family and we have decided to accept your proposition we think it would be better if we had the show here in our own home mama is talking about decorations and food would you or mrs wing be able to loan us the television there is something i did not understand i did not understand before how much of what you do is done for the village i thought you did it to make money you dressed down and looked bad and i thought you had given yourself a different kind of air and grace that you had set yourself up as something it simply did not occur to me how much of what you were doing you were doing without thought of yourself and so i find that i am more than happy to join with you in your project together we will get kizuldah insured your brother jumei siao siao mae called overjoyed siao come see mae and sloop the engineer from yeshibozkent put the demonstrationtogether siao and jumei wrestled her television into the wang family house there were indeed flowers but winter flowers made of paper and tables full of food someone from every household in the village came the grates were piled high with coals and there was rice wine jumei stood in front of them all and showed people how much money they could make and how they could pay so little each week the faces of other farmers explained they were buying protection these were not videos yeshibozkent home guardian set up live links lined weathered faces like their own answered the villagers questions oh yes we lost all our sheep to foot and mouth but the company paid back our losses the director of home guardian also came on a live link he told jumei that his show was a model of how to bring the insurance crusade to the people siao was there and bought insurance on behalf of the family chung he made a handsome gesture of paying for the insurance of maes weaving machine throughout mae sat quietly in the corner wearing her best white dress after the shaking of hands and goodnights and seeing her brothers overjoyed smile mae climbed up the ladder to her loft and went to bed alone her arms held nothing except the memory of the party she cradled it all night alongside the swelling shape of her unborn child but she found herself thinking of siaos smooth arms chapter teacher shen cameto call mae opened her door and saw him against the glowing whitegrey sky and her heart thumped teacher she said greeting him in the formal fashion with a bow of respect shen looked awful disordered wisps of hair were on his chin they were grey like an old womans whiskers his eyes were encircled with concentric pouches of flesh he stared at her it is cold for you please come in teacher she said he looked poor he smelled poor his coat was old black held shut something had been spilt on it he had beautiful eloi mittens knitted by his wife mae kept talking oh such weather to come visit let me make you tea its not cold he said it is unseasonably warm please please sit at the table mae cleared away siaos breakfast things i know what you mean about warmth all that snow on the hills in this warm weather i fear there will be a flood shens lip curled mae kept smiling rattling out cups there was one you know in and all the village of aynalar was washed away we need to be prepared in case it happens again stop it she told herself you say that to everyone now you chatter he is not here for that mae bustled the kettle onto the brazier and rattled out cups for them both she smelled his breath old sour wine chinese men could not drink well the condition was called kizul red for the flushed cheeks and the anger it should also be called white for afterwards they were pale and shivery like easily broken ice he sighed and dug his fingers into his thick black hair you were always so handsome she thought friendship flowed down old familiar channels i didnt sleep last night he said i dont wonder at it you have been removed from a most honoured position most unjustly tub he said looking at her as if she were the tv his look said you did it i did nothing you know mae said sitting away from him she found she was calculating how far he could swing if he went to hit her teacher shen i would ride in your cart upholstered with hops for the beer factory that was always my favourite way to go to the city you me and suloi up early all the four am birds singing all around us the dawn would come up on your friendly faces and we would eat buns and you would tell all your old village stories shen said my wife tells me you have been writing letters you are trying to get me my job back shens face shivered the ice broke and he was weeping they wont give me my job he sounded exactly like a little boy his face wrung like an old washingrag he stared at the table drawing breath trying to swallow i am not a farmer i have very little land what i am to do for money he patted his pockets looking for a cigarette then remembering he had none could not afford them mae leaned forward you studied so hard to be a teacher it was not right of them to fire you fire me they did he said kwan is trying to make a collection trying to get enough money from the village to pay you he shook his head over and over who had the money for that in winter who became a teacher to end up living on village charity mae tried to explain i would help collect it but shen sighed and nodded but no one will talk to you hard to lose a job isnt it he looked up at her it is what i did to you she shrugged i was able to do something else as we all will have to teacher the world will not let any of us stay the same shen sniffed he sat up straighter i have been thinking he said that there is something i can do to help myself he sighed sniffed and repaired the damage to his manhood by wiping his cheeks i can learn how to use the monster he pulled in a breath as if smoking selfrespect cigarettes if i use it they will say oh he is no longer stopping progress mae paused her response must be gentle you are wise teacher shen she replied how do i do it he said with a snap she replied cautiously it will take time teacher shen and the village needs you to be teacher now mae considered how to unroll shens mat the effect we need to create is that you already know much about info and that you are willing to teach it shen swayed in his chair he looked trapped he turned away and looked as if he desperately wanted a lungful of cigarette smoke to blow out okay he said i can tell you what to say to the machine to set up an email address if you do it vocally the machine will record that the commands came from you personally and that will be better yes the office of discipline and education sees it comes from you then we will send them a videomail so they see that you dont just know email you are full net tv person so we must spruce you up a bit he almost laughed fashion expert no longer she replied but i am good at selling things and make no mistake teacher we are now selling you ah im sorry but we must be clear on what we are trying to do he was dismayed he was helpless and his picture of the world no longer worked he nodded tamely i still have some things of joes she said and stood up oh the tea she quickly poured water into the pot and left him with it he sat nursing the cup he wanted to be comforted and to wash away the booze by the sink were joes things male things razor comb when joe left he had hurled everything about the house he and tsang had flung everything about they must have been drunk or very happy here you must shave you must wash your hair shen seemed frozen of course he would have to take off his shirt imagine the scandal if one of the ladies of the circle came to find him with madam owl and his shirt off i will check the machine and be back mae said she was growing very adept at zipping up and down that ladder she unhooked the tv from the beam it did not take much strength to wheel the machine around and crank it down onto the kitchen floor tell me when you are ready teacher shen she called mae looked out from her skylight the whole house clicked like knitting needles as water trickled continually down the eaves the water butts were overflowing it was cool her breath was vapour but only because the air was so wet it could not contain any more moisture it was the vapour of fog not of deep chill too warm too warm too warm mae broke off the thought she talked mrs tung down we will go on tv and get teacher shen back his job the weaving machine is making all kinds of things new things that never existed before california ladies order bags women in japan order embroidered caps isnt info great isnt business fun tm ready mr shen called mae clambered down the ladder her heart went out to shen he stood up straight head back as if to brave the buffeting waves of examination his hair was black again from being damp there were shaving suds around his ears and joes old razor had left a rash but he looked shiny and he sat up straight oh you look so professional said mae she talked him through setting up an account on her machine he spoke the words slowly hesitantly through a stone face in which even the lips hardly moved but the screen did a fan dance of pages confirming informing i love this stuff thought mae at no other time was her mind as clear at no other time was old mrs tung farther from her less in step more powerless inside her so joy reinforced joy her beautiful tv was like a fount from which she drew something sparkling wholesome and clear shen was a double name if he was karzistani and there was a lot of doubt about that then the name meant happiness if it was the chinese name shen then it was too ancient to mean anything it could even be an eloi name if you pushed shueng what nation was he someone called shen came from a people with too much history they could be killed for the history embedded in their names that made them permanently afraid buffeted by fate they were a peasant people only wanting to be left alone and to not have to worry about which continent they belonged to or which tribe that was all shen wanted to be left alone unnoticed okay now you must look like you are going to your daughters graduation she pulled the old coat from him and was grateful that he had worn a black shirt it was rumpled and of variable colour but on tv its darkness would be pristine she wiped the soap from his ears excuse me you have a rash she said can i put some makeup on you finally he smiled i am a talent he said shuffling his feet even as he sat mae dabbed his chin with her own colourings i will be talking to the secretary he said something like terror overcoming him no she said hurriedly no no of course not what you will do is talk into the tv but the video will be sent like a letter they can open later they will see that you are a good man a serious man and that you are at home with info they will see that they are wrong about you okay she looked into his eyes the village hated the government mistrusted it he could bolt at any moment ill tell you what use the big screen like a mirror that will show you how you look and that can help you shen seemed to wilt i should not do it now i should write out a speech first what if i make a mistake if it is a bad one we make the movie again okay but listen shen dont read a speech you are a teacher you are used to talking all day in front of people you are a smart man i promise you will do this well okay okay you poor good man mae turned on the camera and went onto record and swapped the screen so it would show what the camera saw shen was suddenly struck by seeing his own face on tv he opened his mouth and stared sweat from the heat trickled down his face as if he were melting snow i dont know what to say he said his face was slippery with panic stop cancel she told the machine mae mopped his face and told him firmly you know what you need to say the secretary knows he is powerful so dont waste his time grovelling he knows you are asking for something just ask quickly but make sure also that you say what you need to say he began again and the teacher in him emerged secretary goongoormush he said and swallowed i am teacher shen yoh of the village of kizuldah in yeshibozkent vilayet i have recently been removed from my post of teacher he cleared his throat i understand why this has been done it is my job to teach info and it is true that i did stop madam chung from teaching this subject however the village has no teacher at all now in winter this means that the children receive no schooling i request that i be reinstated as you see i have begun to learn info from madam chung herself he paused and then said we have always been the best of friends and i am sure she will help me to become a good teacher thank you for your time his breath rattled and then he said queue message when had he learned that thats it she said to encourage him youve done it yes he said thank you his eyes were heavy his whole bearing was weighted as if lifting rocks he stood up to go it was time for them to be honest mae stood up too what you did to me was a very bad thing she said to him yes he said still he did not could not apologize he moved towards the door i am only trying to help us help us all she said finding herself trailing after him we all must learn to be part of the future what did she want from him something in return he was being pursued and speeded his progress towards the door he picked up his stained coat and wrapped his scarf around his throat his back was towards her he was at the door through the door gone nothing else was said not even a thankyou she went to the window shens shoulders were hunched he took a hand and mussed his tidy hair his hands shook as they fought to open the ancient latch of the courtyard gate then as if in a rage shen flung the doors back so they shuddered against the cobbles and only slowly swung back to close after him before they did mae saw shen hide his face in his hands then she looked to the other side of the courtyard she saw mr ken glaring after shen ready for a fight she saw kuei turn towards her window and she darted back into the shadows party of progress todays events sunnima am s review of good dress high fashion see how info makes it

have taken to heart your kind advice of some months ago i have given this all the thought of which i am capable and i see so clearly how wise you are if balshang is imitating my native costumes they will take my business because americans will not see or care that we are real and balshang is not so i think our own people see america on tv and will want to look like america your house must be planning to sell good cheap clothes for households the ladies of my circle are good and cheap we will give you great deal on duplicate american houseclothes maybe your house or maybe even you yourself would be interested your friend chung mae email from office of meteorological investigation january dear madam chung we were pleased to receive your unusual offer to take readings for us in the kizuldah sector of the yeshibozkent villayet it is true that we have no regular records of weather from your locale however the standards we apply to data collection are very rigorous this data must then be interpreted via use of nconstant equations before our own database can make use of the information many thanks for your offer but we see little point in accepting it either from your point of view or ours bedri eyoobogloo email from the office of agricultural development january dear mrs chung we are pleased to be able to offer our local weather prediction system combined with our partner office of land surveying modelling package it offers an allinone solution for those seeking to predict weather and its impacts on particular geographies the licence fee is riels a year this includes an annual update full online support and smart helper installation as you are a taking wing initiative centre of progress we are also able to offer ten per cent discount we await your answer goksel kartal audio file from mr goksel kartal office of agricultural development january it is true that the system does not offer nconstant interpretation but it is very unusual for normal agricultural use to require such a sophisticated weather prediction system why would the happy province need to mesh data from balshang and beijing audio file from mr bedri eyoobogloo office of land use january madam chung you are quite correct the process you describe would meet our rigorous standards for data collection but are you sure you want to do it you are talking two hours work a day i think please understand i think maybe you have this wrong the government cannot pay you to do this work nor can we give you nconstant software you only pay the licence fee once but it is one thousand riels why are you doing this audio file from mrs chung mae january dear mr eyoobogloo i want to know about the weather we depend on land here and water and sun and all those things nconstant means chaos theory right that means that if i know patterns in balshang i know how they affect us right this is important because this winter we have high snowfall and warm temperatures in this meant a terrible flash flood it happened with the erjdha nefsi dragons breath hot wind from the northern desert from balshang you see audio file from miss soo ling january your message came at good time as i am considering setting up my own business i am replying in haste and will reply again at leisure your friend ling audio file from mrs chung mae january mr tunch my constant watcher i finally had the tv read out to me your article just to be clear i cannot read which is one great advantage i have over many people i move by my gut not my head but info has taught me that i have a very good head attached to a very good gut it gives me such secret pleasure to know that none of you understand air not you not your sistemlar not the un not the gates format not all you scientists and talents and politicians i know something you do not something i suspected but hid from you so i got the better of our deal so i make another deal with you mr tunch i will tell you this great thing i know if you get me the best most powerful most accurate software for weather forecasting with nconstant interpretation when you have done that for me i will tell you what air is and it will blow your world away yours with deepest affection chung mae audio file from mr hikmet tunch january mae mae my darling girl i think you have spent too much time in the hills you go crazy like an old trapper i know what you have to tell me in air gravity and thought are the same thing you know that because you seized hold of gravityasthought and used it to tear my metal fence to shreds when you decided to go home and you want to tell me that this can be an amazing weapon that we can use thoughtasgravity to tear whole cities apart i can tell you that we are already working on that you are a bright bright girl sorry about the deal but no deal your wise contender hikmet audio file from mrs chung mae january haha teehee that is the words of my laughter i am laughing at you you are foolish gangster in so many ways the universe is a diamond of love and whenever it decides to shine its light on us you foolish gangsters always always try to turn the light that illumines into the light that burns you take diamonds and turn them into knives to cut but you have failed havent you arrogant child it has not worked has it this great new weapon that works only by thought i know it will fail it will go on failing and since i am wise mother comforting arrogant child i will give away something for free after all i am selling info there is a thing called kwan tom no you see i have other sources of information than you i knew about eleven dimensions before i met you kwan tom says that the world around us and the things in it are only probable atoms go in two directions at once and then suddenly make up their minds many realities exist as probabilities only very very small well tearing fences is not a probability it is a miracle there have always been miracles mr tunch and they have always been small because they are not at all probable you try to make your terrible miracles big and probability will close over you as if your thoughts were stones thrown into a pond your thought will create ripples something almost happens and then the surface of what is probable closes over your weapon will never work i have no words or education i dont need them i turn that into freedom so i fly higher and deeper than you do into reality i can blow your foolish gangster world away and replace it with a better one give me nconstant software or i will keep laughing at you ha hee hee ha hee hee hee ha ha hee hee ha ha hee hee audio file from hikmet tunch january okay laugh the cost of the best nconstant and weather software is nothing to me i know you only want it to predict the weather my weather talent you will find the code for it attached to this file with a full licence to use and a help manual so come on then blow my world away your sceptical very rich friend hikmet agricultural development weather predictor audio reading january location school ridge drop wind velocity kph direction northnortheast air temperature c maybe okay plug in direct oh this is cold on the feet air temperature c air temperature with chill factor c temperature of snow on surface c temperature of snow at base c temperature of runoff c the village is all blue like a memory every morning i hear voices when i wake up the children wailing their mothers crying it is the flood if i am not careful i fall into air and i am there with it so it is good to come out here weather talent on my night patrol the cold roots me in the now the flood will come this year or next whatever ah this is the worst bit right down into the muck maybe i find an onion left behind something for the pot soil temperature c i can really feel these stones these terraces they want to roll they want to roll down and flatten us at least all this is solid info keeps me sane there has always been a flood washing us all away indeed mrs tung my dear indeed the flood look across the valley on the mirror hill you will see what is left of the village of aynalar mirrors it is a mirror for you in the whole hillside was wiped away in one night by a flash flood when all the snow melted too fast once the terraces of aynalar were rich and fertile it was on the sunny slope of the valley and kizuldah was the poor cousin in shade now aynalar is a heap of rocks this happened during a winter of high snowfall and hot temperatures this winter is another mirror a mirror of that winter you have seen me every morning and every evening i go and measure snow three times a day i measure many things temperature and wind and strength of sunlight through cloud i am in touch with many government offices to calculate info so far we are okay it will need to be hotter than even for the flood to come here you will know the flood is coming if the dragons breath happens in winter see these pictures they show our village if the water melts it shows how deep the water will get and where you should go dont go to the school big rocks will roll down from the terraces there and it could get buried everyone should get to mr wings house it is highest on an outcrop of stone those in the valley like you mr han move your seed grain now there wont be time when the flood comes move things into your lofts if all else fails if the flood comes get onto your roofs i will tell you the situation every day madam chung mae audio file from mrs chung mae january whooooooooooooo mr tunch that is the sound of my breath blowing you away everything in air is eternal no so i ask myself how can we make the imprints how can we change something that is eternal nothing new can happen there so i think if we are in air at all we have always been there these imprints you make of us have always been there and then i think so how do i get back to mrs tungs life when i saw the flood that destroyed the village of aynalar i was really there the water was icy i swallowed mud i felt my child i mean mrs tungs snatched away from me by the water i was in mrs tungs life sometimes i look up over kizuldah and i see great floating balloons or hotels that do not exist and i am not crazy i am simply seeing the future through my airself i nip in and out of time like a mite living in a sponge i just go through the holes ah but then guess what else i have found with my nipping everything lives in air mr tunch everything is in our balloon world and in air at once that means stones flowers and birds and floods and funerals that means everything is eternal mr tunch that means we have always had airselves if we live in air at all then we have always lived there from the beginning we have always been able to sometimes see the future or the past we have always been able to make tiny miracles any child knows that many women do it seem that only great big gangsters do not everything has always been and has always happened all at once which means nothing causes anything else which means stories only happen in this poor balloonworld of ours stories have no meaning nothing can be interpreted everything just is without meaning without needing your philosophy and your science or all our miseries and myths and tales and explanations it is all just one big smiling now whooooooooooooooooo that is the sound of air blowing chapter mae came back from her morning weather talent patrol and found kwan and sunni sitting at her kitchen table the house was chilly the brazier burntout siao was out selling info services good morning ladies said mae pleased to see her friends good morning mae said kwan her hands steepled on the table sunni nodded eyes averted kwan asked how long have you been out oh for two hours now when did you go to bed kwan asked oh i had a lot of mail you see we tell all customers to be patient with us for we are snowbound and cannot ship until after march some of them find that interesting and write and i try to answer kwan held up yesterdays leaflet did you run out the weather reports then too mae was unwinding her scarf oh no i do that now in the mornings before the circle i would offer you tea but i have drunk all my winter stock they didnt want tea mae sat down with them and began to wonder why they were there did you really tell mrs pin that you know there will be a flood because you have been to the future kwans face looked burnished like wood hard not in those words but yes kwan and sunni looked at each other sunni asked do you really believe that mae found herself adopting a fortified position feet braced on the earthen floor when you have been in air for a while you will see it is true air is forever in both directions forward and back kwan drew in a breath and said you are saying that you have actually been into the future and stood in the coming flood here in kizuldah i have been in my future life i suddenly find myself in my future life sometimes it is in the flood there will be a flood and that is why i warn people kwan uncrumpled the leaflet in her hand and read it again mae we want you to stop worrying people sunni picked up the thread it is foolish people are bored with it they say if this is what working with info does then let mae drive herself crazy with it we will leave it alone kwan finished it hurts progress mae sunni sighed as your friends we are going to ask you to stop no no no these were her friends this was a simple misunderstanding mae began to explain the flood temperature and snow she stood up got out her printouts all elevation lines and water flow it was hard practical stuff kwan chuckled in exasperation honestly mae if you do this one more time to me i will scream i have heard what you have to say about the flood can i tell you what it sounds like mae that you are afraid not of the flood but of the future all this talk of wiping everything away that is what air will do not the flood everyone sees you as a woman who is scared but cannot admit it and is driving herself and everyone else crazy added sunni kwan sighed it reminds everyone that you have mrs tung inside you it reminds them of the first disaster that test it just makes them think all progress is madness and i am the crazy adulteress woman and i am an embarrassment to you i didnt think i was but i am the two women looked at each other something was clinched mae said kwan we want you to stop working take time out to sleep eat relax leave the circle to us leave the new screens for the site to someone else stop going out all over the hills pretending to be a weatherman also said kwan there is a lady from yeshiboz sistemlar called fatimah who has told us about the pregnancy sunni leaned forward with concern for heavens sake mae get rid of it you know what i am talking about fatimah says it will kill you the whole room started to buzz it was as if the walls were full of hornets mae felt herself go dim and old and she was frightened and alone left upstairs all day too weak to walk far wanting to talk wanting to be heard always told you are too old gran dont tax yourself stay still stay quiet you will be dead soon and even quieter dont do this said mae in a very quiet distracted voice half hers half mrs tungs dont leave me alone kwan leaned forward and took her hand thats exactly what we will not do mae we are your friends and we will always stand by you sunni took her hand as well yes mae we have had disagreements in the past but we have overcome them listen to your friends we do this out of concern for you kwans eyes were firm we think it is best if you just leave the tv alone for a while said sunni until you are well and rested again mae you should see yourself you look like a ghost your face is thin your eyes stare your hair is like a witchs you who were the most elegant woman in the village said sunni you need help said kwan with finality and chuckled sunni you need to leave that thing alone you need a rest from the tv said kwan again determined dont do this to me mae repeated her friends her friends who had stood by her who had not deserted her why were they doing this now let siao do the screens for mr pin and the others maybe you could go to balshang stay with your son have tea with your new friend miss soo have you ever seen the capital no said mae arms folded there you go sunni lifted up her arms as if everything were evident settled maybe we could all go together i would love to see the big city my work is here said mae the road is closed what business is any of this of yours come and live with me again for a while mae please said kwan no said mae i am happy living here with my family kwan leaned forward her voice flat mae she demanded come with us i am happy as i am said mae they tried for a further fifteen minutes cajoling tugging on her arm offering her tea saying she had worked harder than anyone and that she had won she had succeeded all the village was learning was the village not a centre of progress everyone knew that it was because of her but even strong branches break when the load is too great said sunni everything they said availed nothing they had stopped talking about making her stop work or taking away her baby but that was what they intended finally sour made angry and defeated kwan and sunni left mae sat still until she was sure they were gone then she locked and barred her door she thought about what kwan might do next if she were determined enough mae conferenced mr oz yes yes hello its always a pleasure look i need a wireless account of my own for my tv mr oz sounded relaxed and cheerful away from the road that should be easy enough just call the telephone company its urgent i need it done today today i dont know you used to have a mobile phone didnt you you could try calling them why is there a problem with swallow communications lets just say i just have a suspicion that kwan might develop account problems she might cut mae off mr oz groaned why was he upset he was not the one with the problem youve got extendable credit with the bank make sure they know that have the bank references ready make sure you have your phone account number and everything about your tv its a hitachi pdtv okay and mae whats wrong mae thought for a moment about future and past and then said i am too far ahead of them then she conferenced sloop at his desk at the telephone company his round face glistened and he chuckled there is no problem we like new business i need it done today she said sloop blinked today it was complicated mae would have to download her new id from their servers sloop would have to talk her through the process of reconfiguration she was at work on that when kwan and sunni came back they hammered on the door mae dont be ridiculous open this door mae why are you leaving swallow communications mae looked out from her attic skylight she looked down on them shuffling in front of her bolted door they had mr wing with them sunnis voice was shrill mae we are your friends we are trying to help mr wing chortled mae if we wanted to cut you off it would be just as easy to cut the power kwans voice was like a knife shushing him in anger mae unlatched her window i have my own account i have my own food i have my own family i will carry on my business and i will continue to tell people about the flood kwan puffed out air you will end up damaging the thing you want to save sunni stepped forward mae at least go to see doctors about that baby thank you for shouting my business all over the valley said mae she latched the skylight shut and went back to work mae no one wants to hurt you sunni called mae heard kwan murmur i think were just making things worse mae turned again to her beautiful screens and the messengers like birds there was another knocking at the door mrs chungmaam someone called it was sezen and maes response was what now she went to the trapdoor suddenly it looked a long way down to the kitchen floor mae didnt want to move she wanted to stay in her loft above the floodwaters with her machine please let me in sezen called a thought of mrs tungs seemed to breathe through mae we all end up alone with no one understanding mae went back to the tv she watched as her morning weather data uploaded to balshang there were footsteps on the roof mae heard boots skidding on stone tiles mae this is sezen said a voice from above get away you silly girl you will fall and kill yourself said mae im not one of them mae i wouldnt do that to you what did they say the voice through the stone tiles was as clear as if sezen were in the room they want me to stop working they want to take everything away from me and they say they want to help me tuh typical you are a wild woman and dont wait for them to approve what you do you go too far too fast they want to kill my baby said mae her voice thickening with rage that bloody woman in the city has been trying to kill my baby all along and she has been writing to kwan dont you worry mae sezen will never let you down ah we are wild women together what do you need me to do get down off that roof before you kill yourself sezen laughed the view is lovely up here okay i am holding on to the crest of the roof so i cannot fall so what do you need me to do mae considered she considered being accosted alone in the fields surrounded by socalled friends she considered all the hours she worked she considered the baby in her belly made of fire she considered the undoubted truth that she was doing too much above all else she considered the village i need you to help collect info mae said info about snow mae someone shouted what is going on sezen giggled you have shut out siao siao hold on is there anyone with you for just a moment mae imagined that they might be with siao for just a moment that siao might even have joined them i want lunch he shouted back mae went down and let him in sezen joined them grinning as mae raged pacing her own kitchen in fury siao and sezen caught each others eyes and mimed ducking so i got a new wireless account my machine is up in the loft i dont need them good said siao with a mild smile you have needed to be independent of kwan for a while dont worry eh if they cut off the electricity i know how to get it going again ill put printout through doors whatever mae hugged him in gratitude and he kissed the top of her head they hung together for a just a moment as if in outer space then they remembered sezen was there she made a mysterious and somehow knowing gesture holding up both hands palms out in the evening an email arrived from mr ken he had keyed it in not spoken it so he must not have wanted to be overheard it came from sunnis machine if you are in trouble i will help you know that please call on me to help but please also tell me what is this about a baby by all the stars she hadnt told him she had not told kuei about his child the room seemed suddenly colder her cheeks burned she could hear siao below in the kitchen cooking dinner for her the metal spoon tinged against the wok siao was humming a song mae what are you doing chapter it was chinese new year and mae was alone kwan was having a party after everything that had happened mae would not attend why should she to be argued at cajoled and entreated something was up with siao he had come back from the teahouse looking distracted he tore off the top of his thumbnail with his teeth kissed mae on the cheek and told her not to worry then he was gone in young mr pins car old mr chung shuffled and shrugged and then left early perhaps embarrassed for a gathering of old village reprobates like himself mae had hoped at least to share some warm rice wine at new years with her family with siao whenever she talked to siao she always got good sense she always felt secure she didnt own him if he wanted to go off and have fun okay he wasnt married he must need a woman and perhaps he hoped to find one and ah mae that is it that is why your hands tumble over themselves round and round that is why you cannot sit still you see another woman coming into the house and that disturbs you but more than that you see another woman with siao mae what has happened here sit down mae and look at your hands what do they tell you they tell you want to look into his calm honest bluegrey eyes you want to see his smooth lean arms with the silky skin that mixes karzistan with china you want to hear his deep measured voice you wish he were here you wish you were with him mae put her head into her hands oh mae mae mae mae what is this mae stood up from the kitchen table i want him to work with me we work well together he understands the things i understand he is even better than me at selling he is better than me at understanding what all this new stuff is for yes mae and what else i want to hold him i want to give him a home i want to show him the respect his stupid brother never gave him i want him to know that someone sees how smart he is how kind how patient how wise oh mae you are in love with your husbands brother well it is traditional the husband dies the brother can take over but when the husband just goes off when the husband goes off because the wife went with his nextdoor neighbour and when she is about to have the nextdoor neighbours child oh mae the knots you tie if you were scandalous before what will you be after this and poor siao suppose he feels nothing for you but kindness what will he feel if you declare yourself you will be trapped together in the house you see each other halfnaked nearly every day he has to think of his brother he has to be neighbours with mr ken oh mae nobody needs this mae if you go after your husbands brother you really will lose everything maybe you really have gone mad but once given its proper name the feeling would not go away i love his little beard i love the way it makes his teeth shine out when he smiles i love the slow way he moves i love the way he turns everything around stands it on its head and it makes more sense that way my god i love his body i love his mind when did it change when did i notice as if in passing that he was also handsome when did he wake up and start to speak or rather when did i begin listening to him mae leave this you dont like being alone thats all being alone at new years is making me jealous i do not like being the crazy lady of the village i do not like being where i am i am not madam owl i am not mrs disruption and i wish all this would stop i want peace i want quiet mae went up to the loft to work the moment she woke up the tv it was invaded the screen was cleared and there was kwan mae kwan said her living room ghostly behind her mae reached forward to restart please dont go we must talk realtime open other channel the picture was torn in half and there on her machine uninvited and full of concern was fatimah of yeshiboz sistemlar hello mae she said mae felt herself go cold fatimah i told you once before that you would find it impossible to do good said mae it is nothing to do with who you are it is your job mae please listen said kwan this woman is a doctor nurse she kept me prisoner fatimah looked so sweet madeup groomed oh shes wearing white that gives her the right to kill peoples children mrs chung there is no chance of it coming to term it could kill you oh so it is by no means certain i will die fatimah sighed not if we could get you into a hospital kwans arms were folded it was the posture she adopted whenever she struggled against other peoples stupidity she is trying to help save both of you mae mae said fatimah sounding conciliatory come to us in a hospital stay with us okay maybe i will go and stay in a hospital in may maybe the whole month is that good enough for you goodbye mae unplugged the machine and detached the battery the screen image collapsed as if punctured all communication would be broken and the invasive code disabled she pushed the battery back in and a fresh clear screen came up she downloaded her written mail her machine was invaded again the image interlaced in stages this is rude crashing in on me like this said mae you are still distributing paper said kwan fixing her eye on her you are still telling people no flood just yet but more snow and it will come i had old mrs nan in here yesterday asking if i could keep her goats in my loft its the safest place for them said mae since no one is taking any steps to save people maybe the goats will at least survive the flood why are you having the child kwan demanded why did you have yours do you think its some kind of magic sign kwan demanded still beautiful little aging pouches of loose flesh under the determined mouth mae thrust out her jaw yes she said since you phrase it that way kwans eyes widened momentarily look kwan i am doing this weather work the weather is all tied up together but not like we think we think that everything that happens has a cause that i strike with a knife and that causes a cut but sometimes a cut happens somewhere else too without a cause sometimes things happen because the world is held together by patterns things that are alike so there are signs and portents kwan chose her words you believe your child is a sign so is the flood said mae kwan looked momentarily defeated she wilted a little and ran her hand over her forehead you really have been working too hard my baby is lodged in my stomach it will be born out of my mouth you know why mr tunch wants my baby dead because he thinks my child is a portent too mae said kwan in despair listen to yourself please you sound like some superstitious old woman from one hundred years ago i am one said mae kwan shook her head everything is changing and my baby is part of everything you know what fatimah does she helps makes intelligent talking dogs one of them helped me escape his name was ling how is that for karz people ah they always give their dogs chinese names a talking intelligent dog and it asked asked to be put back as a dog kwans face was shaking slightly from side to side you really have gone mae she sighed who has gone you threaten me you break into my machine are you going to break down my door are you going to drag me off into the night kwan did not answer her face said whatever is necessary to help you her words said something else mae you can believe any nonsense that you like but you must shut up because your nonsense is stopping the very thing you believe in most progress mae i cannot tell people this is a good thing when you are being driven crazy ah so you are not concerned about me really kwan scratched her hair delicately i am concerned about many things including you so how are you going to stop me talking shen couldnt you are so concerned about progress is it progress to start bossing people around like the government the government thinks you are nonsense kwan who saved you then you then leave me alone kwan looked very determined i am going to return the favour mae i am not one to give up on a friend it was kwan who cut off communication this time mae was left quaking with rage who was kwan to tell her what to do to tell her what to say to tell her to get rid of her baby kwan you have been important in the village too long you have come to think of yourself as head woman she read her mail email from mr ken kuei february dear mae happy new year email gets easier all the time it reminds me of when i learned to ride a bicycle suddenly for no reason you can do it i wish though that i had learned from you since these messages can go round the world i thought i would send one an even greater distance across our courtyard audio file from lieutenant chung lung february tsang has left dad i knew trouble was coming when she started to lose weight and wear black and took even more trouble with her grooming she got a job with some crook of an estate developer she would talk in front of dad about all the opportunities he was offering her dinner with clients she thought she had become a balshang beauty she was always a very stupid woman she used to be falsely fond of dad but at least she would praise him in front of the officers suddenly all that stopped she started to say things to make dad look like a fool and he would sit with that hazy grin of his looking really foolish this drove my sister ying crazy she said she would not be in the same room with tsang tsang was very bitter about me too oh but then asian women are not good enough for you so you want to leave kizuldah so far behind like you i said back is this boss of yours married so finally she has gone off with her gangster and dad is alone he wants to come and live here with me i cant have him mama i have to entertain officers here it really is not possible he came here two nights ago when the colonel was visiting with us dad was drunk and he was weeping and cursing tsang and cursing you and cursing life and looked like a real peasant i tried to keep him under control i said he could stay the night if he wanted to sarah tried to take him into the kitchen and he threw off her hands and started calling her a western whore and he started telling me that i thought i was a big man now but i wouldnt when my western wife found out i had a small cock all this in front of my colonel truly awful i know he was upset but really he cannot behave in this way neither i nor ying has heard anything from him for two days i will try to visit him after work today i will let you know what happens email from mr bedri eyoobogloo february mae thanks for data the attached file shows what happens when we run it against whats happening here you are getting more snow because it is warmer there is more evaporation which then falls on the higher slopes we get dragons breath when an inversion over the desert is suddenly pushed south by a cold front coming down from the north usually this happens in summer when the air has baked it is usually in massive single movements we have an inversion now it is degrees celsius in balshang we are getting little dragons mustafa here calls them dragon sneezes whirls of cold coming down in spiral patterns making very hot blasts very localized the front itself is not moving nor the inversion however this is the foundation situation your data is going patchy and that disappoints us your assistant sezen is no substitute for you mae opened the attached file and entered it into her own database she stood up and looked through her skylight it was snowing heavily it was so warm the flakes seemed to have cohered into lumps almost as if someone were throwing snowballs or marshmallows she told her machine calculate the chances of a flood chance of flood this is the last warning i can

house and knocked on his door his mother opened it old mrs ken glared at mae she was a plump overworked woman in her sixties sweaty with hair astray mae did not give her a chance to speak the

nothing mrs ken tore up the paper calmly neatly i will put this where it belongs she said i am carrying your grandchild said mae and left having no more time to waste mae was wrestling with the courtyard gate and heard footsteps dont mind mother she is still upset said mr ken his face was phosphorescentblue from snowlight and outlined in gold im used to it said mae it seemed as if ken kuei

faithful man yes she said and then hedged probably probably he said disappointed move please please her eyes and her voice were pleading of course i need help with this please help mr ken nodded serious solemn not entirely bright but good he stepped out of the gate and turned up lower street mae found herself gazing at his broad silent back oh god she thought i love him too she turned and walked northeast she climbed up the hill to sezens house she pounded on the door sezi sezi its me mae hatijah opened the door looking nervous but pleased to see her patron at new years the courtyard goat began to bleat at the disturbance hello hatijah fiftyfifty chance of a flood so this is the last of my paper sezen hopped in pulling on a boot mrs chungmaam are you going to kwans party no and

tell your boyfriend he is enough to put people off their food and to dress himself sezen giggled weve just been fucking this is not a joke sezen maes voice was raised in warning look the whole point of being wild is to have more style not less sezen swallowed her grin embarrassed yes mae was right what can you expect with my home background better replied mae move already the warm snow had filled in her footprints mae struggled farther up the hill to the school where teacher shen lived she pounded on the door why why did no one ever answer she pounded again yes inquired sulois voice suloi please open up just for a moment i am so sorry to intrude the little room beside the schoolhouse was full of candlelight and smelled of wine suloi was all smiles but a screen had been pulled across the entrance and behind it her husband snored hello mae happy new year are you going to the party tonight she wished everything was normal she wished everyone could be friends mae passed her the paper in silence oh said suloi disappointed she looked trapped ashamed im not saying necessarily only fiftyfifty suloi looked sad are you going to everyone in the village with this of course said mae what do you think that i would leave anyone out i know you mean well mae suloi sighed mae you know what people used to do to eldritch women cast them out said mae into the snow said suloi unless they told the truth said mae i must go happy new year suloi said quietly and went back to her snoring husband mae marched down the hill to the first house on upper street the okans were an old couple all their children and grandchildren had moved to town they were delighted to receive company happy new year they chorused and hobbled forward with the warm wine they were not sharing with anyone this is so kind madam okan said toothlessly under her best coloured headscarf mae did not have the heart to make them feel deserted at the new year so she sat with them and sipped the warm wine and itched to be away throughout sitting up straight on the diwan she sits so prettily said mrs okan relax sit back drink with us said mr okan allah forgives on this day and besides it is not made from grape eh he winked his skin like old stained leather shrunk onto bones they began to talk about children grandchildren even greatgrandchildren photographs a tumble of babies and babies who now sat babies of their own on their laps if began mae if you hear a funny noise tonight oh new years we dont mind the noise there could be a flood mae said if there is a flood you need to get to kwans their smiles faded they grew confused mae tried to explain mrs okans heart plainly sank mae had not come to be social she had come because there was some kind of trouble it was good when someone came because there was trouble but even nicer when someone came to have fun they nodded and tried to smile but their little glasses were lowered mae felt awful for them how are we to get to mr wings said mr okan smiling with a shrug i can only shuffle he moved his slippered feet back and forth and his wife of fifty years chuckled and put a hand on his arm how indeed i have to go said mae at the door the okans chorused how nice to see you happy new year on impulse mae leaned forward and kissed them both ohho mr okan joked i have a new girlfriend next door was mr and mrs ali mrs ali opened the door looking sour you know why i have come said mae and passed one of her papers i fear i do said mrs ali sunnis old ally is that all you have to say to me happy new year said mae say hello to sunni for me ali

took maes hand and pulled her inside her house was full of people her large family the lings the soongs and the pings our favourite madwoman said mrs doh and crumpled a paper hat onto maes head oh look another piece of paper from our mae you just stop work and get drunk like us said young mr doh and thrust some rice wine into her hand the radiocassette was on and the younger people were dancing young miss doh wiggled up took all of maes papers from her and made her join the dancing circle mae danced and calculated this party had saved her having to visit three other houses she warned young miss doh who was pressed next to her in the circle the main danger on upper street will be rocks falling from the terraces houses like yours will take the full force of them you must leave everything stop said young miss doh have fun life is short mae allowed herself one dance then she cut everything off with a nod of her head got her papers back and left mae climbed up and over the steep arch of their bridge the next house belonged to hasan muhammed mae swallowed hard and knocked on his door it was answered promptly tsangs deserted husband stood clean pressed and proud he carried his young son in his arms yes he asked his head held back away as if from a bad odour mr muhammedsir i am sorry to intrude just in case mae held out a paper towards him he didnt take it he pondered her for a moment and then shifted his child to the other arm i already have everything in the loft he said entirely serious when it comes we shall all go directly to the house of mr wing me and my children someone believed her you are well prepared said mae she took hold of the little boys foot and held it bad things happen said mr muhammed as both of us know too well keep an ear listening happy new year he merely nodded and closed the door thank you mr muhammed she added facing the blank door she turned and began to walk up towards the atakoloos as she came around the corner of her brothers house she came upon a group of people struggling up lower street there she is said kwan a flashlight darted over maes face making her squint the wings sunni and mr haseem strode towards her mae said mr wing this has got to stop they all wore waterproofs kwan neat slim and in black was in front of them all with papers in hand we mean it mae are those my papers mae demanded kwan was nearly up to her are those my papers you are not going to make a fool of yourself on new years now give me the rest mae felt fury you give me that paper who said you could have that paper we took it from sezen if you must know she spat at us but i expect no better from her give us the paper mae it is not your paper it is my paper kwan nodded over her shoulder i am sorry mae you cant go around spoiling everyones new year with these fantasies sunni hiding behind kwan said over her shoulder mae you are a traitor to yourself with this foolishness wing and haseem came towards her you keep your hands off me mae warned kwan shook her head i am sorry it has come to this mae but the madness must stop we are friends no longer warned mae again that is your choice mae was hugging her leaflets the last of her papers to her breast wing already had grasped them come on mae dont make it worse said wing your friendly madwoman chuckled mr haseem please mae sunni wheedled i have no friends said mae in a small voice jerking away from mr wing mr haseem took her arms mae doubled over to clench the papers to herself fire burned in her belly wing reached around her this really is getting us nowhere mr wing said still neat still smiling mae began to yell they are stealing from me they are robbing me thieves help the paper was shiny so that messages could be burned cheaply onto it it was slippery and it began to slide now sezen jumei siao help jumei fire shot out of her fire like dragons breath and she turned and let them have it fiery juices shot out of her burning stomach and over mr haseems face ah he yelped and backed way god she spat at me mae said kwan rolling her eyes shaking her head she looked at sunni she just gets worse her and sezen sunni shrugged it burns it really burns yelped sunnis husband the acids gnawed at his skin and mae froze for she was indeed beginning to believe in sympathetic magic dragons breath oh god what if ive helped it happen suddenly wing was shaking her mae enough he got the papers there is a fiftyfifty chance said mae in a weak voice im not saying it must happen im saying it could im saying we must be prepared kwan looked at her with something like sympathy im sorry mae if you feel like coming to the party later you will be very welcome she must be like a nuclear furnace inside said mr haseem wiping his face with a handkerchief im trying to digest my baby said mae a little stupid from everything that had happened they left her she listened to the falling snow the front door of the wangs house opened in the warm light stood her brother jumei mae what is going on he asked oh jumei they have taken the last of my papers and there is a good chance of a flood come in come and get warm he said he gave her rice wine he had a new little clock of which he was very proud mae relented and toasted the new year as her brothers prosperous little clock chimed she ignored the sounds of a party at kwans and very slightly tipsy went back down lower street maybe it wont happen theres a good chance it wont happen she thought she got home siao was still not there she pulled herself up into her loft and dragged a heavy trunk over the trapdoor she opened up the connection more mail audio file from lieutenant chung lung february so what has happened now is even worse i think dad has gone back to you i went to his room and he was not there mum balshang is a mess the place has roads and pipes for a million people and no one knows how many have come here between nine and sixteen million i had not seen his place before mum there was a lagoon of sewage behind it all his things were gone there was no sign of breakfast just one very old dirty plate with hard food on it that may mean he has been gone some days he has no money so must be hitching he may think he will be able to get back to you through the snow he is beside himself with despair i dont think he even cares about getting through the snow i think right now he probably wants to die i thought i should warn you if he turns up here with me or my sister i will let you know try under the circumstances to have a good new year what else thought mae her spirits and her body sagged what else can possibly happen she turned off her machine she pulled out the mattress and laid it on the plywood sheet that rested between the slats of her floor the roof was the thinnest part of the house if the flood came she would hear it and if it did not thank god she turned out the light chapter sweat woke mae up she sat up in the dark suddenly wideawake and gasping for breath she had been dreaming of the flood she had heard it the spreading crash of water and stone she listened everything was silent and still but she was soaked with sweat the air it was hot hot as summer as hot as those nights when you have to sleep outside she heard a rustling in the eaves like something breathing erjdha nefsi mae threw off the covers and stood up listening very faint under the sound of moving air was a sound as if the hills were being tickled she switched on the light and looked at the tv fortyfive degrees centigrade wake up mae told the tv she threw on old jeans rubber boots and a light coat she strapped on a rucksack filled with blankets and tins of food she jerked the trapdoor out of its socket and dropped the bag down to the kitchen floor below siao she called siao are you there there was no answer if siao had gone down the hill and was in a house or a cafe he might be all right if he was on the road when it hit mae did not have time for imaginings she spun back around and sent an audio file bedri its fortyfive celsius the erjdha is breathing and i can hear the meltdown i dont know if its flood or not but please tell people if it is at the worst we will need help its fourthirty am now and i need to store battery power so im sending this off and leaving dont bother replying i wont be here if its bad ill be at kwans mae pushed the machine off and lowered herself through the trapdoor badly scraping her forearm she could hear her breath rattling like gamblers dice she dropped to the floor and hauled back the curtains to siaos alcove old mr chung slept quietly smiling he smelled of rice wine mae called him and shook him mr chungsir mr chung she dragged him blinking out of sleep its here mr chung its here the flood get up he had fallen onto the bed fully clothed mae knelt and jammed his feet into string shoes come mr chung come she rattled him out of the house into the courtyard under the stars the hot wind had blasted the sky clean everything was hot and clear she explained to mr chung that siao was still down the hill he must get to mr wings big house then mae pounded on the door of the kens kuei kuei old mrs ken get up get up erjdha nefsi the window overhead was thrown open wood clunked against the wall silhouetted against the whitewash was mr kens mother hissing go away you madwoman my son is asleep take your fancies and go feel the wind feel the air its hot its nearly fire it is here mae thought i dont have time for this or for you mr ken ken kuei wake up its come said a voice this is what it was like mae began to feel a kind of panic ken kuei you said you would help the air is like fire and the water moves the earth mr chung suddenly said ill be back the old man trotted away bowlegged towards the barn mr chung we have to go mr chungs voice had an unexpected edge i cant leave my tools oh no mae held her head she shouted to them all we all have to leave here now our court is in a very bad position both rocks and water will wash here nobody must stay here and suddenly old mrs tung spoke calling mrs ken by her childhood name ting do as you are told no more nonsense even as a little girl all you ever wanted to do was stay inside the house ive told you and told you what happened last time the flood is here darling daughter you will have to leave this house at the window old mrs kens face fell hot wind buffeted the shutters someone touched maes arm bringing her back im here said mr ken mae gasped recalled to herself shes with me shes using my voice mr ken put an arm around her and kissed the top of her head i will get your fatherinlaw to safety he promised and your mother and the okans mae swung her bag higher up her shoulder mr ken smiled amused is there anything else they started to walk towards the gate yes start yelling happy new year mae saw him smiling moonlight making him look young and merry okay she admitted i love him old mr chung returned with his bag of tools he bowed and greeted mr ken sweetly happy new year ken swung open the courtyard gate for her his smile cracked wider and he started to bellow as if in a childs game happy new year the flood is here mae joined in this is no joke the snows are melting he looked up into her face you know dont you that he loved her yes she said yes yes i do now lets go mae turned left down lower street get everyone up to mr wings she shouted again to them both and began to run the air pulsed as if there was something huge and hot and alive breathing down the back of her neck mae shouted as she ran dragons breath wake up wake up already down the cobbled slope of lower street water ran in a current her feet made plashing sounds and her thick boots clunked on the uneven stones she tripped and knocked her wrist against the side of mr kemals house her plan was to get to the mosque to use the pa to warn everyone she turned up the slope towards sezens inshallah gasped mae in hot starlight she saw already the snow from this lower slope was gone mae ran up the hill slipping on a glossy surface of mud and moss the ground creaked with water as if it were an overfull barrel where her feet did not shoot backwards out from under her they sank into mud mae shuffled sideways to one of the usual runoffs as she had hoped it was gravelled swept clean it was also ankledeep in racing water mae struggled up the slope against the current sezen she shouted sezen flood ahead of her on the hillside a light went on the wet slope reflected electric light like a field of broken mirrors the door opened madam chung said a hesitant voice hatijah leaned out of the doorway her husband looming behind her mae stopped and windmilled her arms for balance against the current hatijah called sezen has already left she goes to wake the people of the marsh oh she is a good girl said mae she has become one said hatijah you what are you doing get to kwans get moving now those terraces will be full of water the walls will break we wanted to wait for sezen mae felt a familiar stab of exasperation she struggled up and out of the ditch hatijah sezen is not your mother for heavens sake you have other children get them out of here now now now sezen has packed your bags i know just take them and leave hatijah was weeping we cant leave our goat she said inshallah mae relented of course you cant it is all your familys wealth but edrem please tell her life is more important than money let the goat go perhaps it can save itself edrems silhouette tall skinny and slow murmured to his wife we must go mae started to struggle higher up the hill to the shens she shouted as she walked edrem i rely on you you take the children hatijah the bags okay okay and leave your lights on we will all need light mae struggled up the hill leaning on her hands the hillside was sheathed in water a solid rippling sheet that was seasoned with tiny cutting flints the stones sizzled against her fingers like fat on a stove my god the whole hillside is moving all around her suspended in the air was a sound like sighing a rushing sound of water in a hundred thousand streams it was a terrible sound huge and gentle at the same time vast as a world as if mae had heard the world for the first time thats it thats the sound unexpectedly the ground flattened and mae stumbled forward she was at the schoolhouse already the dusty playground was a polished lake reflecting the childrens swings water poured out from one corner of the school as if from the spout of a pitcher mae waded to the door and pounded teacher shen teacher shen the door seemed to bounce open mae felt another hot breath but not the dragons moist weepy there was suloi her face sticky with tears he wont come mae she said and shook herself into sobs mae hugged her sister from the circle what do you mean a voice out of the darkness like the darkness growled there will be no flood it is foolishness oh shen dont believe me but believe the water look at the ground shen please come something wavered in the darkness as if it were coiled legless there will be no flood suloi backed away he will not leave mae pleaded shen come outside you can hear it the snows are melting and the snows will run off as they have for two thousand years do you think those machines of yours can change the world do you think you can hold back a flood how by teaching it arithmetic maes voice broke with fury the darkness the despair finally uncoiled and stood up it cocked a rifle the gun clicked in the darkness i will not have scandalous filth such as you telling my family what to do said despair who once had been called happiness go mae whispered suloi and gave mae an invisible loving push shen growled we stay here where we belong mae pulled suloi to her hugged her whispered in her ear run in the dark then she pulled back and ran and called over her shoulder live the hills were laughing there was a giggling sound thousands of chuckles as the water shook itself over rocks down gullies it slapped its way across the rock faces of the terraces mae skittered down the slope to the square box of the mosque that had the publicaddress system mounted on its gable she came to the door she rattled it the sound beyond was hollow it was locked who locks a mosque its never been locked mae had calculated she knew it would take three hours to rouse each house in turn mae was near tears she had planned and planned but she had never planned that the mosque would be locked she would have to run to mr shenyalar the muerain he would have the keys at least it was downhill she turned and let the water and gravity carry her mae staggered and slid down the hill she skittered through the space between the alis and the dohs she got tangled in old rusting bedding that someone had discarded the springs made a merry sproing sound as she pulled her feet free she half fell onto the cobbles of upper street and spun herself into the concave frontage of the house of the doh family mae shouted up at the shuttered windows old mrs doh all dohs wake up wake up there is a flood there is a flood she had danced with them only hours before please wake up new year and everyone will be asleep drunk exhausted happy mae spun away onto the bridge the little river roared enveloping the arch in mist that stroked maes face and danced happily into her lungs over the stone balustrade moonlit rapids shot white and hot and fierce down the gully mae remembered the ducks the geese already they were a memory already washed away below the village square looked like an ocean all glinting waves on the other side of the bridge there was a huge puddle even here on upper street a pocket of the road was flooded mae plunged down from the bridge and water poured in over the tops of her boots even now the village was still asleep still dark flood flood she shouted suddenly a flashlight flared around the corner of the back of the hajs house mae this way said a voice it was her brother weve got mother up at the wings ive just been down to lower street jumei i need to get to the shenyalars good this is the way down here mae waded towards him the water above her knees jumei reached forward and grabbed her arm together they threshed their way down the rocky gap between the house of the haj and his neighbours the alley was like a water garden all ferns and waterfalls mae and jumei fell into lower street as if plunging into a river the current nearly swept them away it poured around the corner of jumeis house rucking up like bedding white as sheets across the street was the muerains tall stone house with its bronze plaque clinging to each other jumei and mae crossed the torrent it made them trip downstream as if dancing they crammed themselves into the porch of the al gamas house to brake holding on to the rough walls they pulled themselves upstream as if up a cliff something crackled mae turned to see the hajs straw outhouse spin out into the current and down into the square the square was a lake the villages one streetlight glowed golden on waves rocking against the front doors of the kosals and the masuds the outhouse roof like a straw hat swirled away on the current the surface of the water roiled as if full of serpents jumei pulled mae into the doorway of the shenyalars he pounded mae howled muerain muerain shenyalar oh please please open please wake up oh muerain muerain why why didnt they move they were religious karz they did not drink they did not celebrate the new year why didnt they hear there is a flood muerain please wake up from somewhere down in the valley came a terrible spreading crash as if someone had dropped a dresser full of china the sound of breakage rolled settled and then shushed to a halt the small terraces below the village were falling collapsing into the waters the houses of the pins and the chus where sezen was mae was spurred by terror shenyalar wake up oh please wake up a shutter moved who is it mrs shenyalar it is chung mae listen did you hear that noise yes yes indeed the flood is here mrs shenyalar can your husband come with me can he come and open up the mosque so we can use the publicaddress wait there mrs chung said the wife jumei began to shout at the other houses mr al gama the hajsir mrs nan a light went on at mrs nans mrs nan get up get your things go mae shouted at the light the door of the shenyalars opened oh muerain mae cried in relief inshallah breathed out the muerain he had taken time the foolish man to dress in his religious robes he saw the river and its surging current and the new lake at the foot of the streetlight he heard the roar he turned and looked at mae and his fine thin features said mutely you were right we have to tell everyone she said unhurried the muerain strode back into his house wife get the children get food and go at once to madame kwans his wife called surely it is too soon to worry it is too late to worry i order you wife out of this house and up to the house of the wings what are you doing his wife asked there was a flurry of footsteps on stairs my duty at that moment the entire village was plunged into darkness the power went inshallah husband get to the wings i go shouted mr shenyalar mae wrestled with her backpack and felt the rubberized surface of a waterproof flashlight i have two she said and passed him one the light flashed on the wet walls like fairies in a play dancing ahead of them mae turned to her brother she kissed his cheek thank you she said dont go down lower street is lost go up to the soongs the pings and mr atakoloo yes my place is with you said jumei it has always been with me brother but it is also with your wife and neighbours please go jumei paused and then very deliberately gave his sister a long low bow of respect then he turned shouting go to wings dont go on lower street mae shouted for a muerain could not lose dignity to that extent everyone up the flood is here everyone up mae and the muerain fought the current back up the gap between the haj and the nan households overhead the stars glinted with merriment the hills roared everything was comic the little people were finally seeing who their master was the current on upper street had gained strength it sounded now like a waterfall the little lake had reached up into the house of mr ping and its surface rippled as it sluiced its way out between houses the muerain hoisted up his skirts to show long hairless legs he reached back for mae and ran holding up his skirts like a dancing showgirl the stars laughed around their feet stones swirled like the shards of broken pots the muerain ran up the cobbles of the bridge below through the pursed lips of the bridges arch the river made a noise like a child blowing through its own spit mr shenyalar and mae cleared the top of the arch more like a stallion now all in white the muerain plunged down into the cascades that swept around both sides of the dohs ancient house his sandals were snatched away from him the muerain nipped and minced and hopped across the stones on tender feet ouch ooch eek ouch the stars clutched their sides their tiny eyes narrowed wet with tears of laughter ahead of them was movement mae shone her torch mr ken was giving a piggyback ride as if at a party mrs okans arms around his neck mr okan shuffled beside them clinging to the edge of his wifes dress and murmuring to her behind them came sezens two sisters edrem carrying his youngest child and hatijah who was carrying the goat its eyes were round and pink with terror the muerain said hurry up to kwans the bridge will not hold the current is terrible said mr ken mae come with us not yet mae do not be so foolish please mae said instead loan the muerain your shoes a moments pause the sense of it was seen and mr ken kicked off his galoshes is your mother out kuei shook his head my mother is packing the muerain hopped on one leg pulling on the shoe packing does she think its a picnic i know mr ken began to run to gain momentum to get him and mrs okan up the steep slope of the bridge ill have to go back for her he shouted the goat blinked and kicked in hatijahs arms mae and the muerain ran they ran straight into the rusting bedding now washed into the roadway blindly they bobbed and bounded their way over the springs on the moonlit hill sunnis house was dark out onto the bare slope all trails gone the stars glistened on the sheen of water ahead of them the white walls of the mosque glowed they reached the door of the mosque mae waited panting the muerain suddenly slapped his own forehead ive left the key behind he said you what mae felt like the water torn broken swept away the muerain stood back raised a leg and kicked at the lock he was tall strong a herdsman with a splintering sound and a shuddering of wood the door chuckled its way backwards the floor was flooded he grasped the wooden railing of the prayer stall splashed across the floor to a staircase and ran up the steps to the tower mae ran after him the flashlight licked hungrily over the back of the speaker down to the batteries mr shenyalar bent and kissed the batteries tasting them to see if they still worked he flicked a switch there was amplified crackling he began low and dark to sing mae grabbed his arm muerain please the flashlight glared angrily at her im sorry muerainsir but most people sleep through a call to prayer pause they turn over in their beds pause and his voice rich and deep said the flood has come for our sins our godlessness the flood is upon us it was strange mae could hear his voice which was so close to her roll and fall away all across the valley then he said follow the advice of mrs chung take food take blankets and go to mr wings do not go on lower street already you will not get past go on upper street now the flood is here he turned you go the muerain said she paused somehow she had pictured herself calling the faithful you must go and wake people i can stay here not too long mae warned him i have a duty mr shenyalar said go he passed her back the second flashlight she turned and the muerains voice ballooned out over the sound of the water the flood has come mae staggered down the steps and then had to lean over acids shot like venom up from her stomach and out of her mouth the fumes were acrid she had difficulty breathing her throat was raw and sore she knelt down and scooped up some of the water and drank where could she do the most good sezen would have roused the plain the houses in the low south it was sunni who had farthest to go she was high but next to the river she would need to go down to the bridge to cross mae looked across and saw sunnis house high and alone she blinked and thought she saw it move on its foundations so mae ran to save sunni the hill between the high mosque and the high house was no longer flowing with water it was pouring mud the mud stirred around her like porridge but porridge with teeth for it was also full of stone i will have to give up soon mae thought i will have to save myself already another voice spoke unbidden the hillsides dissolve like sugar in tea that undermines the terraces and they fall the houses fill with mud or are crushed by stone ahead the river leapt up white and snarling the river had become a kind of dragon rearing up over its banks leaping challenging and opening its maw mae thought of sunni of their delicate chats in the ice cream parlour of adjusting each others hair the stones nibbled her ankles the mud tugged playfully a boot was pulled free from her foot mae forged on against what was becoming a tide of mud sunnis high stone front step was already an island mae pounded on the door she shouted the river was louder the door was not locked mae ran into the darkened house it looked so calm and normal and safe with its rack of kitchen pots and new pool table in the living room sunni sunni mr haseem wake up mae ran up the stairs narrow steep unfamiliar she had never been upstairs she bashed her head on a beam there were many doors which one she pushed her way into a bedroom full of snores and reeking of booze starlight through the window fell over the bed making chessboard squares wake up wake up mae cried sunni jerked and sat up and then wailed and covered herself with the bedding her face full of fear what are you doing here get out sunni wailed her husband snored fully clothed still in his boots sunni the flood is here get out of my bedroom sunni please just listen the snow has melted listen to the river madwoman sunni was in a rage she tried turning on a light nothing no power she got up and threw on a robe and stormed towards mae and pushed her madwoman get out of here mae pushed her back ow shouted sunni scandalized husband wake up she will kill us both stupid cow i dont know why i bother with a woman with cowshit instead of brains mae raged and seized sunni by the wrist and pulled her out of the room husband i am assaulted help maes strength surged out of panic and anger and sunni was dragged to a corridor window there said mae outside the river was full and white it filled the gully it was pouring all around the bridge it hauled itself over the top walls of lower street and down a waterfall now under the steaming moon they saw the entire valley it glittered like a sea my god whispered sunni see see raged mae who is the madwoman now its terrible you are nearly dead the hill outside this house is moving whole and entire there was a sharp breath sunni spun into the dark wisps of white twirling after her and went back to her husband wake up wake up sunni shook mr haseems brightred face by the ears she looked back at mae i know him when he is like this he wont wake up she said leave him said mae oh you would say that you hate him mae limped forward i dont sunni but it is too late for all but final things do you want to die with him sunni looked at her blankly its come to that if he doesnt wake up now you either love him enough to die with him or you go with me now now you hear her you hear her sunni shouted she slapped faysal hard on the face he snorted wake up she slapped him again he turned over sunni said to mae okay lets go mae turned and clattered down the steps dont hit your head on the beam sunni said too late maes eyes watered a second time sunni grasped two tins of food as she soared through the kitchen out into moonlight okay were together sunni said if one of us goes the other tries to pull them free but only for so long we promise each other ah we save ourselves but we try to help the first right said mae but im going to lower street madwoman said sunni again i have to see if siao has come back if mr chung got out if sezen is okay okay but im not coming with you said sunni at last you are talking sense it will make a change i admit said sunni the moving earth was unstable both of them fell into the mud they thrashed their way to their feet and held each other up the flashlight said sunni ive got it its covered in mud mae wiped it on her coat and the light shone dimly again she pointed the light ahead on one side of the dohs house the river had risen up on the other mud was mounting the back of the house like an unwanted lover mae and sunni would have to cut down through the gap between the dohs and the alis there was no other way down mud and water carried them down into upper street at some point the calling of the muerain had fallen silent zeynap panted sunni thinking of her friend zeynap ali they tumbled together onto the street mae shone the light the doorway of the alis house was open theyre out said mae from inside the house of the dohs came yells and shouts mae cried dohs i have a flashlight she ran inside the kitchen young miss doh was flinging food into bags amid unwashed glasses and crumbs go upstairs get my parents down miss doh raged as if mae were stupid standing still mae turned and ran up the stairs in the upper corridor old mrs doh spun into the flashlight beam waving her arms as if fighting cobwebs this way said mae whos that wailed old mrs doh chung mae what are you doing here trying to help these are the steps come on mrs doh felt like a loose bunch of sticks in strong wind she shook what she said not even a question mae passed her to sunni at the foot of the stairs here we are dear said sunni as if it were a party mae turned and ran through each of the rooms she heard the rivers roar she heard a creaking in the walls in the wooden beams and she felt the weight of the mud leaning against the house this house is going to go she shouted to anyone who could hear her she went from bedroom to bedroom the good fairy of the flashlight blessed the walls of each room in the last of them old mr doh stood sobbing he was trying to button his shirt and could not mae imitated sunni oh good mr doh this is mrs chung its time to go he flung off her hand impatient sobbing still fighting his way into his best shirt no no she cooed and laughed you look wonderfully elegant come down now my wife he said dazed shes waiting the whole house groaned and listed forward mae screamed sunni from the street outside mae simply seized him and pulled oh oh he said fighting the dark she hauled him towards the stairs the walls suddenly snapped forward leaning dust puffing out where the floorboards joined them everything was looser underfoot she pulled him down the stairs he lost his footing and they skidded together in the dark slammed vengefully by gleeful wooden steps until they both tumbled into the kitchen leave me he said he started to fight mae the light careering over the walls someone entered seized him and pulled out they all went clattering against chairs slipping on oil spilled from bottles as if all the contents of the house had been upended in the street the dohs waited i told you he was not outside raged miss doh to the others it took chung mae as always miss doh pushed the old man turned in the darkness seized mae and pushed her tongue into maes mouth in case one of us dies miss doh said and darted back all the world was careering like the light the stars themselves seemed to threaten to fall over the sound of water mae heard a grinding rumble she turned and saw headlights trailing up the road against the lights she saw water gushing up against tyres siao she thought that could be siao you go on mae said to sunni where are you going fool back home okay sunni was suddenly in front of her mae you were right she said mae began to move sunni gripped her you heard me say that didnt you you were right sunni yes i heard go you go and come back quickly nothing else was said mae ran past the backs of the houses of the hos the matbahsuluks and the kemals she held on to the corner of mr kemals house to wrench herself around into lower street a sound like applause if you hear it above you you are dead this is it mae one check on the house and then you go yourself her old house glowed white like a cake under the stars in front of it rested one of mr pins old vans empty and dark the courtyard door was open mae ran in her courtyard was kneedeep in mud siao siao mae shone the light the door to the barn was shut firmly mud already pushing against it across the surface of the mud rivulets of water flowed if there were no one here she would run from inside mr kens house someone wailed i cant get out it was old mrs ken above them something hissed like water on a skillet the terraces are going mae screeched and she felt a click i have been here before she thought mrs ken began to pound on the inside of the kitchen door the weight of mud pushing it shut the window break the window mae called she waded forward mud was a slow and heavy evil it sucked at her feet and held her back like glue she could not advance i cant get any closer a chair was punched through the glass which sparkled like snow in the air on the liquid earth mae someone called from by the courtyard gate mae turned and it was kuei he surged forward pushing through the mud up to his waist mother mother he jerked thrashed tossed himself from side to side rocking through the mud towards the broken window suddenly the mud heaved him forward and off his feet for the first time the thought came to mae weve left this too late we could die a head arms then legs came through the kitchen window oh oh kuei help me out the mud gripped kuei and held him fast his mother was out of reach kuei called another man walk on this board siao mae turned three men were carrying the lid from the coalbunker there was siao and there helping him was joe joe where how the three of them flung the broad plywood lid on top of the mud under the window jump down onto it maybe it will take your weight for long enough try to walk forward to us mother kuei said just fall forward ill catch you old mrs ken without another word pulled herself through the jagged window frame and fell gently forward onto the raft it listed down into the mud and she scuttled forward towards her sons hands kuei grabbed her and pulled her forward joe and siao rocked forward and pulled as well kuei cradled his mother who juddered out a single sob mae demanded siao what are you doing here trying to find you a current of mud pushed them back away from the gate like some kind of living thing a slug how do we get out through this joe despaired mae remembered her washing line strung across the courtyard this way she said flashing her good fairy light along the rope then she reached up and began to pull herself along it through the mud mr ken said okay mama pull like mae says all of them seized the rope and pulled themselves forward mae turned at the gate and shone the light on them there they were her three men her husband her lover and siao she looked at siaos steady face i got a message at the teahouse he said joe had got to the desiccated village joe looked up at mae and then down quickly in shame did mae hear applause she turned to the open door not daring to breathe and looked behind there was a sound of delight massed clapping from the eastern slope the sound had a shape a shape like a blade sharp at one end but widening behind a wedge of the walls had fallen thats it she keened her voice box tight wet ssssh said all the stones they trickled like water made a sound like water were borne by it and their own weight down the hillside one collapse knocking into the terrace below catching it knocking it free mae fought her way to the street and glinting in the moonlight she saw it a flow of rocks on the eastern side of the bowl a river of stone come on she screeched again she looked behind her wildly ken and joe were up to their ankles and pulling mrs ken free mae fought forward and pulled then the applause started on the hill directly above them it was so slow the fall of stone above them on the hill a terrace wall turned sideways grumpily forced to move by the weight of stone settling on top of it all of it slumped forward towards the school to sezens they would not be able to get back to upper street weve got to go this way said mae they all ran mae shone the light doors left open doors closed mae found she no longer cared who had managed to escape as if something were jamming needles into her ears there was a terrible sensation a shivering in the air in the earth itself that was not quite a noise it was something inside her head there was another sigh in front of them this time the hills groaned with relief as if finally able to let loose their bladders and bowels three houses only and they would come to the square the beam of light teased them showing them glimpses of the flood the square had indeed gone most of the kosals house had collapsed the western corner of it still stood but the rest was spread as rubble across the new lake a chair stood on the stone beyond the rubble the river roared we cant get across said mr ken we could try climbing the rubble joe said just beyond it would be the gully we would just disappear into it lets go back old mrs ken pleaded the house will be buried said mae there was grinding as if the sky itself were being milled as if the hill were peppercorns and in the light of the moon and stars they saw the bridge above them come away from its foundations the bridge heaved up and shrugged forward and skidded down the slope with a fall of earth and stone down from upper street there was an explosion of water great white shooting jets of it wooden beams spun upwards into the air a tangle of roots rose up snagged itself whiplashed down the one tree had fallen the bridge moved down the hill the bridge settled still upright leading nowhere another crash spread out just above them the dohs house would have finally gone one of her men jerked her which one all of them moved into a veil of water it pummelled their heads it tried to drive them down onto the ruins of the kosal house they had to climb up a broken wall of stone someone reached down for her she looked up into his face it was joes face looking worn handsome and sad but not slow fast lean and as awake as he had been when he was the leader of the young men he hoisted her up first they climbed up the tree they walked along its ancient oaken trunk all rough creases and then walked as if nothing were awry across the old bridge a waterfall thundered next to them scented with earth and the mineral smell of freshly melted snow a beautiful river huge and green washed under them and down onto a valley that was a sea the tuis house stood above the water its upper storeys only otherwise the southern wing of the village was simply submerged kizuldah looked like a seaside town as if it had always been that way with a breakwater of stone lower street fell away below them to the west and the hillside was flowing across it everything was moving rocks shrubs earth as if in migration the earth looked like a herd of buffalo going to a lake to drink oh oh sobbed mrs ken everythings gone they had to jump down from the bridge twice the height of a man into swiftly flowing water the current slammed into mae taking her breath and her strength one of her men caught her she caught him they both caught mrs ken and whoever was holding her together they pulled each other up onto the street that was gushing water white rapids over the cobbles cobbles were solid underfoot they were going to live they ran up the hill towards kwans chapter wing had his generator running the courtyard was full of light and people the haj their pilgrim to mecca stood at the courtyard gate he had crammed onto his head a funny hat with a teddy bears face perhaps he wanted to cheer people up he had a list chung mae the haj called out people surged forward hoho with all the chungs old mrs ken and he paused ballooning out his eyes mr ken he coughed and then murmured quite a family group mrs shenyalar threw a blanket around maes shoulders mrs chung was first the muerains wife shouted to the villagers she roused my husband sunnis mother old mrs al gama took up maes hand sunni hugged mae are you all right darling sunni asked mae turned back around to the haj mr hajsir where is sezen miss ozdemir has she come in yet the haj kept smiling but his eyes narrowed he said nothing kwan has hot food for everyone sunni was tugging at her shoulder haj you have been keeping count who has come who has not the haj looked sweet like a calf and shrugged he was blinking so many have been saved he said looking down at the list where is sezen the haj sighed and reached forward with his plump hands she has not come here who else the shens the chus mae knew the people in the south wash the haj shook his head the macks and pins are all right he sighed they believed you mae found she was weeping who else sunni stopped pulling surrendered and hugged her mae asked what about han kaihui her daughter the haj simply shook his head and said inshallah almost everyone else is all right said sunni you did everything mae let herself be led through the throng all the soongs had survived and were huddled in one corner of the court the cluster of grandchildren played with toys mr and mrs okan shuffled up to mae and showered her with thanks sezen was gone she had died saving an the traitor han an the last person in the world you could have seen sezen giving her life for mae thought of an and their clipboards mae remembered kaihuis face when they were little girls both poor catching turtles in the reeds from somewhere there came a sound like thunder or fireworks a crackling and a boom someones house had fallen involuntarily the villagers groaned some of the dohs surged around mae now and took hold of her hand they were thanking her was their house still standing have you seen mr and mrs ozdemir mae managed to ask mrs doh stared back at her as if she was far too important to know or care about sharecroppers wild girl said mae and suddenly her legs left her mae slumped down onto the ground siao joe and ken kuei were ranged all around her and that was too much as well her brain buzzed someone else was using her mouth we all go we are all washed away down into the dark and no one will find us ever again sunni was making mae sit up sezen is probably cut off somewhere mae you know sezen shell come roaring up here tomorrow on her boyfriends motorcycle indeed it would be just like sezen mae tried to smile joe and ken between them helped her to her feet her shins were numb somehow she was on the stone staircase being led down into kwans kitchen all around them the noise of the flood was gently falling asleep sssh the waters seemed to say sssh the worst is over the wound is lanced the pus is draining sssh little ones sleep in the kitchen everything was feverish the single orange light the heat of the stoves the bustling women something bony and hard flung itself around maes neck mae burped vile juices into her mouth and felt only elbows kwan desperate clung to her kwan leaned back looked at mae and her lower face crumpled mae felt nothing who was this person kwan took her hand and led her to a table mrs pin leapt up and with a kind of whirligig speed spun bowls and village bread onto the table in front of mae wing and mr atakoloo looked up from their food both bowed deeply and in silence mrs pin ladled soup into maes bowl mae picked up the spoon and found it was too heavy to lift she collapsed into tears and lowered the spoon and sat helplessly kwan crowded in next to her and mae gave her an angry shove i tried to tell you mae shouted at kwan no one believed me no one did anything the kitchen fell into an embarrassed silence from outside came the rushing sound of water kwan wing sunni young mrs doh all stared at her with those same round helpless eyes what were they waiting for for her to say i forgive you thats all i have to say she told them abruptly she tore at a newly moistened piece of village bread mae found that the only person she cared about right now was sezen not joe not ken not jumei not kwan none of them it was a strange thing to discover if she told the story of any of them it would not move her only sezens life had a meaning sezen who loved air where is mrs ozdemir said mae very carefully very angrily that is what i have asked people sezens mother or is she not important enough to be allowed into the kitchen kwan looked up questioningly in the courtyard somewhere without saying anything else mae stood up and walked mae someone called after her she broke into a run fleeing from them leave me alone she heard her feet on wet stone again as if the flood was still behind her the flood never goes away it pushes pushes and washes all away bunched up like a fist mae pushed her way unseen through people too concerned with their own loss the sky was going silver the rooster crowed on kwans barn roof mae found hatijah huddled in a corner of a barn in the dark her head was covered and she sat rocking slightly she was singing in a wan private voice mrs ozdemirmaam hatijah mae rubbed the womans shoulder the family goat was loose rooting in hay edrem sat with his back towards everyone hatijah dont give up hope suppose she rescued all those people and got them up to high hills what a heroine she will be ah think how joyous we will all be when she comes back to us hatijah the woman kept singing a thin wheedling wordless lament hatijah stared unblinking and dryeyed ignoring the baby on her lap mae hugged the red shawl and thought of fleas and the stricken household and how sezen had fought fought everything and she won sezen had won hatijah do you want to talk hatijah kept singing tunelessly and rocking back and forth the older daughter sat plucking her own shawl scowling ignored the useless back of her useless husband was turned towards them can you talk nothing edrem answered instead we saved the goat he snarled the last word his hands were over his eyes and he creaked like an old leather chair born in poverty die in poverty born in shit die in shit die without hope oh but live in hope oh yes only to have those hopes broken ground down and for what to want to slit the throat of a poor animal because it is alive and your daughter is not to break your back weep into the earth be beaten by the sun and for what for the sometime song of the nightingale the onceayear feast the sometimesfull belly that is mostly empty love when love is what makes it hurt when someone is destroyed edrem began to sob great heaving heartbroken helpless useless sobs his skinny bent body his wide flat shoulders swelled and shuddered mae hugged him too and smelled sweat old hides smoke bread and yogurt like his wife he was beyond being hugged mae was useless too so mae stood up and stepped back out into the last of the starlight looking up at the stars so perfect so white so cold the dragons breath was still blasting and hot people still stood in silent circles kicking the ground the haj was still at his post trying to tell dawn and her friends a story but looking looking as the sun rose for anyone coming up the road the rooster cried saying work work should begin mae climbed up her friends stone steps the steps belonged to others as well to a thousand years worth of families maes legs were made of bags of wet earth fire burned in her belly kwan sat exhausted on a chair in the diwan hand buried in her hair kwan did not see her mae climbed up farther footsteps followed mae turned and on the landing of the staircase three men looked up at her she pieced together who they were joe and mr ken were lined up side by side as if for a firing squad behind was siao siaos eyes were full and full on mae beautiful men so much alike really useless useless their beautiful brown eyes their fat male hands their lean legs mae said one of them joe and i have been talking about the weather mae asked with a crooked smile everyone talks about the weather we have decided not to fight said joe mae you are expecting a child it is expecting me she replied she had to sit on the stairs joe walked forward joe she thought you are beautiful again maybe you become beautiful when you are really needed maybe somewhere you are always beautiful maybe if you had been born rich i was the one who left said joe i will leave again he leaned forward and kissed her he took her face in his hands my little mae his shoulders said you dont need an idiot like me i have ruined everything i lost my fathers farm i want to wander the earth in shame dont feel useless joe mae pleaded were all useless we just do things and hope lung thinks im a fool he murmured i am a ghost here the teenage boy had suddenly found cracks in his face who needs a teenage village hero in his fifties what could he do nothing except to be someones sharecropper i could buy you some land mae said joe paused i hate farming he said smiling i think i want to drive a truck so did i said mr ken in recognition but you grew up thought mae so i still love my husband and i am going to let him go she stood up everything was very suddenly clear as if washed clean by floodwater she looked at her old husband who was going away and at faithful simple mr ken who had fathered her lastchance child and at siao who was wise i am going to live with siao mae announced im sorry without a glance at mr ken mae climbed again she remembered her first day at school and seeing the older boys playing football the captain of one of the teams stopped the game and began to fight that is not fair he bellowed a little boy maes own age came up and stood beside her he was the first child in the school to talk to her thats my brother little siao said proudly quietly are you going to live here he asked until im grown up little mae had answered mae went into her old high room and there was the machine in front of the high window and she looked out over the courtyard the sky over the broken roof and the bowl of the mountains was already bluegrey against silver somewhere farther down the valley in the future the sun was bright but kizuldah was still in shadow the rooster was crowing over and over having sensed at last that something was wrong and there was her old friend kwans tv chung mae wake full audio and video no queuing sent in real time and saved to bugs at nouvelles also to bedri at metoff a flick and buzz the little seeing detachable eye mae held it up in the palm of her hand hello bedri hello bugsy this is chung mae there has been a flash flood this is our village now at sevenfifteen am the bowl of the shadowed mountain was no longer in orderly lines white rocks were spread in wedgeshaped lines down the hillside they rested at crazy angles like eggs in the mud the treasured and nurtured earth had escaped wasted itself in bursting down the hillside it may not look too different to you said mae but yesterday it was covered in snow there was snow on the high hills and today looking at the hills across the valley there is no snow that is the first time i have seen that she swallowed she traced the two parallel streets of kizuldah with her eyes it will not look different to you but our stone bridge was washed away from upper street into lower street i can remember mae had to break off and swallow she felt her eyes swell and heat up but this was real time she could not afford mistakes i can remember when the chinese engineers visited to volunteer to make the bridge they came with trowels and concrete because kizuldah had none we were too poor her voice like a carpet was worn thin it straggled away like torn thread mae swallowed and continued we loved the chinese because they were told not to be snobbish to mix in and they did and they worked hard and they left that bridge behind and those of us here who are chinese thought of them every time we walked across it the big handsome men the happy women who lived in our homes and praised the food how we all admired them and their bridge and see the house next to it oh mae had to stop again she hauled back in moisture and sadness for she had to keep talking that was mr and mrs kosals house but it was the house on the square and on its benches we spent our lives sitting old men played dominoes our haj would talk about his travels and old mrs kosal now gone would come out and give the children bonbons in the square we had the harvest we would pile up the hessian sacks full of rice and build bonfires for barbecues year on year we would lay out rugs and hire a band and all of us the old women the boys the little girls danced and ate our fill of roast and yams and new rice we sat under the tree we called it the one tree it had been planted there so long ago and was big and huge it was like a friend it was like all our fathers taken root and its been washed away it had a swing on it and all the children the children of the s and the s and s s s all of us swung on that swing so high so hard i think some of us must have tossed our spirits into the air and they are still in the air the spirits of the children playing mae had to wring the moisture out of her eyes the gully is where we kept our ducks and geese maybe some of those lived and the house that has fallen across upper street that was my friends house the dohs house and they have lived there for one thousand years the dohs were chinese warriors who stayed and the house is older than the one tree and just above it that was our new mosque every morning our muerain would sing and he sang so considerately in the early morning soft and low and sad as if he was sorry to wake us wanted to let us sleep sorry that we would have to wake up to empty bellies or cold or scorching sun we all built the mosque we all paid for it even those of us who were not muslim and all the children ran to help with hammers and the dogs barked like when the trucks come to take the harvest mae broke down she couldnt speak her face was not her own it was like the laundry she saw in old mrs tungs hands wrung clean she wiped her face and her mouth and swallowed and kept on thats the roof of the mosque in what is left of mr and mrs alis house they are a fine old couple of our party of progress and there is the okan house they are as old as the hills and i am so happy because their house is whole it isnt touched and all the circular rugs that mrs okan weaves herself with old hands over candles at night they will have survived we can wash them we can wash them and put them on her floors and it will all be as it was and next next to them mae drew a breath and grew grim next to that is the house of my dear friend mrs ozdemir you cannot see it but i can i can see it as if it had never left was still there as if a girl called sezen still drew at a table and still fumed at her mother for being sad and frightened as if it were still full of corncobs that the family used as furniture because they were too poor to have anything else with beautiful naked babes and words from the koran written in crayon on the walls i can still see it but that girl died and they have lost their home but mrs ozdemirs heart is broken and so is her head and she just sits and rocks and weeps and there is my house too my house in many ways because it was my husbands house and in that house i gave birth to three children one whole side of it is gone i can see inside it its so familiar even flooded with sunlight my bed and my kitchen i think i see my own tv in part of the loft sunning itself but the barn is full of mud so i think my beautiful weaving machine will be gone but look at the beautiful new sea look at it sparkle look how full of hope it seems look it has seagulls who could hate such a beautiful sea even if it covers houses houses where you played as children even if dear friends are trapped inside their mouths full of mud even landscapes die and give birth to new ones and here comes the sun see it it is creeping over the hills and the terraces and the terraces are gone every spring after harvest up we all would go men and women and children with levers and stakes and hammers and pulleys and all of us even the ones who hated each other would stand together and pull up the rocks and hammer in the stakes to repair the terraces to hold the earth and that earth what it did not contain our blood and sweat our shit our stillborn babies anything to make it rich and keep it rich what you see spilled is not mud it is our blood our blood of two thousand years that is why it is so red and that is why it seems to me that the earth screams for it is lost now like a beautiful child that bursts free into danger it will be washed away washed away down into the valley and so much of what we are will go with it the corner of the room was dark and mae was swaying and the constant fire in her belly gnawed at her she saw the school high on the hill swamped with mud she saw its open door farther down the hill stumbling over the ruin of mrs dohs house she saw people walking its shen mae shouted oh the people you see walking see that is our schoolteacher mr shen we thought he was dead surely look at the wreck of our school but look he is there oh tell the haj tell our pilgrim that one more of us has lived and lovely suloi she lives too beautiful suloi and her daughters shen shambled as he walked everything shaking legs arms but his head was held erect stupidly high dumbly proud as if he had been proved right as if he had defeated history the littlest child too young to understand except to wonder her mouth was open in the beautiful sunlight she held out her arms and began to spin she dances whispered mae the daughter dances mae turned to tell someone that shen lived she turned and saw that crowded and silent in the doorway were kwan and wing and sunni and kuei and joe and mr pin and mr ali and others looking over their shoulders the room was going darker mae heard the sound of children playing in a courtyard she heard the muerain year on year and the harvest festival and the winter party and the spring replanting with its songs and the latenight barking of the drowned dogs thats when it came into the room mae had seen it before something dark and whole something like a dog loyal in a sense patient waiting except that it meant the end of everything she had known and loved the black dog settled in the corner and licked its chops mae sat back onto the bed she dropped the camera kwan walked forward and picked it up the road has been completely washed away kwan said to the machine we are cut off and have only limited supplies of food wait look said a handsome man mae once had known there was a sound like sheets in the wind clean sheets being shaken its a helicopter the handsome man spun in joy they have already sent a helicopter mae did you send a message last night blurpble ah said mae she was not well mr ali came forward with his hat and mr atakoloo and even mr masud so said mr ali you will have to teach us all now mae all how to use it we will need it said mr atakoloo he tried to smile but everything was slipping into darkness closing down someone else was dancing old mrs tung won chapter progress passed into the hands of the habitual leaders of the village the wings the muerain and mr atakoloo they set about rebuilding kizuldah as a blacksmith mr atakoloo was disposed to building shelters of prefabricated metal mr wing knew stone was best stone would hold warmth it takes too long to build mr atakoloo protested gesturing puffing out his handsome white moustache if you only have two or three people building we have one hundred men with nothing to do tub most of them unskilled said mr atakoloo brushing flakes of village bread into his cupped palm in the end they had to build with both metal and stone the cold came back ruined houses like the dohs or maes had small shelters built against whatever walls were still sound for this the stones of the ruined terraces and houses served better than tidy sheets of aluminum the men and the women carried rocks in wheelbarrows or in gloved hands the aluminum sheets formed the roofs concrete was poured on top of that to stop them radiating out all the warmth of the fires fifteen families had bought mr wangs insurance jumei his city clothes gone in the flood made a point of giving them their cash himself he passed them wads of bills to replace their houses folds and flocks they gaped at him in wonder so it was that maes computer was seen even to provide money the village people were related to each other and showed solidarity they shared their payouts and so the village had money to restore itself the tv brought other things news for example that the office of discipline and education had reinstated shen in his job the email wished him a productive partnership with mrs chung the office seemed unaware that there had been a flood people temporarily shared their houses the kemals and the ozdemirs found shelter in jumeis house mr wing put up the whole tribe of pins the alis stayed with the haseems in what was left of their house faysal haseem had awakened late on the day after new year to find much of his house missing it looked he said rather like his own skull felt broken open and washed away his garage his white van all his tools were gone he thought there had been thieves he thought that chung mae had finally gone crazy and driven a tractor into his house it had its funny side waking up hungover having slept through disaster he had to laugh he told the story over and over he did not look at his wife as he laughed sunni looked down at her hands food was dropped from the air bags of flour or rice paid for partly by money donated by the nouvelles magpie on cold clear days the village could hear the rumble of machinery up from the valley the road to their village was being repaired kwan thanked bugsy thanked the world she still had requests by voicemail for maes last narrowcast kwan always referred to the nouvelles address she could not bear to listen to it herself at times kwan stood looking out of that same window to see how the village was healing and to think of mae the wind had a different sound now kwan was sure she was not making that up some of the wind spirits had left them the invader wind had frightened them away some of the spirits would never come back the air itself would sound forever different that at least is what her mother would have said her mother mrs kowoloia would have said many things kwans mother would have said there are four principal spirits called earth air water and fire in times of change they become unbalanced the eloi despised the chinese with their paltry system of opposition yin and yang the eloi had layers of struggle and synthesis earth was female and solid and nourishing and dark and fertile as the womb it was the lowest layer water was the force of time that carried everything forward it flowed making the earth turn the air spin water was the engine of the world water was change air was the spirit high in heaven between earth and air was fire fire was people fire was their desires the things that made them move fire and water were change air and earth were what continued oh mrs kowoloia would have had no trouble telling them what had happened air had usurped the place of time and desire the world of the spirits had come to earth like ghosts and the firedemon erjdha had blown across the hills old mrs kowoloia would have had no difficulty knowing what chung mae was either some people bore the weight of the world it was not their fault they could not be blamed air and fire and earth and water churned within them exactly as they churned without they did extraordinary things and were to be avoided for they were maelstroms and they were to be watched for whatever happened to them happened to the world such people became oracles to be read like yarrow stalks so kwan would sit and ponder the meaning of the oracle what the oracle told her was simple and final and all that mae had been saying since the beginning their old and beloved world had died it was right to mourn it but they could not resist the movement either water spurred by air had changed its course water was time time had moved very swiftly and so must they and old mrs kowoloia long since burned by funeral fire to join the world of the spirits would also say do not fear for your friend the water in mae has responded to the usurping air the water has swept her away mae lives in the future thinking this looking out over their darkened village kwan let hot water fall from her eyes and her mother would have said to kwan cry daughter tears are good for people who grieve tears are time the tears help bear you away beyond the time of grief why does it work mother this old stuff why does it work when you tell me it is dead why does it help me understand kwan had wanted her son to be modern and scientific the eloi had to be to live in this world and to fight the karz if the time ever came again but her son knew none of his peoples wisdom and he would go away like maes son did and come back a stranger look to oracles they live out the future kwan wiped her eyes and went down to the diwan still crowded with people her sons name was luk he was big quiet kind and part of a group not its leader was now the time she saw his face it was a university face he might not become a soldier he could become something even worse than a soldier see the water see the tears see the candle burning in our little boat of wishes he is going away daughter this is his last winter in kizuldah so kwan made herself smile and collected the stone mugs and murmured to friends not wanting to disturb their viewing they were watching a programme about mat unrolling kwan was glad to see suloi there suloi would understand two eloi sets of eyes caught each others glances kwan said remember mae she talked about her mat all the time very solemnly suloi nodded downward once yes mae was our oracle kwan came to luk son when this is through could you and i go for a walk he glanced at his friends two of the pin brothers all bucktoothed and sweet kwan was glad he had such good friends it was unusual for her to ask he looked at his friends and said i can go now if you like mat unrolling bored him maybe kwan was careful not to tell him how to dress he did not want to hear his mother telling him to bundle up and she promised herself as she slipped on boots that she would not let her worries run away with the night she would not worrit him about studying about not spending about writing her nothing he could do would fill the gap that would be left behind when he went nothing she could do would make his life better if he failed to fly by himself we must meet as equals she thought so they trudged out together and her son had bundled himself up in sheepskin coat scarf and gloves almost too carefully and this made kwan think where is the swagger in him is luk a bit too quiet even a bit dull dont worrit kwan they walked out into the courtyard kwan asked her son what do you make of chung mae that surprised him if he had been dreading a motherly discussion that would have reassured him i dont really know luk said finally she is your good friend im sorry she is not well thats what i think too of course but what do you think she is luk looked back at her askance was this a trick question adults asked questions when they knew the answers kwan did not want to play a guessing game the eloi in me thinks she is something very mysterious kwan found herself smiling and wiggling her eyebrows almost making fun of it they both stood in the courtyard light luk grinned he understood she is a bit spooky he said your grandmother would have said she was oiya said kwan that means disturbed which means the elements are out of balance many people would have called her disturbed said luk only she turned out to be right kwan stepped out of the courtyard and began to walk out of the village up the hill it was so cold that the stars seemed to be made of frost as if her own wreathing white breath blew up into heaven to freeze there stars and breath its too big she thought you cant cram all of the eloi world into someone all at once the elois said that stars are solid places in the air for spirits to rest she said they are like frozen air well theyre fire instead said luk do you ever think about the elois she asked him she could hear his sheepskin shrug only that i am part eloi my first name is eloi i think it doesnt seem to make any difference in the way people treat me you dont have any sudden urges to stand up and herd sheep on the high hills she heard the rustle of a smile no no urge to tattoo my legs either you should try it it looks beautiful ah but my legs are just a bit too hairy for it he was joking but it was also the truth his legs were chinese and they dont allow tattoos in the military he sighed well that might be a good reason to get one then then he said okay tell me about the eloi the air was still you really want to know not as much as you want to tell me but i dont know it good said the stars okay ill talk but if a nightjar churrs we have to go back inside because birds can talk to the air if a nightjar calls it is warning you about what that you are betraying the secrets of the spirits or that the spirit inside the body you are talking to is not ready yet things like that mom you dont really believe this do you kwan had to consider not really not with the top part of my head but this old stuff it produces the right words you just say what the old people would have said and something is explained somehow its all easier to bear even now down the hillside water trickled luk spoke next theres something about earth resting underneath and being the foundation and air on top with fire and water as the filling in the sandwich yes but i think those are the wrong words ah i am a modern fellow he said kwan said there are two kinds of time there is time in motion measured by clocks and there is the time the time is the situation you live in you make it the world makes it most of the time it is like a punch you roll with you make your choices and do not resent them and wait for the season to pass and the season is made of the four elements all of which have characteristics powers they all kind of swirl together those are the wrong words too kwan o mother kowoloia o spirits of the air the water the earth speak for me the nightjar also churrs when you are not ready to speak it sleeps in the road dazzled by headlights only because the asphalt is still warm in mae all these forces are gathered together so mae is the time do you understand mae is like a picture of the time your grandmother would say that mae has solidified the time like water solidifies into ice and ice breaks when the season begins to move you see not yet luk waited kwan continued so mae is the earth like women are she derives her power from women from the circle from bugsy you see how it works the old words so you have mae who is in her character most like the earth she is an earth person rooted leastmoving of all people but her head her head has been filled with air this is the age of air and so she is disturbed spirit mixing with earth swept away by the enraged waters which are change which drive change luk said mae is earth moved by air and moved by water yes kwan was pleased luk understood what is the fire she still remembered him at five all innocent toddling nakedness she remembered him at sixteen how soft and troubled he looked back when tsang had been seducing him dont you know she prodded him think you know she is disturbance so what was disturbed luk was embarrassed ah well her husband and things fire is desire and fire flared up your grandmother would have said that was only to be expected too but fire is not just sex it is yearning for everything here now on earth it makes us have children it makes us love them love our friends water carries us but fire makes us swim there were the stars of fire rather clumsily her huge son put a sheepskinmuffled arm around her shoulders she felt how small and frail she must seem to him she pointed to the stars you see in the world of the air there is no time even fire is still fire becomes permanent why was she crying fire becomes love in air he stood beside her and she was not sure what he felt you see you see you see even to herself kwan sounded like a bird in march the road was finished and in one of the first cars up it carried fatimah from yeshiboz sistemlar fatimah asked where mae was sunni and kwan greeted her with firm smiles mae is gone away said kwan fatimah looked suspicious and disappointed kwan had been her ally where may i see her oh i think not said sunni no said kwan shaking her head no she went up into the hills to live with an old aunt she takes care of her now yes said sunni how lucky is the woman who has family we did not even know the aunt existed where is the village fatimah nodded vaguely uphill there is no road said kwan fatimah stood just outside the interior of the car the door open between her and the villagers above her the ruin of terraces was a jumble of stones i feel it is only polite to point out said sunni that for you there will never be a road fatimahs face went pale and worked in helplessness she got back into the car the circles weaving machine was replaced by insurance money there was a celebration when it arrived the nouvelles chung mae fund had ordered over four thousand collars enough to keep even the machine busy each disaster collar had in honor of chung mae woven into it inside the package in english was the recipe for a thankyou cake the huge sums of money from the sale were distributed to those outside the circle as well as those within the men repaired some of the terraces only a few enough to plant some rice enough to feed the village and generate some more grain a hired bulldozer came and scooped up the last of the ruins of the chu koi and han households rugs cups clothing came to the surface but not the missing bodies finally halfway down the plain they found a body which must have been han kaihui sezen kwan decided had been carried by the flood even farther into the future than mae she would never be found except perhaps in a spaceship going to the moon high on the hill where their mosque had been the villagers gathered for another funeral and chung mae was brought out for it chung siao came with her holding her hand keeping her quiet and on her other side stood mr ken who is it who is it mae demanded too loudly han kaihui granny mr ken said to her you remember her she was chung maes little childhood friend maes face looked angry she must have died very suddenly was it an accident pause yes granny said ken mr ken struggled to keep the fighting hands still his face looked worn but enduring how can he stand it kwan wondered oh people should be more careful mae flung the news away with a toss of her head old mrs tung could not learn she looked around the crowd outraged like an angry lizard and children should show respect where is han an at her own mothers funeral where is chung mae if it is her friend mae should be here this was beginning to look like a mistake kwan moved through the village crowd they stood in their anoraks or sheepskins all heads bundled in scarves the fire was mostly broken furniture and kerosene with a rug wrapped around the body maybe kuei can bear it for the sake of his child inside her maybe he can bear it because he shares it with siao it is strange the two of them and her who can say how they make it work except through love fire in air kwan nodded to them both eyes catching then she looked deep inside the eyes of the woman beside them who was no longer chung mae kwan denounced her you horrible old woman you are dead too you died you horrible ghost we loved you in life but you should be a spirit now in the air you are a disease at least let mae mourn her friend the eyes went confused and watery the young mouth shook like an old one for just a moment kwan thought she saw mae mae were winning everyone uses the tv we love it mae we want you back uh said the struggling mrs tung and pushed kwan away from her kwan saw struggle in the helpless confusion of the face the shuddering and the shaking shes fighting shes there said kwan she took hold of the hand and kept talking to her come on mae you can come back the old witch only has part of your soul you have the rest come back mae kwan visited mae mostdays siao and ken kuei lived together with mae in the ruin of their houses the village had decided not to regard this as a scandal both men loved her of course they would stay with her in misfortune only the barn and the back corner of the house still stood the wound had a scar of piled stones over it bandaged with plastic daylight peeked through but the room was warm there was room for the brazier and the table and the alcove with the bed part of the loft remained but was unused kwan would duck through the low doorway and bow with respect to old mr chung who sat in the only standing corner of his old house kwan would lay food on the table village bread a few dried vegetables and at times even a bottle of rice wine saved from the flood siao and mr ken would both then busy themselves with the cooking politely they would pass each other the knife the soy kwan had once asked ken kuei how it was all three of them living together oh he said there is no problem i have lived next to chung siao all my life we have always been friends kwan felt a quiet pride such behaviour is only possible she thought among a truly civilized people it was best for mae to sleep in her own bed it might help to bring her back certainly old mrs tung did not like it the old creature quailed why are we in this place she was confronted with the fact that she did not belong the tiny bedroom alcove was kept as tidy as possible by mr ken old mrs tung would sit disgruntled next to the tiny window she kept turning out the electric lights she hated them she lit candles mr ken put them out candles in such a crowded space were dangerous hello siao said kwan is she eating he shook his head no no she is not she says her tummy burns her stomach ballooned out just under the rib cage like a pigeon breast you could tell just from looking at her shape that something was terribly wrong old mrs tung could learn nothing new so she could not remember that she was pregnant or where the pregnancy was she felt full so she never ate maes starving face was becoming more and more delicate mae was beginning to look like mrs tung kwan said maes not fighting perhaps there is no more mae left to fight i found the onion in my old store and mrs ozdemir bless her she still keeps giving me bits of her goat for mae it was smoked scragend siao went for the cleavers the famous cleavers he said he added the onion and curry powder to cover the taste of stale meat they sat and talked of village things the two men took turns to stir the fry up kwan looked at maes beautiful old dresses hung in an orderly row its been a long year she said huh more like a century said kuei remember last april she was already beginning to talk to people about graduation dresses showing them fabric bustling about the place she always wore high heels for that remember oh do i kuei rolled his eyes as if he had never seen anything as beautiful with her hair always up i would look out and it was like a dream to see her like someone from tv had dropped down by mistake into our village kwan smiled wryly that was the effect she wanted she was a different mae said mr ken which mae do you love kwan wondered old mrs tung shifted with discomfort and frustration where is mae she demanded and kuei why are we are we eating old goat cant you find anything better siao made a space near him for mr ken to moisten the bread in the corner maes tv still received voicemail kwan considered it is probably siao who loves the mae she became unrolling mats and tv screens i will have to get back soon to the girls mr ken warned siao his daughters lived with their cousins at the teahouse siao nodded the two men were a household and kwan considered it is probably siao who keeps it together as soon as the shreds of goat were cooked they offered the food kwan leaned forward mae mae eat something please i am not hungry said old mrs tung kuei take me home we have been here long enough it is evident that mae and joe will not be back for your baby you must eat said kwan what what what mrs tung shook her head no no over and over what are you talking about old mrs tung demanded i dont want your food woman i want to go home why cant we go home sssh granny said kuei coming from the stove we have been here for hours old mrs tung started to weep from frustration sssh granny the house is gone it was washed away in a flood what old mrs tung looked up in horror and her eyes shivered with all the despair of fresh discovery old mrs tung could only live in the past mae lived fascinated in air air was real life all of life all at once for it made all times one time for mae time was a breakfast table with everything in reach she would stretch across eternity and feel herself expand out of air and into any moment of her life mae would walk to school hand in hand with her brother jumei she threw acorns at him and they ran laughing round and round the one tree joe took her on a date down the hill to kurulmushkoy the teahouse there catered to young people and had a radio dazzled at sixteen mae sits in a booth and listens to u it is only two years since the communists have gone there is all this new stuff joe seems to be king of it u are from ir lang do they are not english not american they had a big event all the big stars sang for poor people it went round the world yah joe looked into his tea his hair is buzzed short he wears a chrome necklace joe is the future his eyes are sad we missed it mae is entranced she is moved we will not miss it next time joe she says she ventures forth and puts her hand on top of his this is simply because she finds she feels the same next time we will be part of the future we can bet on that he says and pushes his hand into his tight jeans and pulls out a quarterriel he slams it on the table it is a wager mae giggles at sixteen and covers her teeth with her hands because she thinks they are huge and make her look like a horse but her eyes are fixed on joe and then this time shrinks and folds down into itself it is the room and the people and the smell of boiled water and cigarettes that collapses not mae herself mae is always there mae can do frightening things she balloons herself back into the womb before she was born she can feel her mothers terror and misery seething around and inside her she hears pumping and muffled voices she sees gentle light it is like dying a gentle dying that is not fearful because you know that this is the beginning the unborn infant knows that too connected in air to its own future we live and we die in eternity our physical bodies occupy the balloon world the balloon world has space and we are trapped in one part of it the balloon expands and we are trapped with that expansion and that is time but oh in air air has no time air is everything that has been and will be waiting its turn to puff out of its tiny dot into our brief world and maes life is hinged with that of another it is the first day of autumn school and mrs kowoloia comes with her little daughter kwan mrs tung thinks my but the child is solemn and mrs kowoloia oh she is so beautiful ethereal she floats and all that embroidery mrs kowoloia you are as beautiful as the butterfly hoots mrs tung seizing her clients hands with gratitude for this is the first arrival of the school year the courtyard will soon be full of children mrs kowoloia says mrs tung may i say what a benefit this is to all of us to run a school for us year in and year out and we all know of your education ah but all my books were lost hoots mrs tung holding up her hands and laughing for the dead the little girl looks seriously ready for work and disgruntled that there is none to do kwan dear i have some paper and paints kwan wrinkles her nose its all right says kwan ill read my book every time the boys play football together in the white dust of my courtyard i say ahmet would have played with them when all the little girls sing or skip rope i close my eyes and imagine i hear lily chanting with them my lily who i let fall and drown two little girls slip through the gate all by themselves one is tall and skinny and angry the other is tiny so small that her chin hits her chest as she scowls i know who this is thinks mrs tung and she walks forward bending at the middle are you the little girls who lost their daddy mrs tung asks the oldest looks at her with frightening directness he was shot by communists and what is your name mrs tung half hopes it will be lily i like to be called missy says the elder so thats what everybody calls me she looks down at her sister with a mothers pride this is my sister mae she says in a way that makes mrs tung want to weep it is so full of love and care the little one is shy she holds up an autumn leaf its red she says i found it on the ground leaves fall thats because autumn is coming im mrs tung its beautiful it looks like a cushion all red where is your mother mrs tung asks nowhere missy says coolly missy coughs and from deep within her lungs comes the authentic crackle of tb she coughs again and passes mae to mrs tung maes clever says missy she ushers mae forward arm around her shoulder her solemn eyes meet mrs tungs mrs tung feels a prickle up her spine as if missy is passing mae to her to care for missy coughs again mrs tung is sure mrs tung could taste air come mae we have another clever little girl for you to meet her name is kwan mrs tung moves them forward together the older one is lean and already grey as a ghost mrs tung gazes at the round face of the little girl and to her it is like an egg that will hatch she can half see who this mae will be oh clever yes but not in any way that school can capture she will turn herself into missy to honour her and love her and remember her the children run around her swirling like dust and mrs tung can see them all hatching into shen into joe into kanhui it is her job to warm them love them into life mrs tung sits in her big kitchen darning wet socks you darn them wet so that they will dry and heal shut her smelly kindly old husband is in the fields her young man is off in the hills mrs tung feels heavy and weighted as if going up a fast escalator she is pregnant and she knows the child is not mr tungs she becomes aware that she is hearing gunfire has the war moved back here suddenly the guns batter so loudly that it is as if the guns are in the kitchen mrs tung jumps she hears a cry from nowhere then everything is still again just dust turning in rays of light suddenly mrs tung is certain kalaf is dead something that was in the air is there no longer like music that is suddenly turned off like the sudden smell of burning food he is dead she thinks and i will be getting a telegram she puts the sock down on the table and ponders it will not do for her husband to see any telegram about any man she ponders a moment and wonders why she is not crying when there is no doubt mrs tung goes up lower street to the teahouse and she slips sideways into the room with all the men and cigarette smoke the men in cloth caps look up and glower she is a woman even if her head is covered only whores sit in cafes with men mrs tung sits at a table and starts to darn socks she focuses on the yarn and the thread the morning passes she nods yes to a glass of tea but does not drink it her cousin mr tui comes up and suggests she should leave mrs tung just shakes her head for she finds she does not trust herself to speak she keeps her eyes on the socks then the machine in the corner of the room chatters mrs tung sees the shadow of mr tui turn away mrs tung puts her hands in her lap and waits the shadow comes back this is for you he says leaning down so that she has to see his walrus face looking sad you should have said you were waiting says mr tui mrs tung knows that if she speaks she will start to weep cousin tui stands up she was waiting for this he shakes the telegram at the men at the bar he folds it flat and puts it in her limp and waiting hands dear friend beloved cousin kalaf is dead he was kind to me when i was young says mrs tung and scrunches up the telegram as if it were her face her face becomes a rag to be wrung she can feel water seeping she stands up and holds up and swiftly strides out of the teahouse she keeps her head high walks back home through the narrow corridor of houses and cannot tell anyone that the father of her child is dead she finally closes the door of the kitchen and hides her face in her husbands wet socks mrs tung knew before she could have known mrs tung had been a traveller in air before there was air so mae went to find her mae went back to the day of the test mae burgeoned back into her old life the cauldron is boiling joe has eaten his rice old mrs tung is led in chuckling at herself kuei helps her blind to his own future as blind as this timebound workbound mae to chung mae wang certificate of appreciation from the graduating class of for fashion studies and all around them are the magnetic fields the arcs emanating from the fire in the heart of the earth unnoticed and of no importance to kizuldah for two thousand years until now there is the flash and the buzz and the inflation of the mind every neural pathway is jolted at once a kind of question map of the self every question answered complete buzzed and jolted and in that moment stamped for ever on eternity in air a complete unchanging unloving unnatural map and oh murmuring here comes the format mae has to chuckle it was such a cheap and tinny thing the format like a childs plastic spacehelmet clamped on the head a few lines of code a bit of information added to the mix chocolate i smell chocolate coos old mrs tung here it comes thinks maeinair here it comes the cauldron is knocked and topples it will fall forever that white steaming sheet will like a shroud cling and scald the old thin flesh for an eternity mae is moved by pity and jumps forward her mind addled and stirred by the unfamiliar immanence of alltime onetime she plucks away the scalding shroud mrs tung another mae demands riding on the shoulders of her old life where are you mrs tung maeinair seeks the eternal soul in time mrs tung takes another maes hand there are sticky trails across mrs tungs face as if from snails her hands are lumpy and blue i can see mrs tung whispers her eyes waver back and forth skipping leaping but they move in unison mrs tung its me mae air was saying to send messages go to the area called airmail mae watches her early self swoop clumsily across a virtual courtyard and overshoot the graphics she embeds herself in the blue stone seen from enough distance anything is funny air says for an emergency configuration simply repeat your own name several times and maeinair hears her other self say over and over mae mae mae mrs tung cries out in unison mae mae click that was it that was it right there such a simple thing a mailbox address you dont need to talk about souls or wonder how your imprints got entangled its nothing to do with the gates or the un format all you have to do is chant the same name together when they configure your mailboxes mae starts to laugh their mailboxes had the same name that was the problem they would have the same name for eternity all eternity both past and future the imprint had the mailbox but the imprint was connected always to the real self the real person who controlled all i have to do mae realizes is talk to the real mrs tung water says granny tung as if in prophecy the flood comes gurgling back but mae is gone mae pierced and repierced air like a sewing needle looking for the real soul of mrs tung mae sat on her own shoulder morning visit after morning visit to mrs tungs attic there mrs tung was in her chair at ninety the wind blowing in her face as if fresh from a cossack campfire looking back at memories of the hills is that you my dear mae mrs tung would banter and then laugh again from heartbreak well well come and sit near me child and tell me all your news hoohoohoo mae would collapse woh nothing granny just laundry ohhoho i used to so love doing laundry watching it hang out in the sun all those colours i used to love the smell of it you know thats because you loved the people who wore the clothes granny and maeinair on her own shoulder would whisper granny granny tung can you hear me and it seemed sometimes that the old catlike face would go still and listening as if just catching a whisper granny granny im here hoohoohoo strange how the mind plays tricks i suddenly remembered oh i dont know why something long before your time and maeintime fresh from laundry and joes noodles and the smell of siao in the loft would lean forward hopeful for novelty wanting beauty remembered what granny oh mrs tung waved it away i remembered i dont know why hoohoohoo i remember one year the rice fields were full of poppies just for no reason and we all left them there because so many of our young men had died poor souls her old blind eyes still glittered with joy as if they could see the eternity beyond and mae would stand up to go and maeinair would collapse herself back down then she would huff and puff and blow herself back up to another day another visit mae followed herself haunted herself trying to find whenever mae had been near old mrs tung she reasoned that there might be some closer link the closer she got to their final relationship their final state then finally mae went back to the day just before the test maeintime thumped her way up the stairs to mrs tungs room it was a duty visit her head full of dresses and how she could deliver them all in time by leaving off lace collars she was feeling impatient a tickle of nerves making her jump as she collapsed onto the chair mrs tung kept for guests they talked about wishboats and pumpkin seeds mae outside time could see now that old mrs tung was in a mysterious mood i remember the day you first came to me mrs tung said as if the time had come to talk of final things as indeed it had i thought is that the girl whose father has been killed she is so pretty i remember you looking at all my dresses hanging on the line yah yah yah a sweet old ladys memories thought mae she replied half thinking and you asked me which one i liked best another mae thought pay attention mae this is precious this is the last time this will happen mrs tung giggled oh yes and you said the butterflies she sat straight up in her chair as if surveying all of her life from a high cliff the air from the open window blew her hair we had tennis courts you know here in kizuldah did we mae pretended she had not heard that before oh yes oh yes when the chinese were here just before the communists came part of the chinese army was here and they built them we all played tennis in our school uniforms oh they were all so handsome all the village girls were so in love mrs tung chuckled i remember i couldnt have been more than ten years old and one of them adopted me because he said i looked like his daughter he sent me a teddy bear after the war she chuckled and shook her head i was too old for teddy bears by then but i told everyone it meant we were getting married oh i wish i had married him there were so many people old mrs tung wished she had married from her cossacks to boys in other villages and of course her kalaf she even managed to love the ones she had married its all so precious thought maeinair its all so beautiful we have to ignore it to get on with the laundry and mae felt a wind blow a movement in air old mrs tung did a slight jerk and turned her head and tried to chuckle ooh hoohoohoo someone just walked on my grave she said in time and outside time dim and confused something rippled like a voice mae dying people say their fathers return the dead sit down beside them to comfort them they give them kisses in dreams missy lay dying in summer in an attic room that was always hot and smelled of old sweat in clothes mama would not let mae visit for fear of making her ill as well but mae still crept in and marvelled in horror at the dark circles under her sisters eyes and the dew of sweat missy looked at her said sweetly isnt it lovely that papa lies so quiet next to me again mae it was just a whisper unclear unformatted a swirl an eddy in time from a place where nothing can move maeinair reached across for it across the breakfast table of time and very suddenly like the incomplete thing it was the room the space it contained and the bodies in it collapsed like cards fell back and down and there in infinite layers reflecting back reflecting forward babe child woman granny was mrs tung mrs tung was a weaving blur around the landscapes of three villages lost in forgotten hills mrs tung was a serpentweaving pattern of someones entire life a sinuous wild shape through time folded in on itself folded in on mae mae didnt use one name to call it she used all names young miss hu ailing mrs yuksel mrs tung granny the names were a weaving serpent blur as well and the entirety seemed to rouse itself in something like recognition it rose up like a ghost there was no speaking to it there was nothing clamped to its head to translate and set other peoples messages in order it rose up and then settled down into the most probable shape but it could be teased down the hill edged towards the imprints help me whispered mae and the entirety lifted up its aged young beautiful self and corralled its separate parts like hundreds of waving chiffon scarves collected itself trying to recognize and learn in a realm where time and learning were complete finished meaning accomplished mae nipped in and out of that life like a mouse through floorboards mae called and the entirety tried to lift its head as mrs tung slept mae whispered to mrs tung in dreams a young wife tossed fitfully in her bed in a village called mirrors mae tried to lead her back to the moment when the cauldron spilled when the fire shot through the air little miss hu shivered on the grass as she slept by a campfire trading horses mae called granny shook her head aching in a wooden chair asleep in dreams in air dreams are a way for the finished self in air to live again to have a before and an after in which to think we learn through all eternity in our dreams and so did mrs tung the dream had recurred all through her life it was a terrible dream always the same a friend a daughter even lily perhaps needed her she mrs tung had done something she didnt mean to do it she had not known she had done it but it was something she had done sometimes at its most nightmarish she had somehow stolen her friends body and the answer was always the same old mrs tung lifted all of herself up like a thousand ragged ghosts and she was blown by love towards one particular time mae mae mae mae mae mae and she met a friend and that friend seemed to pour her like slithery silk scarves to one particular thing that thing was a part of mrs tungs life a moment of her life that had been taken and frozen and held it was like a burn victim so scarred that it could not move embittered and incomplete incomplete and angry after the beautiful pattern should have been finished mrs tung settled on it with her whole self and enveloped it and welcomed it and hugged it and stilled it she was reunited with a tiny hardened mean little part of her life she wove it back into the beautiful carpet and then said very clearly quoting the poet through all her life listen to the reed how it tells a tale complaining of separations somewhere in time maes eyes fluttered and opened again she was in her kitchen back in herself im back she managed to whisper there was a sound of scraping chairs as two men jumped up from the table but somewhere else two spirits sat together as if in an attic exchanging memories joined forever remembering the poets body is not veiled from soul nor soul from body yet none is permitted to see the soul in the future everyone will be able to talk with their dead chapter mae siao mr ken and his children all strolled together towards the celebration they were a new kind of family mr ken walked on ahead cajoling and calming his two daughters who were beside themselves with impatience to get to the square to join their friends mr kens arms were full of little paper boats each one had a birthdaycake candle balanced in it the girls kept jumping up and trying to snatch them as if they were full of bonbons careful careful said mr ken the candles are only held by a little wax and these are for auntie mae and siao as well let me have mine said the eldest trying to look more mature she delicately peeled a boat from her fathers grasp she looked at it with experienced eyes what happens if the candle falls over and the boat catches fire oh that is very good luck that means your wish gets to heaven even faster mae thought i think kuei has just made that up but oh he was handsome his hair combed his broad shoulders in a nice new shirt his round legs in beautiful new slacks mae and siao strolled slightly behind them holding hands siao had caught her glance and grinned i have found you out he said teasing i know you have a lover but i am not sure who it could be ah now i am undone said mae she played along but she could still be taken aback by siaos unexpected habit of turning the most painful things into jokes people even say that once you had a crush on my brother joe said siao joe dont be silly maybe when he was younger and more fashionable i only like fashionable men ah said siao who even on this big night wore his stonemasons grey sweatsuit that is what you see in me he grinned at her with his beautiful catlike face that was the village face when it was beautiful like mrs tungs i love both of my men thought mae she walked ponderous with contentment and pregnancy i feel like a ewe on the pastures at lambing time mrs chungmaam someone called mrs hoiyoo kwans sister was waving from a high window your special dress is so beautiful it was airy and embroidered shen suloi made it for me mae called back the girls look excited they are beside themselves see you there the village square was already full of people mr kens daughters saw friends squealed and ran off clutching their boats of wishes the village square was newly paved with honeycoloured stone their once wayward little river was now firmly disciplined in a decorative zigzag channel the bridge which had conveniently dropped down from upper to lower street was now firmly mortared in place and hung with lights once the lights would have hung from the one tree and the children would have been in the swings soaring higher and higher over the heads of the festival the children did not even miss the tree now dad well need more duct tape genghiz atakoloo shouted down from scaffolding at the edge of the drop it would hold all the village tvs for everyone to see his father enver atakoloo bristled his white moustache mae remembered that her first real crush had been for mr atakoloo who in those days had been strong and bulllike with his black eyes and black stubble on the terrible day that he killed mr pin and was carried off to prison mae had wept joe came up behind her and said that she must get used to that because one day he joe was going to kill someone and go to prison too i miss joe mae said to siao i know said siao and gave her hand a shake mae coughed up bile and moved her handkerchief over her mouth dawn came bouncing up pulling her mother mrs ling my mother says you are no longer pretty giggled dawn oh exclaimed her mother she says that you are an imam instead dawn dissolved into giggles where is your white turban she kept chuckling mae said ling in apology it is nice to be called an imam mae said with a shrug and suddenly kwan was there with sunni and the women gave each other a quick hug and ken and siao and the girls were all hugged in turn well sighed kwan were all here not all of us said mae she thought of sezen kaihui mrs tung old mrs kowoloia someones car radio was pumping out balshang lectro ah kwan said indeed the song faded away and a talent raved over and over the air was coming it was airday and the air was air degrees food came up on legs the pin children brought mae plates of food people straightened her collar for her young miss doh approached still yearning for love this is your day she said to mae we are all so lucky said mae lucky kizuldah said young miss doh we are high up so we have rain and do not live in a desert our people had to fight to stay here you know this was the most valuable place mae looked up at the ruined hills we were cut off from all the madness until the very end mae looked at miss doh and saw that she did not feel lucky cut off high in the hills but it was important that she acknowledge we are the last you see said mae the last human beings after tonight everywhere we will be different the teahouse had a new awning and tables and chairs laid out on the new pavements the men played cards or dominoes some of the women knitted mae felt a constant churning like illness in her belly suddenly she felt sick and sagged slightly lets sit shall we sunni suggested mr ali stood up and offered a chair mae settled still holding siaos hand kwan seemed to flicker like a knife being sharpened she shot a glance at sunni and sunni stood up to fetch something or someone i wonder mae began there was too much to wonder about where joe was now and what he was doing what sezen would have done with air if she had lived what would happen to maes village after air suloi pulled up a chair then mrs pin and mrs doh with a sound of scraping chairs the circle was suddenly gathered out came the clay pipes and tobacco siao leaned back and shared his cigarettes with kuei the chat was light and distant about soong chang who was to wed one of the pin boys mrs pin must be excited had plans proceeded siao stood up and craned his neck trying to catch someones eye i shouldnt have had anything to eat said mae she put down her plate the food was simply fire raw on her ulcerated stomach ooh all this excitement she said sunni came back with mrs kosal the new toilet in my house is now working mae if you should need to use it as if on a signal siao kuei and kwan were on their feet come on mae darling you should see how mrs kosal has been able to restore the house mae chuckled i just need to use the toilet mrs hoiyoo was also there suddenly kwans sister had become a much better friend since the night of the flood for some reason she had a towel we all want to see the new house said sunni better than sitting around waiting for eleven o clock on the radios all around them yulduz was singing about fate and the fate of the nation being like the fate of a person so they dutifully admired the paint on mrs kosals wall and agreed that there was no trace of damage now and kwan drew mae off into the loo its warned mrs kosal her smile shook dont be frightened mae said to her kwan and sunni gasped in mock approval at the modern toilet oh they have done so well look at this so convenient and hygienic said kwan hot water said sunni in approval im going to be sick mae said shyly she wanted them to leave poor darling said kwan and would not leave her she patted maes back she looked at sunni and sunni suddenly darted away im all right mae said is it moving asked mrs kosal mae flung herself forward and mrs pins delicious fish salad shot whole and glossy out of her mouth there said mae thats it sunni smiling stuck her head around the doorway can we come in she asked brightly she prised the women apart and ken kuei blundered his way forward and then settled relieved siao stood respectfully behind him ach said mae all of you mrs kosals new toilet is not more fascinating than the air come on all of us or we will miss the show she looked at kwan i feel better really this time her two men took hold of her one on each arm mae asked kuei what about the girls they are fine they are with their cousins you just think about yourself for once outside the house was a crowd of people they stood in silence turned away from the screens the car headlights the radios and the food they faced the kosals house waiting for mae shes fine kwan said to them all in a singsong voice and mrs kosals toilet is very modern said mae which brought a bit of a chuckle hatijah came forward with a paper boat she had started to wear black trousers like her daughter mrs chungmaam she said have you made a wish oh no ive forgotten said mae and took mrs ozdemirs arm in gratitude hurry up said kwan it seemed that the entire crowd bustled mae forward to their little stream since the flood the gully was steeper their little stream was walled channelled to the edge of the square where it dropped away as a waterfall mae was supported as she knelt down beside it the fire in her belly moved again i want another boat mae exclaimed one for my baby she looked back and there they all were all the villagers shen had joined his wife and all the pin babes crowded round have mine said ling dawn two boats of paper with birthday candles light the candles first or the boats will float away first said dawn kwan pushed a cigarette lighter into her hand mae lit the first candle and set the boat adrift the boat was made in the old way it seemed not to soak up the water it was stable and it spun away bearing fire mae lit the second beginning to feel selfconscious with all those people watching and her second boat of wishes was borne away separate from the first thats it show is over she said standing up she turned and saw both little boats drop suddenly over the edge then it moved her whole stomach rose up crammed like a hard pillow it caught in her gizzard and something tore there was another wave she could feel her gullet clench relax push like a serpent the thing caught and her gut began to thrash its coming she managed to gasp on the scaffolding mr kwans tv was lit with the face of the tiger talent it is almost here everyone the talent boomed in just two minutes time there will be the second coming of the air are you all counting her sharp high little voice began to count one minute and fiftyseven seconds the screen shifted to the crowds outside the national assembly in balshang the president was counting mae vomited and vomited but nothing moved her chest heaved in singapore a dancing dragon moved through the crowd push old mrs tung was fighting with her the dragon inside her moved the lump reared up and stuck and mae could not breathe her whole body heaved and fought kwan shouted something mae felt hands hands on her wrists everything about her was slimy with sweat no one could hold her she was hot and wringing wet one minute thirtyfive seconds in new york people were holding hands and singing iheard the news today oh boy in kizuldah mr wings fireworks erupted crackling above the ancient fields blue and white fire danced in the air smoky trailing down like snow made of light the light also danced on the water the irrigated fields were full of little boats made of fire tracing the pattern of the ancient canals mae heaved to suck in air it came with a thin popping sound slithering up and over the thing in her throat she roared again with the sound of vomit and bent over fortynine seconds in japan there was a new building made all of wood to celebrate and balloons were bobbing ready to be released fire burned the inside of her nostrils everything strained pushing her new empty hungry belly the lacerated gullet it all shifted and something stuck just behind her mouth like everything mae had ever wanted to say i love you kuei i love you siao kwan you are a true friend sunni i am sorry but we are friends now yes sezen i am your mother joe you will always be my husband and like a bubble something burst ten seconds to go maes knees gave way out it moved something encased she felt it move move of its own accord and the envelope tore and something sugary and sweet suddenly poured forth kwan was shouting over all the noise and stroking maes throat its coming shes giving birth through her mouth and then the flood came a flash and a falling backwards and then a waterfall of sound tasteimages sense rising up out of the earth catching fire a flood of air roaring into her head with a sound like bells washing away the breakage of the previous format mae thought this time it will be right this time it will be safe the people were imprinted again because of mae it was still the un format it was not the un format that had made her ill but the mailbox program there was no need for a different format she had wrote and told bugsy that bugsy had written a second powerful article do we want a company to own our souls there were voices in the air like birds and they shouted in all languages hello hello hello mae understood them understood all the languages she tasted the tang of new york the restraint and pride of japan the waves of salt from her own people and bay toh van come sing a song of joy air bloomed as gently as knowledge itself thing after thing was learned as ignorance was healed like a suppurated wound cars telephones the kings of england the japanese yen the euro the space shuttle the iron molecules on old computer disks and the joyful ghosts they came running even as mae choked and clenched for one last time bugsynouvelles babe honey did you make it my baby ive just had my baby bay toh van boomed bugsy did a virtual dance in the air and mae looked down under crackling light tunchkn well mae you won you beat even me we all won chunglarm hiya mom show us kizuldah we can see with your eyes mom and mae looked down at the thing that hung out of her mouth sunni held one hand kwan the other and kueis arm was around her back the newborn was tiny the size of a hand how could it shrink so small and it was burned black black by acids its tiny fingers seemed melted together and its tiny genitals were a blur of ruined flesh and its eyes had been seared shut and the child beamed smiling joyful dazed the babe had been formatted it was full of beethoven the history of karzistan the hysterical voices of joy live from beijing a new wall of collab music rolling across the landscape from new york and a sudden huge warm hand of love reaching into it mae spoke to it through air my little future you are blind but you will not need to see for we can all see for you and sights and sounds will pass through to you from us you have no hands but you will not need hands for your mind will control the machines and they will be as hands your ears also burned away but you will hear more in one hour than we heard in all of our lifetimes i am called your mother and then mae looked up youre alive said kwan we all are said mae and she caught up the dangling child and its father reached out for it held it and cradled it he burns kuei chuckled the child burns but he cradled him to his breast the light flicked and crackled for one last time the fireworks of kizuldah fell away to nothing kwan gave her a tug mae and kwan sunni siao kuei and his new son old mrs tung all of them turned and walked together into the future
