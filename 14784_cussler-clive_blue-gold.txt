clive cussler blue gold numa files prolog sao paulo airport brazil with a powerful kick from its twin turbofan engines the sleek executive jet lifted off the runway and shot into the vaulted skies above sao paulo climbing rapidly over the biggest city in south america the learjet soon reached its cruising altitude of thirtynine thousand feet and raced toward the northwest at five hundred miles an hour seated in a comfortable rearfacing chair at the back of the cabin professor francesca cabral peered wistfully out the window at the cottony cloud cover already missing the smog cloaked streets and sizzling energy of her hometown a muffled snort from across the narrow aisle interrupted her musings she glanced over at the snoring middleaged man in the rumpled suit and wondered with a shake of her head what her father was thinking when he assigned phillipo rodriques as her bodyguard extracting a folder from her briefcase she jotted notes in the margins of the speech that she planned to deliver at an international conference of environmental scientists in cairo she had gone over the draft a dozen times but her thoroughness was entirely in character francesca was a brilliant engineer and a highly respected professor but in a field and society dominated by males a female scientist was expected to be more than perfect the words blurred on the pages the night before francesca was up late packing and pulling together scientific papers she had been too excited to sleep now she cast an envious glance at the snoozing bodyguard and decided to take a nap she set the speech aside pushed the back of her thickcushioned seat into its reclining position and closed her eyes lulled by the throaty whisper of the turbines she soon dozed off dreams came she was floating on the sea gently rising and falling like a jellyfish buoyed by soft billows it was a pleasant sensation until one wave lifted her high in the air and dropped like a runaway elevator her eyelids fluttered open and she looked around the cabin she had an odd feeling as if someone had grabbed at her heart yet all seemed normal the haunting strains of antonio carlos jobims one note samba played softly over the sound system phillipo was still out cold the sense that something was amiss would not go away she leaned over and gently shook the sleeping mans shoulder phillipo wake up the bodyguards hand went to the holster under his jacket and he came instantly awake when he saw francesca he relaxed senhora im sorry he said with a yawn i fell asleep i did too she paused as if she were listening something isnt quite right what do you mean she laughed nervously i dont know phillipo smiled with the knowing expression of a man whose wife has heard burglars in the night he patted her hand i will go see he got up and stretched then went forward and knocked on the cockpit door the door opened and he stuck his head through francesca heard a murmured conversation and laughter phillipo was beaming broadly when he returned the pilots say everything is okay senhora francesca thanked the bodyguard settled back in her seat and took a deep breath her fears were foolish the prospect of being freed from her mental meat grinder after two years of exhausting work had given her the jitters the project had consumed her drained the hours from her days and nights and demolished her social life her gaze fell on the divan that stretched across the rear of the cabin and she resisted the impulse to see if her metal suitcase was still safely stored in the space behind the sofa cushions she liked to think of the valise as a reverse pandoras box instead of evil good things would pour out when it was opened her discovery would bring health and prosperity to millions and the planet would never be the same again phillipo brought francesca a cold bottle of orange juice she thanked him thinking she had grown to like her bodyguard in the short time she had known him with his wrinkled brown suit balding pepperandsalt hair thin mustache and round spectacles phillipo could have passed for an absentminded academic francesca couldnt know that he had spent years perfecting the shy bumbling manner his carefully cultivated ability to merge into the background like faded wallpaper made him one of the top undercover agents in the brazilian secret service rodriques had been hand picked by her father francesca initially balked at her fathers insistence that a bodyguard accompany her she was far too old to have a babysitter when she saw his genuine concern for her welfare she went along she suspected her father was more worried about goodlooking fortune hunters than for her safety even without her familys wealth francesca would have drawn male attention in a land of dark hair and smoky complexions she was a standout her blueblack almondshaped eyes long lashes and almost perfect mouth were the legacy of her japanese grandfather her german grandmother had passed along her light brown hair her height genes and the teutonic stubbornness of the delicately sculpted jaw her shapely figure she decided long ago had something to do with living in brazil brazilian women seem to have bodies especially designed for the countrys national dance the samba francesca had improved on the natural model by many hours spent in the gym where she went to relieve the tension of her work grandfather had been a minor diplomat when the empire of japan ended under twin mushroom clouds he stayed on in brazil married the daughter of a third reich ambassador similarly unemployed became a brazilian citizen and switched to his first love gardening he moved the family to sao paulo where his landscape company served the rich and powerful he developed close ties with influential government and military figures his son francescas father used those connections to move effortlessly to a highly placed position in the commerce department her mother was a brilliant engineering student who put her academic career aside to become a wife and mother she never regretted her decision at least not openly but she was de lighted that francesca would choose to follow in her academic footsteps her father had suggested that she fly on his executive jet to new york where she would meet with united nations officials before boarding a commercial flight to cairo she was glad to get back to the states if only for a short visit and wished she could make the plane move faster the years she had spent studying engineering at stanford university in california would always be pleasant memories she glanced out the window and realized she had no idea where they were the pilots hadnt re ported on the flights progress since the plane left sao paulo excusing herself to phillipo she went forward and stuck her head in the cockpit bom dia senhores i was wondering where we are and how much longer well be in the air the pilot was captain riordan a rawboned american with crewcut strawcolored hair and a texas accent francesca had never seen him before but that wasnt surprising nor was the fact that riordan was a foreign national although the plane was privately owned it was maintained by a local airline that sup plied pilots bowanis deeyass he said with a lopsided grin his chuck yeager drawl and butchered portuguese grating on her ears sorry for not keeping you up to date miss saw you were sleeping and didnt want to disturb you he winked at the copilot a thickset brazilian whose over muscled physique suggested he spent a lot of time pumping iron the copilot smirked as his eyes roved over francescas body francesca felt like a mother who had come upon two mischievous boys about to play a prank whats our timetable she said in a businesslike manner waall were over venezuela we should be in miami in approximately three hours well stretch our legs while we refuel and should be in new york about three hours after that francescas scientific eye was drawn to the screens on the instrument panel the copilot noticed her interest and couldnt resist the chance to impress a beautiful woman this plane is so smart it can fly itself while we watch the soccer games on tv he said showing his big teeth dont let carlos blow smoke up your flue the pilot said thats the efis the electronic flight instrument system the screens take the place of the gauges we used to use thank you francesca said politely she pointed to another gauge is that a compass she said sim sim the copilot said proud of his successful tutelage then why does it indicate were going almost due north she said with a furrowed brow shouldnt we be heading in a more westerly direction toward miami the men exchanged glances youre quite observant senhora the texan said absolutely right but in the air a straight line isnt always the fastest way between two points has to do with the curvature of the earth like when you fly from the us to europe the shortest way is up and around in a big curve weve also got to deal with cuban airspace dont want to get ol fidel all haired up the quick wink and smirk again francesca nodded appreciatively thank you for your time gentlemen its been most instructive ill let you get back to your work no bother maam any time francesca was fuming as she took her seat fools did they think she was an idiot the curvature of the earth indeed everythings okay like i said phillipo asked looking up from the magazine he was reading she leaned across the aisle and spoke in a low even tone no everything is not okay i think this plane is offcourse she told him about the compass reading i felt something odd in my sleep i think it was the shifting of the plane as they changed direction maybe youre mistaken perhaps but i dont think so did you ask the pilots for an explanation yes they gave me some absurd story saying the shortest distance between two points was not a straight line because of the curvature of the earth he raised an eyebrow apparently surprised by the explanation but he still wasnt convinced i dont know francesca pondered some other inconsistencies do you re member what they said when they came on board about being replacement pilots sure they said the other pilots were called off on another job they took their place as a favor she shook her head peculiar why did they even bring it up its as if they wanted to head off any questions i might have but why i have had some experience in navigation phillipo said thoughtfully i will go see for myself he sauntered up to the cockpit again she heard male laughter and after a few minutes he came back with a smile on his face the smile faded as he sat down theres an instrument in the cockpit that shows the original flight plan we are not following the blue line as we should be you were right about the compass too he said we are not on the correct course what in gods name is going on phillipo a grave expression came onto his face there was something your father didnt tell you i dont understand phillipo glanced toward the closed cockpit he had heard things nothing that would persuade him you were in danger but enough so that he would like the reassurance of knowing i would be nearby if you needed help looks like we could both use some help sim senhora but unfortunately we must do for ourselves do you have a gun she said abruptly of course he said faintly amused at the hardnosed question from this beautiful and cultured woman would you like me to shoot them i didnt meanno of course not she said glumly do you have any ideas a gun is not just for shooting he said you can use it for intimidation use its threat to make people do things they dont want to do like pointing us in the right direction i hope senhora i will go forward i will ask them politely to land at the nearest airport saying it is your wish if they refuse i will show them my gun and say i would not like to use it you cant use it francesca said with alarm if you put a hole in the plane at this altitude it would depressurize the cabin and wed all be dead within seconds a good point it will increase their fear he took her hand and squeezed it i told your father i would watch out for you senhora she shook her head as if it would make the situation go away what if im wrong that these are innocent pilots doing their job simple he said with a shrug we call ahead on the radio we land at the nearest airport we bring in the police we straighten things out then we resume our trip they cut their conversation short the door to the cockpit had opened and the captain stepped into the cabin he ambled forward having to bend his head because of the low overhead that was some joke you just told us he said with his crooked grin got any more sorry senhor phillipo said waall i got one for you the pilot replied riordans droopy heavylidded eyes gave him a sleepy look but there was nothing sluggish about the way he reached behind his back and produced the pistol he had tucked in his belt hand it over he said to phillipo real slow phillipo gingerly opened his jacket wide so the shoulder holster was in plain view then extracted his gun by the tips of his fingers the pilot stuck the gun in his belt grazyeass amigo he said always nice to deal with a professional he sat on an armrest and with his free hand lit a cigarette me and my partner have been talking and we think maybe youre on to us figured you were checking us out when you came up a second time so we decided to lay it all out so there wont be any misunderstandings captain riordan what is going on francesca said where are you taking us they said you were smart the pilot said with a chuckle my partner never should have started bragging about the plane he blew twin plumes of smoke from his nostrils youre right were not going to miami were on our way to trinidad trinidad i hear its a real nice place i dont understand its like this senyoreeta theres going to be a welcome party waiting for you at the airport dont ask me who they are cause i dont know alls i know is weve been hired to deliver you things were supposed to go nice and easy we were going to tell you we had mechanical problems and needed to land what happened to the pilots phillipo asked they had an accident he said with a slight shrug he ground the cigarette butt on the floor heres the situation miss you just stay put and everything will be fine as for you cavaleiro im sorry to get you in trouble with your bosses now i can tie you both up but i dont think youd try anything foolish unless you can fly this plane yourselves one more thing up partner and turn around thinking he was about to be frisked phillipo complied without protest francescas warning came too late the pistol barrel arced down in a silvery blur and struck the bodyguard above the right ear the sickening crunch was drowned out by the bodyguards cry of pain as he doubled over and crumpled onto the floor francesca jumped up from her seat why did you do that she said defiantly you have his gun he couldnt harm you sorry miss im a firm believer in insurance riordan stepped over the prostrate form in the aisle as if it were a sack of potatoes nothing like a cracked skull to discourage a man from getting into trouble theres a first aid kit up there on the wall taking care of him should keep you busy til its time to set down he tipped his hand to his cap strolled back to the cockpit and shut the door francesca knelt by the stricken bodyguard she soaked cloth napkins in mineral water and cleaned the wound then applied pressure until the bleeding was stanched she daubed an antiseptic on the scalp cut and the bruised skin around it wrapped ice in another napkin and pressed it to the side of the mans head to prevent swelling as francesca sat by his side she tried to piece the puzzle together she ruled out a kidnapping for money the only reason someone would go through this much trouble would be for her process whoever was behind this mad scheme wanted more than a scale model and the papers explaining her work they could have broken into the lab or grabbed her luggage at the airport but they needed francesca to interpret her findings her process was so arcane so different that it didnt conform to the norms of science which is why no one had thought of it before the whole thing didnt make sense within a day or two she was going to give the process to the countries of the world for nothing no patents no copyright no royalty fees absolutely free of charge anger smoldered in her breast these ruthless people were stopping her from improving the lot of millions phillipo groaned he was coming around his eyes blinked open and came into focus are you all right she said it hurts like the devil so i must be alive help me sit up please francesca put her arm around phillipo and lifted until he sat with his back against a seat she unscrewed a bottle of rum from the bar and put it to his lips he sipped some liquor managed to keep it down then took a healthy swallow he sat there for a moment waiting to see if his guts would come up when he didnt vomit he smiled ill be fine thank you she handed him his glasses im afraid they were broken when he hit you he tossed them aside they are only plain glass i can see fine without them the level eyes that bored into francesca were not those of a frightened man he glanced at the closed cockpit door how long have i been out twenty minutes maybe good there is still time time for what his hand slid down to his ankle and came up filled with a snubnosed revolver if our friend hadnt been so anxious to give me a headache he would have found this he said with a grim smile this was definitely not the same rumpled man who had seemed more like an absentminded professor than a bodyguard francescas elation was tempered by reality what can you do they have at least two guns and we cant fly the plane forgive me senhora cabral another failure to be forthright on my part sounding almost guilty he said i forgot to mention that i was in the brazilian air force before i joined the secret service please help me up francesca was speechless what other rabbits would this man pull out of his hat she gave him a hand until he was able to stand on shaky legs after a minute a new strength and determination seemed to flow through his body stay here until i tell you what to do he said with the air of a man used to people obeying his command he went forward and opened the door the pilot glanced over his shoulder and said hey look whos back from the land of the living dead guess i didnt hit you hard enough you dont get a second chance phillipo said he jammed the revolver barrel under the texans ear hard enough to hurt if i shoot one of you the other can still fly which one will it be christ you said you took his gun carlos said youve got a short memory cavaleiro the pilot replied calmly you shoot us and whos going to fly the plane i will cavaleiro sorry i didnt bring my pilots license with me youll have to take my word for it riordan turned his head slightly and saw the cold smile wreathing the bodyguards face i take back what i said about dealing with a professional riordan said what now partner give me the two guns one at a time the pilot handed over his pistol and the one he had taken from phillipo the bodyguard passed the weapons back to francesca who had come up behind him get out of your seat he ordered backing into the cabin slowly riordan caught the copilots eye and levered himself out of his seat using his body to shield the gesture he made a quick palmdown flip with his hand the copilot nodded almost imperceptibly to show he understood the pilot followed phillipo as if drawn by an imaginary leash as the bodyguard backed up into the cabin i want you to go lie facedown on the divan phillipo said keeping his gun pointed at riordans chest hell i was hoping i could take a nap the pilot said thats real kind of you francesca had backed off the aisle to make room for the two men to pass phillipo asked her to get some plastic trash bags from under a front seat phillipo intended to use the bags to bind the pilot with riordan on ice he would only have to deal with the copilot the cabin was about twelve feet long in the tight space phillipo had to step aside to let the other man pass he re minded riordan not to try anything at close quarters because it would be impossible to miss riordan nodded and stepped to ward the rear they were only a few inches apart when the co pilot put the plane over on its left side riordan had expected the move but he didnt know when it would come or that it would be so violent he lost his balance and was thrown onto a seat his head slamming into the bulkhead phillipo was lifted off his feet he flew across the cabin and landed on top of riordan the pilot disentangled his right hand and blasted his big fist into the bodyguards jaw phillipo saw galaxies whirling over his head and almost blacked out but he managed to keep a death grip on the gun riordan brought his arm back for another punch phillipo blocked it with his elbow both men were street fighters phillipo clawed at riordans eyes the pilot bit phillipo on the fleshy part of the palm the bodyguard jammed his knee into riordans groin and when the pilot opened his mouth phillipo snapped his head forward smashing the cartilage in riordans nose he might have gained the upper hand but at that point the copilot made the plane yaw sharply to the right the struggling men flew across the aisle into the opposite seat now the american was on top phillipo tried to club riordan with the guns muzzle but the pilot grabbed his wrist with two hands and twisted it away and down phillipo was strong but he was no match for the doubleteamed assault the barrel swung closer to his midsection the pilot had his hands on the gun and was wrestling it away phillipo tried to hold on to the pistol almost had control of it again but the grip was slippery from the jets of blood flowing from riordans nose in a wrenching twist the pilot took control of the gun got his fingertip onto the trigger and squeezed there was a muffled crack phillipos body jerked and then went limp as the bullet plowed into his chest the plane righted itself as the copilot put it back into its nor mal position riordan stood and staggered toward the cockpit he stopped and turned apparently sensing something wasnt right the gun he had left behind was propped up on the body guards chest phillipo was trying to steady it for a shot riordan charged like a wounded rhino the pistol cracked the first bullet hit the pilot in the shoulder and he kept coming phillipos brain died but his finger twitched twice more the second shot caught the pilot in the heart and killed him instantly the third went wild and missed him completely even as the pilot crashed to the floor the pistol had dropped from phillipos hand the struggle from one side of the cabin to the other had taken only a few seconds francesca had been thrown between the seats and played possum as the bloodied pilot was making his way back to the cockpit the shots sent her down again she cautiously stuck her head into the aisle and saw the pilots still body she crawled over to phillipos side pried the pistol from his bloody hands and approached the cockpit door too enraged to feel fear her anger quickly turned to shock the copilot was slumped forward his body held in place by his seatbelt there was a bullet hole in the partition separating the cockpit from the cabin and through the back of the copilots chair phillipos third shot francesca pulled the copilot upright his groan told her he was still alive can you talk she said carlos rolled his eyes and whispered a hoarse yes good youve been shot but i dont think it hit any vital organs she lied im going to stop the bleeding she retrieved the first aid kit thinking that what she really needed was an emergencyroom trauma unit she almost fainted at the sight of the blood flowing from the wound down his back to puddle on the floor the compress she applied immediately turned scarlet but it may have helped stanch the loss of blood it was impossible to tell the only thing she knew for certain was that the man was going to die with fearful apprehension she looked at the glowing instrument panel numbed by the realization that this dying man was the key to her survival she had to keep him alive francesca retrieved the bottle of rum and tilted it to the copilots lips the rum dribbled down his chin and the little amount he swallowed made him cough he asked for more the strong liquor brought color to his pale cheeks and the gleam of life back into the glazed eyes she put her lips close to his ear you must fly she said levelly its our only chance the proximity of a beautiful woman seemed to give him energy his eyes were glassy but alert he nodded and reached out with shaking hand to flick on the radio that connected him directly with traffic control in rio francesca eased into the pilots seat and slipped on the headset the voice of the traffic controller came on carlos asked for help with his eyes francesca began to talk explaining their predicament to traffic control what do you advise us to do she said after an agonizing pause the voice said proceed to caracas immediately caracas too far carlos croaked mustering the strength to talk someplace closer several more moments dragged by the dispatchers voice came back theres a small provincial airstrip two hundred miles from your position at san pedro out side caracas no instrument approach but the weather is perfect can you make it yes francesca said the copilot fumbled with the keypad of the flight computer with all the strength at his command he called up the international identifier for san pedro and entered it in the computer guided by the computer the plane began to make a turn carlos smiled slightly didnt i tell you this plane flies by itself senhora his wheezy words had a drowsy quality to them he was obviously becoming weaker from loss of blood it was only a matter of time before he passed out i dont care who flies it she said sharply just get us on the ground carlos nodded and set up the automatic descent profile on the flight computer to take the plane down to two thousand feet the plane began to descend through the clouds and before long patches of green were visible the sight of land reassured and terrified francesca at the same time her terror rose a few degrees when carlos shuddered as if an electric current had gone through him he grabbed francescas hand and held it in a death grip cant make san pedro he said his voice a wet rattle youve got to francesca said no use damn it carlos you and your partner got us into this mess and youre going to get us out of it he smiled vacantly what are you going to do senhora shoot me her eyes blazed youll wish i had if you dont get this thing down he shook his head emergency landing our only chance find a place the big cockpit window offered a view of the thickgrown rain forest francesca had the feeling she was flying over a vast unbroken field of broccoli she scanned the endless greenery again it was hopeless wait sunlight glinted off something shiny whats that she said pointing carlos disconnected the auto pilot and auto throttles took the wheel in his hands and steered toward the reflection which came from the sun glinting off a giant waterfall a narrow meandering river came into view alongside the river was an irregularly shaped clearing of yellow and brown vegetation flying almost on automatic himself carlos passed the open area and set up a thirtydegree banking turn to the right he ex tended the wing flaps and put the plane in a boxlike flight pat tern with a hard right he prepared the plane for its final approach they were at eighteen hundred feet descending on a long shallow glide carlos extended the wing flaps to slow them down further too low he growled the treetops were rushing at them with superhuman strength born of desperation he reached out and gave the throttles more power the plane began to rise through blurred vision he scoped the final approach his heart fell it was a terrible landing field small and lumpy the size of a postage stamp they were doing a hundred and sixty miles per hour too fast a soggy gasp escaped from his throat his head lolled onto his shoulder blood gushed from his mouth the fingers that had clutched the wheel so tightly were curled in a useless death grip it was a tribute to his skill that in his last moments he had trimmed the plane perfectly the jet maintained trim and when it hit the ground it bounced into the air a few times like a stone skipped across water there was an earsplitting shriek of tortured metal as the bottom of the fuselage made contact with the earth the friction between the plane and the solid earth slowed it down but it was still going more than a hundred miles an hour the fuselage cut ting through the ground like the blade of a plow the wings snapped off and the fuel tanks exploded leaving twin black and orange swaths of fire in the planes wake for another thousand feet as it hurtled toward a bend in the river the plane would have disintegrated if the grasscovered ground had not given way to the soft marshy mud along the riverbank stripped of its wings its blue and white skin splattered with mud the plane looked like a giant wormlike creature trying to burrow into the mire the plane skidded over the surface of the muck and finally came to a lurching stop the impact hurled francesca forward into the instrument panel and she blacked out except for the crackle of burning grass the ripple of river water and the hiss of steam where the hot metal touched the water all was silent before long ghostly shadows emerged from the forest as quiet as smoke they moved in closer to the shattered wreckage of the plane san diego california chapter west of encinitas on the pacific coast the graceful motor yacht nepenthe swung at anchor the grandest craft in a flotilla that seemed to include every sailboat and powerboat in san diego with her fluid drawnout lines the spearlike sprit jutting from the thrusting clipper bow and her flaring transom the twohundredfootlong nepenthe looked as if she were made of fine white china floating on a delft sea her paint glistened with a mirror finish and her bright work sparkled under the california sun flags and pennants snapped and fluttered from stem to stern bobbing balloons occasionally broke loose to soar into the cloudless sky in the yachts spacious british empirestyle salon a string quartet played a vivaldi piece for the eclectic gathering of black clad hollywood types corpulent politicians and sleek tv anchors who milled around a thicklegged mahogany table devouring pate beluga caviar and shrimp with the gusto of famine victims outside crowding the sundrenched decks children sat in wheelchairs or leaned on crutches munching hot dogs and burgers and enjoying the fresh sea air hovering over them like a mother hen was a lovely woman in her fifties gloria ekharts generous mouth and cornflowerblue eyes were familiar to mil lions who had seen her movies and watched her popular sitcom on tv every fan knew about ekharts daughter elsie the pretty frecklefaced young girl who scooted around the deck in a wheel chair ekhart had given up acting at the peak of her career to de vote her fortune and time to helping children like her own the influential and wellheeled guests chugging down dom perignon in the salon would be asked later to open their checkbooks for the ekhart foundation ekhart had a flair for promotion which was why she leased the nepenthe for her party in when the vessel slid off the ways at the g l watson boatyard in glasgow she was among the most graceful motor yachts ever to sail the seas the yachts first owner an english earl lost her in an allnight poker game to a hollywood mogul with a penchant for cards marathon parties and underage starlets she went through a succession of equally indifferent owners winding up in a failed attempt as a fishing boat smelling of dead fish and bait the rotting yacht languished in the back corner of a boatyard she was rescued by a silicon valley magnate who tried to recoup the millions he spent restoring the vessel by leasing her out for events such as the ekhart fundraiser a man wearing a blue blazer with an official race badge pinned to the breast pocket had been peering through binoculars at the flat green expanse of the pacific he rubbed his eyes and squinted into the lenses again in the distance thin white plumes were etched against the blue sky where it met the water he lowered the binoculars raised an aerosol canister with a plastic trumpet attached and pressed the button three times hawnk hawnk hawnk the klaxons blaring squawk echoed across the water like the mating call of a monster gander the flotilla took up the signal a cacophony of bells whistles and horns filled the air and drowned out the cry of hungry gulls hundreds of spectators excitedly reached for their binoculars and cameras boats heeled dangerously as passengers shifted to one side on the nepenthe the guests wolfed down their food and poured from the salon sipping from glasses of bubbly they shaded their eyes and looked off in the distance where the feathery plumes were thickening into bantam rooster tails carried on the breeze was a sound like an angry swarm of bees in a circling helicopter a thousand feet above the nepenthe a sturdy italian photographer named carlo pozzi tapped the pilots shoulder and pointed to the northwest the water was marked by parallel white streaks advancing as if plowed by a huge invisible harrow pozzi checked his safety harness stepped out onto a runner with one foot and hefted a fiftypound television camera onto his shoulder leaning with a practiced stance into the wind that buffeted his body he brought the extraordinary power of his lens to bear on the advancing lines he swept the camera from left to right giving viewers around the world an overview of the dozen race boats cutting furrows in the sea then he zoomed in on a pair of boats leading the pack by a quarter of a mile the speeding craft skimmed the wave tops their fortyfoot hulls planing with elevated bows as if trying to escape the restraints of gravity the lead boat was painted a bold firehouse red trailing by less than a hundred yards the second boat sparkled like a gold nugget the boats were more like star fighters than craft designed for travel over water their flat decks connected two knifeedged catamaran hulls called sponsons and aerodynamic wings over the engine compartments twin ftype canopies were set sidebyside twothirds of the way back from the sharppointed double prows squeezed into the red boats righthand canopy his sun bronzed face fixed in a mask of determination i curt austin braced himself as the eightton craft slammed against the concretehard water again and again unlike a land vehicle the boat had no shock absorbers to cushion the jarring impact each jolt traveled through the onepiece kevlar and carbon composite hull up through austins legs and rattled his teeth despite his broad shoulders his muscular biceps and the fivepoint harness system that strapped his twohundredpound frame in place he felt like a basketball being dribbled down the court by michael jordan every ounce of strength in his muscular sixfootone body was needed to keep a steady hand on the trim tabs and the throttle levers and a firm left foot on the engine pedal controlling the pressure in the mighty twin turbos that sent the boat thundering over the water jose joe zavala sat hunched over the steering wheel in the left canopy his gloved hands tightly gripped the small black wheel that seemed inadequate for the task of keeping the boat pointed in the right direction he felt as if he were aiming rather than steering the boat his mouth was set in a grim line the large dark brown eyes had lost their usual soulful look as they strained intently through the tinted plexiglas visor to read the sea conditions for changes in wind or wave height the upand down movement of the bow compounded the difficulty where austin gauged the boats behavior quite literally by the seat of his pants zavala felt the waves and troughs through his steering wheel austin barked into the intercom mike that connected the canopies whats our speed zavala glanced at the digital speed gauge one twentytwo his eyes went to the gps position and compass right on course austin checked his watch and looked down at the chart fastened to his right thigh the onehundredsixtymile race began in san diego made two sharp turns around santa catalina is land and came back to the starting point giving thousands of spectators along the beaches a view of the dramatic finish the final turn should be coming up any minute he squinted through the spraysplashed canopy and saw a vertical line off to the right then another sailboat masts the spectator fleet flanked a wide swath of open water once past the spectators the racers would pick up the coast guard cutter near the turn buoy and head into the last lap he snapped a quick glance over his right shoulder and caught the reflection of the sun off gold kicking it up to onethirty austin said the hard shocks coming through the steering wheel indicated that the wave height was growing zavala had observed white flecks in the water and a distinct marbling to the seas that told him the wind was up dont know if we should zavala yelled over the shriek of the engines picking up a slight chop wheres ali baba practically in our back pocket hes crazy if he makes his play now he should just lie back and let us take the lumps like hes been doing then go for the home stretch sea and wind are too unpredictable ali doesnt like to lose zavala grunted okay take it to one twentyfive maybe hell back off austin pushed down with his fingertips on the throttles and felt a surge of speed and power a moment later zavala reported doing one twentyseven seems okay the gold boat fell back then speeded up to keep pace austin could read the black lettering on the side flying carpet the boats driver was hidden behind the tinted glass but austin knew the bearded young omar sharif lookalike would be grinning from ear to ear the son of a dubai hotel magnate ali bin said was one of the toughest competitors in one of the worlds most competitive and dangerous sports class offshore power boat racing ali came within a whisker of beating austin at the dubai duty free grand prix the year before the loss in his own back yard before his home audience was particularly galling ali had beefed up the power in the carpets twin lamborghini engines with improvements in its power plant the red ink squeezed out a few extra miles per hour but austin estimated alis boat was a match for his at the prerace briefing ali had jokingly accused austin of calling in the national underwater amp marine agency to quell the seas in his boats path as leader of the special assignments team for numa austin had the resources of the huge agency at his command but he knew better than to play king canute ali had been beaten not by engine power but by the way austin and his numa partner clicked together as a team zavala with his dark complexion and thick straight black hair always combed straight back could have passed for the maitre d in a posh acapulco resort hotel the slight smile al ways on his lips masked a steely resolve forged in his college days as a middleweight boxer and honed by the frequent challenges of his numa assignments the gregarious and soft spoken marine engineer had thousands of hours piloting helicopters small jets and turboprop aircraft and easily switched to the cockpit of a race boat working with austin as if they were parts in a precision machine he took command of the race from the second the referee raised the green starting flag they were up on plane at a nearideal angle and blasted across the start line at one hundred and thirty miles per hour every boat had hit the finish line with throttle straight out two harddriven competitors blew out their engines on the first lap one flipped on the first turn probably the most dangerous part of any race and the rest were simply outclassed by the two leaders the red ink rocketed by the others as if they were stuck on fly paper only the flying carpet kept pace during the first catalina island turn zavala had maneuvered the red ink around the buoy so that ali went wide the fing carpet had been playing catchup ever since now the carpet had taken wing and was coming abreast of the red ink austin knew of alis lastminute switch to a smaller propeller that would be better in rough seas austin wished he could trade in his large calmwater propeller ali had been smart to listen to his weather sense rather than the forecast im cranking her up another notch austin shouted shes at oneforty now zavala yelled back winds up shell kite if we dont slow down austin knew a highspeed turn was risky the twin catamaran sponsons skated across the surface with practically no water resistance the same design that allowed for high speed over the wave tops also meant wind could get under the hull lift it in a kiting motion or even worse flip it back onto its deck the flying carpet continued to gain austins fingertips played over the tops of the throttle levers he hated to lose his combativeness was a trait hed inherited from his father along with the football player physique and eyes the color of coral underwater one day it would get him killed but not today he eased back on the throttles the maneuver may have saved their lives a whitecrested fourfoot rogue sea was racing in off the port bow practically snarling as it bore down on them zavala saw it angling in prayed theyd clear it knew instantly that the timing was all wrong the wave hooked one of the sponsons like a cats claw the red ink was launched spinning into space with lightning reflexes zavala steered in the direction of the spin like a driver caught on an ice patch the boat splashed into the water sideways rolled so the canopies were buried then righted after a few more yaws ali slowed down but once he saw they were all right he gunned his engines throwing caution to the winds he wanted to finish as far ahead of austin as possible ignoring the advice of his veteran throttle man hank smith ali pushed his boat to the edge the giant rooster tail arced high in the air for hundreds of feet and the twin propellers plowed a wide and double furrowed wake for hundreds more sorry about that zavala called out caught a wave great save lets go for second place austin pushed the throttles forward and with a scream of the engines they were off in hot pursuit high above the race course the italian tv cameraman had spotted the dramatic reversal of the lead boats the chopper swooped out in a wide circle and came back over the flotilla to hover at midchannel pozzi wanted a wide shot of the lone boat speeding past the spectators to the turn buoy for the final approach to san diego the cameraman glanced at the sea below to get his bearings and saw wavelets outlining a large shiny grayish object mounding at the surface a trick of the light no there was definitely something there he caught the attention of the pilot and pointed straight down what the hell is that the pilot said pozzi aimed the camera at the object and zoomed in with the touch of a button its a balena he said as the object came into focus for gods sake speak english how you say a whale oh yeah the pilot replied you see them migrating dont worry hell dive when he hears the boats no carlo said with a shake of his head i think hes dead hes not moving the pilot put the chopper at a slight angle for a better view hell youre right theres another one im counting threeno four damn theyre popping up all over the place he switched to the hailing channel come in san diego coast guard this is the tv helicopter over the race course emergency a voice crackled over the radio coast guard station at cabrillo point go ahead im seeing whales in the race course whales yeah maybe a dozen i think theyre dead roger the radio man said well alert the cutter on scene to check them out too late the pilot said youve got to stop the race a tense silence followed then roger well try a moment later in response to a call from the station the coast guard cutter moved from its post at the turn buoy orange signal flares blossomed against the blue sky ali saw neither the flares nor the bloated gray carcass floating in his path until it was too late he yanked the wheel missed the obstruction by inches dodged another body but could not avoid a third he veered off yelling at hank to cut power smiths fingers flew to the throttle and the planing hull settled down the carpet was still going fifty miles an hour when it hit the carcass with an explosion of foul air the body popped like a huge blubbery balloon the boat careened off on one sponson ripped somersaulted and miraculously landed rightside up again ali and the throttle man were saved from fractured skulls by their helmets working through a black haze ali reached for the wheel and tried to turn but there was no response from the rudder he called out to the throttle man hank was slumped over the throttles on the nepenthe the captain had left the bridge and was down on the deck talking to gloria ekhart when the actress leaned over the rail and pointed excuse me captain whats that gold boat doing the flying carpet was wallowing like a punchdrunk boxer trying to find a neutral corner then the twin bows came around and the boat straightened out gained speed and assumed a trajectory aimed at the yachts midships the captain waited for the boat to veer off it kept coming alarmed he calmly excused himself stepped aside and whipped a walkie talkie from his belt his mental computer was calculating how long it would take the gold boat to hit them this is the captain he barked into the hand radio get this ship under way now sir during the race are you deaf weigh anchor and move this ship out now move where sir they had a snowballs chance in hell of getting under way in time and his helmsman wanted to play twenty questions forward he shouted close to panic just move it even as he barked the order the captain knew it was too late the race boat had already cut the distance in half he started to herd children to the other side of the yacht maybe a few lives would be saved although he doubted it the wooden hull would shatter into splinters fuel would be spilled in a fiery conflagration and the yacht would go to the bottom within minutes as the captain grabbed onto a wheelchair with a little girl in it and pushed her across the deck he yelled at others to do the same too frozen by fear to react ekhart saw the gold torpedo speeding toward them and instinctively did the only thing she could she put her arm protectively around her daughters thin shoulders and held her tight chapter austin was not surprised to see alis boat go out of control ali was begging for a flip or a hook it was the nature of the accident that puzzled austin the flying carpet veered sharply in a sloshing foamy skid then living up to its name went airborne with one side higher than the other like a stunt car doing a twowheeler off a low ramp the catamaran flew bowfirst for several boat lengths landed with a monumental splash vanished for a moment then bobbed to the surface rightside up austin and zavala had found that a speed just under a hundred miles per hour kept them ahead of the pack but was slow enough to deal with changing water and wind conditions the sea was a mix of small and moderate waves some longer than others but most crested with white foam not exactly force on the beau fort scale but nothing to ignore they kept a sharp eye out for the sudden buildup of an errant sea that could trip them up again zavala had brought the red ink around in a wide sweeping curve and pointed the bows toward alis boat to see if he needed help as the boat topped a wave and slid down the other side zavala swerved sharply to avoid a gray object longer than the race boat the boat did a seamstretching giant slalom run around three more large slatecolored mounds whales zavala shouted with excitement theyre every where austin reduced their speed by half they passed another lifeless carcass and a smaller one nearby that could have been a calf gray whales he said with wonder a whole pod of them they dont look healthy zavala said not healthy for us either austin said backing off the throttles its like a minefield out here alis boat had been slithering aimlessly around in the waves the propeller chewing at air the bows rose suddenly the stern sank the blades bit hungrily into the water and the flying carpet was off like a jackrabbit spooked by a hunting dog it accelerated rapidly quickly coming up on plane and headed toward the spectator fleet macho hombre zavala said with admiration bounces off a whale and goes to shake hands with his fans austin also thought ali was taking a bow alis boat streaked across the open water like a gold arrow homing in on a bulls eye with his eye austin drew an invisible line on the water ex tending the flying carpets course until it intersected with a big white boat that was anchored broadside to the race chute the graceful lines identified the vessel as an old luxury yacht austin noted with appreciation how the designers had blended form and function in the wooden hull he glanced again at alis boat it was moving faster continuing toward the yacht in an undeviating line why havent they stopped or turned away austin knew a race boats hull was tougher than nails but the rudders and the connecting tie bar were exposed if the bar had been bent the rudders could have been locked in place well so what even if the steering were locked all the crew had to do was shut down the engines and if the throttle man couldnt do it the racer could use the kill switch activated by an arm cord the boat had struck the whale a glancing blow but the impact still would have been severe even worse when it slammed down onto the water it would have been like hitting cement even with helmets and restraining harnesses alis team might have been shaken up at the very least or worse incapacitated he looked back at the yacht and saw the young faces lining the decks good god kids the yacht was full of kids there was a flurry of activity on deck they had seen the on coming race boat the yachts anchor was coming out of the water but the boat would have to sprout wings to avoid a disastrous collision its going to hit zavala said more in wonder than in apprehension austins hand seemed to move by itself the fingertips pushing down on the throttles engines roaring the red ink lurched forward as if it were a racehorse stung by a bee the acceleration caught zavala by surprise but he tightened his grip on the steering wheel and pointed the red ink at the runaway boat their ability to intuit what the other was thinking had saved their skin more than once while carrying out a numa assignment austin slammed the throttles forward the catamaran came up on plane and streaked across the open water they were going twice the speed of the carpet coming in at an angle interception was only seconds away keep us parallel and come up alongside austin said when i yell nudge him to starboard austins brain synapses danced with enough electrical energy to light up a city the red ink went up the side of a wave flew through the air and came down with a jawjarring splash the yacht was moving slowly forward this would give them a slight increase in the margin of error but not much the two boats were almost side by side zavala displayed his incredible skill as a pilot bringing the red ink closer despite the waves from the broadening wake austin let them overtake the capet move past it then slowly pulled back on the throttles to match the speed of the other boat they were only yards apart austin had slipped into the nether land between intellect and action pure reflex his every sense at full alert the earsplitting thunder of four powerful engines drowned out attempts at rational thought he had become one with the red ink his muscles and sinews joined with the steel and kevlar as much a part of the boat as the pistons and driveshaft the boats were out of sync one up when the other was down austin finetuned the red inks speed until they were like two dolphins swimming abreast in perfect formation up down up now he yelled the space between the racing boats narrowed to inches zavala eased the steering wheel to the right it was a delicate maneuver if it were done too sharply they would hook hulls and possibly flip into the air in a lethal tangle there was a loud hollow thump and a screech of tortured carbon composite as the hulls came together then bounced apart zavala brought the boat over again and held it firmly in position the wheel wanted to tear itself out of his hands austin gunned the throttles the sound of the engines was horrendous again the boats crashed it was like trying to herd a very large and powerful steer eventually the fing carpet began to yield its forward momentum and angle off to the right they drifted apart once more warmed to the game zavala slammed the boats together the angle increased haul off joe alis boat surged ahead on a track that would miss the yachts stern and sped toward the flotilla boats scattered like dry leaves in a wind austin knew that battering alis boat off course would send the red ink off like a cue ball in a game of billiards he hadnt counted on how long it would take to persuade the carpet to take a hike now he and joe were hurtling toward the moving yacht with only seconds to spare before they struck it they could see the horrified expressions of the people on deck the boat was going seventyfive miles an hour even if he shut down the engines he and zavala would have to be scraped off the wooden sides of the old boat what now zavala yelled stay on course austin shouted zavala swore softly under his breath he had every confidence in austins ability to get them out of a tight spot but sometimes his partners actions defied all logic if zavala thought the order meant certain suicide he didnt show it his every instinct told him to whip the wheel over and take his chances but he grimly held their insane course as steadily as if the twohundredfoot boat that filled his vision like a big white wall were nothing but a mirage he gritted his teeth and tensed his body in preparation for the impact duck austin ordered keep your head low im going to stuff it he bent and gunned the engines at full throttle at the same time he set the trim tabs and ailerons a stuff was usually some thing to be avoided it happens when a boat comes off one wave and burrows into another the worst type is called a submarine because thats what the boat becomes when it goes into a stuff at high speed far from avoiding this result austin was counting on it happening he held his breath as the race boat nosed down at a sharp angle buried its bows in the water and kept on going burrowing into the sea like a badger with the full power of the engines behind it the red ink was transformed from a surface boat into a submersible the boat passed under the moving yacht but not quite deep enough to prevent its canopies from being ripped off there was a sickening watery crunch the whirling propellers missed their heads by inches then the catamaran passed under the yacht and emerged on the other side exploding from the water like a very large and very red flying fish it came to a halt as the burbling engines stalled out in a cloud of purple smoke the boat was built with an interior cage that could resist a herd of overweight elephants the canopies were more vulnerable both plexiglas covers had been completely ripped off the cockpits were taking in seas as the boat rocked in the waves zavala coughed out a mouthful of seawater you okay he asked a stunned look on his dark handsome face austin pulled his helmet off to reveal the thick head of platinum almost white hair he surveyed the propeller scars on the deck and realized how close they had cut it still among the living austin replied but i dont think the red ink was designed to be a convertible zavala felt the water around his waist time to abandon ship consider it an order austin said loosening his harness they piled out of the boat into the sea as part of their certification racers must pass a dunk test a cabin cruiser came over and hauled them dripping from the water minutes before the red ink went to the bottom what happened to the gold race boat austin asked the cruisers owner a pipesmoking middleaged man who had come out of san diego to watch the race and got more than he bar gained for he pointed off in the distance with the stem of his pipe over there the guy plowed right through the fleet dont know how he missed hitting the other boats mind if we check them out no problem the man said obligingly as he put the wheel over moments later they pulled up alongside the fing carpet the canopies had been pushed back austin saw to his relief that the men inside were alive although blood streamed down alis head where hed bashed it and hank looked as if he were nursing a bad hangover austin called out are you injured no ali replied although he didnt look quite convinced of his own wellbeing what happened you hit a whale a what when he saw austins serious expression alis face fell guess we didnt win he said glumly dont feel bad austin said at least your boat doesnt lie on the sea floor sorry ali said sadly then he brightened as a thought hit him then you didnt win either au contraire austin said all four of us won the prize for being the luckiest men alive ali nodded praise allah he said a second before he passed out chapter venezuelan rain forest the thick canopy of overhanging tree branches blotted out the suns rays making the black water in the still pool seem deeper than it was wishing that she hadnt read that the venezuelan government was reintroducing maneating orinoco crocodiles into the wild gamay morgan trout jackknifed her lithe body in a surface dive and with strong kicks of her slender legs descended into the stygian darkness this must be how a prehistoric animal felt sinking into the ooze at the la brea tar pits in california gamay thought she flicked on the twin halogen lights attached to her stingray video camera and swam down to the bottom as she passed over the spinachy vegetation that rose and fell in the slight current as if dancing to music something poked her in the buttocks she whirled around almost more indignant than scared her hand going for the sheath knife at her waist inches from her face mask was a long narrow snout attached to a lumpish pink head with small black eyes the snout waggled back and forth like a scolding finger gamay unclenched her hand from the knife hilt and pushed the snout aside watch it with that thing the sentence streamed out the regulator as a stream of noisy bubbles the thin beak opened in a friendly sharptoothed circus clowns grin then the river dolphins face rotated so that it was looking at her upside down gamay laughed the sounds coming out like the gurgles old faithful makes before it erupts her thumb pressed the valve that allowed air to inflate her buoyancy compensator within seconds her head broke the pools calm surface like a jackinthe box she leaned back into her inflated bc whipped the plastic mouthpiece from between her teeth and broke into a wide grin paul trout was sitting in his tenfoot bombard semiinflatable boat a few yards away doing his job as a dive tender he had followed the foamy air bursts marking his wifes underwater trail he was startled to see her emerge from the black water and nonplussed at her mirth lips pursed in puzzlement he lowered his head in a characteristic pose as if he were peering up over the tops of invisible spectacles are you all right he said blinking his large hazel eyes im fine gamay said although clearly she wasnt her laughter was rekindled by the incredulous expression on pauls face she choked on a mouthful of water the prospect of drowning from laughter made her laugh even more she popped the mouthpiece back into her mouth paul paddled the inflatable closer leaned over the side and offered his hand are you sure youre okay yes im fine she said she regained her composure and spat out the regulator after a fit of wetdog coughs she said id better come aboard clinging to the side of the boat she handed her dive gear up to paul who then reached down and easily lifted her one hundred thirtyfive pounds onto the raft with his tan shorts matching militarystyle shirt with epaulets on the shoulders and floppy brimmed poplin hat he looked like a victorian fugitive from the explorers club the large tropical butterfly perched below his adams apple was actually one of the colorful bow ties he was addicted to trout saw no reason he couldnt be impeccably dressed anywhere even in the depths of the venezuelan rain forest where a loincloth is considered going formal pauls foppish attire belied a potent physical strength built up from his days as a fisherman on cape cod the barnaclehard calluses on his palms were gone but the muscles from hoisting fish boxes lurked behind the razorcreased clothes and he knew how to use the leverage of his sixfooteight body the depth finder says its only thirty feet deep so your giddiness is not caused by nitrogen narcosis he said in his typical analytical way gamay undid the tie holding back the shoulderlength hair whose dark red color had prompted her wine connoisseur father to name his daughter after the grape of beaujolais insightful observation my dear she said wringing the water from her tresses i was laughing because i thought i was the sneaker when i was really the sneakee paul blinked what a relief that certainly clears things know what a sneaker is sneakee on the other hand she flashed a dazzling smile cyrano the dolphin sneaked up and goosed me with his nose i dont blame him he leered at her slimhipped body with a groucho marx hike of his eyebrows mother warned me about men who wear bow ties and part their hair in the middle did i ever tell you you look like lauren hutton he said puffing on an imaginary cigar and that im attracted to women with a sexy space between their front teeth bet you say that to all the girls she said putting a mae west huskiness into her voice which was low and cool by nature i did learn something scientific from cyranos little love poke that you have a nose fetish she gave him a nononsense lift of her eyebrow no al though i wouldnt rule it out i learned that river dolphins may be more primitively developed than their saltwater cousins and more mellow in general than their marine relatives but they are intelligent and playful and have a sense of humor you would need a sense of humor if you were pink and gray had flippers with discernible fingers on them a dorsal fin thats a joke in itself and a head like a deformed cantaloupe not a bad biological observation for a deep ocean geologist glad to be of help she kissed him again on the lips this time i really appreciate your being here and for all the work youve done computer profiling the river its been a nice change im almost sorry to be going home paul looked around at their tranquil surroundings ive actually enjoyed it this place is like a medieval cathedral and the critters have certainly been fun although i dont know if i like them taking liberties with my wife cyrano and i have a purely platonic relationship gamay said with a haughty elevation of her chin he was just trying to get my attention so id give him a treat a treat a fish treat she slapped the side of the inflatable several times with a paddle there was a splash where the lagoon opened into the river a pinkishgray hump with a long low dorsal fin cut a vshaped ripple in their direction it circled the boat emitting a sneezing sound from its blowhole gamay scattered fish meal pellets and the slim beak came out of the water and hungrily snapped them down weve verified those apocryphal stories of dolphins coming on call i can imagine them helping the locals with their fishing as weve heard youve also proven that cyrano has done a good job of training you to give him a snack true but these creatures are supposed to be unfinished versions of the saltwater type so its of interest to me that their brains have advanced faster than their physical appearance they watched the circling dolphin with amusement for a few minutes then aware that the light was waning decided to head back while gamay arranged her gear paul started the outboard motor and headed them out of the lagoon onto the slowmoving river the inky water changed to a strainedpea green the dolphin kept pace but when he saw there would be no more treats he peeled off like a fighter plane before long the thick jungle along the river gave way to a clearing a handful of thatched huts were grouped around a white stucco house with a red tile roof and arcade facade in the spanish colonial style they tied up at a small pier hauled their gear from the boat and walked to the stucco building trailing a chattering gang of half naked indian children the youngsters were shooed away by the housekeeper a formidable spanishindian woman who wielded a broom like a battleax paul and gamay went inside a silverhaired man in his sixties wearing a white shirt with an embroidered front cotton slacks and handmade sandals rose from his desk in the coolness of the study where he had been working on a pile of papers he strode over to greet them with obvious pleasure senor and senora trout good to see you your work went well i trust very well dr ramirez thank you gamay said i had the chance to catalog more dolphin behavior and paul wrapped up his computer modeling of the river i had very little to do with it actually paul said it was mostly a question of alerting researchers at the amazon basin project of gamays work here and asking them to point the landsat satellite in this direction i can finish the computer modeling when we get home and gamay will use it as part of her habitat analysis ill be very sorry to see you go it was kind of the national underwater amp marine agency to lend its experts for a small re search project gamay said without these rivers and the flora and fauna that grow here there would be no ocean life thank you senora gamay as a way of appreciation i have prepared a special dinner for your last night here thats very nice of you paul said well pack early so well be ready for the supply boat i wouldnt be too concerned he said the boat is always late fine with us paul replied well have time to talk some more about your work ramirez chuckled i feel like a troglodyte i still practice my science of botany the old way cutting plants preserving and comparing them and writing reports nobody reads he beamed our little river creatures have never had better friends than you gamay said perhaps our work will show where the dolphins habitat is under environmental threat then something can be done about it he shook his head sadly in latin america government tends to move slowly unless there is someones pocket to be filled worthwhile projects sink into the morass sounds like home our bottomless swamp is named washington dc they were laughing at their shared joke when the house keeper herded a native into the study he was short and muscular wore a loincloth and had large copper loops in his ears his jetblack hair was cut in bangs and his eyebrows had been shaved off he spoke in respectful tones to the doctor but his ex cited speech and darting eyes made it clear something had set him off he kept pointing toward the river dr ramirez grabbed a broadbrimmed panama hat from a hook there is apparently a dead man in a canoe he said my apologies but as the only government representative of any kind within a hundred miles i must investigate may we come gamay said of course i am hardly a sherlock holmes and would welcome other trained scientific eyes you may find this of inter est this gentleman says the dead man is a ghostspirit noting the puzzled reaction of his guests he said ill explain later they hustled from the house and walked quickly past the huts to the edge of the river the men of the village were gathered silently near the water children were trying to peek through their legs the women stayed back the gathering parted as dr ramirez approached tied up to the dock was an ornately carved dugout canoe the dugout was painted white except for the bow which was blue and a blue stripe that extended from the front to the back the body of a young indian man lay on his back inside the canoe like the village indians he had black hair cut in bangs and he wore only a loincloth the resemblance ended there the village men tattooed their bodies or dabbed crimson paint on their high cheekbones to protect them from evil spirits who supposedly cannot see the color red the dead mans nose and chin were painted in a pale blue that extended down his arms the rest of his body was a stark white when dr ramirez leaned into the canoe his shadow startled the greenbottle flies clustered on the dead mans chest and they buzzed off to reveal a gaping circular hole paul sucked his breath in that looks like a gunshot wound i think youre right dr ramirez said a serious look in his deepset eyes it doesnt resemble any spear or arrow wound ive ever seen he turned to the villagers and after a few minutes of conversation translated for the trouts they say they were out fishing when the canoe came floating on the river they recognized it from the color as a ghost spirit boat and were afraid it appeared to be empty so they came alongside they saw the dead man in the canoe and thought they would simply let the boat go on its way then they thought better of it because his spirit might come back to haunt them for not giving him a decent burial so they brought him here and made him my problem why would they be afraid of this ghostspirit gamay asked the doctor tweaked the end of his bushy gray mustache the chulo which is the local name for the tribe this gentleman belongs to are said to live beyond the great falls the natives say they are ghosts who were born of the mists people who have gone into their territory have never come out he gestured to ward the canoe as you can see this gentleman is flesh and blood like the rest of us he reached into the canoe and pulled out a bag made of flayed animal skin that was lying next to the corpse the village natives backed away as if he were brandishing a sack full of black plague he spoke in spanish to one of the indians who became more animated the longer they talked ramirez abruptly ended the conversation and turned to the trouts they are afraid of him he said and indeed the village men were drifting back to their families if you would be so kind we will haul the boat onto shore i persuaded them to dig a hole but not in their own cemetery over there on the other side of the river where nobody goes anyhow the shaman has assured them that he can place enough totems on the grave to keep the dead man from wandering he smiled having the body so near will give the shaman more power when something goes wrong with his spells he can always say the dead mans spirit has returned we will send the boat off by itself down the river and the spirit will be allowed to follow it paul eyed the canoes fine workmanship seems a shame to waste such a beautiful example of boat building anything to keep the peace he grabbed one end of the canoe with the three people pulling and pushing they soon had it up on the shore away from the river ramirez covered the body with a woven blanket from the canoe then he retrieved the sack which was about the size of a golf bag and tied with thongs at the open end perhaps this will tell us more about our ghost he said leading the way back to the house they went into the study and placed the bag on a long library table he untied the thongs opened the bag gingerly and peered inside we must be careful some of the tribes use poisoned arrows or blowgun darts he lifted the bottom of the sack and several smaller bags slid out onto the desk he opened one and extracted a shiny metal disk that he handed to gamay i understand you studied archaeology before you became a biologist perhaps you know what this is gamay furrowed her brow as she examined the flat round object a mirror it appears that vanity is not confined to women paul took the mirror from her hand and turned it over to ex amine the markings on the back a smile crossed his face i had one of these when i was a kid its a signal mirror look these are dots and dashes this isnt like any morse code i know but its not bad see these little stick figures a basic code guy running one way means come facing the other direction is go id guess heres someone lying down stay where you are gamay ventured my guess too these two fellows with spears might mean join me to fight little guy and the animal could stand for hunt he chuckled almost as good as a cell phone better gamay said it doesnt use batteries or cost you per minute paul asked ramirez if he could open another bag and the spaniard gladly assented fishing kit trout said metal hooks fiber line hey he said examining a crude pair of metal pincers bet this is a pair of pliers for pulling hooks out ive got you beat gamay said emptying another bag and pulling out a connected pair of small wooden circles with dark transparent surfaces filling their openings she attached the apparatus to her ears with fiber hoops sunglasses not to be outdone ramirez also had been poking through bags he held a gourd about six inches long unplugged the wooden top and sniffed medicine perhaps it smells like alcohol hanging from the bottom was a miniature bowl and a wooden handle with a flat piece of stone and an irregular wheel on a rotating axis paul stared thoughtfully at the gourd then took it from the other man he filled the dish with the liquid brought the wooden device near and flicked the wheel it scraped across the stone and emitted sparks the liquid ignited with a poof voila he said with obvious satisfaction the very first bic cigarette lighter handy for starting a campfire too more interesting discoveries followed one bag held herbs ramirez identified as medicinal plants including some he had never seen in another was a slim flat piece of metal pointed at both ends when they placed it on a glass of water it swung around until one end pointed toward the magnetic north they found a bamboo cylinder when held to the eye the glass lenses imbedded inside offered about an eightpower telescopic magnification there was a knife that folded into a slim wooden case their last find was a short bow made from overlapping strips of metal like a car spring and curved to provide maximum pull for an arrow the bowstring was of thin metal cable it was hardly the primitive design one would expect to find in the rain forest ramirez ran his hand over the polished metal amazing he said ive never seen anything like this the bows the villagers use are simple dowels pulled back and tied with a crude bowstring how did he learn how to make these things paul said scratching his head gamay said its not just the objects themselves but the material they are made of where did it come from they stood around the table in silence there is a more important question ramirez said somberly who killed him of course gamay said we were so overwhelmed by his technical accomplishments that we forgot that these objects be long to a dead human being do you have any idea who might have murdered him paul asked a dark cloud descended on ramirezs brow poachers wood cutters and burners the latest are men who collect valuable plants for medicine they would kill anyone who got in their way how could a lone indian be a threat gamay asked ramirez shrugged gamay said i think that in a murder investigation you are supposed to start with the corpse where did you hear that paul said i may have read it in a detective novel good advice lets take another look they walked back to the river and uncovered the body paul rolled it over onto its stomach the smaller entry wound indicated that the man had been shot in the back trout gently re moved a carved pendant from around his neck it showed a winged woman holding her hands in front of her as if she were pouring from them he passed it to gamay who said the figure reminded her of egyptian engravings of the rebirth of osiris paul was taking a closer look at the reddish welts on the dead mans shoulders looks like hes been whipped he rolled the body onto its back again hey check out this strange scar he said indicating a pale thin line on the indians lower abdomen if i didnt know better id say he had his appendix out two dugouts arrived from across the river the shaman whose head was adorned with a brilliant crown of feathers announced that the grave was ready trout covered the dead body with the blanket and with gamay at the tiller they used the inflatable to tow the blueandwhite canoe to the other side trout and ramirez carried the body a few hundred yards into the forest and buried it in the shallow hole the shaman surrounded the grave with what looked like various dried chicken parts and solemnly warned the assemblage that the spot would be forever taboo then they towed the empty canoe to midstream where the current would catch it and set the dugout adrift how far will it go paul asked as they watched the blue andwhite craft wheel slowly on its final journey there are rapids not far from here if it isnt broken up on the rocks or caught in the weeds it could continue on to the sea ave atque vale trout said quoting the old roman salute to the dead hail and farewell they went back across the river as ramirez was climbing from the inflatable he slipped on the wet bank are you all right gamay said ramirez grimaced with pain you see the evil spirits have already begun their work ive apparently twisted something ill put a cold compress on it but i may require your assistance to walk he limped back to the house with a hand from the trouts ramirez said he would report the incident to the regional authorities he didnt expect a response a dead indian was still considered a good indian by many in his country well he said brightening what is done is done i look forward to our dinner tonight the trouts went back to their room to rest and clean up for dinner ramirez collected rainwater in a roof cistern and channeled it into a shower gamay had evidently been thinking about the indian as she toweled off she said do you remember the ice man they found in the alps paul had slipped into a silk bathrobe and was stretched out on the bed with his hands behind his head sure stone age guy who got freezedried in a glacier what about him by looking at the tools and possessions he carried it was possible to picture his way of life the indians around here are at a stone age level our bluefaced friend doesnt fit the mold how did he learn to make those things if we had found those tools on the ice man it would be in every newspaper headline i can see it now ice man flicks a bic maybe he subscribes to popular mechanics maybe he gets boys life too but even if he got instructions every month on how to make neat stuff where would he get re fined metals to make them with perhaps dr ramirez can enlighten us at dinner i hope youre hungry paul said he was staring out the window im starved why i just saw a couple of natives carrying a tapir to the barbecue pit chapter as austin stepped through the big bay door into the cavernous building at the san diego naval station his nostrils were assaulted by a hell smell emanating from the three leviathans whose floodlit carcasses were laid out on flatbed trailers the young sailor standing just inside the door had seen the broadshouldered man with the strange white hair approach and assumed from his commanding presence that he was an officer in mufti when austin went to identify himself the sailor snapped to attention seaman cummings sir the seaman said you might want to use this he offered austin a surgical mask similar to the one he was wearing the smell has gotten real strong since they started pulling out the vital organs austin thanked the seaman wondering whom he had offended to pull such foul duty and slipped the mask over his nose the gauze had been sprinkled with a perfumed disinfectant that didnt quite cut the strong odor but subdued the gag reflex what have we got austin said a mama a papa and a baby the sailor said boy what a time we had getting them here the seaman wasnt exaggerating austin thought the final count was fourteen whales disposing of their bodies would have been a tall order even without the turf battles as the first government agency to arrive on the scene the coast guard was worried about hazards to navigation and planned to tow the whales out to sea and sink them with gunfire the highly dramatic tv reports had gone around the world and stirred up animal rights activists who were angrier over the whale deaths than if los angeles had fallen into the pacific ocean with all its in habitants they wanted answers fast the environmental protection agency was equally curious to know what had killed mammals that were under epa protection the city of san diego was horrified at the prospect of huge smelly carcasses drifting up to its beaches marinas seaside hotels and shorefront houses the mayor called the district congressman who happened to be on the naval appropriations committee and a compromise was reached with amazing speed three whales would be brought to shore for necropsy the others would be towed out to sea and used for target practice greenpeace protested but by the time they mobilized their mosquito fleet the whales had been blasted to blubbery smithereens by navy gunners in the meantime an oceangoing tug hauled the remaining whales to the base navy cranes lifted the massive bodies from the water in improvised slings and they were transported to a vacant warehouse mammalian forensic specialists from several california universities went to work as soon as the whales were delivered an improvised laboratory was set up dressed in foul weather gear gloves and boots the technicians swarmed around and on top of the carcasses like large yellow insects the head of each animal had been separated from its body brain tissue removed and taken to the dissecting tables for tests wheelbarrows served the function of stainless steel trays in a human autopsy not exactly brain surgery is it austin observed as he listened to the buzz of power saws echoing off the metal walls of the warehouse no sir the sailor said and ill be glad when its over lets hope its soon sailor austin pondered why he had left his comfortable hotel room for this ghoulish watch if the race hadnt been a flop win or lose he would have been guzzling champagne in celebration with the other racers and the coterie of lovely women who hovered around the race circuit like beautiful butterflies a respectable number of bottles were popped but the festivities had been dampened for kurt and ali and their crews ali showed up with an italian model on one arm and a french mademoiselle on the other even so he didnt look particularly happy austin elicited a smile when he told the arab he looked forward to competing against him again soon zavala up held his reputation as a ladies man by carving a chestnuthaired beauty from the field of groupies on hand for the race finale they were going out for dinner where zavala promised to regale his date with the details of his narrow escape austin stayed long enough to be polite then left the party to phone the owner of the red ink austins father was expecting his call he had watched the race finale on tv and knew austin was safe and the boat lay at the bottom of the ocean the elder austin was the wealthy owner of a marine salvage company based in seattle dont worry about it he said well build another one even better maybe with a periscope next time chuckling evilly he recounted in loving and unnecessary detail the night a teenage austin had brought his fathers mustang convertible home with a crumpled fender most grand prix races were held in and around europe but austins father wanted an americanbuilt boat to win in american waters he paid for the design and construction of a fast new boat he called the red ink because of the money it cost him and put together a topnotch pit crew and support team his father put it with his typical bluntness time we kick ass were gonna build a boat that shows these guys that we can win with american parts american knowhow and an american driver you he formed a conglomerate of sponsors and used their economic clout to bring a major race to the states race promoters were eager for the opportunity to tap into the vast potential of the american audience and before long the first socal grand prix had become a reality numa director admiral james sandecker grumbled when austin told him he wanted to work around assignments when ever possible so he could race in the qualifying runs sandecker said he was worried about austin being injured in a race austin had politely pointed out that for all its dangers racing was a canoe paddle compared with the hazardous jobs sandecker as signed him to as leader of numas special assignments team as a trump card he played on the admirals fierce patriotic pride sandecker gave austin his blessing and said it was about time the united states showed the rest of the world that they could compete with the best of them austin returned to the party after talking to his father he quickly tired of the false hilarity and was happy to be invited aboard the nepenthe to meet gloria ekhart who wanted to thank him the actresss mature warmth and beauty enchanted him when they shook hands she didnt let go right away they talked awhile and maintained eye contact that sent messages of mutual interest austin briefly entertained the fantasy of having a fling with someone hed idolized on the big and little screens it was not to be apologizing profusely ekhart was dragged off by the demands of her children figuring it just wasnt his day austin went back to the hotel and answered calls from numa colleagues and friends he had dinner sent up and enjoyed filet mignon as he watched tv re runs of the race the stations were running slowmotion replays again and again austin was more interested in the fate of the dead whales one reporter mentioned that three whales were going to be examined at the naval station austin was curious as well as bored from what he had heard and seen the whales didnt have a mark to indicate what killed them the incompleteness of the situation went beyond the loss of his fathers boat it rankled his sense of orderliness the autopsy seemed to be winding down austin asked the seaman to take his numa business card to someone in charge the seaman returned with a sandyhaired man in his forties who stripped off his bloodsoaked foulweather gear and gloves but kept his surgical mask on mr austin he said extending his hand jason witherell epa pleasure to meet you glad to have numa interested we might need to utilize your resources were always ready to help the epa austin said my interest is more personal than official i was in the race today when the whales made their appearance i saw the news clips witherell laughed that was one hell of a maneuver you pulled off sorry about your boat thanks i was wondering have you come up with a cause of death sure they died of dork pardon witherell grinned dont really know dork austin smiled patiently he knew pathologists sometimes cultivated a zany sense of humor to help maintain their sanity any guesses witherell said as far as we can determine for now there was no evidence of trauma or toxin and weve tested tissue for virus negative so far one whale had become entangled in a monfilament fishing net but it doesnt seem to have prevented the animal from eating or harmed it in any fatal way so at least for now you dont have a clue how they died oh sure we know how they suffocated there was heavy lung damage that caused pneumonia the lungs seem to have been damaged by intense heat heat im not sure i follow you ill put it this way they were partially cooked internally and their skin was blistered as well what could have done something like that doric witherell said with a shrug of his shoulders austin pondered the answer if you dont know what how about when thats tough to pinpoint the initial exposure might not have been instantly fatal the mammals could have become ill several days before their deaths but continued to make their way along the coast the little ones would have been the sickest and maybe the adults waited for them youd have to factor in the time it would take for the body to decompose and for the putrefaction gases to bloat them up where theyd surface in the race course so if you backtracked you might be able to determine where they were when they died youd have to consider traveling and feeding time and currents of course he shook his head too bad the whales cant tell us where theyve been witherell chuckled who says they cant tell us cmon ill show you the epa man led the way past the flatbeds around the puddles of bloody water being hosed into drains the smell was like a sledgehammer this close to the dead whales but witherell didnt seem to be bothered this is the male he said stopping by the first carcass you can see why theyre called gray whales the skin is naturally dark but its blotched from barnacle scars and whale lice hes a bit chopped up now when we first measured him he was forty one feet they walked to the next flatbed which held a miniaturized version of the first whale this calf is also a male born just a few months ago there were other calves so we dont know if it belonged to the female they had paused before the last flatbed shes bigger than the male like the others shes got no outward signs of any bruise or laceration that might be fatal this is what might interest you he borrowed a knife from a colleague climbed onto the flatbed and bent over the whales fin after a minute he hopped down and handed austin a flat square packet of metal and plastic a transponder austin said witherell pointed up this old girls every move was being tracked by satellite find out whos been keeping an eye on her and that person should be able to tell you where she has been and when youre a genius mr witherell only a humble government servant like you trying to do my job he hefted the transponder ill have to hold on to this thing but theres a number to call on the back austin jotted the number down in a small notebook and thanked the pathologist for his help as witherell escorted him back to the door austin said by the way howd you choose these particular whales it was done pretty much by chance i asked the navy to cut three representative animals out of the batch i guess there was somebody on board who actually listened to my request do you think you would have been more likely to find a cause of death if you had a chance to autopsy the other corpses i doubt it witherell said flatly what killed these whales killed the others that were towed away its a bit late for that anyhow from what i understand after the navy got through with them there wasnt enough left of the other animals for a plate of sushi more autopsy humor tossing his surgical mask into a barrel austin took a last look at the butchered carcasses that were the sad remains of once magnificent sea creatures he thanked witherell and seaman cummings and stepped out into the fresh night air he gulped in several deep breaths as if he could purge his memory as well as his lungs of the rank smell across the harbor sparkled the citylike lights of an aircraft carrier he drove back to the hotel and walked quickly through the lobby but not fast enough to avoid a few nose wrinkles from the staff and guests who had picked up the stench of death back in his room austin threw the khakis and dress shirt hed been wearing into a laundry bag he took a long hot shower shampooed twice and changed into slacks and a golf shirt then he settled into a comfortable chair picked up the phone and dialed the number marked on the transponder as he expected he was connected to voice mail the government wouldnt pay someone to sit around and wait for news of a meandering whale it might take days before someone answered his call he left no message and instead called a twentyfourhour desk at numa headquarters outside washington and put in a request the phone rang about a half hour later mr austin my name is wanda perelli im with the interior department someone called from numa and said you were looking for me they said it was important yes thanks for calling im sorry to bother you at home you heard about the gray whales off california yes i was wondering how you got my number it was on a transponder attached to the fin of a female whale oh dear that was daisy it was her pod ive been tracking her for three years shes almost like a relative im sorry to hear that there were fourteen whales in all she was one of those picked at random she sighed loudly this is terrible news weve tried so hard to protect the grays and theyve really been making a comeback were waiting for a forensics report on cause of death i came from the necropsy a little while ago apparently there was no sign of a virus or pollutant the whales died from lung damage caused by intense heat have you ever heard of such a thing happening no never does anyone know the source of this heat not yet i thought it might shed some light on the incident if we knew where the whales had been recently im pretty familiar with daisys pod their migration is re ally quite remarkable they make a tenthousandmile round trip they feed all summer in the arctic seas then head south along the pacific coast to the breeding lagoons in baja california mexico they start moving around november and december and get there early the following year the pregnant females lead the way then the mature adults and the juveniles in single file or in pairs they go pretty close to the shoreline they start back north in march the whales with calves may wait until april again they follow the coastline closely on the way north they go real slow about ten miles an hour on the average there was a briefing before the boat race we were told to keep a watch for whales but the race had been scheduled after the last pod had passed as far as anyone knew there were no whales in the vicinity the only thing i can think of is that they were stragglers maybe one of the calves became sick and they dallied some where until the calves were well the pathologist had the same theory would you have kept track of their migration yes do you have access to a laptop computer wouldnt be without it good give me your email address ill tap into the data base and get the information to you at light speed thank you cant ask for better service than that you might get the chance to pay me back if we call on numa for help call me personally and well do what we can thanks oh god i still cant believe it about daisy austin hung up opened his ibm laptop computer and hooked it up to the telephone after fifteen minutes passed he opened his email file a map of the western us canada and alaska appeared a dotted line ran down from the chukchi sea through the bering sea then along the coast of north america to the tip of the fingerlike baja peninsula the map was labeled general whale migration route attached to the map was specific information on actual pods austin scrolled down until he found the file name daisy the file linked to a map showing the exact route of the daisy pod the pod had made steady progress then had stopped off the baja coast south of tijuana after a pause they started north again moving slower than before at one point they looped around as if they were disoriented he followed their tortuous path until it stopped off san diego austin exited the whale file and called up several other sites after a few minutes he sat back in his chair and tapped his fingertips together the whales were migrating normally until they reached a certain area then something changed he was pondering what he should do when he heard somebody at the door zavala home from your date so soon yeah i told her i had to get back to check on my sick room mate austin looked alarmed you didnt bump your head today did you i must admit going under a boat was a unique experience ill never look at the nautical rules of the road in the same light again well for your information i feel fine so you can go back and pick up where you left off zavala flopped down onto the sofa you know something kurt there are times when one has to show some restraint austin wondered if a zavala clone stripped of its sexual drive had walked into the room i agree wholeheartedly he said with caution now tell me the real reason she broke zavalas rule i dont go out with married women how did you know she was married her husband told me so oh was he big slightly smaller than a cement truck well restraint was an especially wise decision in that case joe nodded unconvinced god she was beautiful he said with a sigh what have you been up to i went to a whale necropsy and i thought i was having a bad time there must be more fun things to do in san diego im sure there are but i was curious about what killed those whales did they find a cause their lungs were damaged by heat and they died of pneumonia strange zavala said i thought so look at this map on my computer i got it through a noaa weather satellite it shows the water temperature of the ocean see that little red bump in the water off the baja sudden temperature change youre saying our whales became sick shortly after they passed this area of warm temperature maybe but im more interested in what caused that change think youre about to suggest a trip south of the border i could use an interpreter paul and gamay wont be back in arlington for a few days no problemo its important for me to stay in touch with my mexican roots he got up and started for the door where are you going austin said zavala looked at the clock the night is young two devilishly handsome and eligible bachelors sitting in their room talking about dead whales and hot water not healthy amigo i saw a beautiful woman in the lounge as i passed by she looks as if she could use company i thought you were giving women up a momentary delusion caused by my injuries besides i think she had a friend zavala said and theres a good jazz band playing in the lounge austins appreciation for cool jazz came right after his love of beautiful women and fast boats a tequila and lime juice night cap would taste mighty good to say nothing about female companionship he grinned and closed the cover on his laptop computer chapter how do you like your meal dr ramirez inquired paul and gamay exchanged glances its wonderful gamay said indeed it was she thought surprisingly so she would have to tell st julien perlmutter naval historian and gourmet about this exotic dinner the thin tender slices of white meat were spiced with local herbs accompanied by rich dark gravy and fresh sweet potatoes dinner was served with a respectable chilean white wine oh god shed been in the jungle so long she had developed a taste for roast tapir next shed be craving howler monkeys paul displayed his yankee bluntness i agree its terrific wed never guess it would be so good after seeing the men carry that oddlooking beast in from the forest ramirez put his fork down a puzzled expression on his face beast the forestim afraid i dont understand the tapir gamay volunteered hesitantly as she glanced down at her plate ramirez looked stunned then his mustache twitched and he broke out into a deep laugh he brought his napkin to his lips you thought he started to laugh again excuse me i am a poor host amusing myself at the expense of my guests but i must assure you that this is not the animal you saw being trundled in from the hunt i bought a pig from a neighboring village for this feast he made a sour face tapir i cant imagine what it is like perhaps its quite tasty ramirez poured more wine and raised his glass in a toast i will miss you my friends your company has been most enjoy able and we have had many delightful conversations around this table thank you gamay said it has been a fascinating experience for us today may have been our most exciting day how ever ah yes the poor indian paul shook his head i cant get over the sophisticated nature of all those gadgets he had with him ramirez spread his palms apart the people of the mists are a mysterious tribe what do you know about them gamay said her scientific curiosity aroused before she attained a doctorate in marine biology from scripps institute of oceanography she had been a marine archaeologist and had taken many anthropology courses during her studies at the university of north carolina ramirez took a sip of wine nodded with appreciation and stared off into space as he ordered his thoughts the buzzing and chirping of millions of tropical insects came through the screened windows and the concert provided a fitting back ground for tales of the rain forest after a moments reflection he said first you must realize as we sit here in this island of civilization with our propane gas stove and our electrical generator that only a few years ago we would have been dead within minutes had we strayed into this part of the forest fierce indians inhabited the area head hunting and cannibalism were commonplace anyone whether you were a missionary bringing in the word of god or a hunter searching for animal skins was regarded as an intruder who must be killed only recently have these people been domesticated except for the chulo gamay ventured correct they retreated further into the forest rather than be pacified i must confess that i learned more about them today than i knew in the three years i have been living here i have seriously doubted they even exist with this tribe you must separate facts from legend the other indians avoid the forest beyond the great falls they say people who go into chulo territory never come out their fear as you saw today is real those are the scant facts and the legend gamay said they can make themselves invisible ramirez said with a smile they can fly they can pass through solid obstacles they are more like ghosts or spirits than men they cant be killed by ordinary weapons the bullet hole we saw puts that myth to rest paul said it would seem so ramirez agreed there is another story even more intriguing the tribe is apparently matriarchal a woman leads it a goddess in fact an amazon gamay suggested in answer ramirez pulled an object from his pocket it was the pendant that had been hanging around the dead mans neck perhaps this is our winged goddess it is said she protects her tribe and that her vengeance is terrible she who must be obeyed gamay said dramatically pardon gamay smiled its a quote from an adventure story i read when i was young about a jungle goddess who lived for thou sands of years without aging paul took the pendant and studied it goddess or not she didnt do a very good job of guarding the native we saw the older mans face darkened yes but at the same time is there something wrong gamay said im somewhat concerned one of the village men came to me he said there were stirrings of trouble in the forest what kind of trouble paul asked he didnt know only that it had to do with the murdered indian in what way gamay asked im not sure exactly he paused creatures are being killed in this forest at this moment insects animals and birds are constantly involved in a violent struggle for life yet out of this bloody chaos there is an equilibrium his deepset eyes seemed to grow even darker i fear that the killing of the indian has disturbed this balance maybe the amazon goddess is about to wreak her revenge paul said handing the medallion back ramirez swung the pendant back and forth on its thong as if he were svengali using it as a hypnotic device as a man of science i must deal with the facts it is a fact that someone out there has a gun and has no hesitation about using it either the indian strayed out of his territory or someone with a gun invaded it do you have any thoughts on who this person might be gamay asked perhaps do you know anything about the rubber industry both trouts shook their heads a hundred years ago rubber trees grew only in the amazon jungle then a british scientist stole some seeds to start vast rubber plantations in the east the same thing is happening now the shaman who accompanied us on our burial detail today is a bit of a fraud when it comes to chasing out evil demons but he knows the medicinal value of hundreds of rain forest plants people come here and say they are scientists but they are really pi rates looking for herbs that have medicinal properties they sell the patents to multinational drug companies sometimes they work directly for the companies in either case the companies make fortunes while the natives who have harbored the knowledge get nothing even worse sometimes men come in and take the medicinal plants you think one of these pirates tortured and shot the indian paul asked its possible when millions are at stake the life of a poor indian means nothing why they shot him i dont know its possible he simply saw something he shouldnt have these plant secrets have been with the forest inhabitants for generations is anybody trying to stop these pirates gamay said it is a problem sometimes government officials are in collusion with the drug companies the stakes are very high the governments care little about the indigenous people they are interested only in how to sell the natives genetic knowledge of plants to the highest bidder so the piracy goes unchecked not quite the universities are sending teams of true scientists to track down the pirates they are doing research on plants themselves but at the same time they talk to the indians and ask if there have been strangers asking questions our neighbors in brazil have tried to stop the theft of genetic resources in the court they sued a scientist for cataloging seeds and tree bark the indians use for cures and charged him with stealing knowledge from indigenous people a difficult charge to make stick paul noted agreed brazil is also pushing legislation to protect bio diversity so we are making progress but not much we are talking about taking on drug companies with billions of dollars in re sources it is not an even match a thought occurred to gamay has your university been involved yes he said we have had teams from time to time but there is little money for fulltime police work it wasnt the answer gamay was looking for but she didnt persist i wish there was something we could do there is ramirez said with a broad smile i would ask a favor please feel under no obligation to grant it try us paul said amiably very well a few hours travel from here there is another settlement on the river the dutchman who lives there has no radio they may have heard about a chulo being killed in any event they should be told in case there are repercussions he stuck his leg out the ankle was heavily wrapped in a bandage i can barely walk i dont think there is a break but it is badly sprained i was wondering if you could go in my place you could make a quick trip of it what about the supply boat gamay asked it is due late tomorrow as expected they will lay over for the night you would be back before it leaves i dont see why we cant do it gamay said stopping short as she caught the quizzical look in her husbands eye if its okay with paul well ah i apologize my request has created marital discord oh no paul reassured him its simply my new england caution of course wed like to help you splendid i will have my men gather supplies for you and fuel my boat it will be faster on the river than your inflatable she should make the round trip in the same day i thought you had only dugout canoes in the village gamay said ramirez smiled they serve most of my needs yes but occasionally more efficient transportation is desirable she shrugged tell us more about the man you call the dutchman dieter is actually german hes a trader married to a native woman he comes here occasionally but mostly he sends his men once a month with a list and we relay it to the supply boat he is an unsavory character in my opinion but that is no reason not to warn him of possible danger ramirez paused you do not have to do this these things are really none of your affair and you are scientists not adventurers especially the beautiful senora trout i think we can handle it gamay said looking at her husband with amusement she was not speaking with bravado but as part of the numa special assignments team she and paul had been on any number of dangerous assignments and as attractive as she was gamay was no delicate flower back in racine wisconsin where she was born she had been a tomboy who ran with a pack of boys and later moved with ease among men well then we have an agreement after dessert we will have a glass of brandy and retire so we can be up at the crack of dawn a short while later the trouts were back in their room getting ready for bed when gamay asked paul why were you hesitant about helping dr ramirez couple of reasons lets start with the fact that this little side trip has nothing to do with our numa assignment paul ducked the pillow tossed at his head since when have you gone by the numa rule book gamay said like you whenever it has been convenient ive stretched the rules but never broken them then lets just stretch them a little by saying that the river is an integral part of the ocean therefore any dead person found on it should be investigated by numas special assignments team must i remind you that the team was formed precisely to look into matters nobody else would not a bad sales pitch but dont put too much stock in your powers of persuasion if you hadnt suggested looking into this thing i would have on similarly flimsy grounds i might add i have an aversion to someone getting away with murder so do i do you have any idea where we might start already handled that dont let my taciturn cape cod nature deceive you not in a hundred years my dear back to your original question the reason i hesitated was my surprise this is the first time ramirez mentioned his boat hes given us the impression he used dugouts remember the fuss he made about how great our little puttputt inflatable was i was sniffing around one day and found a shed holding an air boat she leaned up on one elbow an airboat why didnt he say something i think its obvious he didnt want anybody to know i think our friend ramirez is more complicated than he appears i have the same impression i think he was being disingenuous about sending us scientific geeks off on a potentially dangerous mission weve told him enough about the special assignments team for him to know what we do when were not counting river dolphins i think he wants numa brought into this thing looks like weve played right into his hands but im not sure why hed be so machiavellian ive got an idea gamay said he was talking about the scientists from the university acting as bio police he is a scientist from a university he sort of sideslipped the implication i noticed paul stretched out on the bed and closed his eyes so you think hes actually a bio cop disguised as a botanist it would make sense gamay paused in thought i must confess that the real reason i want to investigate was in those bags we found with the chulo im intrigued at how a backward indian got all those hightech toys arent you there was no sound from the other side of the bed except that of low breathing paul was exercising his famous talent for dropping off to sleep on command gamay shook her head pulled the sheets over her shoulders and did the same they would be up with the sun and she expected the next day to be a long one chapter the mexican customs agent leaned from his window and checked out the two men in the white ford pickup truck they were wearing beatup shorts and tshirts foster grant sunglasses and baseball caps with bait shop logos on them purpose of your visit the agent asked the husky man be hind the wheel the driver jerked his thumb over his shoulder at the fishing rods and tackle boxes in back going fishing wish i could join you the agent said with a smile and waved them on into tijuana as they pulled away zavala who was sitting in the passenger seat said whats with the spies like us routine all we had to do was flash our numa ids austin grinned this is more fun were lucky our cleancut appearance doesnt fit the profile for terrorists or drug runners i prefer to think that were masters of disguise austin glanced at zavala and shook his head by the way i hope you brought along your american passport i wouldnt want you to get stuck in mexico no problem it wouldnt be the first time a zavala sneaked across the border zavalas parents had waded across the rio grande in the s from morales mexico where they were born and raised his mother was seven months pregnant at the time her condition didnt stand in the way of her determination to start life with her newborn in el norte they made their way to santa fe new mexico where zavala was born his fathers skills as a carpenter and woodcarver brought him steady work with the wealthy clients who built their fashionable homes there the same influential people helped his father when he applied for a green card and later for citizenship the truck was on loan from the red inks support team because rental cars couldnt be taken into mexico from their hotel they headed south from san diego passing through chula vista the border town that is neither mexican nor american but a blend of both countries once into mexico they skirted the sprawling slums of tijuana then picked up mex the carretera transper linsula highway that runs the full length of baja california past el rosarita with its concentration of souvenir shops motels and taco stands the commercial honkytonk began to thin out before long the highway was flanked by agricultural fields and bare hills on the left and by the curving emerald bay known as todos los santos about an hour after leaving tijuana they turned off at ensenada austin knew the resort and fishing city from the days he crewed in the newportensenada sailboat race the unofficial finish was at hussongs cantina a seedy old bar with sawdust covered floors before the new highway brought the tourists and their dollars baja california norte was truly the frontier in its heyday hussongs was a haunt for the colorful local characters and rugged individuals and the sailors fishermen and auto racers who knew ensenada when it was the last outpost of civilization on the eighthundredmilelong baja peninsula before la paz hussongs was one of those legendary bars like foxys in the virgin islands or captn tonys in key west where every body in the world had been as they stepped inside austin was heartened to see a few scruffy barflies who might remember the good old days when tequila flowed like a river and the police ran a shuttle service back and forth between the cantina and the local hoosegow they sat at a table and ordered huevos rancheros ah pure soul food zavala said savoring a bite of scrambled eggs and salsa austin had been studying the sad expression on the moose head that had been over the bar for as long as he could recall still wondering how a moose got to mexico he turned his attention back to the map of the baja that was spread out on the table in front of him next to the satellite photo showing water temperature this is where were going he said pointing to the map the temperature anomaly is in the vicinity of this cove zavala finished his meal with a smile of pleasure and opened a baedeckers guide to mexico it says here that the ballena gris or gray whale arrives off the baja from december to march to mate and give birth to its young the whales weigh up to twentyfive tons and run between ten and fortynine feet long during mating one male will keep the female in position while another male he winced think ill skip that part the gray was almost exterminated by commercial whaling but was made a protected species in he paused in his reading let me ask you something i know youve got a lot of respect for any thing that swims in the sea but ive never thought of you as a whale hugger why the big interest why not leave this up to the epa or fish and wildlife fair question i could say i want to find out what started the chain of events that ended up with the sinking of pops boat but theres another reason that i cant put my finger on a thoughtful expression came into austins eyes it reminds me of some scary dives ive made you know the kind youre swimming along everything seemingly fine when the hair rises on the back of your neck your gut goes icecold and youve got a bad feeling youre not alone that something is watching you something hungy sure zavala said contemplatively but it usually goes be yond that i imagine that the biggest baddest hungriest shark in the ocean is behind me and hes thinking how its been a long time since hes had authentic mexican food he took another bite of his huevos but when i look around theres nothing there or maybe theres a minnow the size of my finger whos been giving me the evil eye the sea is wrapped in mystery austin said with a faraway look in his eyes is that a riddle in a way its a quote from joseph conrad the sea never changes and its works for all the talk of men are wrapped in mystery austin tapped the map with his fingertip whales die every day we lose some to natural causes others get tangled in fishing nets and starve to death or they get nailed by a ship or we poison them with pollution because some people think its okay to use the sea for a toxic waste dump he paused but this doesnt fit any of those categories even with out interference from humans nature is always out of kilter constantly adjusting and readjusting but its not a cacophony its like the improvisation you see with a good jazz group ahmad jamal doing a piano solo going off on his own catching up with his rhythm section later he let out a deep laugh hell im not making sense dont forget ive seen your jazz collection kurt youre saying theres a sour note here more a universal dissonance he thought about it some more i like your analogy better ive got the feeling that theres a big badass shark lurking just out of sight and its hungry as hell zavala pushed his empty plate away as they say back home the best time to fish is when the fish are hungry i happen to know you grew up in the desert amigo austin said rising but i agree with what youre saying lets go fishing from ensenada they got back on the highway and headed south as in tijuana the commercial sprawl thinned out and vanished and the highway went down to two lanes they turned off the highway past maneadero and followed back roads past agricultural fields scattered farm houses and old missions eventually coming into rugged lonely country with fogshrouded rolling hills that dropped down to the sea zavala who was navigating checked the map were almost there just around the corner he said austin didnt know what he was expecting even so he was surprised when they rounded the curve and he saw a neatly lettered sign in spanish and english announcing they were at the home of the baja tortilla company he pulled over to the side of the road the sign was at the beginning of a long clay drive bordered with planted trees they could see a large building at the end of the driveway austin leaned on the steering wheel and pushed his foster grants up onto his forehead youre sure this is the right spot zavala handed the map over for austins examination this is the place he said looks like we drove all this way for nothing maybe not zavala said the huevos rancheros were excel lent and ive got a new hussongs cantina tshirt austins eyes narrowed coincidence makes me suspicious the sign says visitors welcome as long as were here lets take them at their word he turned the truck off the highway and drove a few hundred yards to a neatly tended gravel parking lot marked with spaces for visitors several cars with california plates and a couple of tour buses were parked in front of the building a corrugated aluminum structure with a portaled adobe facade and tiled roof in the spanish style the smell of baking corn wafted through the pickups open windows diabolically clever disguise zavala said i hardly expected to see a neon sign that said welcome from the guys who killed the whales i wish we were toting our guns zavala said with mock gravity you never know when a wild tortilla will attack you i once heard about someone being mauled by a burrito in no gales save it for the drive back austin got out of the car and led the way to the ornately carved front door of dark wood they stepped into a whitewashed reception area a smiling young mexican woman greeted them from behind a desk buenos dias she said you are in luck the tour of the tortilla factory is just starting youre not with a group from a cruise boat austin suppressed a smile were on our own we were driving by and saw the sign she smiled again and asked them to join a group of senior citizens mostly americans and mostly from the midwest from the sounds of their accents the receptionist who also acted as guide ushered them into the bakery corn was life in mexico and tortillas have been the staple food in mexico for centuries with both the indians and the spanish settlers she led the way past where sacks of corn were being emptied into grinding machines for many years people made their tortillas at home the corn was ground into meal mixed with water to produce masa then rolled cut pressed and baked by hand with the growth of demand in mexico and especially in the united states the tortilla industry has become more centralized this has allowed us to modernize our production facilities providing for more efficient and sanitary operation speaking in low tones as they trailed behind the others austin said if the market for mexican flapjacks is in the us why isnt this place closer to the border why make them down here and ship them up the highway good question zavala said the tortilla business in mexico is a tightly held monopoly run by guys with close government connections its a billiondollar industry even if you did have a good reason to locate this far south why build overlooking the ocean nice place for a luxury hotel but an operation like this the tour went past the dough mixers which fed into machines that produced hundreds of tortillas a minute the thin flat pies coming out on conveyor belts all tended by workers in laundrywhite coats and plastic caps the guide was ushering the group to the packaging and shipping department when austin spied a door with words written in spanish on it employees only he asked zavala joe nodded ive learned all i want to know about burritos and enchiladas austin stepped aside and tried the door it was unlocked im going to look around eyeing austins imposing physique and blazing white hair zavala said with due respect for your talents as a snoop you dont exactly blend in with the people working around here i might be less conspicuous than a giant gringo stalking the hall ways zavala had a good point okay snoop away be careful ill meet you at the end of the tour if the guide asks ill say you had to go to the restroom zavala winked and slipped through the door he was confident he could charm his way out of practically any situation and had already prepared a story saying hed become lost looking for the bano he found himself in a long hallway with no windows or other openings except for a steel door at the far end he walked the length of the hallway and put his ear against the door not hearing anything he tried the knob the door was locked he reached into his pocket and pulled out a modified swiss army knife that would have got him arrested in places where possession of burglar tools is illegal the standard attachments such as scissors nail file and can opener had been replaced with picks for the most common locks on the fourth try he heard the latch click open behind the door another corridor slanted down unlike the first this passage had several doors all were locked except one that opened into a locker room the lockers were secure and he could have opened them with his picks if he had time he glanced at his watch the tour would wind up soon on the opposite wall were shelves piled with neatly folded white coats he found one that fit and slipped it on in a supply cabinet he discovered a clipboard he stepped out into the corridor and continued on to yet a third door this too was locked but he managed to open it after a few tries the door opened onto an elevated platform that overlooked a big room the platform led to a series of walkways that crossed through a web of linking horizontal and vertical pipes the low hum of machinery seemed to come from everywhere and he couldnt trace its source he descended a set of stairs the pipes came out of the floor then disappeared at right angles into the wall plumbing for the tortilla factory he surmised at one end of the room was another door it was unlocked when he cautiously opened it a cool ocean breeze hit him in the face he gasped with surprise he was standing on a small plat form perched high on the side of a cliff facing out onto a lagoon about two hundred feet below him it was a beautiful vista and again he wondered why somebody hadnt built a hotel rather than a factory there he assumed the factory was behind the edge of the cliff but he couldnt see it from his angle he looked down again the water washed up against the jagged rocks along the shore in foamy ripples the platform had a gate at one end that led to empty space with no steps going down or up odd a few feet from the gate a metal rail ran down the side of the cliff and disappeared into the water he followed the rail down to the lagoon with his eye a section of water appeared to be darker than that surrounding it it might have been kelp and other seaweed washing against the rocks as he watched there was an intense bubbling at the base of the cliff and a large shiny eggshaped object suddenly appeared from the water and began its climb up the side of the cliff of course the rail was for an elevator the egg rose steadily up the track it would be there within seconds zavala ducked back into the big room with the pipes keeping the door open a crack the egg made of a dark tinted glass or plastic that blended in with the side of the cliff came to a stop at the platform a door opened and two men in white smocks stepped out zavala dashed for the stairs within seconds he was back at the store room he tore his coat off folded it as neatly as possible and quickly walked along the corridors to the bakery nobody saw him step back into the area open to the public he hurried along in the direction austin and the tour group had taken the guide saw him approach and gave him a quizzical and not altogether pleased look i was looking for the bano she blushed and said oh yes i will show you she clapped her hands for attention the tour is about over she handed everyone a sample package of tortillas and conducted them back to the reception area as the cars and tour buses left austin and zavala compared notes from the look on your face id guess your little exploration was successful i found something i just dont know what it is zavala laid out a quick summary of his findings the fact that they hid something underwater indicates that they dont want anyone to know what they are doing austin said lets take a walk they strolled around the side of the factory but only got a short distance toward the water before they encountered a high mesh fence topped with razor wire a few hundred feet short of where the cliff dropped off so much for an ocean view zavala said lets see if we can get around to the other side of the cove the two men returned to the pickup and drove back onto the road several tracks led down to the sea but the fence blocked each potential access they were just about to give up when they saw a man with a fishing pole and a basket full of fish coming from a path that led toward the water zavala called him over and asked if they could get to the water the man was wary at first apparently thinking they had something to do with the tortilla place when zavala extracted a twentydollar bill from his wallet the mans face lit up and he said yes there was a fence but there was a place to crawl under it he led them on a narrow path through the shoulderhigh bushes pointed to a section of chainlink fence and left clutching his windfall a section of fence was bent back from the ground and a hole scooped out underneath zavala easily slithered under to the other side then held the fence for austin they followed the overgrown path until they came to the edge of a cliff they were near the tip of the southernmost promontory enclosing the lagoon a trail that must have been worn by the feet of fishermen descended down the less steep side of the point the numa men were more interested in the unimpeded view across the cove from this angle the dark metal structure looked like a sinister re doubt out of a conan movie austin scanned the building through his binoculars then pointed them at the side of the cliff sunlight glinted off metal about where zavala had described the elevator track he let his eyes sweep out to the wide entrance of the lagoon where surf broke on the rocks then back to the factory ingenious austin said with a chuckle if you stuck a big facility out here in the boonies everyone like our fisherman friend back there would talk about it but put it in plain sight invite the public to come tramping in and out every day and youve got an unbeatable cover for some kind of clandestine operation zavala borrowed the binoculars and scanned the opposite cliff why a waterproof elevator i dont have an answer austin said with a shake of his head i think weve seen all were going to see hoping to detect signs of activity around the building or cliff they lingered a few more minutes but the only movement they saw was the soaring sea birds they headed away from the sea and minutes later were crawling under the fence zavala would have liked to ask the fisherman if he knew about the elevator or whether he had seen anything unusual in the lagoon but the man had taken his money and run they got back into the pickup and headed north austin drove without talking zavala knew from past experience that his partner was chewing over a plan and when he had it fully formulated he would spill the details just beyond ensenada austin said is numa still running those field tests off san diego as far as i know i was planning to check in after the race to see how things were going austin nodded during the drive back they exchanged small talk trading war stories about past adventures and youthful indiscretions in mexico the long line of traffic at the border crossing was moving at a snails pace they flashed their numa ids to save time and were whisked through customs back in san diego they headed toward the bay until they came to a sprawling municipal marina they parked and made their way along a pier past dozens of sail and power boats at the end of a dock reserved for larger craft they found a stubby widebeamed vessel about eightyfive feet long painted in white on the greenishblue hull were the letters numa they stepped across the catwalk and asked one of the crew men puttering on the deck if the captain were aboard he led the way to the bridge where a slim oliveskinned man was going over some charts jim contos was considered one of the best skippers in the numa fleet the son of a tarpon springs sponge fisher man he had been on boats since he was able to walk kurt joe contos said with a wide grin what a nice surprise i heard you were in the neighborhood but i never suspected youd honor the sea robin with a visit what are you up to he glanced at zavala well i always know what youve been up to zavalas lips turned up in his typical slight smile kurt and i were in the offshore boat race yesterday a dark cloud crossed his brow hey i heard about that thing with your boat im really sorry about that thanks austin said then you must know about the dead gray whales i doa very strange story any idea what killed them we might be able to find out with your help sure anything i can do wed like to borrow the sea robin and the mini and do a little diving south of the border contos laughed you werent kidding about a big favor he paused in thought then shrugged why not were just about through with our field tests here if you can get an oral authorization to work in mexican waters its fine with me austin nodded and immediately called numa after a few minutes of conversation he passed the cell phone to contos he listened nodded asked a few questions then clicked off looks like were heading south gunn gave his okay rudi gunn was numa director of operations in washington two days at the most he wants you and joe back so he can put you to work again one thing though he says he wont have time to get clearance from the mexican government on short notice if anyone asks we can say we were lost austin said with feigned innocence contos gestured at the glittering array of lights and dials on the ships console that might be a tough story to sell with all the electronics this vessel carries the sea robin may be ugly but she sure knows whats going on in the world well let the state department iron out any problems if were boarded when do you want to leave well pick up our gear and get back as soon as possible the rest is up to you ill schedule a seven am departure for tomorrow he said and turned away to give the crew its new orders as austin was walking back to the car he asked zavala what contos meant when he said he knew what joe had been up to we dated the same woman a few times zavala said with a shrug is there any female in the district of columbia you havent dated zavala thought about it the first lady as you know i draw the line at married women relieved to hear that austin said getting behind the wheel but if she becomes divorced well they got into the car and as austin started the engine he said i think this would be a good time for you to tell me about the guy in nogales who was mauled by a burrito chapter under a cloudless western sky the teal green mcdonnelldouglas helicopter cleared the rugged peaks of squaw mountain dipped low over the alpine waters of lake tahoe and darted like a startled dragonfly to the california shore it hovered an instant then dropped into a tall stand of ponderosa pine touching down on a concrete landing pad as the rotors spun to a stop an elephantine chevy suburban lumbered alongside the driver who was wearing a uniform the same dark green as the helicopter and the su got out to greet the rangy passenger who stepped from the chopper taking an overnight bag from the passengers hand he said right this way congressman kinkaid they got into the vehicle which headed along a blacktop drive through thick forest minutes later it pulled up in front of a complex of buildings that looked like a redwood version of the fabled hearst castle of san simeon the lateafternoon sun threw the turrets walls and towers into fantastic silhouette a whole forest of giant trees must have been leveled merely to pro vide the facing the sprawling edifice was the ultimate log cabin squared and cubed in size a series of connecting outbuildings clustered around a threestory main house congressman kinkaid muttered this place is bigger than the mormon tabernacle welcome to valhalla the driver said noncommittally he parked the vehicle in front took the congressmans bag and led him up a wide stairway to a deck as long as a bowling alley then into a large foyer paneled and beamed in dark almost black wood they followed a series of passageways done in the same dark paneling finally stopping at a set of high metal doors cast in relief and shaped in a gothic arch ill take your bag to your quarters sir the others are waiting youll find a nameplate designating your seat the guide pressed a button on the wall and the doors opened silently kinkaid stepped inside and sucked his breath in as the doors clicked shut behind him he was in a massive high ceilinged chamber the great hall was lit by the fire from a huge hearth and blazing wall torches that vied for space with brightly decorated shields and pennants spears battleaxes swords and other instruments of death that recalled a time when war was an exercise in personal butchery the lethal artifacts paled next to the object occupying the center of the room it was a viking ship about seventy feet in length its oak planking curved into an upswept bow and stern the single square hide sail was set as if to catch a following breeze a gang way near the stern allowed access to the deck and to a long table that ran lengthwise with the mast as its center point kinkaid was a marine veteran who had seen action in vietnam and was not put off by the intimidating surroundings set ting his jaw in an unmistakable expression of determination he crossed the hall to the ship and went up the gangway seated around the table were about two dozen men who halted their conversation and looked at him with curiosity he sat in the last empty chair and glowered at the others he was about to strike up a conversation with the man on his right when the double doors at the end of the hall were flung open a woman entered and strode toward the boat in the flickering light of the torches her long legs quickly eating up the distance as she made her way across the hall her closefitting green coveralls emphasized the athletic body but it was her height that was most imposing she was nearly seven feet tall the womans body and features were unflawed but she was beautiful in the way an iceberg is beautiful and equally forbid ding she could have sprung whole from the arctic permafrost her flaxen hair was pulled away from her face and tied in a bun displaying to the fullest the marble skin and large eyes that were a hard glacial blue she came up the gangway onto the ship and walked around the table in a voice surprising for its softness she greeted each man by name and thanked him for coming when she reached the congressman she paused boring into his craggy face with her remarkable eyes and shook his hand in a vise grip then she took her place in front of the highbacked chair at the bow end of the table she smiled a smile that was as cold as it was seductive good afternoon gentlemen she said her voice rising to the rich tones of a natural orator my name is brynhild sigurd undoubtedly you are wondering what sort of a place this is valhalla is my home and corporate headquarters but it is also a celebration of my scandinavian roots the main building is an expanded version of a viking long house the wings are for specialized use such as offices guest quarters gymnasium and a museum for my collection of primitive norse art she arched an eyebrow i hope none of you is prone to sea sickness she waited for the laughter to subside then went on this vessel is a reproduction of the gogstad viking ship it is more than a stage prop it symbolizes my belief that the impossible is attainable i had it built because i admire the functional beauty of the design but also as a constant reminder that the vikings would never have crossed the sea if they had not been adventurous and daring perhaps their spirit will influence the decisions made here she paused for a moment then went on youre probably all wondering why i invited you she said a sawedged voice cut her off id say that your offer to give us fifty thousand dollars or donate it to a charity of our choice may have had something to do with it congressman kinkaid said ive donated your offer to a scientific foundation that looks into birth defects i would have expected nothing less given your reputation for integrity kinkaid grunted and sat back in his chair pardon me for interrupting he said please get on with your er fascinating presentation thank you brynhild said to continue you gentlemen come from all parts of the country and represent many different endeavors among your number are politicians bureaucrats academics lobbyists and engineers but you and i belong to a common fraternity bound together by one thing water a commodity we know to be in very short supply these days everyone is aware that we are facing what could possibly be the longest drought in the countrys history is that not so professor dearborn as a climatologist would you kindly give us your appraisal of the situation id be glad to replied a middleaged man who seemed surprised to be called upon he ran his fingers through thinning gingercolored hair and said this country is experiencing moderate to severe drought in its midsection and along the southern tier from arizona to florida thats nearly a quarter of the contiguous fortyeight states the situation will probably get worse in addition water in the great lakes is at alltime lows a prolonged drought of dust bowl levels is entirely possible a mega drought lasting decades is not outside the realm of possibility there was a murmur from around the table brynhild opened a wooden box in front of her dug her hand inside and let the sand run through her long fingers the partys over gentlemen this is the bleak dusty future we face with all due respect ms brynhild drawled a nevadan youre not telling us anything new vegas is going to be in tough shape la and phoenix arent much better off she put her hands together in light applause agreed but what if i told you there is a way to save our cities id like to hear about that said the nevadan she slammed the cover down symbolically on the box the first step has already been taken as most of you know congress has authorized private control over the distribution of water from the colorado river kinkaid leaned forward onto the table and as you must know ms sigurd i led the opposition to that bill fortunately you did not prevail had the legislation gone down the west would have been doomed the reservoirs hold only a twoyear supply after that ran out we would have to evacuate most of california and arizona and a good portion of colorado new mexico utah and wyoming ill say the same thing i told those fools in washington putting hoover dam in private hands wont increase the water supply that was never at issue the problem was not water supply but distribution much of the water was being misused ending government subsidies and putting water in the private sector means that it will not be wasted for the simplest of reasons waste is not profitable i stand by my basic argument kinkaid said something as important as water should not be controlled by companies that are unaccountable to the public the public had its chance and failed now the price of water will be set by supply and demand the marketplace will rule only those who can afford the water will get it thats exactly what i said during the debate the rich cities would thrive while the poor communities die of thirst brynhild was unyielding so what of it consider the alter natives if the water continued to be distributed under the old publicly owned system and the rivers dried up the west as we know it would become a dust bowl as the man from nevada said la phoenix and denver would become ghost towns picture tumbleweed blowing through the empty casinos of las vegas there would be economic disaster bond markets would dry up wall street would turn its back on us loss in financial power means lost influence in washington public works money would flow to other parts of the country she let the litany of disasters sink in then went on westerners would become the new okies straight out of the grapes of wrath only instead of moving west to the promised land they would pile their families into their lexus and mercedes sws and head east with irony in her rich voice she said ask yourself how the crowded eastern seaboard would react to thou sands millions of jobless westerners moving into their neighbor hood she paused for dramatic effect wouldnt it be interesting if the people in oklahoma refused to take us under their wing i wouldnt blame them said a developer from southern california theyd greet us the same way the californians did my grandparents with guns and goon squads and road blocks a rancher from arizona grinned ruefully if you californians werent so damned greedy there would be enough water for everybody within minutes everyone was talking at once brynhild let the argument go on before rapping the table with her knuckle this fruitless discussion is an example of the squabbling over water that has gone on for decades in the old days ranchers shot each other over water rights today your weapons are law suits privatization will end this squabbling we must end the fighting among ourselves the sound of clapping echoed in the hall brava said kinkaid i applaud your eloquent performance but youre wasting your time i intend to ask congress to reopen the whole issue that might be a mistake kinkaid was too agitated to detect the veiled threat i dont think so i have it on good authority that the companies that have taken over the colorado river system spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to influence this awful legislation your information is inaccurate we spent millions millions you not personally my corporation which is the umbrella organization for those companies you mentioned im stunned the colorado river is under your control actually under the control of an entity set up for that ex press purpose outrageous i cant believe youre telling me this nothing that has been done is illegal thats what they said in los angeles when the city water department stole the owens valley river you make my point for me this is nothing new la be came the biggest richest and most powerful desert city in the world by sending forth an army of water surveyors lawyers and land speculators to take control of water from its neighbors professor dearborn spoke up pardon me but im afraid i agree with the congressman the los angeles case was a classic case of water imperialism if what youre saying is true youre laying the groundwork for a water monopoly let me pose a scenario dr dearborn the drought persists the colorado river is unable to meet demand the cities are dying of thirst you wouldnt have lawyers debating water allocation youd have gunfights at the water hole as in the old days think about it thirstcrazed mobs in the street attacking all authority the complete breakdown of order the watts riots would be a schoolyard fight by comparison dearborn nodded like a man in a trance youre right he said clearly troubled but if youll pardon me it just doesnt seem right she cut him short this is a fight for survival professor we live or we die according to our will defeated dearborn leaned back arms folded and shook his head kinkaid took up the cudgels dont let her confuse the issue with her phony scenarios professor dearborn apparently i have not been able to change your mind kinkaid stood and said no but ill tell you what you did do youve given me some good ammunition for when i bring this matter up again before committee i wouldnt be surprised if antitrust action is merited ill bet my colleagues who voted for the colorado river bill would change their minds if they knew that the whole system was going to be under the thumb of one corporation im sorry to hear that brynhild said youre going to be a damned lot more sorry when i get through with you i want to leave your private amusement park immediately she gazed at him with sadness she admired strength even when it was used against her very well she spoke into a radio she had clipped to her belt it will take a few minutes to get your luggage and ready the helicopter the door to the hall opened and the man who had escorted kinkaid earlier guided him from the chamber when they were gone brynhild said while some may consider this drought a disaster it presents a golden opportunity the colorado river is only part of our plan we are continuing to acquire control over water systems around the country you are all in a position to influence the success of our goals in operations in your communities there will be great reward for every one in this room beyond your imagination in fact at the same time you will be doing something for the common good as well her eyes swept both sides of the table anyone who wants to leave now can do so i only request that you give your word to keep your silence about this meeting the guests exchanged glances and some uneasily shifted their weight but nobody accepted her offer of an exit visa not even dearborn waiters materialized magically placed pitchers of water on the tables and a glass in front of each man brynhild looked around the assemblage it was william mulholland who was most responsible for bringing water to los angeles he pointed to owens valley and said there it is take it as if on signal the waiters poured the glasses full and re treated raising her glass high she said there it is take it she put the glass to her lips and took a long drink the others followed suit as if in a strange communion ritual good she said now for the next step you will go home and wait for a call when a request is made you will comply without question nothing that transpired at this meeting can be divulged not even the fact that you were here she scanned each face if there are no more questions she said making clear by her tone that debate had ended please enjoy yourselves dinner will be served in the dining hall in ten minutes i have brought in a fivestar chef so i dont think you will be displeased theres entertainment from las vegas after dinner and you will be shown to your rooms you will leave after breakfast tomorrow morning in the sequence you arrived i will see you at the next meeting exactly a month from now with that she left the table strode across the room and through the double doors she had entered by walking down a corridor and into an anteroom two men stood in the room legs wide apart arms folded behind their backs their deepset black eyes glued to the flickering screens that took up one wall they were identical twins dressed alike in matching black leather jackets they had the same stocky physiques high cheekbones hair the color of wet hay and dark beetling brows well what do you think of our guests she said with derision will these worms serve their purpose and loosen the soil the analogy was lost on the brothers who had only one thing on their minds speaking in an eastern european accent the man on the right said whom do you want us to eliminate said the man on the left finishing the sentence their monotone voices were exactly alike brynhild smiled with satisfaction the answer reaffirmed her conviction that she had made the right decision rescuing melo and radko kradzik from the nato forces that wanted to bring the notorious brothers before the world court at the hague charged with crimes against humanity the twins were classic sociopaths and would have made a mark for themselves even without the bosnian war their paramilitary status conferred semilegitimacy on the murder rape and torture they carried out in the name of national ism it was difficult to imagine these monsters ever having been in a mothers womb but somewhere they had forged the ability to intuit what the other was thinking they were the same men only in separate bodies their bond made them doubly dangerous because they could act without verbal communication brynhild had stopped trying to tell them apart whom do you think should be eliminated one man reached out with a hand whose clawlike fingers seemed to be made for inflicting pain and reversed the video tape the other twin pointed to a man in a blue suit him they said simultaneously congressman kinkaid yes he didnt like what you said and the others again the video reversed and they pointed professor dearborn a pity but your instincts are probably right we cant afford to have anybody with even the trace of scruples very well cull him out as well do your work as discreetly as possible im scheduling a meeting of the board of directors soon to go over our longrange plans i want everything in place before then i wont tolerate mistakes the way those fools bungled their job in brazil ten years ago she whirled from the room and left the twins to themselves the men remained there unmoving their glittering eyes looking at the screen with the hungry expression of a cat choosing the fattest goldfish in the tank for his dinner chapter the river scenery had changed little since dr ramirez waved goodbye from his dock and wished the trouts a safe trip the airboat followed mile after mile of the twisting and unbroken ribbon of dark green water an unyielding wall of trees hemmed the river in on both sides and separated it from the eternal night of the forest at one point they had to stop because the river was blocked by debris they welcomed the break from the mindnumbing drone of the airplane engine they tied lines around the entangled logs and branches and unclogged the bottleneck the job was timeconsuming and it was late after noon when the leafy ramparts gave way to brief glimpses of open space and cultivated fields along the rivers edge then the forest opened up to reveal a cluster of grass huts paul reduced speed and aimed the airboats blunt prow between several dugout canoes drawn up on the muddy banking with a quick goose on the throttle he slid the boat onto the shore and cut the engine he removed the numa baseball cap he had been wearing backward on his head and used it to fan his face where is everybody the unearthly quiet was in sharp contrast to dr ramirezs settlement where the natives bustled about their business throughout the day this place appeared to be deserted the only signs of recent human habitation were tendrils of gray smoke that rose from fire holes this is very weird gamay said its as if the plague struck paul opened a storage box and pulled out a backpack dr ramirez had insisted that the trouts borrow a longbarreled colt revolver moving slowly paul placed the rucksack between them reached inside unclipped the holster and felt the reassuring hardness of the grip its not the plague im worrying about paul said quietly scanning the silent huts im thinking about that dead indian in the canoe gamay had seen paul reach into the bag and shared his concern once we leave the boat it might be tough getting back to it she said lets wait a few more minutes and see what hap pens paul nodded maybe theyre taking a siesta lets wake them up he cupped his hands to his mouth and came out with a loud hallooo the only reply was the echo of his voice he tried again nothing stirred gamay laughed they would have to be sound sleepers not to hear a bellow like that spooky paul said with a shake of his head its too damned hot sitting out here im going to look around can you watch my back ill keep one hand on the cannon dr ramirez gave us and the other on the ignition dont be a hero you know me better than that any problem and ill come running trout eased his lanky form out of the seat in front of the propeller screen and onto the deck he had every confidence in his wifes ability to cover him as a girl in racine she had been taught to shoot skeet by her father and was an excellent marks man with any kind of firearm paul contended she could shoot the eye out of a sand flea in midhop he scanned the village and stepped onto the banking only to freeze he had seen movement in the dark doorway of the largest hut a face had peered around the corner and disappeared there it was again seconds later a man stepped out and waved he shouted what sounded like a greeting and started down the slope toward them he arrived at the rivers edge and mopped his damp face with a sweatstained silk handkerchief he was a big man and the high flat crown of a widebrimmed straw hat added to his height his baggy white cotton slacks were held in place around his corpulent belly by a length of nylon rope and his long sleeved white shirt was buttoned up to his adams apple the sun reflected off a monocle in his left eye greetings he said with a slight accent welcome to the paris of the rain forest paul looked past the mans shoulder at the sorry collection of hovels wheres the eiffel tower he asked casually hahhah eiffel tower marvelous look there its not far from the arc de triomphe after the long river journey in the damp heat paul had little appetite for witty repartee were looking for someone called the dutchman he said the man removed his hat revealing a tonsured mop of unruly white hair at your service but im not dutch he laughed when i first came to this blighted place seven years ago i said i was deutsch im german my name is dieter von hoffman im paul trout and this is my wife gamay hoffman focused his monocle on gamay a beautiful name for a lovely woman he said gallantly we dont et many white women out here beautiful or otherwise gamay asked why the village was so quiet dieters fleshy red lips drooped i suggested that the villagers go into hiding it never hurts to be cautious with strangers they will come out when they see that you are friendly the empty smile again so what brings you to our poor village dr ramirez asked us to come were with numa the national underwater and marine agency gamay said we were doing some research on river dolphins and staying with dr ramirez he asked if we couldnt come in his place i heard through the jungle telegraph that a couple of scientists from the united states were in the neighborhood i never dreamed you would honor us with a visit how is the esteemed dr ramirez these days he would have liked to come but he hurt his ankle and couldnt travel too bad it would be nice to see him well its been a long time since i had company but thats no excuse for being a poor host please come ashore you must be very hot and thirsty paul and gamay exchanged glances that said okay but be careful and stepped off the boat gamay slung the bag with the gun in it over her shoulder and they started toward the cluster of huts arranged in a semicircle at the top of a rise dieter yelled in another language and each hut disgorged a load of indian men women and children they came out timidly and stood at silent attention dieter gave another command and they began to go about their tasks paul and gamay glanced at each other again dieter did not suggest in this village he commanded an indian woman in her twenties came out of the largest hut her head bowed unlike the other women who were dressed only in loincloths she had a red sarong of machineloomed fabric wrapped around her shapely body dieter growled an order and she disappeared into the hut a thatched roof stood in front of the hut on four poles the roof shaded a roughcut wooden table and stools carved from stumps dieter gestured toward the stools sat in one himself and removed his straw hat he mopped his sweating head with his handkerchief and snapped an order at the open door of the hut the woman came out carrying a tray with three mugs made from sections of hollowed tree limbs she set the mugs down and stood respectfully a few paces away with her head still lowered dieter raised his mug heres to meeting new friends there was a distinct clinking as he swished the contents of his mug thats right he said you are hearing the beautiful sound of ice cubes you can thank the wonders of modern science for allowing me to have a portable gaspowered ice maker there is no need to live like these brownskinned adams and eves he slurped half his glass down in a single gulp paul and gamay took tentative sips and found the drinks cool refreshing and strong gamay looked around the settlement dr ramirez said that youre a trader what sort of goods do you trade i realize that to an outsider this must look like a poor place but these simple people are capable of artistic work that is quite sophisticated i give them my services as a middleman in marketing their crafts to gift shops and the like from the impoverished appearance of the village the middle man must take the lions share of the money gamay guessed she made a show of looking around we also understand that you are married is your wife away paul hid his smile behind the mug gamay was very much aware that the native woman was dieters wife and she didnt like the way the dutchman treated her dieter flushed then called the woman over this is tessa he grunted gamay stood and extended her hand in greeting the woman looked at her in surprise and after a moments hesitation she took the proffered hand nice to meet you tessa my name is gamay and this is my husband paul the fleeting ghost of a smile crossed tessas dusky face sensing that dieter would make tessa pay for it later if she pushed too far gamay nodded and sat down tessa stepped back to where she had been standing dieter covered his annoyance with a meaty smile now that i have answered your questions the purpose of your arduous trip paul leaned forward onto the table and looked up over the top of his nonexistent glasses the body of an indian came ashore upriver in a dugout canoe dieter spread his hands the rain forest can be dangerous and its inhabitants are only one generation removed from savagery a dead indian is not unusual i am sorry to say this one was paul replied he was shot shot theres more he was a chulo that is serious dieter said with a shake of his jowls any thing to do with the ghostspirits means trouble dr ramirez mentioned that the tribe is led by a woman gamay said ah youve heard the legends very colorful yes of course i have heard of this mythical goddesschief but i have never had the pleasure of meeting her gamay asked have you ever run into members of the tribe i have no firsthand knowledge of them but there are the stories what kind of stories mr von hoffman the chulo are said to live beyond the hand of god thats what the natives call the great falls some distance from here they say the five cascading waterfalls resemble giant fingers natives who have gone too close to the falls have disappeared you said the forest was dangerous yes they could have been mauled by some animal or bitten by a poisonous snake or simply become lost how about nonnatives from time to time men come this way to seek their fortune i have given them what poor hospitality i could shared my knowledge of my surroundings and most important warned them to stay away from chulo territory he made a washing motion with his hands three expeditions ignored my cautions and three have vanished without a trace i notified the authorities of course but they know the impossibility of finding some one once the trees have swallowed them up were any of those groups looking for plants that could be useful as pharmaceuticals paul said they came looking for medicine for rubber timber treasure and lost cities for all i know few who pass this way share their secrets i dont ask questions while dieter rambled on tessa had silently raised her hand and pointed toward the sky he finally noticed the strange gesture and the trouts quizzical expressions his face went rock hard then the unctuous smile reappeared as you can see tessa was most impressed by a group that passed this way not long ago in search of specimens they employed a miniature zeppelin to move above the tree canopy the natives were very much in awe of the machine and so was i i must admit who were these people gamay asked i know only that they represented a french firm you know how closemouthed the french can be what happened to them i havent the slightest idea i heard they moved on maybe they were captured and eaten by the chulo he laughed heartily at the prospect which brings me back to the purpose of your visit i thank you very much for warning me but now that you know the dangers that lurk here i trust you will go back to dr ramirez with my appreciation gamay looked at the lowering afternoon sun she and paul knew that in the tropics the sun drops with the swiftness of a guillotine blade its a little late to be starting back she said what do you think paul it would be dangerous trying to navigate that river by night dieter frowned then seeing he was getting nowhere smiled and said well then you will be my guests tomorrow you will get an early start after a good nights sleep gamay half heard his words tessas head was no longer downcast she was looking straight at gamay her eyes wide open almost imperceptibly shaking her head paul caught the gesture as well they thanked dieter for the refreshing drink and his offer of a place to stay and said they wanted to retrieve some gear from the boat as they walked toward the river the natives shied away as if the couple were surrounded by an invisible force field gamay made a pretense of checking the engine for oil did you see tessa she said she was warning us no mistaking the terror in those eyes paul said examining the dip stick what do you think we should do we dont have much choice im not enthusiastic about spending the night here in camp happy but i wasnt kidding it would be crazy to run this river in the dark do you have any suggestions yes i do gamay said watching a bat the size of an eagle flit across the river in the failing light i suggest that we dont dose our eyes at the same time chapter as austin scudded through the bluegreen baja waters on the back of a minisubmersible he wondered how a national geographic photographer filming a whale migration would react if a man riding a giant boot suddenly appeared in his cameras viewfinder perched outside like a rumble seat passenger in an old roadster austin could see joes head and shoulders outlined by the blue light from the control computer screen inside the watertight cockpit zavalas metallic voice crackled in the headphones of austins underwater communicator hows the weather out there cap austin rapped on the plexiglas dome and curled his finger and thumb in the okay sign its fine this beats muscle power any day he said zavala chuckled contos will be pleased to hear that the skipper of the sea robin had beamed with pride as he showed austin the new submersible sitting in its deck cradle the experimental minisub was a marvelously compact vehicle the operator sat in the dry pressurized cabin like the driver of a car legs stretched out into the extended eightfootlong hull two pontoons flanked the miniature cabin and on the back were the air tanks and four thrusters austin had run his fingers over the transparent bubble dome and said ill be damned this thing does look like an old boot i tried to get you the red october contos said but sean connery was using it austin wisely kept his silence numa people were known to form personal attachments to the hightech equipment under their command the uglier the gear the more intense the relationship austin didnt want to embarrass contos by explaining how he knew the sub was being fieldtested off california where the main components had been assembled he had commissioned the design and building of the minisubmersible for the special assignments team and zavala designed it numa had subs that could go faster and deeper but austin wanted a tough little vehicle that would be portable easily transported by a helicopter or boat it would have to be unobtrusive as well austin specified so as not to attract attention although he had approved the blueprints this was his first glimpse of the final product zavala was a brilliant marine engineer who had directed the construction of many manned and unmanned underwater craft for inspiration zavala used the deepworker a commercial minisub designed by phil nuytten and zegrahm deepsea voyages an adventure expedition cruise company zavala extended the range and power and added sophisticated testing capacity he claimed the instruments aboard the submersible could tell what river or glacier a drop of ocean water came from the sub was originally named the deepsee an homage to its predecessor and to its intended function as an exploration vehicle when admiral sandecker heard the designation he cringed at the pun shown the scale model he grinned it reminds me of one of the brogans i used to wear when i was a kid he said using the old slang term for hightopped workboots the new name stuck the numa ship cruised south from san diego into mexican waters staying well offshore near ensenada the sea robin began to follow the coast more closely the ship passed several fishing boats and a couple of cruise ships before long the vessel was about a half mile from the open mouth of the cove austin and zavala had scouted out earlier from land austin scoured the rugged cliffs through powerful binoculars and studied the back of the tortilla factory nothing appeared out of the ordinary large signs posted on either side of the lagoon warned of dangerous hidden rocks highlighting the warnings were caution buoys strung across the opening the sea robin sailed beyond the cove and headed into a small inlet as the anchor slid into the sea zavala eased into the minisub and made his lastminute checks with the dome se cured the cabin was watertight and carried its own air supply zavala was dressed comfortably in shorts and his new purple hussongs tshirt austin who would be immersed in water was suited out in full scuba gear and extra air tank he climbed onto the back of the brogan with his fins resting on the pontoons and fastened a quickrelease harness attached to the sub the dome was latched tight at his signal a crane hoisted the sub in the air then lowered it into the sea austin unhooked the slack holding lines and gave zavala the goahead to dive within seconds they were sinking into the sea in an explosion of bubbles the batteryoperated thrusters kicked into action with a highpitched hum and zavala steered for open water the sub rounded the point of jagged seawet rocks and followed a course directly into the mouth of the lagoon they stayed at a depth of thirtyfive feet moving well under mach one at a comfortable five knots they used a combination of austins observations and the minis instruments to navigate austin kept his head low to reduce water resistance he was enjoying the trip particularly the schools of brightly colored fish that scattered like wind blown confetti at their approach austin was glad to see fish for a less aesthetic reason their presence meant the water was still safe for living things he had not forgotten that unknown forces killed an entire pod of huge creatures that were hardier and more adaptable to their marine environment than a puny human being although sensors in the subs skin automatically sampled and tested the ambient waters austin knew that by the time he learned conditions were un healthy it might be too late approaching the mouth of the lagoon were going right up the middle zavala reported plenty of room on either side mooring line from a warning buoy off to starboard austin turned to the right and saw a thin black line running from the surface toward the bottom i see it notice anything funny yeah zavala said as they cruised by no rocks under the buoy bet you a bottle of cuervo that all the other warnings are phony too ill take the bottle but not the bet someone wants to keep people out of here thats obvious hows this buggy handling getting into a little backwash from the water swishing out of the lagoon but its still easier than driving on the beltway zavala said referring to the highway that separates washington from the rest of the country geographically and politically she handles like anuhoh whats wrong sonar is picking up multiple targets lots of them about fifty yards dead ahead austin had been lulled into complacency by the tranquility of the trip in his imagination he pictured a line of underwater guards waiting in ambush divers sonar hits are too small little or no movement austin strained his eyes in an attempt to pierce the gauzy blue thinking ahead he said whats the brogans top speed if we have to get out of here in a hurry seven knots pedal to the metal she was made more for vertical travel than horizontal and were carrying a couple of hundred extra pounds of beef ill join weight watchers when we get back austin said move in real slow but be prepared to make a dash for it they crawled ahead at half speed within moments dozens of dark objects materialized stretching from the surface to the bottom and rolling off both directions in a great wall fish looks like a net austin advised stop before we get snagged the brogan slowed to a complete halt and hovered in place austin ducked his head in reflex as a streamlined silhouette glided in from above and behind him the shark was only there for an instant long enough for austin to see its round white eye and to estimate the hungry predators length at more than six feet its toothy jaws opened then clamped shut to grab half a struggling fish in one bite before disappearing from sight with a flick of its high tail fin zavala had seen the same thing kurt are you okay he shouted austin laughed yeah dont worry that guy doesnt want a tough old human to chew on when hes got a whole seafood buffet glad to hear you say that because he invited some of his friends for dinner several more sharks swooped in grabbed a bite then wary of the sub quickly left it was less a wild feeding frenzy than a gathering of discriminating gourmands picking from the choicest items on the menu hundreds of fish were caught in the fine mesh they came in all sizes shapes and species some still alive were making fruitless attempts to free themselves only to attract the attention of the sharks others had only their heads left and bones marked the remains of many more no one has been tending the net austin said maybe someone hung it here to keep nosy guys like us out i dont think so austin said after a moments reflection that net is made of monofilament you could cut your way through it with a nail clipper no electrical wiring so it doesnt seem to have an alarm signal attached i dont get it lets think about it whatever sir that lagoon killed a pod of whales the locals would begin asking questions if they started seeing hundreds of dead fish the folks who bring you baja tortillas dont like attention so they stick the net here to keep the fish out and any dead ones in makes sense zavala agreed what next keep on going zavalas fingers danced over the computer screen that con trolled the subs functions two mechanical arms on the front of the brogan unfolded and extended like a telescope to within inches of the net the claws at the end of each arm grabbed the mesh and tore it open like an actor parting a curtain pieces of fish in various states of decomposition drifted off in every direction the job accomplished zavala brought the metal arms back to their rest position and increased throttle with austin still on the subs back they plunged through the hole and into the la goon the thirtyfoot visibility was cut in half by thousands of tiny particles of seaweed that had washed into the cove to be shredded by the razorsharp rocks the sub slowed to a walk zavala feeling his way like a blind man with a white cane they didnt see the huge object until they were almost on top of it again the sub came to a stop what is that thing zavala asked the cathedral light filtering down from the surface illuminated an enormous structure it was about three hundred feet wide austin estimated and about thirty feet thick tapered at the ends like a huge metal lens and resting on four thick metal legs the legs were hidden by boxlike structures where they sank into the sea its either a big metal spider or a sunken ufo austin said in wonder in any case lets take a closer look at austins direction zavala steered the sub off at an angle and cruised along the perimeter as far as they could then re traced their path and went along the other side the structure was almost perfectly round except where it butted up close to the undersea cliffs hey this is amazing im getting high heat readings i can feel the heat through my wet suit someone has cranked up the btus the instruments indicate that its coming from the pillars must be conduits as well as supports nothing dangerous yet park this thing while i go in for a closer look the mini dropped lightly to the bottom and rested on its pontoons austin unhooked the harness and peeled off with instructions for zavala to turn on the positioning strobe light in fifteen minutes austin swam toward the disk then over it except for a circular skylight the odd structure was fabricated of metal painted a dull green which would have been difficult to see from the surface he dropped down onto the dome itself and peered cautiously through the skylight below was a network of pipes and machines men in white frocks walked about the welllit cavernous space austin puzzled over the function of the machines trying to put what he saw together with the hot water discharges but came up with nothing he undid a portable waterproof video camera from his belt and filmed the scene below satisfied with his work he decided to get an overview he rose off the disk and was panning the camera when he saw movement out of the corner of his eye he froze floating above the structure the eggshaped elevator zavala had described descended from the shimmering surface it moved along its track and disappeared into a circular hatch that was opening on the roof of the underwater structure closest to the face of the cliff austin resumed his camera work only to be interrupted again this time by zavala better get back here pronto the water temp readings are shooting up there was no mistaking the urgency in zavalas voice on my way austin threshed the water with strong kicks of his powerful legs maintaining a rhythm that ate up the yards zavala wasnt kidding about the heat buildup austin was sweating under his wet suit he vowed never to boil a lobster again hurry zavala said the temp is going off the tracks the brogans silvery beacon blinked in the gloom austin reached down and switched on a small strobe that hung from his buoyancy compensator the brogan moved in to meet him the heat had become more intense austin grabbed onto the back of the moving sub and snapped his harness buckle in place with austin aboard the brogan quickly wheeled about and was headed for the mouth of the lagoon motors whining at top speed zavala barked somethings wrong kurt i am detecting alarms inside the facility moments later austin heard a loud muffled whump he turned to look over his shoulder just as the facility exploded in a fiery ball the inferno instantly incinerated every living thing in the enclosed space superheated gas shot up pipes into the tortilla factory luckily the factory was empty be cause it was sunday the brogan wasnt as fortunate it was caught by the shock wave and tumbled end over end with austin desperately clinging on austin felt as if he had been kicked by a giant invisible mule the harness straps let go and he was flung forward arms and legs flailing in a tangle of air hoses he cartwheeled for an eternity and might have kept going halfway across the pacific if he hadnt slammed into the net strung across the mouth of the la goon he hit the mesh with his feet which was fortunate be cause a headfirst impact would have broken his neck the netting yielded then snapped back austin shot out like a rock in a boys slingshot right into the path of the oncoming submersible the minis dome had been ripped off and zavala was no longer inside the sub tumbled at austin on a collision course austin brought his knees up to his chest and wrapped his arms around them he seemed fated to be smashed like a bug on a car windshield when the sub did a little hop that took it over austins head he felt a painful impact as a pontoon grazed his shoulder then he was buffeted by secondary shock waves from multiple explosions that slowed his velocity and tossed him back after the minisub the brogan had battered its way through the net and this time there was nothing to stop him instinctively he swooped his arm out to retrieve his regulator hose clenched the mouthpiece between his teeth and took a breathy gulp of air the regulator was still working his face mask was a cobweb of fracture lines where one of the hoses had hit the lens better the mask than his face he whipped the use less mask off assumed a vertical position and did a complete turn he knew he had better get to the surface but he wasnt going to do it without zavala one more try he spun slowly around without the mask his vision was blurred but he thought he saw a spot of purple and swam toward it zavala was floating a few feet off the bottom bubbles were coming from his mouth austin pushed the regulator toward zavalas face not sure if it ever found its mark because the willpower he had been using to operate on was eaten away by the black angry surf crashing against his brain he reached down and let the quickrelease buckle go on his weight belt and groped for the inflation valve of his buoyancy compensator he thought he heard another explosion then he blacked out completely chapter trout stood at the door of the hut as motionless as a totem pole watching and listening he had been at his post for hours staring into the darkness his every sense alert to catch any change in the rhythms of the night he had watched the day wind down and seen the shadows mix with the false dusk created by smoldering cook fires the last few natives had disappeared into their huts like sullen phantoms and the village went silent except for the brief muffled cry of a baby trout was thinking what an unhealthy place this was it was as if he and gamay had stumbled into a plague ward the dutchman had kicked the family out of the hut closest to his and with a sweep of his hand ushered the trouts through the door like the doorman at the ritz slivers of light filtered through the grass walls into the dim interior hardly a breath of fresh air entered the close confines the floor was dirt a couple of hammocks were slung from support poles and the furniture consisted of two crude stools and a cutting board fashioned out of stumps the stifling heat and primitive accommodations didnt faze trout he was more bothered by the feeling he and gamay were trapped he wrinkled his nose a gesture hed picked up from his father a cape cod fisherman trout could picture his father walking to the end of the pier in the predawn darkness and sniffing the air like an old hound dog most days hed say finest kind cap lets go fishing but some mornings he would wrinkle his nose and head for the coffee shop without another word any doubts about the elder trouts olfactory prowess disappeared one beautiful morning when he stayed in port and six fishermen were lost in an unpredicted offshore storm things hadnt smelled right his father explained later trout had the same feeling although he was far from the sea in the heart of the venezuelan rain forest it was simply too quiet there were no voices no coughing nothing to indicate human habitation of any kind while it was still light trout had committed every detail of the village to his nearphotographic memory he began to imagine that the population of the village must have silently vanished in the night he backed away from the doorway and bent over the still form lying in a hammock gamay reached up and felt his face with a light touch of her fingers im awake she said just thinking about what she sat up and swung her feet onto the floor i dont trust our friend the flying dutchman any further than i could throw him not that i would touch him yech i agree with your sentiments exactly i think someone is watching us he glanced toward the doorway this hut re minds me of a lobster trap one way in no way out except to the cooking pot i suggest we spend the night on the boat much as i hate to leave these fivestar accommodations im ready when you are question how do we sneak off with someone watching simple we go out the back door there wasnt a back door last time i looked guess youve never heard of yankee ingenuity trout said smugly if you would stand watch ill put my cleverness to work he slipped a hunting knife from its belt sheath and went to the back of the hut kneeling he slipped the eightinch blade through the thatch and began to saw the rustle and snap were barely audible but to be on the safe side he timed his sawing to the cry of an unknown forest creature that made a noise like a rattail file on metal within minutes he had cut a rectangular opening about two feet square in the rear wall he went to the front of the hut and guided gamay by the arm to the newly crated exit she stuck her head through to make sure it was safe then was out in an instant pauls basketball player body slithered out a second later they stood sidebyside behind the hut listening to the sym phony of insect buzzes and bird calls earlier gamay had noticed a path that went from behind the huts to the river they could see the faint outline of hardpacked earth gamay led the way and before long the huts were behind them and their nostrils picked up the river odor of damp rot the path led to the gardens they had seen from the river in daylight they walked along the boggy edge of the river and after a few minutes saw the skeletal outline of the airboats propeller housing they stopped in case dieter had someone watching the boat paul threw a pebble into the water the plop failed to draw anyone out of hiding they went aboard and readied the boat to leave at the first sign of dawn trout tucked a life preserver under his head and stretched out on the deck gamay climbed onto the seat and took her turn at the watch paul soon dozed off at first he slept fitfully because of the heat and insects his exhaustion caught up with him and eventually he slipped into a deep sleep in his slumber he heard gamay calling his name as if from far away light was coming through his eyelids he blinked and saw gamay still on her perch her face grotesque in a flickering yellow glow three dugout canoes were pulled up alongside the airboat the canoes carried fiercelooking indians armed with razor sharp spears and machetes the raw flames from the blazing torches they held in their free hands illuminated the garish red paint on their bronze bodies and faces black bangs came down to where their eyebrows would have been if they hadnt been plucked clean the indians were clad in loincloths except for one who wore a new york yankees cap on his head trout eyed the shotgun the man cradled in his arms one more reason to hate the yankees he thought trout grinned and said hi the granite expressions remained unchanged the man with the shotgun motioned for the trouts to get off the boat they climbed onto the shore where the indians clustered around them the yankees fan jerked the shotgun again in the direction of the village with the trouts in the middle the torchlight procession started up the slope sorry paul gamay whispered they just came out of nowhere not your fault i thought any threat would come from land me too what was the deal with the smile i couldnt think of anything else to do i guess dieter is smarter than we thought he was gamay said begrudgingly i dont think so look as they approached the clearing in front of the huts they saw dieter he was looking very pale and frightened in the torchlight and for good reason more indians surrounded him their spear points inches from his ample belly sweat dripped off his face but he couldnt get to it because his hands were in the air as if he didnt have enough to worry about two white men had their handguns leveled at his heart they were dressed identically in cotton pants longsleeved tshirts and hightopped leather boots both wore what looked like wide leather linesmans belts with metal clips attached one was a hulking slovenly type who badly needed a shave the other was short and slim and had the dark flat eyes of a cobra the boss indian handed him the colt the hard eyes studied the trouts for an instant then flicked back to the dutchman here are your couriers dieter the man said with a french accent do you still deny that you tried to doublecross me dieter began to sweat even more profusely the perspiration coming off his face like a waterfall i swear to god i never saw them before this morning victor they simply showed up here and said ramirez sent them to tell me about the dead indian and to warn trouble was brewing a sly look came into his yellow eyes i didnt believe them i put them in the hut where i could keep an eye on them yes i noticed your extraordinary security measures victor said with undisguised contempt he turned to the trouts who are you my name is paul trout this is my wife gamay were re searchers working with dr ramirez on a river dolphin project why are you here there are no dolphins in this part of the river thats true paul said we found the body of an indian in a canoe dr ramirez thought trouble might be brewing and wanted us to warn this village why didnt ramirez himself come with this warning he hurt his ankle and couldnt walk besides we wanted to see more of the rain forest convenient the frenchman hefted the colt is this part of your scientific equipment no it belongs to dr ramirez he insisted that we take it in case we ran into trouble from the looks of things id say he was right victor laughed your story sounds so stupid it might actually be plausible he appraised gamay as only a frenchman could look at a woman gamay an unusual name with french roots gamay recognized lechery where victor saw charm but she was not above using her feminine attributes for leverage the frenchmen i have met in the past would have introduced them selves by now ah pardon my bad manners it must be my association with people like this cochon here dieter flinched as victor waved his pistol barrel under the dutchmans nose my name is victor arnaud this is my assistant carlo he said indicating his silent companion we are employed by a european cartel that is seeking the acquisition of rare biological substances from the rain forest youre botanists then like dr ramirez no he said with a shake of his head the work is too rigorous at this point for botanists we have a working knowledge of biology but we are the advance collection team who will bring back interesting specimens for the scientists to analyze they will come later when we have paved the way so youre looking for pharmaceuticals paul ventured perhaps as a byproduct arnaud said it is no secret the next cure for cancer may be growing in the wondrous biological treasure house above our heads he tapped his long nose then his lips we are here primarily seeking fragrances for perfumes and essences tastes for the food industry if we come across medicinal extracts so much the better we have the permission of the venezuelan government and our operation is entirely legitimate paul let his gaze drift over the ferociouslooking painted savages the leveled guns and the patently terrified dieter he didnt believe for an instant that these jungle thugs were doing anything legitimate he didnt want to set arnaud off by being too inquisitive but he knew it would seem peculiar if he didnt show curiosity youll hardly be surprised if i observe that youre quite heavily armed for a scientific party paul said of course arnaud said taking the comment in stride ramirezs fears were not without foundation you can see how dangerous the forest is you yourself have seen a dead man his mouth curved in an ironic smile you must wonder what our relationship is with this wretched creature he said speaking of dieter he has given us the men of this village to help in our search for biological specimens they know the forest better than anyone he is paid handsomely i might add paul grinned looks as if youre about to fire mr von hoff man from his job and for good reason even if what you have to say about yourselves is true that you are not couriers this does not change the fact that dieter here tried to steal from us we had been looking for an extremely valuable plant that could be worth mil lions billions possibly to the pharmaceutical food and perfume industry its quite a wonder we were going to take samples to europe for analysis the natives have been using it for decades although not for perfume unfortunately you seem to have solved your problem gamay said you have both dieter and the specimens i wish it were as simple as that arnaud said with an edge in his voice true we have this pig but our valuable plant samples seem to have disappeared im afraid i dont understand we had heard of this amazing plant from the natives but none of them was able to locate it we had gone far beyond our original area of operations into uncharted parts of the forest which is where we came across the indian you were later to find dead he had samples of the plant in his possession we offered to pay him to show us where he got the specimens but he re fused we made him our guest in the hopes we could persuade him to change his mind paul remembered the welts on the indians body so when he wouldnt talk you shot him oh no nothing so simple as that in fact we were doing our best to keep him alive dieter was in charge of providing hospitality and safeguarding the specimens he got drunk one night and let him escape the poor devil was shot stealing a canoe we assumed he got away with the specimens in which case he would have had them when you found him what did these specimens look like paul asked quite unimpressive really small tapered leaves with red veins which give the plant its local name blood leaf we examined the contents of the indians bag paul said there was a medicinal pouch full of folk medicine herbs nothing like you described so arnaud said he turned a scornful eye back to dieter you said the indian left with the plant in his possession who is telling the truth i dont know what theyre talking about dieter countered the indian took his bag and everything in it i dont think so arnaud said quietly if they had the plant specimens they would not have come back and acted so stupidly i think you have what we want he cocked his revolver and if you dont tell me where it is i shall kill you then youd never find it arnaud the dutchman said dredging up a shred of defiance it was bad timing arnaud was clearly in no mood to dally true but before i killed you id turn you over to my painted friends here they would have no compunction against skinning you like a monkey color drained from dieters florid face i did not mean i would not tell you i only meant there must be room to negotiate all opportunity for negotiation has passed regretfully im tired of this affair im tired of you he raised the pistol to dieters lips im tired of your lying mouth there was a tremendous boom and the lower half of the dutchmans face disappeared in an explosion of crimson from the pointblank shot the monocle popped from his unbelieving eye and his body toppled over backward like a tree felled by a chainsaw the frenchman turned the smoking gun on paul as for you i dont know if you are telling the truth or not my instinct tells me that you are its very unfortunate that you happened to visit this pig nothing personal but i cant let you carry away news of what has been going on he shook his head sadly i assure you i will make it quick for your beautiful wife paul was lightyears ahead of the frenchman hed been shocked by dieters summary execution but he knew immediately what arnauds move meant for gamay and him no wit nesses trouts lanky body and normally languorous movements were deceptive he could move quickly when he had to he tensed his arms ready to grab arnauds wrist and twist him to the ground he knew that at the best he would take the bullet but gamay might get away in the confusion at the worst they would both be killed as arnauds finger tightened on the trigger and trout pre pared to make his lastditch move there was a sound half grunt half cough from the indian wearing the yankees baseball cap he had dropped the shotgun and now he looked down in terror at the brown wooden shaft of an oversized arrow that protruded at least two feet from the front of his chest its barbed point glistened with red he made a motion to grab onto the arrow but the tremendous hemorrhaging from the projectile took its toll and he crumpled to the ground near dieters body another indian cried out chulo a giant arrow cut him down as soon as the shout left his lips his companions took up the horrified chant chulo chulo there was a strange ululating cry and a ghastly blueand white face appeared in the bushes then another and within seconds the masklike faces seemed to be everywhere more arrows filled the air more indians fell torches dropped or were thrown to the ground in panic in the darkness and confusion pauls long arm reached over and grabbed gamay by the wrist shocking her out of her trance ducking low they ran toward the river with the same thought get to the boat in their frantic haste they almost bowled over the slender figure who stepped out of the shadows and stood in their way stop she said firmly it was dieters wife tessa were going to the boat gamay said come with us no she said and pointed to the river look in the light of the torches they carried dozens of bluefaced men could be seen swarming ashore from large canoes the woman tugged at gamays arm this way is safer she led the trouts out of the clearing and they plunged into the dark forest bushes and thorns whipped at their legs and faces the ululation grew fainter they could have been at the center of the earth as far as they knew it was just as hot and dark where are you taking us gamay said stopping to catch her breath cant stop now chulo come soon sure enough the strange war cry began to increase in strength they kept moving until dieters wife stopped after several minutes they were in a grove of trees dwarfed by the huge misshapen trunks that soared for more than a hundred feet tessa was barely visible in the moonlight streaming down from openings in the tree canopy she had raised her hand the trouts lifted their eyes to the treetops they saw only darkness broken here and there by the silvergray night sky the woman detected their confusion and like a teacher working with blind children she opened their hands and placed something in them that felt like dead snakes thick nylon ropes paul remembered the belts arnaud and his pal wore and dieters comment about the zeppelin he quickly fashioned a loop around gamays thin waist she hauled on the other end of the line and began to rise above the ground paul looked around dieters wife had vanished they were on their own keep going he said im right behind you he rigged an other rope around his own waist and with several strong pulls was yards off the ground by the hard sound of breathing gamay was just ahead from below came a burst of the strange warbling cry the torches of the chulos appeared the indians threw the torches into the air where they arced and fell like exhausted comets gamay and paul expected to be skewered by oversized arrows that could easily reach them but they kept pulling just as they thought they were out of range they looked down and saw two of the indians lift off the ground of course paul thought if there were two hauling ropes there would be others as well gamay yelled from above his head im at the top paul kept climbing and felt his wifes hand reach down to help him clamber onto a branch thicker than a mans waist grunting with effort he pulled himself onto the limb and reached for another branch his hand touched a smooth rubbery surface the pewter light from a half moon was diffused by a mist that hung over the trees but he could see a large plat form of mesh and tubing draped like a giant spiders web over the canopy it was an ingenious working platform trout thought but he would have to save his admiration for later heavy breathing was coming from under their feet paul grabbed for his hunting knife and remembered that one of the indians had taken it from him at the same time he was relieved of the colt gamay yelled and pointed at the rotund silhouette of a small blimp floating above their heads there was a crack of twigs from just under their feet the chulos were seconds away paul detached himself from the lifting line and walked with some difficulty across the spongy mesh until he reached a mooring rope he gripped the line and used his weight to pull the blimp down to where gamay could clamber into the seat hanging under the gas bag with her weight holding the blimp down he climbed in next to her do you know how to operate one of these things gamay said cant be too hard think of it as a boat first thing you do is cast off gamay had sailed the great lakes as a child so the comparison was reassuring even if she didnt believe it they quickly untied the other mooring lines the blimp hesitated then made up its mind and rose slowly above the trees they looked down and saw shadows leaping to grab the dangling lines but the blimp was safely out of reach they rose high above the fogfilled valleys that stretched off in every direction and began to drift like a milkweed seed wondering if they had simply exchanged one set of dangers for an other chapter senor senor austins eyes blinked open to see a white stubble of whiskers covering leathery cheeks and a gaptoothed mouth stretched wide in a jackolantern grin it was the face of the mexican fisherman he and joe had met on the cliffs the day before austin lay on his back in an open wooden boat his head cushioned by a coil of rope he was still in his wet suit but his scuba gear was gone he pushed himself upright with his hands a task of no small difficulty because his joints were sore and he was sprawled on a slimy pile of fish a fisherman who strongly resembled the first man right down to the cleft in his dental work sat at the other end of the boat keeping watch over zavala joes hair normally so neatly combed sprouted in a hundred different directions and his shorts and tshirt were dripping wet he looked dazed but awake you okay austin called out a fish flopped onto zavalas lap he carefully picked up the creature by the tail and tossed it with the others no broken bones now i know what its like to be shot out of a cannon how about you a few aches and pains austin rubbed the throbbing muscles of his shoulder then went to work on his legs i feel like ive gone through a car wash and a telephone keeps ringing in my ear your voice sounds like its still coming over an underwater communicator do you know what happened i was coming to get you in the brogan when all hell broke loose there was an underwater explosion austin glanced at the mirrorflat sea the boat lay off the cove entrance the sea robin was nowhere in sight austin couldnt figure it contos and his crew would have heard the blast why hadnt they come out to investigate he turned his attention back to their own predicament would you ask our friends how we got here zavala questioned the fishermen in spanish one of them did most of the talking speaking in rapid fire as his brother nodded in agreement zavala thanked him and translated the ex change this mans name is juan zavala said he remembers us from yesterday up on the cliffs the other guy is his brother pedro they were fishing when they heard a big muffled roar and the water bubbled and foamed in the inlet si si la bufadora juan said he threw his hands expansively into the air like an orchestra conductor calling for a crescendo whats with the theatrics austin asked he says the noise was like the blowhole outside ensenada where the sea comes into a cleft in the rocks and makes a big boom only it was many times louder the cliff split away be hind the tortilla factory there were big swells and the boat al most capsized then we popped out of the water they pulled us in like a couple of overgrown sardines and here we are austin scanned the sea again did they mention seeing the sea robin they saw a ship earlier from their description it must have been the robin it went around to the other side of the headland and they havent seen it since austin was starting to worry about contos and his crew please thank our benefactors for their kindness and ask if they would mind taking us around the point zavala relayed austins request and the fishermen started the old mercury outboard in a cloud of blue smoke coughing like an asthmatic corn popper the motor effortlessly moved the boat through the silken sea with juan manning the tiller they rounded the headland and immediately saw why the sea robin hadnt left its mooring the numa ship wasnt going anywhere for a while the deck was covered with a small mountain of dirt and boulders and the vessel listed heavily to the starboard the aframe at the stern and the freestanding cranes on the aft deck had been twisted as easily as pretzels by the debris above the boat the steep cliff face was layered with yellow strata exposed by the rockslide crew members were attacking the rubble with shovels and crowbars tossing what debris they could manage over the side a forklift was moving the bigger rocks juan maneuvered the fishing boat alongside the numa vessel contos came to the rail and leaned over his hands and face were caked with dirt and he looked as if he had crawled out of a mine austin cupped his hands and called out anyone hurt a few cuts and bruises contos yelled back luckily the aft deck was clear we had heard a loud boom from the cove and were about to check it out then the whole side of the cliff came down before we could weigh anchor where the hell have you two been i like your new makeup austin said joe chimed in is it estee lauder contoss attempt to rub the dirt off his nose only made it worse its evident from your wiseass comment that youre hale and hearty when youre through being obnoxious would you mind telling me what happened that boom you heard was an underwater explosion joe said contos shook his head in disbelief i dont know of any volcanic activity along here what caused it best we can say for sure is that it was centered in the under water installation austin said he gave austin a blank look well explain later austin surveyed the yellowed the explosion shook the slide loose contos furrowed his brow hey he said as a thought struck him what did you do with the brogan austin and zavala looked at each other like guilty children who had broken the cookie jar austin was beginning to wonder if he were a jonah the name mariners give a seaman who at tracts calamity this was the second craft he had lost in as many days we lost her austin said sorry it couldnt be helped juan and pedro here hauled us out of the water pleased to meet you contos said to the smiling fishermen not much we can do about it now numa will simply have to build me a new one austin swept his eyes over the tilted hull of the sea robin your vessel has quite a list are you in any danger of sinking i think well be okay no leaks detected so far well see what happens once we get under way most of the damage is to the deck and superstructure the cranes are useless as you can see the forklift can move the big stuff we havent called for help because we dont want to have to explain what were doing in mexican waters do we have time to check out the cove contos looked over his shoulder at the rubble still to be re moved be my guest well get under way as soon as were able zavala asked the fishermen to take them back to the inlet the request started an animated argument between the brothers pedro had had enough of the cursed place with its strange explosions and stranger mermen popping out of the sea he clearly wanted to go home but his brother prevailed the boat made its way around the headland as they entered the cove they could see smoke coming from the tortilla factory like the cliff above the sea robin the sheer face behind the factory was layered yellow where the outer rock cover had been dislodged by the explosion the rock slide had taken with it all traces of the monorail elevator the fishing boat cut a path through the debris and dead fish that covered the surface of the inlet using a bucket austin and zavala scooped pieces of melted plastic and charred paper from the water remembering how a tiny piece of metal had helped track down the source of the twa jet explosion over locker bee scotland austin figured even the tiniest fragment might be of use the work was painstaking but their persistence paid off zavala snagged a metal cylinder bobbing in the water it was about two feet long and six inches in diameter austin found a serial number and the name of its manufacturer etched into the metal joe called his attention to movement at the top of the cliffs human specks could be seen lining the bluff austin didnt feel like answering questions for the local authorities the fishermen were happy to head back to the ship the deck was practically clear as they pulled up next to the sea robin the ship was close to its normal pitch austin borrowed some money from contos and tried to pay the fishermen for their services but the brothers refused the cash juan explained through zavala that showing them the hole in the fence was a service for which he would accept payment but saving men from the sea was a moral duty austin thought about it then persuaded the fishermen to accept a gift of friendship after discussing it with contos they presented the happy fishermen with an outboard motor soon to be retired from service but in excellent shape the engines were started and the ship slowly headed for open water no leaks were detected contos set a course north they left just in time as they cruised along a dark green helicopter appeared out of nowhere circled the inlet several times then dashed off to the north as quickly as it had come they mingled with the boat traffic around ensenada where they spotted a mexican coast guard boat steaming at full speed in the opposite direction with the sea robin safely on its way the numa men hit the showers and got into dry clothes they rejoined contos on the bridge he had a fresh pot of coffee waiting okay gentlemen he said pouring two hot steaming mugs as skipper of this vessel which you commandeered for what turned out to be a commando mission id appreciate it if you would fill me in austin took a sip of the highoctane brew and decided he had never tasted anything more delicious the explosion was a surprise to us he said our basic mission was pretty simple we wanted to check out the source of the heat that may have killed those whales we think we found it he described the underwater structure as they first saw it filling contos in on the approach the fake hazard buoys the fishing net and the high water temperature then he turned the narrative over to joe putting himself back underwater in the moments before the explosion zavala curled his hands as if he were clutching an in visible steering wheel everythings fine we figure the high temperature readings are coming from the installation you set off for a closer look and i put the sub on the bottom to wait the temps start to go off the charts and i suggest you get back to the brogan austin reached into his memory i had just looked through a skylight on the top of the structure when i got your call there were people and machinery inside i headed back to the sub then boom you said the structure was full of piping zavala said some of it would have been highpressure conduits hence the potential for explosion i dont know there could have been a flaw in the piping but this was a sophisticated operation they would have had layers of safety valves and shutoffs to prevent a pressure buildup from what i could see there was nothing out of the ordinary nobody was rushing around in a panic no indication of any thing wrong what about the water temperature buildup good question although the satellite photos indicate this isnt the first time there has been a hightemperature water discharge into the cove so it probably didnt have a direct link to the explosion austin had brought a plastic bag with him he opened it and produced the metal cylinder we found this floating in the cove any idea what it is contos examined the object and shook his head ill try to track down the manufacturer when we get back to washington guess your instincts were right kurt remember back at hussongs when you said you had the feeling a big badassed something was watching us austins coral eyes hardened if youll remember i made an other astute observation what was that i said that whatever it is lurking in the shadows the damned thing is as hungry as hell you two are spooky contos said it sounds as if youre talking about godzilla austin said nothing he stared out at the bow cleaving the waves as if the answers to the questions whirling around in his head could be found beneath the bluegreen of the sea chapter the hand of god the airship glided over the rain forest like a huge elongated japanese lantern pulsating with a soft blueandorange light as twin tongues of flame from the propane burners heated the air inside the big sausageshaped envelope except for the occasional burner blast the only evidence of the crafts existence was a silent shadow that blotted out the moon and stars like a passing cloud what paul and gamay thought to be a blimp was actually a thermal airship an ingenious cross between a hotair balloon and a dirigible hotair burners provided lift but unlike a balloon which goes where the wind takes it the thermal airship had an engine and could be steered under power the more streamlined zeppelin silhouette had replaced the customary pearshaped air bag known as the envelope the envelope kept its shape with internal air pressure instead of a rigid blimp skeleton the trouts sat sidebyside at the front of the aluminum frame gondola held in their comfortable padded seats by full harnesses from their perspective slung under the belly of the envelope the blimp looked enormous the polyester fabric bag was one hundred feet long and half that in height it had a full rudder at the back end for steering and large thick fins for stability behind the passenger seats were the propane tanks that fueled the burners the fuel containers for the rotex twostroke power plant the engine itself and the threeblade propeller that provided lateral thrust paul and gamay had taken turns acquainting themselves with the airships controls both trouts had ridden in balloons and knew the principles of hot air the airships operation was relatively simple a footoperated valve controlled the stainless steel burners that kept hot air flowing through a metal chute into the envelope the instrument panel had only half a dozen gauges the trouts watched the altimeter with gimlet eyes keeping the airship at about two thousand feet an altitude that would give them a reasonable safety margin keeping the airship aloft had drained the propane from one tank and they were operating on reserve they had been waiting for daylight to use the power plant so a plentiful fuel supply remained for the propeller drive a pearlgray glow in the east announced the coming of dawn soon the sky turned rosepetal pink even after the sun rose the visibility was obscured by fog the vapors rising off the tree canopy absorbed the skys hue and a roiling reddish sea of mist stretched off to the horizon while paul operated the airship gamay rummaged around in a storage box between the two seats time for breakfast she announced cheerfully ill have mine over easy paul replied crisp on the bacon please and the home fries burned around the edges gamay offered paul a choice of granola bars you can have raspberry or blueberry ill try room service he flicked on the radio but all they heard was the crackle of static bet phineas fogg never had to rough it like this paul said with a frown aw hell ill take blue berry she handed him a bar and a bottle of warm mineral water that was quite a night yes i would say that having a brush with ruthless bio pirates witnessing a coldblooded murder and escaping from savage indians would certainly qualify as quite a night we owe our lives to tessa i wonder how she got hooked up with dieter shes not the first woman to show poor judgment in men if you had married a lawyer or a doctor instead of a fishermans son you would be floating in your backyard pool instead of being up here how boring gamay chewed thoughtfully on her breakfast bar any idea where we are mr fishermans son he shook his head i wish my dad were here he learned how to navigate the oldfashioned way before we started to depend on electronic gear what about the compass not much use unless youve got landmarks or navigational buoys to go with it thats obviously east he pointed to the sun the dutchmans settlement was south and west of ramirez gamay said what if we aimed this thing north east paul scratched his head that might work if we were sure we were still at the exact spot where we climbed into this rig there was a breeze last night i dont know how far it could have pushed us could make a big difference and weve only got a limited amount of fuel left for the burners any decision will have to be the right one the engine tanks are full but it wont do much good to go forward if we lose altitude gamay gazed over the ocean of green sure is beautiful not as beautiful as three eggs over easy and bacon with home fries she handed him another granola bar use your imagination i am im trying to imagine how they got this airship into the forest they could have flown it in but thats doubtful be cause this isnt big enough to carry all the supplies and spare fuel it would need my guess is they launched it from the ground not far from where we found it since there are no roads gamay said picking up the thread of logic they probably came in by water if we found the river or tributary we could retrace our way back to dr ramirezs camp perhaps if we went higher wed see more of the forest brilliant he said and goosed the throttle with his foot the burners responded with a throaty whisper and after a pause the aircraft began to rise as they ascended the heat of the sun was beginning to burn off the mist the tree canopy began to appear as ragged patches of green reddish flowers grew in patches on the treetops like coral reefs at three thousand feet gamay squinted through the haze i see something over there paul started the power plant and turned the steering wheel that controlled the cables running to the rudder until the airship came slowly about with the watercooled engine purring quietly the airship gained speed slowly as it overcame its inertia and before long the propeller was kicking them along at ten miles per hour gamay had found a pair of binoculars and was using them to scope out where they were going incredible she said as the mists cleared what do you see gamay was silent for a second the hand of god she said with quiet awe paul hesitated he hadnt slept much and was slow on the uptake the great falls the dutchman talked about gamay nodded even at this distance its magnificent paul tried to increase their speed he sensed something peculiar about the controls the airship seemed to be dragging he peered down and saw a red triangular object dangling from lines attached to the gondola hello he said weve got company gamay lowered the binoculars and followed pauls gaze it looks vaguely like a life raft made out of rubber tubing and mesh in the middle they probably used it to drop people and supplies off on the tree canopy sounds like a reasonable explanation well have to be careful it doesnt catch in the treetops he lifted his head to check on their course what he saw sent chills up his spine they were approaching a high headland that rose from the forest in the shape of a giant step a river coursed from the forest toward the precipice of the plateau where rocky formations broke the flow into five waterfalls with the sunlight sparkling off the white water the streams looked like gems being run through the fingers of a diamond merchant the falls had the deceptive slowmotion look that water has when it plunges from a great height a thick cloud of foglike condensation rose from the explosive force of thousands of gallons of water cascading into a lake directly below the steepsided bluff paul said those falls make niagara look like a herring brook all that water has to have an outlet gamay scanned the perimeter of the lake paul over there i can see the river its flowing out of the lake all we have to do is follow it not unless you see a gas station too trout said with a glance at the propane fuel gauge the tank was practically on empty were about to drop out of the sky we can still move forward get us as close to the river as possible well ditch this thing and use the raft trout did a mental rundown of a water splashdown the gondolas weight would pull it under the water residual air in the envelope might keep the gondola from going down immediately but the hundreds of square feet of fabric would pose a hazard trapping them in its folds they should both be clear of the airship before it hit water and do their best to keep the raft in tact it could be their ticket out of the forest paul quickly outlined his analysis and plan i think we should cut the raft loose before we land otherwise we could lose it gamay took another look over the side nine nylon lines three at each corner were attached to the dangling raft theres a swiss army knife in the storage box she said paul tested the sharpness of the blade with his thumb and tucked the knife in the big pocket of his cargo shorts you take us in he said get us as low to the water as you can ill cut the raft free then i bring this buggy to a hover and we abandon ship and go in for a swim gamay said as easy as onetwothree paul said with a grin gamay took over the steering wheel and put the airship into a slow turn away from the falls sunlight streaming through the mists that rose off the lake created multiple rainbows gamay hoped it was a good sign the gondola tilted from pauls weight as he climbed out onto the right side of the framework he looked down at the red tri angle swinging about thirty feet below and made his way to the rear of the gondola behind the tanks and burners he sawed away at the lines attached to the rear left corner of the raft then continued across the gondolas framework and repeated his work attached to the gondola only by its nose lines the raft bobbed and twisted in the wind using a light foot on the burner control gamay aimed for a spot near the river bringing the airship down in a long easy glide she was starting to think that his crazy scheme might work her optimism vanished as the burner went ploof then was silent they had run out of fuel at an altitude of a thousand feet there was no immediate change in the airships behavior the heated air maintained the envelopes streamlined shape and the propeller kept the craft at a shallow angle the airship continued on its heading at five hundred feet altitude the situation began to come apart at the seams as the air cooled lift was lost and the angle of descent became steeper pressure inside the envelope diminished as well and the front end developed a dent the airship assumed the shape of a rotten tomato and swung to the left paul was working a few feet directly in front of gamay he had severed two lines and was about to work on the third he had become overconfident and had released his safety grip on the framework when the blimp swerved not expecting the sudden maneuver he lost his balance and tumbled off gamay yelled helplessly the gondola was jerked violently and nosed down gamay leaned over and saw paul clutching the line immediately above the dangling raft which twisted violently snapping back and forth like a childs swing in the wind the blimps forward motion had slowed almost to a stop she looked up at the envelope which had become a formless blob then back under the gondola paul was still hanging on trout didnt want to be under the blimp when it came down he cut the line and plunged feet first into the water from a height of about fifty feet as he came to the surface the raft hit the water with a great splash gamay was operating on pure adrenaline she unsnapped her harness climbed out onto the side of the gondola took a deep breath and dove off despite the shakiness of the platform and the fact that it was plunging rapidly toward the water gamay did a classic swan dive that would have earned her a top score in an olympic competition she hit the water with arms out stretched her body straight went deep then kicked her way quickly back to the shimmering surface just in time to see the airship come down directly on top of the raft the raft disappeared under the layered folds of the envelope along with any hope it could be used to float their way home she was more concerned about paul for the moment and was relieved beyond words when she heard his voice calling although she still couldnt see him pulled under by the gondola the envelope sank taking the raft with it she saw pauls head bobbing on the other side of the sinking airship he waved and they swam toward each other meeting in the middle they treaded water for a few moments gazing with awe at the cascading streams then taking advantage of the push from the water rippling out from the falls they began to swim for the distant shore chapter fbi special agent miguel gomez leaned his beefy wrestlers body back in his swivel chair laced his fingers behind his head and gazed in wonderment at the two men sitting on the other side of his desk you gentlemen must like tortillas one hell of a lot to want to see enrico pedralez austin said well pass on the tortillas we just want to ask pedralez a few questions impossible the agent said flatly shaking his head for emphasis his eyes were as dark as raisins and they had the sad and wary expression cops get when they have seen it all i dont understand austin said a hint of impatience in his voice you make an appointment with his secretary you go in and have a chat just like any businessman the farmer isnt just any businessman the farmer i was unaware he was into agriculture too gomez couldnt hold back a toothy grin guess you could call it agriculture did you hear about the big search for bodies buried at a couple of ranches just over the border sure austin said it was in all the papers they found dozens of corpses probably people killed by drug dealers i was one of the fbi field agents the mexicans allowed to come in on that operation the ranches were owned by enrico or rather in the names of guys who worked for pedralez zavala who was sitting in the other chair said youre telling us the tortilla king is a drug dealer gomez leaned forward onto his desk and counted on his fingers drugs prostitution extortion kidnapping medicaid fraud purse snatching and making a public nuisance of himself you name it his organization is like any other conglomerate that doesnt put all its eggs in one basket the bad boys are taking their cue from wall street diversification is the byword in the mexican mafia these days mafia austin said that might present a little problem nothing little about it the agent said he was on a roll the mexican mafia makes the sicilians look like choir boys the old cosa nostra would whack a guy but it was hands off the family the russian mob will wipe out your wife and kids if you get out of line but even with them its purely business with the mexicans its personal anyone who gets in their way is of fending their machismo enrico doesnt just kill his enemies he grinds them their relatives and their friends into powder thanks for the warning austin said unfazed by the agents monologue now will you tell us how we go about seeing him gomez let out a whooping laugh he had wondered about this pair since they walked into his office and flashed their numa identification he only knew of the national underwater amp marine agency by name that it was the undersea equivalent of nasa austin and zavala didnt fit in with his preconceived notion of ocean scientists the bronzeskinned man with the penetrating bluegreen eyes and albino hair looked as if he could knock down walls with those batteringram shoulders his partner was softspoken and a slight smile played around his lips but with a mask and a sword he would have been a casting directors ideal choice to play zorro okay guys gomez said shaking his head in defeat since it is still against the law to assist a suicide i would feel better if you told me whats going down why is numa interested in a tortilla plant owned by a mexican crook there was an underwater explosion in the cove behind the plant pedralez owns in baja california we want to ask him if he knows anything were not the fbi were simply a scientific organization looking for a few answers doesnt matter all feds are the enemy asking questions about his business would be considered an aggressive act i think i see where youre going with this how do you let enrico know theyre available every dealer has a client list so buyers can be quickly matched up to acquisitions you never know when an unusual collectible will come up or how long a dealer may be able to keep the transaction exclusive ill call a couple of dealers and tell them i have to unload the pistols in a hurry ill make it sound as if im in desperate straits a crook can never resist the chance to cheat someone what if enrico has pistols like these theyre relatively rare but if he does have copies he might want them for the same reason i did for future trades the main thing is having the opportunity to talk to him hed still want to see them hold them in his hands its a collector thing say a dealer gets several anonymous queries how do we know which is enrico we know he doesnt come north of the border if i am asked to go to mexico to make the deal well know hes it they returned the files to gomez and told him of their plan might work might not its dangerous as hell no guarantee hes going to talk even if you do get to meet him weve considered that possibility gomez nodded look i hate to have something happen to a nice fellow like you i cant protect you outright because the mexicans are a little sensitive about gringo cops treading on their territory i can make certain that if he does kill you his life wont be worth a plugged peso thanks agent gomez my survivors will be reassured best i can do ill line up a few assets let me know when this thing is happening they shook hands and the numa men headed back to the hotel austin brought out the dark brown wood case from his duffel bag opened the lid and removed one of the pistols these are almost identical to a pair i have in my collection they were made by a gunsmith named boutet about the time of napoleons egyptian campaign he incorporated the sphinx and the pyramids into the barrel these were probably made for an englishman he sighted at a floor lamp the butt is cut round instead of square like the continental type but the rifling is multigrooved in the french style he replaced the pistol in its green baize id say this is irresistible bait for any collector austin consulted his list of dealers and called around he made sure the dealers knew he was extremely interested in selling the pistols even at a loss and that he was leaving san diego the next day austin believed the best cover stories are at least partially true he said his boat sank and he needed cash to pay off his bills then he and zavala went over possible eventualities and how best to respond to them an hour after he began putting feelers out austin received an excited call from a particularly vulpine dealer with a slightly shady reputation his name was latham i have a potential client for your pistols latham said with excitement hes very interested and would like to see them as soon as possible can you meet him in tijuana today its not far austin curled his thumb and forefinger and silently mouthed a word bingo no problem where would he like us to get together the dealer told him to park on the us side of the border and walk across the pedestrian bridge the pistol case would identify him austin said hed be there in two hours and hung up then he filled zavala in zavala said what if he takes you somewhere we cant help you like one of those ranches where he likes to plant people then ill keep the conversation on the pistols and well go through with the transaction if hes interested at the very least it will give me a chance to size him up austin immediately called gomez the fbi agent said hed assembled a team in anticipation they would watch austins back but couldnt get too close because pedralez would make sure austin was not followed a few minutes later the numa men were on the way south again in the borrowed pickup zavala left austin off on the american side and drove into mexico austin waited twenty minutes then walked across the bridge the pistol case tucked under his arm hed hardly gotten off the bridge when a portly middleaged man in a cheap suit approached him meester austeen he said yes thats my name the man produced a federal police badge police escort for you and your valuables he said with a grin courtesy of the chief lotsa bad people in tijuana he led the way to a dark blue sedan and held the back door open austin got in first making a quick sweep of the parking lot with his eyes zavala was nowhere to be seen austin would have been disappointed if zavala were too conspicuous but he would have felt better knowing that his back was being watched the car plunged into the tijuana traffic winding its way through a bewildering warren of slums while the driver was leering at a young woman crossing the street austin checked the rear the only vehicle behind them was a battered old yellow cab the police car stopped in front of a windowless cantina whose pockmarked stucco exterior of seasick green looked as if it had been used for target practice by an aic the old cab went speeding by austin got out and stood next to a rusty corona beer sign wondering if he was expected to go inside the cantina and whether it would be a good idea a gunmetalgray mercedes came around the corner and halted at the curb a toughlooking young man wearing a chauffeurs cap got out and wordlessly held the door open austin got in and they were off the car left the slums and drove into a middleclass neighborhood stopping in front of an outdoor cafe another young mexican opened the door and escorted austin to a table where a man was sitting by himself the man extended his hand and smiled broadly please sit down mr austin he said my name is enrico pedralez austin wondered at the banality of evil how even a monster could look so ordinary enrico was in his fifties austin guessed he was casually dressed in tan cotton slacks and a white short sleeved shirt he could have passed for any of the merchants who sold sombreros and blankets in the tourist shops he had black hair and a mustache that looked dyed and wore a great deal of gold in the form of rings wristlets and a chain a waiter delivered two tall glasses of cold fruit juice austin sipped his drink and glanced around eight swarthy men sat two at each table the men were not talking to each other they made a pretense of not looking at austin but out of the corner of his eye he caught quick glances in his direction mr pedralez might be a bit cocky about appearing in public but he took no chances thank you very much for coming to see me on such short notice ml austin i hope it was no trouble he spoke english with a slight accent not at all i was pleased to be put in touch with a potential buyer so quickly im leaving san diego tomorrow senor latham said you were involved in the boat race i was one of the losers unfortunately my boat sank a pity pedralez said he removed his sunglasses his small greedy eyes moving to the pistol case he rubbed his hands briskly together in anticipation may i see them of course austin unsnapped the clasp on the box and opened the cover h truly magnificent pedralez said with the eagerness of a true connoisseur he took a pistol out and sighted it at one of the men at a nearby table the man smiled nervously then the drug lord ran his finger over the oiled barrel boutet made in the english style for a wealthy lord no doubt that was my assessment as well the workmanship is excellent as i would expect he care fully placed the pistol back in its case and sighed theatrically unfortunately i have a similar pair oh well austin made a show of trying to hide his disappointment as austin went to close the case pedralez put his hand on his perhaps we can still do business i would like to present these as a gift to a close friend have you thought of a price yes austin said casually he looked around hoping gomez was serious about his backup and said casually i need some in formation the mexicans eyes narrowed i dont understand he said warily im in the market for some property myself theres a tortilla factory in the baja i understand that it might be available in a fire sale youre mistaken pedralez said coldly he snapped his fingers the men lounging at the surrounding tables came to alert who are you i represent an organization far bigger than yours youre a policeman fbi no im with the national underwater and marine agency im an ocean scientist and im investigating an explosion near your plant in return for information id like to make these pistols a gift the avuncular smile had vanished and enricos lips were curled in a humorless and ferocious grin do you take me for a fool i own this restaurant these men the waiters the cook they all work for me you could disappear without a trace they would swear you were never here what do i care for your pistolas he said with contempt i have dozens more austin kept his gaze leveled on enricos face tell me mr pedralez as a fellow collector what is your fascination with these old weapons the mexican seemed amused at the question the heat went out of the fierce glitter in his eyes but the temperature went down only a few degrees they represent power and the means of power yet at the same time they are as beautiful as a womans body well said and you aside from their fine workmanship they remind me that lives and fate can be altered by chance a trigger squeezed pre maturely a gun raised too quickly a single shot missing a vital organ by an inch or two they represent the luck of the draw in its most lethal terms the mexican seemed intrigued by the answer you must consider yourself very lucky to place yourself in my hands mr austin not at all i took the chance that you would be willing to chat you made your gamble i applaud your audacity unfortunately this is not your day you lose he said coldly i dont care who you are or who you represent you have drawn the death card he snapped his fingers again and the men rose from the tables and began to move in austin felt like a fox outfoxed by the hunters with an earsplitting roar of its unmuffled exhaust system the battered yellow cab squealed to a stop in front of the restaurant the car an ancient checker was still bouncing on worn shock absorbers when the cab driver got out except for the soiled seer sucker sports jacket over a hussongs tshirt the driver behind the reflecting silver lenses looked suspiciously like joe zavala joe stood on the sidewalk and called out in heavily accented english anybody here call a cab one of enricos men went over and growled at joe in spanish im looking for an american zavala said in english at the top of his voice looking past the thugs shoulder sergeant alvin york the man put his palm on zavalas chest to emphasize his point okay okay damned gringos he stalked back to his cab and lurched off trailing a purple cloud of exhaust fumes the thug turned around and laughed austin breathed a sigh of relief his eyes roved the low rooftops and he smiled zavala was passing on a message not very subtle but effective sergeant york was the kentucky sharpshooter who got the medal of honor for capturing german prisoners during world war i an amusing fellow eh mr austin very amusing good now i must go adios mr austin unfortunately we will not be meeting again wait the mexican scowled at austin as if he were a bit of lint on his shirt i wouldnt move if i were you youre in the sights of a sniper one wrong move and your head will explode like a ripe melon look up on that roof if you dont believe me and that one over there pedralez swiveled his head like a praying mantis and scanned the low rooftops three snipers placed at different locations made no effort to hide he sat down again it seems you dont believe entirely in the forces of fate what do you want i simply want to know who owns the baja tortilla factory i do of course its quite profitable really what about the underwater laboratory in the cove what do you know about that im a busy man mr austin so i will tell you the story and then we will part two years ago somebody came to me a lawyer from san diego he had a proposition someone wanted to build a factory they would pay for its construction and i would take all the profits there were conditions it had to be isolated and it had to be on the water i want to know what was built in the water i dont know a large ship came there were guards they brought something into the cove and deliberately sank it connections were made to the factory people came and went i asked no questions what do you know about the explosion he shrugged someone called afterward and said not to worry they would make good on my loss thats all i know the police dont care this lawyer who handled the deal what was his name francis xavier hanley now i must go i have told you all i can yes i know youre a busy man pedralez waved his hand the men got up from the tables and formed a corridor to the sidewalk on either side of him the mercedes appeared out of nowhere the door opened with machinelike precision the bodyguards piled into two jeep cherokees ahead of and behind the mercedes mr pedralez austin called out a deals a deal you forgot the pistols enrico answered with a mirthless smile keep them he said and added a few more words he got into the back of the car shut the door and zoomed down the street austin was sweating and it wasnt just from the heat the junky cab pulled up in front of him and tooted the horn austin slid in the passenger side and looked around in amazement whered you get this rig agent gomez was nice enough to have it waiting for me its got a hot engine and all kinds of radio gear i used to let our friends know where you were im going to hate to give it up did mr pedralez say anything austin held up the pistol case yeah he told me the next time i came to tijuana to be sure these things are loaded hes killed people for less look agent gomez we havent cornered the market on foolhardiness austin said we tried other avenues first the mexican police say the steam pipes caused the blast case closed we thought the owner might have something to tell us so we called the department of commerce they did an uhoh said the plant was owned by enrico and suggested that we get in touch with gomez in the san diego field office thats you now wed like to take the next step does he have an office in the us he wont cross the border he knows well grab him then well have to go to him this wont be easy pedralez used to be a mexican federal cop and half the police are on his payroll they protect him and turn over informants competitors or anyone else who might cause him trouble gomez unlocked a drawer in his desk he pulled out two thick files and laid them on the desk blotter this is the file on enricos dirty stuff and the other has information on his legal operations he has to launder that dirty money somewhere so hes set up or bought legitimate businesses on both sides of the mexicanamerican border the tortilla business is the leader tortillas have become worth millions of dollars since the us market opened up and people on this side of the border started eating the things a few companies control the business just look in your supermarket if you dont believe me enrico used his government connections sprinkled the bribes around to get a piece of the action he pushed the files across the desk i cant let this go out of the office but youre welcome to read it austin thanked him and took the file into a small conference room he and zavala sat on opposite sides of a table austin gave joe the file on the legal businesses told him to shout if he saw anything interesting and begin to skim through the other file he wanted a measure of the man he might be dealing with the more he read the less he liked he hadnt thought so much evil could be poured into one skin enrico was responsible for hundreds of murders and every one of the executions had its own grisly touch he was glad when zavala gave him the excuse to halt his reading got it joe said he rustled a couple of sheets of paper these are background and surveillance reports on the tortilla factory hes owned it a couple of years the fbi went down to take a peek didnt see anything suspicious sounds like they took the same tour we did except for my little side trip report says it seems like a legitimate operation nothing about the underwater facility zavala frowned nope not a word im not surprised the installation could have been floated in at night plausible how about your file did you learn anything yeah that hes one nasty sob we still have to talk to him gomez says its impossible got any ideas i might have he handed zavala a piece of paper from his file this is a list of his hobbies wine women racehorses gambling the usual things something caught my eye zavala saw it right away he collects antique firearms sounds like someone else i know austin smiled he was a serious collector of dueling pistols the walls of the old potomac boathouse where he made his home were covered with the exquisitely fashioned instruments of death he kept the most valuable pieces in a vault and had one of the finest collections in the country you remember the new pieces i bought for my collection the day before our race theyre a fine pair but they duplicate a brace i have i was planning to use them in trade with another collector chapter the scene was so awe inspiring in its terrible beauty that trout almost forgot the predicament he and gamay were in paul sat on a rocky ledge about twenty feet above the lake long legs dangling down swiveling his head back and forth to take in the whole panoramic sweep he had to strain his neck to see the tops of the falls multiple rainbows arced over the five cascades as the sun caught the droplets of water in the twisting vapor cloud that rose for hundreds of feet the roar was like that of a hundred distant loco motives at full steam trout wasnt a religious man but if anything was the hand of god he was looking at it a groan ended his reverie what are you doing gamay said with a yawn she was lying nearby in the shade of a tree thinking what a great place this would be to build a hotel ugh gamay said with a scowl she sat up and wiped the sweat from her face make sure you have air conditioning it had rained briefly an hour before and the sun returned with a vengeance their perch was well shaded by trees and bushes and they slept for a time but there was no way to escape the suffocating humidity paul was the first to awake ill get you some water paul said he fashioned a palm leaf into a cup climbed down to the lake and scooped up water in the makeshift container he spilled half the contents bringing it to gamay who was trying to pick blades of grass from her ratty looking hair she guzzled the water her eyes closed in bliss then passed what was left to paul thanks she said with a smile that was refreshing i hope you wont mind if i take a dip in our water supply she climbed down to the lake plunged in and swam out several strokes paul was thinking of joining gamay after he had quenched his thirst when a movement near the river outlet caught his eye he called out a warning but gamay couldnt hear him because of the rumble of the falls he climbed down half falling to the waters edge and dove in he swam out to gamay who was peacefully floating on her back and grabbed her by her tshirt gamay was startled at first then she laughed hey this is no time to get playful hush he said get back to shore hurry the urgency in his voice was unmistakable without a further word gamay swam quickly to shore with paul right behind her she started to climb onto the ledge paul pulled her down into a bush he held his finger to his lips and pointed toward the lake gamay squinted through the leaves and tensed as the sun glinted off wet paddles and she saw flashes of blue and white chulo paul had seen the four canoes emerge from the river into the lake they would have run right into gamay the canoes were moving in single file each canoe held three indians two were paddling and the other was riding shotgun his bow resting across his lap they seemed intent on where they were going and unaware that they were being watched the indians passed within a few yards of the hiding place so close the beads of sweat on their rippling muscles were clearly visible they moved silently across the lake until foggy tendrils enveloped them an instant later they disappeared into the vapor cloud that was some vanishing act paul said puffing his cheeks out now we know why theyre called the people of the mist gamay said using his sixfooteight height to good advantage paul stood cautiously and made sure there were no stragglers all clear he said wed better think of getting out of here i still have the swiss army knife maybe we could fashion a raft with logs and vines and float our way out gamay was staring toward the mists i have a better idea she paused it may be a little risky a little risky paul chuckled dont forget im well acquainted with the way your mind works youre about to suggest that we follow those guys and steal a canoe why not look this is their home turf so they wont expect it with all due respect for your talents with a swiss army knife i cant see us fashioning a boat that will carry the two of us god knows how many miles downriver without sinking or running into more of those characters it was tough enough traveling in an airboat they cant paddle those canoes all day they must pull them up somewhere on shore we just find them wait until dark and slip one away theyll never even miss it i bet amusement crept into pauls large hazel eyes do i detect a hint of scientific curiosity in your proposal okay i admit theres more here than simply a matter of survival dont tell me you havent wondered about this hightech tribe and the talk of a white goddess i was wondering if they have any food paul said patting his stomach he chewed thoughtfully on a blade of grass seriously were in something of a pickle and really dont have many choices we dont know where we are and arent sure how to get out of here we have no supplies as you pointed out this is their territory i suggest that we reconnoiter were strangers in a strange land we go slow and if the situation looks too dangerous we get out in a hurry agreed gamay said now as for food im fresh out of granola bars ive been watching the birds eating the berries on that bush i dont see any dead birds so theyre probably not poison berries it is paul said they cant be that bad trout was wrong the berries were so bitter it was impossible to eat even one without puckering up with empty stomachs the trouts struck off along the shore of the lake at one point where the mud looked like quicksand they climbed to higher ground and stumbled onto a footpath the trail was overgrown and looked as if it hadnt seen any recent use still they proceeded cautiously ready to dive into the bushes if they encountered anyone they trekked along the path for about a mile until they came to a place where mists from the lake rolled into the forest like vapor from a fog machine the leafy growth was as wet as if it had been pelted by a rain shower and the roar of the falls was like the beating of a thousand kettledrums they were aware that the same noise that muffled their movement could drown out the approach of a marching army the air became chilly and so damp that they put their hands over their noses so they wouldnt gag the visibility was only a few feet and they kept their heads low so their eyes could pick out the path then suddenly they were out of the forest if they were expecting to burst out on a beautiful valley like wayfarers in shangrila they were disappointed the forest was no different on the other side of the mists the path no longer led along the lake but instead veered off along a tributary that the canoes must have followed after a few minutes gamay stopped and shook her head notice anything strange about this little river paul walked over to the edge of the banking yes its much too straight to be natural it looks as if someone has taken an existing stream and marsh and cleared them out with shovel and pick my thoughts exactly gamay started walking again as i said the chulo are most fascinating they plodded ahead for several hours they had fashioned hats from palm leaves and stopped frequently to quench their thirst from the river at one point they waited out a shower they became more tense and watchful as the path widened and they began to see the imprints of a bare foot in the soft dark earth after a short discussion they decided to follow the river for a while longer then hide in the forest until dark they were dog tired and needed to replenish their energy as they plodded along they encountered a path coming in from the forest to their right it was made of thousands of flat stones and reminded gamay of the maya or inca roads it was as good as anything she had seen on the appian way their curiosity got the best of them and they followed the paved path for five more minutes they were drawn on even farther by a gleam through the trees the walkway widened into a perfectly circular clearing about fifty feet in diameter and also surfaced entirely with stones in the center of the clearing was a large object ill be damned they said in unison the jet plane was in two sections the front was intact but the passenger cabin was virtually gone the tail section was in fair shape and had been moved directly behind the cockpit giving the aircraft a short stubby look the paint was old and faded and not overgrown by vines or lichen as might be expected they peered through the cracked cockpit windows expecting to see skeletons the seats were empty directly in front of the cockpit was a shallow pit holding the blackened ashes of fires and charred bones of small animals carved totems as tall and thick as a man ringed the stone circle the figures adorning each post were different carved in dark wood at the top of each pole was a winged woman with her hands cupped in front of her it was the same figure carved onto the medallion they had found on the dead indian it looks like some sort of shrine gamay whispered she went over to the ash pit this must be where they burned sacrifices mostly bones from small animals thats certainly reassuring paul said he looked up at the sun then checked his watch theyve got the plane positioned so that it acts like a sundial it reminds me of the layout at stonehenge with the concentric rings that acted as a celestial calendar gamay put her hand on the planes nose does this blue andwhite color scheme seem familiar to you what do you know the chulo national colors gamays eyes widened as she looked past paul who had his back to the forest thats not the only thing around here thats blue and white paul turned and saw about twenty chulo indians emerge from the trees their faces and bodies painted the colors of sky and bone he cursed himself for allowing the planes discovery to push caution aside as silently as the ghosts they were reputed to be the indians surrounded them there was no way to run paul and gamay were completely boxed in the indians advanced with their spears held high but then they did a peculiar thing they opened the circle one indian indicated with his spear that they were to go through the opening the trouts glanced at each other for mutual reassurance then with the silent indians flanking them like a military honor guard they marched from the shrine and followed the path along the river the path widened into a road that took them to a stockade palisade they made their way toward a gate wide enough to drive a truck through from a distance they had seen on either side of the gate tall wooden staffs that had knobs on the top like flagpoles as they neared the entrance gamay squeezed her husbands hand even tighter paul look she said he followed her gaze oh hell the knobs were in fact human heads their faces had been baked brown like apples in the sun and the birds and insects had been making inroads but it was still possible to pick out dieters features he wasnt smiling neither was arnaud or his taciturn assistant carlo the fourth head belonged to their indian henchman trout recognized him by the new york yankees baseball cap then they were through the gates past the grisly decorations behind the fence were several dozen long thatched huts clustered along the river no women or children were visible their guards had lowered their spears and unstrung their arrows and were using the presence of their bodies to keep the trouts from trying anything foolish paul said look at that water wheel we have them like that in new england water had been diverted from the river and was flowing through wooden chutes to turn a wheel they didnt get the chance for a closer look their guards directed them toward a structure at the center of the settlement it was four times bigger than any of the surrounding huts and the walls were made of puttycolored clay rather than saplings they stopped in front of a portal that looked like a large gaping mouth hung over the entrance was the bladed fan from a jet engine the indians closed ranks behind them put their weapons aside and kneeled with their noses touching the earth now what gamay said with astonishment at the sudden submissiveness of the fierce indians i wouldnt advise running for it we wouldnt get ten feet before they nailed us my guess is they want us to go in after you madame well go in together they walked handinhand through the doorway into the dim interior they passed through two smaller rooms then into a large space at the far end of the hut visible in a shaft of light coming through a hole cut in the roof was a seated figure the figure raised its arm and beckoned for them to approach they moved ahead slowly the floor was made of wood not dirt like the huts they had been in before the figure sat on a throne made of what looked like an airplane seat with the exception of two tanned and shapely legs most of the body was hidden behind a blueandwhite oval mask that could have come out of a nightmare it was painted with huge eyes and a wide mouth with sharppointed sharks teeth the trouts stood nervously in front of the bizarre figure not knowing what to do then two hands came from behind the mask and lifted it off whew this thing is hot the beautiful woman behind the ugly mask said in english she set the mask aside cocked her head at paul then at gamay the drs trout i presume gamay was the first to speak through their astonishment how do you know our names we white goddesses see all and know all she laughed when she saw the puzzlement deepen even more im a poor host teasing my guests she smiled and clapped her hands lightly the trouts were in for another surprise the beaded curtains behind the throne parted with a rustle and dieters wife tessa stepped out chapter the law office of francis xavier hanley was on the twelfth floor of a blue glass tower that looked out onto san diego harbor austin and zavala stepped from the elevator into the office lobby and gave the attractive young receptionist their names she punched a button on her inter com and after a murmured conversation smiled brightly and told them to go right in a ruddyfaced man with the body of a night club bouncer gone to flab greeted them at the door he introduced himself as hanley and ushered them to a pair of empirestyle chairs settling his bulk behind a large mahogany desk he leaned back in his plush swivel chair tented his fingertips and contemplated the two men like a wolf drooling over a pair of staked goats after crossing back from tijuana austin had called hanleys office and asked for an appointment he spread his story on as thick as peanut butter saying he and his partner had made a few mil in the market and wanted a place to spend it they got an immediate meeting the predatory gleam in the lawyers pale green eyes suggested that the bait had done its job well he looked from one man to the other i believe in getting right down to business he purred you said on the phone that youre interested in foreign investment were primarily interested in mexico zavala explained the attorney wore an expensive sharkskin gray suit and had enough gold and diamonds on his fleshy hands to sink the titanic all the tailors in the world couldnt hide the brawlers body and no amount of jewelry could have obscured the coarse ness ingrained in his every word and move the numa men were dressed in jeans tshirts and windbreakers it was a studied casualness in california the only ones who look like millionaires are those who arent hanley took in zavalas latin american looks youve come to the right place he said expansively he smiled in an attempt to exert charm but the vshaped mouth in the fleshy face made him look like a fat vulture did you have a specific area in mind we like tortillas austin said with a straight face a look of incomprehension appeared on hanleys florid features pardon me he said not certain he had heard correctly you know tortillas austin said making a circular motion with his finger we hear its a fastgrowing business recovering nicely hanley replied and so it is a booming sector in the expanding food services area austin had the feeling that the answer would have been the same had they told hanley they were interested in making mud pies he and zavala had decided to use the direct approach that had worked so well in drawing a strong reaction from pedralez zavala smiled and said weve been hearing about a tortilla plant in baja california outside ensenada that might be for sale real cheap hanleys watery eyes narrowed under the prominent brow ridge whered you hear that he growled around the corners of zavalas lips turned up in a mysterious smile sorry gentlemen im not familiar with any baja tortilla plant zavala turned to austin he says hes not familiar with that one austin shrugged were surprised at your answer enrico pedralez says youre very familiar with the property he gave us your name and said you arranged the deal for him hanleys defenses went on full alert at the mention of the mexican mob boss he was uncertain how accountable he had to be to these two strangers he fastforwarded through the categories of likely threats police irs state bureaucrats these men didnt fit into any pigeonhole he decided to take the offensive may i see some identification from you gentlemen that wont be necessary austin said in that case if youre not out of my office in two seconds ill throw you out myself austin made no move to rise you could try he said with an icy coldness but i wouldnt recommend it i wouldnt bother calling in your mexican pals either seeing that intimidation wasnt going to work the lawyer reached for the phone im calling the police why dont you call the bar association while youre at it austin said im sure theyd like to hear how one of their members set up a deal with a notorious mexican mafioso that framed license on your wall wont be worth the paper its printed on the hand retreated and hanley stared across the desk who are you gentlemen he practically spat out the last word a couple of people who want to know more about that plant in the baja austin said hanley was having a hard time trying to figure out this pair with their athletic builds and sunburnished faces they looked like a couple of beach bums but he detected a hard edge under their genial image even if you had credible authority i couldnt help you he said all discussions on that matter are covered by lawyerclient privilege thats true austin said agreeably it is also true that you could go to jail for making a dirty deal with a known criminal hanleys mouth widened in an insincere smile okay you win he said ill tell you what i can but lets compromise tell me why you are interested in this property it would be the fair thing to do true austin said but this is an unfair world his coral green eyes bored into hanleys face ill put your mind at ease your slimy dealings are not our concern once you tell us who hired you for the baja job chances are youll never see us again hanley nodded and plucked a cigar from a humidor without offering his guests one he lit up and puffed smoke in their direction i was contacted about two years ago by a broker from sacramento he had heard about my ah connections south of the border and thought i would be the perfect gobetween for a highly lucrative deal with no risk and little work an offer you couldnt refuse of course but i was cautious everyone in california has a getrich scheme he knew about my ties to enrico so i had to make sure this guy wasnt working in an official capacity i had a private detective check him out he was legit austin smiled faintly at the irony of a crooked lawyer worrying about honesty what did he hire you to do the people he represented wanted to find land in the baja it had to be remote and on the coast then he wanted me to handle the paperwork and red tape involved in starting a business in mexico baja tortillas yes he wanted a mexican to hold the actual ownership for the plant he said it would be easier that way it would be a turnkey operation he supplied the plant specifications and brought in a construction crew his clients would require access to the plant after it was built but they would not interfere in the operation they said enrico could keep half the profits and the plant would be his free and clear after five years did you ever wonder why anyone would be so generous with what must have been a considerable investment i am paid substantially because i dont ask questions like that seems your friends wanted a cover operation zavala said that certainly crossed my mind the japanese ran into all sorts of flak when they tried to build a saltproducing plant along the coast a bunch of whale huggers made a big stink with the mexican government i assumed the mans clients saw what had happened with the japanese and didnt want to go through the same headaches who was this broker his name was jones oh yes thats his real name hanley added when he saw the skeptical glances hes a matchmaker who specializes in buying and selling businesses who was he representing he never told me austin leaned forward onto hanleys desk dont jerk us around mr hanley youre a careful man you would have had your private detective poke into this guy hanley shrugged why deny it the clients tried to hide their identity behind a web of corporate paper you said tried who are they i only got as far as an outfit called the mulholland group its a closed corporation with ties to companies involved in largescale hydraulic projects what else thats all i know hanley checked his cartier wrist watch if youll excuse me i have an appointment with a real client we want the brokers address and phone number it wont do you any good he died a few weeks ago his car went off a mountain road austin had been gazing through the floortoceiling window behind hanley at a helicopter going back and forth across the harbor it was moving closer with each pass at the mention of unusual death he brought his full attention back to hanley wed like whatever information you have on him anyway and your whole file as well hanley frowned he thought he was through with this annoying pair i cant give you the original ill have it copied it might take a couple of hours that would be fine we be back for it in two hours hanleys frown deepened then he smiled again rose from his desk and showed them to the door back in the elevator austin said well call hiram yaeger hanleys bound to censor the stuff he gives us so we might want to conduct our own investigation into this mulholland group hiram yaeger was numas computer whiz the tenthfloor computer complex he called max was plugged into a vast data base of oceanic knowledge from every source in the world max routinely hacked into outside databases they stepped out of the building lobby into the southern california sun as zavala walked to the curb to hail a cab there was a loud whupwhup sound from directly overhead a green helicopter hovered over the street about a hundred feet from the glass face of the building like the other pedestrians they stared at the aircraft with curiosity then recognition flashed in austins mind he grabbed zavalas arm weve got to go back zavala glanced at the helicopter and bolted for the revolving door behind austin they dashed into an open elevator and punched the button for the lawyers floor halfway up there was a dull thud and the elevators sides rattled in the shaft austin hit the stop button for the floor below hanleys office they ran past startled office workers and raced up the stairway to the next level acrid black smoke filled the stairwell austin felt the door to the lawoffice floor unable to detect heat that would indicate a fierce blaze on the other side he opened the door a crack more smoke poured out they opened the door wide enough to pass through got down on their hands and knees and crawled through the choking fumes into the receptionists area the sprinkler system had been set off and they were drenched under a cooling spray the receptionist lay on the rug next to her desk what about hanley joe shouted smoke was billowing from the office door dont bother hes gone they dragged the receptionist to the stairwell and got her limp body down to the floor below she came around after a few minutes of mouthtomouth resuscitation soon firemen pounded onto the floor and they turned her over to an emt they walked down rather than take an elevator where they would be stuck if the power went off more firemen poured into the lobby the police had arrived and were evacuating the building they joined the crowd milling around outside but seeing there was nothing they could do they walked a couple of blocks and hailed a cab the driver a senegalese from the looks of his id card glanced at their sootcovered faces you in there man i just heard over the radio some kind of explosion zavala looked out the back window at the confusion outside the building where police were stopping traffic and setting up a fire line zavala wiped the soot from his cheek how did you know that was going to happen i didnt but i noticed the helicopter going back and forth across the harbor when we were talking to hanley i saw it too but didnt pay much attention i figured it was a traffic chopper i had the same reaction at first then we saw it up close and something clicked the same chopper or one very much like it did a flyby after the explosion at the tortilla plant i remember dark green it buzzed the cove then flew off zavala pondered the implication whoever owned that chopper wanted hanley dead in a bad way hanley ran with a pretty rough crowd you think it was enrico its possible he knew we would talk to hanley i was surprised he didnt call hanley to warn him we were coming ive been thinking about mr jones the guy who brokered the deal zavala said thoughtfully maybe his mouth was shut for him as well it would fit in with the enrico theory until something better comes along austin said something better did come along back at the hotel while austin went in to clean up and change zavala flipped to the tv news the camera showed shots of smoke belching from the office and fire trucks outside the fire department spokesman said a number of people were treated for smoke inhalation but there was apparently only one death the name would be released pending notice of next of kin cause of the explosion was un known the report ended and zavala was about to turn the tv off when a familiar face appeared on the screen kurt youve got to see this he called austin emerged in time to hear the blowdried announcer give his report this just in alleged mexican mafia drug figure enrico pe dralez was killed today when his car exploded in tijuana two men who may have been bodyguards also died in the explosion the announcer went on to read the mexicans lawbreaking laundry list looks like our green chopper people dont like loose ends austin observed the phone rang and zavala picked it up he listened for a moment muttered youre welcome and replaced the phone in its cradle that was fbi agent miguel gomez he said what did he want zavalas mouth puckered in a wry smile he just wanted to say thanks for making his job a little easier chapter brunhild sigurd ran her farflung empire from a turret office high above the sprawling viking edifice she called valhalla the windowless room was built in an exact circle the geometric form closest to perfection the walls were stark white and unadorned by paintings or wall hangings she sat in front of a flatscreen monitor and a telephone console of white plastic it was all she needed to be in instant touch with her operations around the world the temperature was kept at a cool thirtyeight degrees summer and winter the few who had been allowed into this aerie compared it to being in a walkin refrigerator but it suited her fine as a girl growing up on an isolated farm in minnesota she had come to love the cold and reveled in the purity to be found in subfreezing temperatures she would ski alone for hours under the stars ignoring the icy chill that stung her cheeks as she grew in height and strength she distanced herself even more from humanity the little people as she called them who saw her as a freak at school in europe her natural brilliance al lowed her to excel at her studies even when she seldom at tended class those times when she couldnt hide and had to suffer the stares of others only drove her ambition fueled her smoldering resentment and planted the seeds for her megalomania she was talking on the speaker phone thank you for your support of the colorado river legislation senator barnes your state stands to gain quite handsomely for your key vote especially when your brothers firm starts picking up contracts for the work we have planned i hope youve taken advantage of the suggestions ive made yes maam i have thank you ive had to avoid the conflictofinterest thing of course but my brother and i are quite close if you know what i mean i do senator have you talked to the president just got off the phone with his chief of staff the white house will veto any bill that seeks to overturn the privatization legislation we passed the president is a firm believer that the private sector can always do a better job than government whether its running prisons social security or pumping water what sort of backing does the kinkaid bill have only a scattering of votes nothing serious damned shame about kinkaid having that accident i always liked the man but without him around to whip up the troops an override is bound to fail excellent how are the other privatization bills faring theyll do just fine youll be seeing publicly run water facilities being privatized all over the country so there are no problems one maybe the biggest pain in the butt is the editor of the daily paper in my state capital hes raising a ruckus and im afraid he might bollix things up she asked the editors name and made a metal note of the senators answer her desktop was free of pen and paper she committed everything to memory by the way senator barnes was the contribution to your reelection campaign sufficient yes maam it was very generous considering im running unopposed having a big war chest discourages the opposition a red light was blinking on the phone console well speak again goodbye senator she pressed a button and a door opened in the wall of the room the kradzik brothers wearing their usual black leather stepped inside well she said the thin lips widened in identical metallic smiles we have fired mexican farmer and lawyer as you ordered no complications they shook their heads the authorities will spend little time on the farmers case she said the lawyer had many enemies now to other matters there have been some developments on the explosion at our mexican operation she touched the screen and two photos appeared one of the photos taken by a surveillance camera showed austin and zavala in the reception area of the tortilla plant the other picture was an enlarged shot of the two men standing on the deck of the sea robin off ensenada brynhilds eye went from the wideshouldered man with the silverwhite hair for a moment then shifted to the handsome darkhaired man do you know who these men are the brothers shrugged thats kurt austin head of numas special assignments team and jose zavala a member of the team when can we eliminate them the temperature in the cool room seemed to drop another twenty degrees if they were responsible for the destruction of the baja facility they will pay with their lives brynhild said but not now theres a minor problem to be taken care of she gave them the name of the newspaper editor and said thats all you can go the brothers hastened from the room like a pair of dogs sent to fetch a bone and brynhild was alone again she sat there brooding about the baja facility all that work wasted even worse the supply of the catalyst was destroyed in the blast she stared with hatefilled eyes at the faces of the two men on the computer monitor little people she snarled with a wave of her hand the screen went blank chapter paul trout turned the shower off and again examined its workings with scientific admiration water flowed through a wooden pipe and sprayed out through tiny holes in the hardened shell of a hollowedout gourd a simple wooden valve controlled the flow the water disappeared through a drain hole in the hardwood floor he stepped from the wooden stall dried himself with a cotton towel wrapped his body in another and went through a doorway into an adjacent room lit by clay lamps gamay was stretched out on a comfortable grassfilled mat tress placed on a platform bed she had fashioned her towel into a toga had combed and braided her dark red hair and was sampling fruit from a large bowl like a woman of ancient rome she eyed paul whose towel looked ridiculously small on his tall figure what do you think of all this nature boy ive seen worse plumbing back in the socalled civilized world did you know a civilization can be measured by the sophistication of its plumbing i cant say much for the uncivilized habit the locals have of sticking heads on sharpened poles but this whole village is a miracle look at the workmanship in these walls he said running his fingers over the white plastered surface ive got a mil lion questions any word from our hostess she sent tessa by and said she would see us after weve had a chance to rest talk about pulling a rabbit out a hat i thought the chulo grabbed dieters wife the goddess had offered no explanations after greeting the trouts by name and producing tessa she simply said please be patient ill explain everything in time at a clap of her hands two young indian women had emerged with heads lowered from behind the curtain the barebreasted ladiesinwaiting led the trouts to their bedroom demonstrated the workings of the shower and left them with a bowl of fruit i know better than to disobey a white goddess paul said sitting alongside his wife what do you make of her lets deal with the obvious gamay tallied her conclusions on her fingers she didnt grow up in these parts she speaks english with a slight accent shes smart shes friendly and certainly knows her fruit here try one of these little yellow ones it tastes like an orange sprinkled with cinnamon trout sampled the plumsized blob and agreed with the assessment then he stretched out on the bed his feet sticking out over the end they only intended to rest a little while but exhausted from the long trek in the sun and relaxed by the shower they fell asleep when they awoke they saw an indian ladyinwaiting sitting crosslegged on the floor watching them seeing them stir she slipped silently from the room lying on a table were their clothes which had disappeared when they were in the shower their shorts and shirts had been washed clean of sweat and grime and were neatly folded trout checked his watch they had slept three hours they dressed quickly hastened by the aroma of cooking food tessa arrived and beckoned for them to follow she led them along a passageway to a large chamber a dark wood table and three covered stools occupied the center of the room an indian woman was tending to clay pots bubbling on a ceramic stove whose exhaust was carried through the ceiling by pipes the white goddess arrived a moment later her barefoot presence announced by the soft jingle of her metal bracelets and anklets a pendant similar to that worn by the dead indian hung from her neck she was wearing a twopiece suit of jaguar skin which hugged the contours of her bronzed body nicely she had oriental eyes and high cheekbones her hair bleached to a honeyed blond by the sun was combed back and cut in bangs the way the native women wore theirs taking a seat at the table she said you look more rested the shower helped immensely gamay said thats a remarkable setup paul added as a native new englander i was intrigued by your yankee inventiveness it was one of my first projects thank you the water is pumped by windmill into a holding tank to maintain pressure it ties in with a ventilated system of pipes that runs through these walls and keeps this place cool even on the hottest days it was the best air conditioning i could come up with given the materials i had to work with anticipating their curiosity she said first well eat and then well talk the cook brought over a vegetable and meat stew served with salad greens in blueandwhite bowls questions were for gotten as gamay and paul plunged into their food washing their meal down with a refreshing faintly alcoholic beverage sugar sweetened cakes were served for dessert the goddess looked on amused at their hunger when the dishes were cleared the goddess declared now it is time to pay for your dinner she smiled you must tell me what has been going on in the outside world for the past ten years thats a cheap price for a meal like that paul said you may not think so when im through start with science if you will what advances great or small have come about in the last decade they took turns describing the advances in computers the widespread use of the internet and wireless communication the space shuttle missions the hubble telescope unmanned space probes discoveries by numa in the field of oceanography and advances in medicine she listened with fascination her chin resting on her folded hands occasionally she asked a probing question that indicated her own scientific background but mostly she absorbed the information with the dreamy look of an addict inhaling opium fumes now tell me about the political situation she requested again they pored through the events in their memory american presidential politics relations with russia the persian gulf wars the strife in the balkans droughts famines terrorism the european union she asked about brazil and seemed pleased when they said the country had become a democracy they talked about movies and plays music and art about the deaths of wellknown figures even paul and gamay were surprised at the incredible busyness of the past decade their jaws were get ting tired from the litany of events what about cancer have they found a cure unfortunately no what about fresh water is it still a problem for many countries worse than ever between development and pollution she shook her head sadly so much she said in a faraway voice ive missed so much i dont know if my parents are still alive i miss them my mother especially a tear gleamed in her eye and she wiped it away with her napkin i must apologize for being so demanding but you have no idea how awful it is to be isolated here in the forest with no communication to the out side world you have been very kind and patient now it is time for you to hear my story she called for tea to be served then dismissed the indian women so that there were only the three of them my name is francesca cabral she began for an hour the trouts listened raptly to the goddesss story starting with her family going through her education in brazil and america up to the time of the plane crash i was the only survivor of the crash she said the copilot was a scoundrel but he knew how to fly the jet skidded into muddy wetlands near the river the mud cushioned the landing and prevented fire when i woke up i found myself in a hut where the indians carried me i was in terrible pain from my cuts and bruises and my right leg was broken a compound fracture the worst kind as youve heard the rain forest medicines can be potent they set my leg and treated me with potions that dulled the suffering and promoted healing i learned later that the plane had landed on top of their chiefs house and killed him they held me no ill in fact it was just the opposite they made you their goddess gamay said you can see why the chulo retreated from the onslaught of the white man a long time ago theyve been completely cut off from the world then i come like a comet flaming from the sky gods are supposed to behave that way to keep people in line they figured the chief had angered the gods i became the center of their religion a cargo cult gamay offered paul said back during world war ii natives who saw planes overhead for the first time built replicas on the ground to worship yes gamay said remember that movie the gods must be crazy a coke bottle dropped from an airplane became an object of religious veneration and started all sorts of trouble precisely francesca said think of how those natives would react if they had an actual plane in their possession that explains the shrine with the plane at its center she nodded they hauled the pieces of the jet there and did a fairly good job of reassembling it sort of a chariot of the god we have to sacrifice an animal now and then so the gods wont wreak more destruction on the tribe the plane was blue and white gamay said the natives paint themselves with the same color scheme no coincidence they believe it will give them protection against their enemies how did tessa come to be here tessa is half chulo her mother was captured during a raid by a neighboring tribe and traded to a european who was tessas father he was killed during a tribal dispute and tessa became dieters property he knew of the chulo and married tessa when she was still a girl erroneously thinking it would give him entree to the tribe and its medicinal herbs which he trafficked in why did she stay with dieter she thought she had no choice dieter reminded her constantly that she was a halfbreed spoiled goods an outcast what about the indian whose body we found tessa wasnt the first child born to her mother she had a halfbrother who lived here he was determined to find his family and began to make explorations beyond the falls he learned that his mother had died but that he had a sister tessa he went to bring her back the chulo take family honor very seriously the plant pirates working with dieter captured him they wanted him to show them where to find blood root arnaud mentioned the plant its the miraculous species that was used to help me after the plane crash the tribe considers it to be sacred he refused to tell them where to find it so they tortured him he was shot trying to escape and you found him dieter stole the specimens i sent a search party to look for tessas brother she was trying to get back here when they ran into her and she told them the story i sent her back to dieters with instructions to keep us in formed about what was going on then you showed up unexpectedly tessa tried to warn you off when that didnt work she helped you escape or so she thought you reappeared on our doorstep were in one piece thats more than i can say for dieter and his friends the men of the tribe brought the heads back as gifts to me she glanced around the dining room which was hung with colorful tapestries of village life shrunken heads would clash with my decor so i suggested they put them outside the village were you also responsible for our welcoming committee oh yes you must admit that big orangeandblue balloon you were flying was not inconspicuous the men reported that you had almost flown into the falls i had ordered that if you were seen you would be observed but not harmed they were tracking you from the start i was surprised when you started this way you couldnt have been lost we thought we might borrow a canoe ah how audacious you wouldnt have stood a chance the reputation these people have is well deserved they tracked you for miles sometimes i think they truly are the ghost people they can melt through the forest like the mists the other indians say they are made of paul had been pondering francescas story why would someone want to hijack the plane and kidnap you i have an idea why come ill show you francesca rose from the table and led the way through torch lit hallways to a large bedroom she reached into a chest and pulled out a battered and scarred aluminum case she set it on top of her bed then opened it inside was a jumble of broken wires and circuits this was a model of the experiment i was carrying to cairo i wont go into the technical details but if you pour seawater in on this end the salt is extracted and fresh water comes out here a desalting process yes it was a revolutionary approach unlike any devised be fore it took me two years to perfect the problem with desalination has been its cost this process would transform hundreds of gallons for only pennies at the same time it produces heat which can be transformed into energy she shook her head it would have turned deserts into gardens and allowed people the benefits of power i still dont understand paul said why would someone want to prevent a boon like this from being made available to the world ive asked myself that question many times in the past ten years and still have no satisfactory answer was this your only model yes she said sadly i took everything with me from sao paulo all my papers were burned in the plane crash brightening she said i was able to put my hydraulic engineering skills to work here it can be boring just sitting around being adored all day im virtually a prisoner they hid me from search parties after the crash the only place where i am truly alone is this palace only those who are invited can enter my servants were handpicked for their loyalty outside the palace im watched by my praetorian guard being a white goddess isnt all its cracked up to be paul said an understatement which is why im so happy you dropped out of the sky tonight you rest tomorrow i will give you a tour of the village and we will start planning planning for what gamay said sorry i thought that was obvious planning to escape chapter austin had a quick breakfast of ham and scrambled eggs on the deck of his boathouse below the potomac palisades in fairfax virginia he stared longingly at the slowmoving river thinking that a brisk row in his scull would be far preferable to morning traffic on the beltway but the events of the last few days gnawed at him having narrowly missed being killed twice had injected a personal note into the case driving a turquoise numaissue jeep cherokee austin headed south and then east across the woodrow wilson memorial bridge into maryland where he left the beltway in suburban suitland he pulled off the road at a complex of metal buildings so boringly nondescript that they could only have been built by the federal government a docent in the visitor center took his name and made a call minutes later a trim middleaged man arrived carrying a clip board he wore paintsplattered jeans a denim work shirt and a baseball cap with the smithsonian national air and space museum logo he gave austin a firm handshake and introduced himself im fred miller we talked on the phone he said thanks for seeing me on such short notice no problem miller raised a quizzical brow are you the same kurt austin who found the christopher columbus tomb in guatemala thats me that must have been some adventure it had its moments ill bet i have to apologize aside from what i read in the papers of numas undersea exploits i dont know a lot about your agency maybe we can both learn something about our respective work i dont know much about the paul e garber preservation restoration and storage facility your web site says you restore historical and vintage airplanes thats only the tip of the iceberg miller said showing the way to the door cmon ill give you a tour he led austin outside and continued his narrative as they walked past a row of identical buildings all with low roofs and big sliding doors paul garber was a plane nut which was fortunate for us when he was just a kid he saw orville wright fly the worlds first military aircraft later he worked for the smithsonian and was instrumental in creating the national air museum the air force and navy had collected examples of the planes that won world war ii and some of the enemy planes they beat they wanted to get rid of them garber did an aerial survey and found twentyone acres owned by the federal government out here in the sticks there are thirtytwo buildings at the center they stopped in front of one of the larger structures this is building ten the workshop where we do the restorations i saw some of your work on the live web cam you might have spotted me i just came from there i worked for years as a project manager for boeing in seattle but im originally from virginia and when i had a chance to come to the center i jumped at it at any given time weve got several projects going weve been finishing up a hawker hurricane restoration its been a little delayed because of a parts problem were restoring the fuselage of the enola gay the b that carried the abomb over hiroshima theres a nifty little biplane called pitts special little stinker thats getting its fabric skin painted its not just planes weve had a russian airtosurface missile plane engines even the spaceship model they used in that movie close encounters we can stop in for a look on the way back id like that sounds like an eclectic collection oh it is weve got aircraft from all over the world that were getting ready for exhibition three buildings are devoted to exhibition restoration alone this is a highclass club the artifacts have to have a story behind them to qualify for a makeover something historical or technological or maybe theyre the last of their kind here this is what youre interested in they entered a building laid out like a warehouse high metal shelves ran from one end to the other stacked neatly on the shelves were hundreds of taped cardboard boxes of all sizes storage is our third most important function along with restoration and preservation miller explained weve got more than one hundred and fifty aircraft and tons of other artifacts spread throughout the complex this is mostly parts in here consulting a computer printout on a clipboard he walked down one of the aisles with austin trailing how do you find what youre looking for austin asked with bewilderment miller chuckled its not as bad as you might think every important part from every plane in the world has something stamped on it weve got complete records of serial numbers registration numbers or letter codes here this is what were looking for using a pocket knife he slit the sealing tape on a cardboard box after reaching inside he pulled out a metal cylinder about two feet long austin thought it was the part he had sent from california but it was too shiny and its surface was free of dents and nicks this is identical to the artifact you sent us he extracted austins cylinder from the box we matched the two objects through their serial numbers this first is from a plane that was decommissioned and taken apart which is why its in such good condition he handed the cylinder to austin who hefted it like the other it was lightweight aluminum and weighed only a few pounds what was this used for it was a water and airtight storage container this one is pristine because the plane never went into active service we examined the interior of yours but the seawater leaked in through the hole and contaminated the residue of what if anything was inside we can tell you what aircraft these things came from anything would be a help miller nodded youve heard of the northrop flying wings sure ive seen pictures of them they were the original deltawinged aircraft jack northrop was way ahead of his time take a look at the stealth bomber and fighter and youll know he was onto some thing what does the flying wing have to do with these cylinders they both come from flying wings whered you get this if you dont mind my asking it was found in the water off the coast of baja california hmmm that makes the mystery of our phantom plane even deeper phantom miller lay the cylinders sidebyside on the shelf our artifact comes from a plane that was junked after the war with the numbers on this thing we can trace its history right back to the assembly line he tapped the battered artifact with his finger the numerical designation on this part doesnt match up to any plane we have record of it came from a plane that didnt exist how could that be a mistake possible but not likely taking a long shot id say that the government ordered up a plane but maybe it didnt want any one to know about it could you be more specific about the type of plane miller carefully replaced both cylinders in the box and re taped it lets go for a walk building was crammed with aircraft bombs and plane parts they stopped in front of an oddshaped singlepassenger plane with a broad sweptback wing two propellers faced back ward from the trailing edge this is the nlm jack northrops first project he wanted to prove a flying wing could fly without all the dragproducing surfaces like engine housings and tail sections austin walked around the plane looks like an overgrown boomerang northrop called it the jeep he built it in basically as a flying mockup it had some real problems during the tests but it performed well enough for northrop to talk the air force into building the b bomber interesting but what does this have to do with the cylinder northrop used this model to talk general hap arnold into funding bigger wings right up to bomber size after the war they converted a couple of big propellerpowered b wings to jet power and called them the b series the plane broke every speed and distance record on the books it had eight jet engines that gave it a cruising speed of four hundred miles per hour at forty thousand feet even after one crashed during a test flight the air force ordered thirty with various airframes the pilots liked the plane they said it handled more like a fighter than a big bomber then in only months after making its big order the air force canceled the flying wing program in favor of b even though that was an inferior plane a sixengine wing survived and was broken up it was the plane our cylinder comes from yours came from another bomber the plane that doesnt exist miller nodded a lot of crazy stuff went on after germany surrendered the cold war was getting revved up people were seeing commies under their beds all sorts of secret stuff going on the government got even worse after the russians developed the bomb my guess is that they built your plane with a mission in mind and didnt tell anyone about it what kind of mission i dont know but id hazard a guess hazard for all its worth my friend miller laughed the northrop bomber was the original stealth plane radar was still comparatively primitive back then and it had a hard time picking up the slim silhouette in they took a wing out into the pacific and flew back to the main land at five hundred miles per hour on a direct line toward the coastal command radar at half moon bay south of san francisco the plane wasnt detected by radar until it was overhead a characteristic like that would come in handy if you wanted to get in and out of hostile territory thats my guess but i have no evidence to substantiate it what could have happened to the plane even with its low radar profile it could have been shot down more likely though it was scrapped like the others or crashed during a test or a mission they were still working out the bugs in the design neither possibility explains how a piece of the plane ended up in the sea off mexico miller shrugged maybe i can find something in the records austin suggested good luck remember what i said about crazy stuff happening after the war after the air force canceled its contract for the last batch of wings it went into the plant cut up all the planes being built and carted them away as scrap metal they refused the smithsonians request for a plane to put on exhibition and ordered all production jigs and dies destroyed all the official records on the flying wing were lost supposedly under direct orders from truman that was convenient austin stared at the flying wing as if the answers to the puzzle were locked in its aerodynamic fuselage but like the plane his thoughts refused to get off the ground well thanks for all your help he said finally it looks like a dead end wish i could have been of more help miller said ive got a suggestion its a long shot a widow of one of the test pilots lives not far from here she showed up one day looking for information about her husband he died while they were testing one of the big wings she was compiling a scrapbook to pass on to the kids and grandchildren we gave her some pictures and she was happy with that her husband could have said something to her maybe he didnt know about our missing plane but there are always rumors austin glanced at his watch he hadnt planned to be back at his numa office until after lunch thanks for the tip ill see if i can track her down they returned to the visitor center and looked up the womans name and address she had made a substantial donation to the center in her husbands name austin thanked miller and headed south beyond the suburbs that ring washington until the countryside began to look more rural the address was a big twostory gingerbread victorian on a back road a car was parked out front austin went up to the front door and rang the bell an athletically built man in his fifties answered the door kurt introduced himself im looking for mrs phyllis mar tin do i have the right house yes this is the martin house but im afraid youve come a little too late my mother passed away several weeks ago im very sorry to hear that austin said hope i havent bothered you not at all im her son buzz martin im taking care of some things around the house perhaps i can help you possibly im with numa the national underwater and marine agency im doing some historical research on flying wings and was hopeful your mother might like to talk about your father doesnt numa deal with the ocean sciences thats right but this might have a connection with numas work buzz martin gave austin a long look its no bother really id be happy to talk to you have a seat on the porch rocker ive been working in the cellar and could use some fresh air i just made a pot of ice coffee he went inside and returned a few minutes later with two tumblers that clinked with ice they sat in a couple of adirondack chairs martin looked out at the oak trees shading the big lawn i grew up here i havent been around much with the demands of job and family i run an air charter service out of baltimore he sipped his drink but enough about me what can i tell you about my father anything you can remember that might help clear up a mystery having to do with the flying wing he piloted martins face lit up like a streetlight he smacked his hands together aha i knew the coverup would unravel one day coverup thats right martin said bitterly this whole crummy deal with my father and the phony crash austin sensed that hed learn more by saying less tell me what you know he said the suggestion was hardly necessary martin had been waiting for years for a friendly ear to listen to his tale excuse me he said with a deep sigh this stuff has been building up for a long time he stood and paced the length of the porch his face was contorted by anguish he took several deep breaths to get his emotions in check then he sat on the railing arms folded and began to tell his story my father died in according to my mother he was testing one of the new flying wings there were bugs in the de sign and they were always tinkering with one thing or another on one flight the plane supposedly rolled he couldnt get it under control he died in the crash i was seven years old it must have been devastating for you i was pretty young he said with a shrug and the whole thing was exciting what with the air force brass and the president sending messages i never saw my father much anyway during the war he was away a lot he paused actually it really hit me when i discovered he wasnt dead youre saying your father wasnt killed in a crash he looked quite healthy when i saw him at arlington cemetery youre talking about seeing him in the coffin you mean no he was watching the funeral from a distance austin scrutinized martins face not sure what he was looking for detecting no sign of dementia he said id like to hear about it martin broke out into a broad grin ive been waiting more than forty years to hear somebody say those words he stared into space as if he could see the scene playing out on an invisible screen i still remember the little things it was in the spring and robins were flitting around i can recall the way the sun reflected off the buttons on the air force uniforms the smell of newcut grass and earth i was standing by the casket next to my mother holding her hand squirming in my suit because it was so hot and the collar was tight the minister was going on and on in this droning voice everyone had their eyes on him he took a deep breath as his memory drifted back in time i saw a movement a bird maybe and looked beyond the crowd a man had stepped away from a tree he was dressed in dark clothes he was too far away for me to see his face but there was no mistaking him my father had a funny way of standing on one leg kinda crooked old football injury what was he doing nothing he just stood there i knew he was staring at me then he raised his right arm a little as if he were about to wave two men came up beside him they talked it looked as if they were arguing then they all walked away i tried to get my mothers attention but she shushed me youre sure it wasnt the wishful thinking of a distraught boy yes i was so certain that after the funeral i told my mother what i had seen it only made her cry ill never forget those tears i never brought it up again she was young enough and re married my stepfather was a nice guy he was successful in business and they had a good life they were very happy for many years he laughed i was my fathers kid my mother tried to talk me out of flying but i became a pilot this thing has burned in me all that time i made inquiries but never got anywhere i was convinced the truth would never come out then you show up and start asking questions what do you know about your fathers job he was a veteran pilot he was hired by avion corporation the company northrop set up to manufacture flying wings although he was still in the air force dad had several close calls the wing design was a great concept but with the materials and the knowhow at the time flying the prototypes was risky business thats why nobody was surprised when his plane crashed you were very young but do you remember anything he said not much my mother told me he loved to fly those contraptions that he said they were going to revolutionize aviation he seemed quite excited about his assignments at one point he disappeared for a period of weeks no communication no con tact except in the direst emergency mom said that when he came home she said something about his sunburn he laughed and said it was more like snow burn but he never explained what he meant did he leave any papers a journal or diary nothing i know of i remember after he died that a bunch of air force people came to the house they might have taken whatever he had written does any of this help austin thought about his conversation with fred miller at garber particularly the mention of early stealth aircraft technology my guess is that your father was training for a secret mission in the north that was fifty years ago why still keep it secret secrets have a way of justifying themselves beyond the point of necessity miller looked out over the shady yard the worst thing is knowing that my father could have been alive all those years he turned back to austin maybe hes still alive hed be in his eighties its possible it also means that there might be someone out there who knows the real story id like the truth to come out mr austin can you help me ill do what i can they talked further before parting they exchanged phone numbers austin vowed he would call if he learned anything he started back for washington like any good detective he had knocked on doors and used up some shoe leather but this puzzle was too old too complex for ordinary methods it was time to see numas computer whiz hiram yaeger chapter the indian village was a marvel of city planning strolling along the network of hardpacked earthen paths that connected the thatched huts the trouts could almost forget that their entourage included a mysterious and beautiful white goddess in a jaguarskin bikini and a silent escort of six armed chulo indians painted the color of an executive jet francesca led the procession the warriors three on either side kept pace a respectable spears length away francesca stopped near the big well in the village center indian women were filling pots with water while gangs of naked children happily chased each other around their mothers legs francesca beamed with obvious pride every improvement you see here is part of an integrated scheme she said with a sweep of her hands i planned the project as if i were building a new infrastructure for sao paulo i worked for months before one spadeful of earth was turned putting everything in place right down to the allocation of capital sources of supply and labor i had to establish a subsidiary to manufacture the specialized tools that would be needed to produce wooden pipe valves and fittings at the same time it was necessary to keep the village functioning without interrupting hunting and harvesting remarkable gamay said looking around at the neatly ordered huts she couldnt help comparing the village with the squalor of dieters empire or the relatively civilized settlement where dr ramirez had his house absolutely remarkable gamay repeated thank you but once i had the preparations in place it wasnt as difficult as it looks the key was water flow its just as essential to life and living here as it is back in the socalled civilized world i assigned digging crews to divert the river we had the same problems as any project the shovel makers complained that we were pushing them too hard and that quality was suffering she laughed it was exhilarating we made a canal to open a tributary from the lake once we established the water supply it was a simple matter to divert it to the public wells the gristmill was basic timeproven technology the water wheel is as good as anything ive seen in the old industrial towns in new england paul said stopping in front of a hut no bigger than a onecar garage but i am really impressed with the plumbing in these public commodes back where i come from they used outhouses right into the twentieth century im particularly proud of the public water closets she said as they continued their tour when i finally admitted to myself that my desalination process would never see the light of day i turned my efforts to improving the life of these wretched savages they lived at a stone age level their hygiene was pitiful mothers routinely died in childbirth the infant mortality rate was incredible the adults were the targets of every parasite that grows in the rain forest their traditional medicinal plants were simply overwhelmed diet was of little nutrition producing a clean and reliable water flow not only protected the people from their usual ailments but it allowed them to grow the crops that would keep them healthy we were wondering whether your talents extended to surgery gamay said tessas brother had a peculiar scar on his body she clapped her hands like a delighted child oh the appendectomy he would have died if i hadnt acted my training was limited to first aid i had the chulo pharmacology to thank they dip their blowgun darts in the sap from a plant they use it to paralyze game but even a small amount can incapacitate a human i smeared it on a large leaf and placed it on the skin it functioned as a local anesthetic the stitches used to close the wound were made with fibers from another plant that seems to resist infection the knife had an obsidian point sharper than a scalpel nothing hightech im afraid i wish i could say the same for those weapons your guards are carrying paul said eyeing the steel tips of the short throwing spears their guards carried each man also carried a bow and a quiver of longshafted arrows those bows and spear tips were made with aluminum from the plane the shortened bow is easier to carry through the forest and the design makes the arrow fly farther if arnaud and his men were still alive they could vouch for their effectiveness paul said im truly sorry about those men but they brought their fate upon themselves the chulo are a comparatively small tribe and theyve always preferred flight to fight oh theyll shrink a head or eat an enemy but they rarely go out and catch someone in a raid they just want to be left alone the white man drove them further into the forest they thought they were safe once they went beyond the great falls but white exploiters continued to press them they would have been destroyed if i hadnt helped them improve their defenses ive been noticing the arrangement of the village gamay said the layout reminds me of the architecture ive seen in old walled cities very perceptive anyone who got past the stockade fence would be in a most uncomfortable position the village is full of culdesacs and blind alleys that offer prime opportunities for ambush what if the intruders were coming to rescue you paul said wouldnt these preparations be selfdefeating i gave up hope of rescue a long time ago my father would have made sure search parties scoured the forest he must have become convinced that i was dead which is just as well three men died in the plane crash and the tribal chief was killed be cause of me i wouldnt want to be responsible for additional deaths its ironic gamay mused the more you do for these people the less likely they are to release you true but they would have kept me captive even if i just sat around making goddess sounds and getting fat as long as i had to be here it would have been sinful not to use my talents to improve their lot when white men finally come i hope the chulo will use their knowledge rather than their arms to deal with civilizations impact unfortunately in the meantime i have little control of the tribes more murderous instincts once arnaud and his friends showed hostile intent they were doomed there was no way i could save them in your case it was easier you were so helpless in the forest they never saw you as a threat until now gamays ears perked up a threat try not to look alarmed francesca said a smile played on her lips but her eyes were deadly serious they dont under stand what were saying but they sense things she stopped to demonstrate a water pipe that served as a fire hydrant then resumed her casual walk theyre worried they think you are flawed gods if were so insignificant why are they concerned gamay theyre afraid youre here to take me back into the sky where i came from they told you that they dont have to i know these people intimately in addition tessas been picking up whisperings theyre talking about burning you the smoke from your bodies will take you back into the sky problem solved paul ventured a sidelong glance at the guards but he failed to detect any change in their stony expressions i cant argue with their logic but that solves the problem for them not for us he said i agree it makes it all the more urgent that we escape as soon as possible come with me well be able to talk about a plan without the palace guard peering over our shoulders they had arrived at the white stone walkway that led through the forest to the shrine with the trouts following francesca walked to the circular clearing with the plane at its center and sat down on a polished wooden bench facing the nose of the learjet the trouts sat crosslegged on the tiled ground i come here to be alone only the priests are allowed at the shrine otherwise the warriors will be in the forest watching our every move but well be able to talk about our escape plans gamay glanced toward the jungle where the warriors had melted out of sight i hope youve got something up your sleeve because we dont she said your original instincts were on the mark our only way out is by water up the tributary and canal t the lake then follow the main river we would never make it through the forest they would catch us in an instant or wed become lost ive seen your boys handle a canoe paul said wed need a substantial jump on them we would have a few hours but they are skilled and strong paddlers they would be getting their strength just as we were tiring what would they do if they caught us paul asked theoretically speaking no theory about it francesca said they would kill us even you their goddess she nodded leaving them would constitute a demotion in my status im afraid my head would be up there on the stockade fence along with yours paul involuntarily rubbed his neck all at once they were no longer alone an indian had stepped into the clearing followed by eight armed warriors he was taller than the other chulo by a few inches and unlike the flat facial features typical in the tribe his profile was almost roman his muscular body was painted red rather than blue and white he stepped over to francesca and spoke gesturing from time to time at the trouts francesca stood like a rearing cobra and cut him short with a daggersharp reply he glared at her then bowed his head slightly his companions followed suit they backed up several steps turned and quickly strode away from the shrine francesca watched them go her eyes blazing with heat this is not good she said who were those people gamay said the tall man is the son of the chief i killed in the plane crash i have named him alaric after the visigoth king hes quite intelligent and a natural leader but he tends to be a bully he would like to depose me and has gathered a group of young turks around him the fact that he set foot on the forbidden shrine shows that he has become bolder he is obviously exploiting the questions raised by your arrival we must get back to the palace as they left the shrine the guards materialized from the forest and took their places alongside francesca walked briskly and they were back at the compound within minutes something was different inside the stockade fence knots of indian men stood around they averted their eyes when the procession passed there were no friendly smiles as on the way out about twenty armed warriors were gathered in front of the palace with alaric at their center they parted with sullen looks at a wave of francescas hand but gamay noticed that they took their time doing it tessa greeted them inside the door her eyes were wide with fright she and francesca talked in their language for a minute then the white goddess translated for the trouts the priests have made a decision youre to be killed in the morning theyll spend the night getting their courage up and building the pyres to burn you gamays mouth hardened sorry we cant stay for the barbecue she said if you would point us to the nearest canoe well be saying goodbye impossible you wouldnt get ten feet now then what do we do francesca mounted her dais and sat on her throne her eyes glued to the chamber door we wait she said chapter the ancient ship hung in space as if suspended from invisible cables its multidecked hull outlined by shimmering spiderweb lines of gossamer blue the great square sails were bowed full and ghostly pennants fluttered at the masthead as if tossed by a freshened breeze hiram yaeger leaned back in his chair and studied the spectral image hovering over a platform in front of his horseshoe shaped console its beautiful max he said but the detail needs sharpening a soft and disembodied feminine voice filled the room from a dozen speakers set in the walls you only asked for a blue print hiram there was the hint of petulance in the tone thats right max yaeger said and youve gone far be yond that but now id like to see how close we can get to the finished product done said the voice the ships hull solidified like a specter materializing from ectoplasm its hull blazed with gold that highlighted the elaborate carvings covering the sides from stem to stern yaegers eyes lingered on the beak head crowned by a wooden image of king edgar the hoofs of his charger trampling the seven fallen monarchs whose shorn beards bordered his mantle then he studied the astronomical panels that represented the glories of the olympic gods going back to the high stern embellished with biblical figures every detail was perfect wow yaeger said you didnt tell me you had programmed the full picture all it needs now is a couple of dolphins instantly simulated seas appeared under the ship and at her bow a pair of dolphins leaped and splashed the threedimensional image spun slowly as the whistles and twitters of the dolphins filled the air yaeger clapped his hands and laughed like a child with de light max youre brilliant i should be the voice replied you created me not only had yaeger created the vast artificial intelligence system but he had programmed his own voice into the original program he didnt like talking to himself so he modified it into maxs female tones the computer system had developed a feminine personality all on its own flattery will get you everywhere yaeger said thank you if youre through ill take a break to allow my circuits to cool down holograms always exhaust me yaeger knew max was prone to exaggerate and that the ship represented only a tiny fraction of the capacity in her circuits but along with a feminine version of his own voice he had programmed in some human traits including the need to be appreciated he waved his hand the ship the roiling seas the leaping dolphins vanished in a blink of the eye yaeger turned to the sound of applause and saw austin standing there clapping his hands hi kurt he said with a grin have a seat quite a show austin said easing into a chair next to yaeger right down to the vanishing act i doubt even david copperfield could make a fullblown english capital ship disappear yaeger was truly a magician but his sleight of hand was per formed with computers rather than a top hat and wand he was an unlikelylooking magus dressed with a studied scruffiness in levis jeans and denim jacket over a plain white tshirt beatup cowboy boots adorned his feet yet he presided like a master sorcerer over the vast computer network that covered nearly the en tire tenth floor of the numa building the national underwater amp marine agency oceans center stored and processed the most enormous amount of digital data on oceanography and related sciences ever assembled under one roof that was nothing he said with boyish delight excitement danced in the gray eyes behind wirerimmed granny glasses perched on his narrow nose wait until you see the treat max and i have planned for you i can hardly wait that was sovereign of the seas right launched in at the orders of charles i one of the largest seagoing vessels constructed up to that time also one of the most topheavy as i recall she had her top deck cut down which was appropriate given that charles lost his head ill add the modifications later the new program will be available for the nautical archaeology department of any university that wants it max has been making a list of hundreds of old vessels we feed their plans architects renderings dimensions history everything we know about a vessel into the computers max pulls it all together into a holographic reconstruction shell even fill in missing details when information is incomplete max would you mind telling kurt what you found with the material he gave us the face of a lovely woman appeared on the huge monitor just beyond the platform her lips parted in a white smile id come off my coffee break any time for mr austin the voice said flirtatiously the air above the platform shimmered with blue light at the nexus of lasers scattered in the walls stud by stud beam by beam but with lightning speed the flashing lasers assembled a long open ship with a single square sail cmon yaeger got up and they walked onto the platform austins vision blurred for a second when it cleared they were standing on the deck of the vessel looking toward the gracefully upturned bow circular wooden shields adorned the sides this is the next evolution in the program not only will you be able to see the ships in our inventory youll be able to walk around on the decks the virtual perspective changes as you move the simplicity of design made this one fairly easy id say im standing on the deck of the gogstad ship correct built in norway between ad and the original ship was seventynine feet long and was constructed entirely of oak something a bit more substantial than light beams this is a halfscale model its beautiful austin said but what does it have to do with the material i gave you ill show you what i found they walked through the shimmering walls back to the con sole it wasnt hard getting some data on the mulholland group yaeger said as your dead lawyer friend told you the company is involved in hydraulic projects i had to dig around but i found that it was part of a larger corporation called gogstad the logo of the parent company is the ship you see be fore you the hologram disappeared and a stylized version of the ship appeared on the monitor tell me more i asked max to start playing around with gogstad i didnt get much on the company but apparently its a huge trans national corporation involved in all kinds of stuff finance engineering banking construction he handed austin a computer disk this is what i found nothing startling ill keep trying thanks hiram ill review it in the meantime ive got an other favor to ask of you and max he related his visit to the garber center and his interview with the pilots son id like to know if this plane was ever built and what happened to the i pilot max had been attentive again a photograph of a large wing shaped craft appeared on the screen this is a picture from the smithsonian files of the yba the last northrop flying wing bomber to take to the air the low voice purred i can give you a threed rendering like the ships this is fine for now the designation etched on the cylinder was ybb the photograph was replaced by a drawing this is the yb b max said whats the difference between this model and the one you just showed us max the designers ironed out the oscillation problem that bothered the bombardiers in addition it would have flown faster and farther than the earlier model it was never built austin knew better than to argue with max instead he watched the statistical and performance figures roll under the picture something in the data bothered him wait he said go back see there it says the cruising speed was five hundred and twentyfive miles per hour how would they have known the speed if they hadnt conducted field trials it may be an estimate yaeger ventured maybe but it doesnt say that its estimated youre right they would have to have conducted field trials back then because they didnt have smart machines like max to simulate flying conditions thank you for the compliment although it does state the obvious max said kurt has a point hiram while you were talking i checked and found that in every instance where a plane was designed but not actually built its speed was estimated except for this one yaeger knew better than to argue with max it seems that maybe this plane did exist but what happened to it this may be as far as we get for now austin said the northrop and air force records were lost what can max tell us about the pilot frank martin do you want the quick economy search or the fullblown probe max asked whats the difference the quick tour goes to the pentagons armed services registry which contains the name of everyone living or dead who served in the armed forces the full monte digs additional information from the pentagons classified files ill throw in the national security council the fbi and the cia just for hahas this is a mere technicality but isnt it illegal to hack into those databases hack is such an ugly word max said lets say im simply paying social calls on fellow computer systems so we can ex change gossip in that case do all the socializing you want to austin said interesting max said after a moment ive tried to open several doors but in every case harry has put a lock on them whos harry another computer yaeger said no silly harry truman austin scratched his head are you saying that all the files on this pilot were sealed by order of the president thats right aside from the most basic information about mr martin everything else is still classified there was an un characteristic pause thats peculiar max said i just got a trace it was as if someone opened a door that was locked heres your boy a picture of a young man in an air force uniform appeared he lives in upstate new york near coopers town hes still alive there seems to be some disagreement on that the pentagon says he died in a plane crash in this new information says just the opposite a mistake i wouldnt be surprised humans are fallible im not does he have a phone no but i have an address a printout came out of a slot on the console still puzzled austin looked at the name and address as if they were in vanishing ink he folded the paper and tucked it into his pocket thanks hiram and max youve been a great help he started for the door where you off to now yaeger said cooperstown this may be my one and only chance to get into the baseball hall of fame chapter across the potomac at the new cia headquarters building in langley virginia an analyst in the directorate of intelligence was wondering if his computer was having the hiccups the analyst an eastern european specialist named j barrett browning stood up and peered over the partition into the adjacent cubicle say jack do you have a second to look at something really weird the sallowfaced man at the cluttered desk put aside the russian newspaper he had been marking up and rubbed his deepset eyes sex crime and more sex i dont know what could be weirder than the russian press said john rowland a respected translator who had joined the cia after the agencys dark nixon days its like us supermarket tabloids on hormones i almost miss the tractor production statistics he rose from his work station and came around into brownings cubicle whats the problem young man this crazy message on my computer browning replied with a shake of his head i was scrolling some historical material on the soviet union and this popped up on the screen rowland leaned forward and read the words protocal activated for sanction with extreme preju dice rowland tugged his pepperandsalt goatee extreme prejudice nobody uses language like that anymore whats it mean its a euphemism goes way back to the cold war and vietnam its a polite way of referring to a hit huh dont they teach you anything at yale rowland said with a grin sanctioning someone is setting him up for assassination real james bond stuff oh i get it barrett said looking around the room at the other cubicles lets guess which of our esteemed colleagues is the practical joker rowland was in deep thought and didnt reply he slid into brownings chair and studied the underlined file number at the end of the message he highlighted the number and hit the enter key a series of digits appeared if this is a joke its a good one he muttered no one has used this encoding since allen dulles was agency director after world war ii rowland hit the print button and took the copy of the message to his cubicle with his puzzled colleague right behind him he made a quick phone call then fed the code into his computer and tapped the keys im sending this down to a pal in the decoding division its pretty antiquated stuff he can decipher it in a matter of minutes with the programs available today where do you suppose it came from browning said what were you reading when the message appeared archives material mostly diplomatic reports one of the senate staff guys needed it for his boss whos on the armed ser vices committee he was looking for patterns of soviet behavior probably so he could jack up the defense budget what was the context of these reports they were from field agents to the director it had to do with soviet nuclear development they were in the old files that clinton ordered declassified interesting that tells us that that the material was meant for eyes only at the highest level sounds plausible but whats this business with the protocol rowland sighed i dont know what the agency is going to do when old war horses like me get put out to pasture let me tell you how the protocols worked back in the old covert action days first a policy would be approved usually at the highest levels with the director nsa joint chiefs all signing on the president would be kept out of the loop officially for purposes of deniability the policy would generate a course of action in response to a given threat or threats that was the protocol the action was distilled into an order the order was broken down into a number of parts makes sense that way those who carried out the order only knew their small part of it you preserve secrecy aha i guess they did teach you something in the halls of eli even if its all wrong those nutty plans like whacking castro or irancontra were set up that way and they all fell apart so why have a protocol at all the prime reason is so the guys at the top can disallow responsibility a protocol was usually reserved for the most serious type of action in this case were talking about a political assassination it was not something taken lightly heads of state are not supposed to plot the demise of other heads of state or people in their own government it makes for bad precedent so the order would be multilevel it was designed not to leave finger prints no one gave orders that could be traced back a number of predetermined circumstances had to come about for the command to be followed through to its end it sounds like the failsafe system they used with the nuclear bombers there were several steps involved and the mission could be aborted up until the very last something like that let me give you another analogy a threat is perceived one hand takes out the gun the threat grows another hand loads the bullet the threat escalates a third hand cocks the hammer next the trigger is pulled and the threat is eliminated all those actionreaction steps would be necessary for the gun to fire browning nodded i understand what youre saying but i cant figure out how the bloody thing got onto my computer maybe thats not as mysterious as it seems most of row lands days were spent in the boring task of reading and analyzing newspapers and he relished the chance for intellectual exercise he leaned back in the chair and stared at the ceiling the protocol originally would have been recorded on paper probably broken down into parts it is never carried out then the agency goes from paper to computers the protocol becomes encoded in the agencys database it sits there for decades until all the triggering mechanisms are in place to activate it the director is supposed to be notified automatically only the files have been declassified and the computer doesnt know that a lowly analyst will be reading a file meant only for the director brilliant browning said now we have to figure out what could have set a fiftyyearold protocol in motion i was looking at these same files yesterday this was not there that means the protocol was activated in the last twenty four hours wait the email was blinking rowland retrieved the message dear rowland heres your message hohum please send something more challenging next time the words on the screen simply said sanction under way its a coded reply from the hit man rowland said browning shook his head i wonder who the poor bastard was i dont think we have to worry about the past its the future im concerned about hey cmon jack its been half a century since this protocol was approved everyone involved must be long dead hit man and victim alike maybe rowland said maybe not he tapped the words on the screen this reply has just been sent it means the hit man is still alive and so is his victim at least for now what do you mean rowland reached for the phone a grave expression carved into the usual cheery face the director didnt countermand the order so it goes to the next step the killing rowland held his hand up to cut off brownings question please put me through to the director he barked into the phone yes its urgent he said his voice rising in a rare display of emotion damned urgent chapter the blaze had been extinguished and the firefighters were mopping up when zavala re turned to hanleys office building zavala bluffed his way past the yellow police tape with officious flashes of his numa identification card he waved the laminated card with his picture close to the arson investigators nose then quickly tucked it back into his billfold he didnt want to explain why someone from a federal ocean science agency was at a san diego disaster scene the investigator whose name was connors said witnesses had told him about the hovering helicopter and described a strange flash of light before the explosion but he hadnt eliminated the possibility that the detonation was internal zavala couldnt blame him its not every day an armed helicopter at tacks an office building in san diego how is the injured woman zavala asked okay last i heard connors said a couple of guys dragged her out of her office before the fire got going zavala then thanked connors and walked to the next block to catch a taxi as he raised his hand to hail a cab a plain black ford sedan pulled up to the curb agent miguel gomez was be hind the wheel the fbi man leaned across the seat and opened the door zavala got in gomez gave zavala his worldweary look things sure have gotten busy since you and your partner arrived in town the agent said a few hours after you walk into my office the farmer and his sleaze ball lawyer go up in smoke why dont you stick around a few more days the whole mexican mafia and their pals will selfdestruct and ill be out of a job which will suit me fine zavala chuckled thanks again for watching our backs in tijuana in return for risking an international incident by bringing a sniper team across the border maybe youll tell me what in gods name is going on i wish i knew zavala said with a shrug whats the story on pedralez he was in his armored car going through colonia obrera a cutthroat neighborhood west of tijuana hes got bodyguards in suvs in front and behind the lead vehicle gets hit first a second later pedralezs car explodes it must have been slammed real hard because that thing was built like a tank the driver of the third vehicle does a quick uturn and gets the hell out an antitank missile would have done the job gomez affixed zavala with dark probing eyes the mexican police found the loader for a swedish gustav antitank missile in an alley the swedes are attacking mexican drug lords i wish the hardware is available on the world arms market theyre probably giving them away on the backs of cereal boxes you can fire the thing from the shoulder they tell me two guys can get off six rounds a minute what do you know about this thing with hanley kurt and i had just left the building when we saw a green helicopter hovering outside hanleys office we went back inside and heard the blast while we were in the elevator some wit nesses saw a flash of light it could have been from a missile launcher how many missiles does it take to wipe out a shyster sounds like a lawyer joke i dont see hanley laughing guy never did have a sense of humor talk about overkill someone really wanted him dead real bad to go through all that trouble he paused why did you go back into the building kurt thought the helicopter looked like one he had seen after the explosion in the baja so you already talked with hanley gomez might look sleepy but he didnt miss a trick zavala thought we asked him about the tortilla plant he said a sacramento business broker contacted him for a client who wanted to get a cover operation going in mexico hanley hooked his client up with pedralez what was the brokers name jones save your dime hes dead gomez smirked dont tell me his car blew up he drove off a cliff it was supposedly an accident a man in a dark blue suit came over and tapped on the car window the agent nodded and turned back to zavala they want me inside lets keep in touch he switched to spanish we mexicanamerican chili peppers have to stick together definitely zavala said opening the door to get out ill be heading back to washington call me at numa headquarters if i can be of help zavala had been truthful with gomez up to a point he purposely hadnt mentioned hanleys disclosure about the mulholland group he doubted the fbi would blast its way through the front door warrant in hand but he hadnt wanted to complicate his investigation on his return to the hotel he called los angeles directory assistance and tried the number he was given for the mulholland group the pleasantsounding receptionist who answered the phone gave him directions to the office he asked the hotel concierge to arrange a rental car and before long he was driving north to los angeles later that morning he pulled off the hollywood freeway into a typical california maze of closebuilt residential blocks interspersed with commercial plazas zavala wasnt sure what he expected but after the explosion in baja and the bizarre deaths of hanley and pedralez he was surprised to find a wellmarked office in a professional building sandwiched between a staples office supply store and a pizza hut the lobby was open and airy the cheery receptionist who greeted him was the same one who had given him directions on the phone he didnt have to exert his latin charm she readily answered questions about the company showered zavala with brochures and said to call if he ever needed hydraulic engineering services he went back out to his rental car and sat behind the wheel staring at the unassuming facade wondering what to do next his cell phone buzzed austin was calling from his office at numa headquarters any luck at your end kurt said im sitting outside the mulholland group as we speak zavala said he filled him in on his findings austin in turn told joe about his visit to the garber center his conversation with buzz martin and the revelations from max youve accomplished a hell of a lot more than i have zavala said all blind alleys so far im heading to upstate new york this afternoon to see if i can clear up the mystery of the flying wing pilot while youre in la maybe you can poke around on gogstad they agreed to compare notes back in washington the next day zavala hung up and called information for the los angeles times he got through to the newsroom where he gave his name and asked for randy cohen in the business section moments later a boyish voice came on the phone joe zavala what a nice surprise how are you im fine thanks hows the best investigative reporter west of the mississippi doing what i can with the limited brain cells left from our tequila sunrise days are you still keeping numa afloat as a matter of fact im in town on numa business and wondered if you could give me a hand always ready to do what i can for an old college pal i appreciate that randy i need some information on a californiabased company have you ever heard of the gogstad corporation the other end of the line went silent then cohen said you did say gogstad thats right joe spelled the name so there would be no mistake does it ring a bell call me back at this number cohen said and abruptly clicked off zavala did as he was told cohen answered sorry to cut you off were talking on my cell phone where are you zavala described his location cohen was familiar with the neighborhood and gave him directions to a nearby coffee bar zavala was sipping on his second espresso when cohen walked in the reporter saw zavala sitting at the counter and gave him a big grin he strode over and pumped his hand god you look great joe havent changed a bit neither have you zavala was telling the truth the re porter looked much the same as when they had worked together on their college newspaper cohen had put a few pounds on his lean frame and his black beard was tinged with flecks of gray but he still walked like a giant crane and the blue eyes blinking from behind hornrimmed glasses were as intense as ever cohen ordered a double latte and herded joe to a table re moved from the others he took a sip pronounced the coffee a ten then leaned forward and said in a low voice so tell me old friend whats numas interest in gogstad you probably heard about the pod of gray whales that was found dead off san diego cohen nodded weve tracked the possible cause of death to an operation on the baja peninsula there was a link to the mulholland group gogstad is the parent company cohens eyes narrowed what kind of operation dont laugh its a tortilla plant i dont laugh at anything having to do with this outfit then you know it intimately thats why i was stunned when you called ive been on an investigative team digging into gogstad for almost a year were going to call the story series the water pirates i thought piracy went out with captain kidd this is bigger than kidd could ever have imagined what turned you on to the story dumb luck we were looking into corporate mergers the quiet ones that dont always make the headlines but have just as much impact on the average citizen we started crisscrossing the same faint trail it was like a hunter coming across snowblown tracks in the woods again and again the tracks were gogstads cohen nodded it took us months to pin it down and we still only have a partial picture gogstad is enormous with holdings in the hundreds of billions it may be the biggest world wide conglomerate in history ill admit i dont read the wall street journal every day but im surprised i never heard of this outfit if its as big as you say dont feel bad theyve spent millions to keep their dealings a secret they use backroom deals straw and dummy corporations every trick in the book thank god for computers we fed the stuff through a geographic information system the gis connects the info in the database to points on a map the cops use the same system to keep tabs on gang connections weve got some great graphs that show gogstads holdings around the world whos behind this supercorp were pretty sure the reins of power are held by one person her name is brynhild sigurd zavala had a deserved reputation as a ladies man so his ears perked up at the mention of a woman tell me about ms sigurd there isnt much i can tell shes never made the fortune magazine list of most powerful women although she deserves to be at the top we do know she was born in the us of scandinavian parents that she went to school in europe and later started an engineering company called the mulholland group i was just there i should have asked to see the lady it wouldnt do you any good shes still listed as company president but nobody sees her im not clear on the company name the office isnt on mulholland drive cohen smiled indulgently have you ever heard of the owens valley scandal it had to do with the los angeles water system i believe thats right its hard to believe today but la was just a small desert town back in the s the city needed water to grow the nearest major source of fresh water was sleepy little owens valley two hundred miles to the north la quietly sent guys to the valley to buy out the water rights to the river by the time the valley people figured out what was going on it was too late to do anything their water was on its way to los angeles what happened to the owens valley drained dry he chuckled evilly most of the water the taxpayers paid for went to the san fernando valley not the city a bunch of local businessmen bought land cheap there prices skyrocketed when water came in and made the speculators mil lions the man who engineered the coup was william mulholland interesting how does the mulholland group fit in with gogstad mulholland was the seed company for gogstad now its a subsidiary that provides engineering services for the parent corporation what exactly does gogstad do at first they acquired interests in pipeline energy and construction companies since then they have branched out into financial institutions insurance media for the last several years theyve concentrated on one product blue gold im only familiar with the fourteenkarat stuff cohen lifted the tumbler in front of him blue gold is water yep cohen held the glass to the light like a fine wine then took a hearty gulp water is no longer a natural right its a commodity that can fetch a higher price than refined gas gogstad is the dominant player in the world water business it has the controlling interest in water companies in one hundred and fifty countries on six continents and distributes water to more than two hundred million people their biggest coup was engineering passage of the colorado river privatization bill ive read something about that fill me in the colorado river is the main source of water for the western and southwestern states the system has always been operated by the feds the people who brought you the big dams and reservoirs working with the states and cities the bill took control away from the government and placed it in the hands of private companies privatization is pretty common these days youve got private companies running prisons why not water systems exactly the argument advanced for the bill the states have been fighting over water rights for years tons of money have been spent on lawsuits the proponents said privatization would end this water would be distributed more efficiently the investors would shoulder the costs of big capital improvements what pushed it into the win column was the drought cities are running out of water and people are scared where does gogstad fit in the way it was set up the colorado river system would be run by a bunch of separate companies working together spreading the wealth that was the idea only problem is every one of these companies is secretly owned by gogstad so gogstad has control of the colorado river he nodded theyve been doing the same thing on a smaller scale all over the country theyve got contracts to extract glacier water in alaska theyve expanded their reach into canada which has the major sources of water in north america theyve nailed down control of most of british columbias water before long the great lakes will become gogstad reservoirs zavala let out a low whistle thats scary but it fits right in with globalization the concentration of economic power in fewer hands sure taking ownership of a countrys most precious re source is entirely legal whether we like it or not but gogstad doesnt play by the rules and thats even scarier what do you mean ill give you one example congressman jeremy kinkaid fought the colorado river bill tooth and nail and was threatening congressional hearings to rescind the legislation he died in an accident lots of people die in accidents the reporter extracted a map of the world from his pocket and unfolded it on the table speaking almost in a whisper he said see these red squares dont bother counting them there are dozens gogstad acquisitions in a manner of speaking as gogstad expanded it ran into established players the companies and municipalities that con trolled the water in other countries in many cases a rival resisted gogstads overtures he tapped the map we correlated the data on the acquisitions with information on company personnel every place where you see a red square the acquisition coincided with fatal accidents among the corporate hierarchy sometimes top executives simply disappeared either gogstad is using street gang methods or it is very lucky you figure it out in the past ten years it has assimilated transnational water companies in france italy britain and south america its like the borg that alien race in star trek that grows in power by absorbing other species into its collective its acquired water concessions in asia and south africa cohen stopped his breathless recitation his eyes darted to the door he relaxed when a woman and a child walked in zavala raised a brow but he said nothing sorry cohen said this whole thing has me as paranoid as hell a little paranoia can be a healthy thing my friend cohen dropped his voice to a whisper again we may have a mole in the news department thats why i had you call on my cell phone he fidgeted nervously with his spoon a lot of weird stuff has been happening at the paper what kind of stuff nothing i can put my finger on files out of the order you put them in strangers in the building odd glances are you sure its not your imagination others on the team have noticed the funny stuff too hell are my jitters that obvious youre even making me nervous good i want you to be nervous i dont think gogstad would think twice about getting rid of anyone standing in the way of its goal which is its clear to me that they want to control the worlds fresh water supply zavala pondered the pronouncement thats a tall order what theyve done in north america and europe is pretty impressive but can any one company corner the worlds fresh water its not as hard as you might think fresh water is less than one half of one percent of the worlds total water stock what remains is seawater or its locked up in ice caps or in the ground a lot of our water is too polluted to use and the world needs more of it every day but isnt most of that water still controlled by all sorts of people and governments no more gogstad locates a likely water source then offers to run it making all sorts of generous concessions once it has its foot in the door it uses bribery extortion or more to convert it to private ownership in the past five years gogstad has stepped up the pace of privatization tremendously its been helped by the fact that under the new international trade agreements a country no longer owns its water for godsakes joe this is owens valley all over again but its happening world wide your megacompany sounds like a very big octopus nice analogy even if it is a little cliche he took a red grease pencil from his pocket and drew lines and arrows on the map here are your tentacles water will flow from canada and alaska to china from scotland and austria it will go to africa and the mideast australia has contracts to export water to asia on the surface separate interests are involved but gogstad calls the shots through its shadow corporations how do they intend to move all that water a gogstad company has already developed the technology to transport millions of gallons across the oceans in huge sealed bags in addition gogstad shipyards have been building fifty thousandgrosston tankers that can serve double duty hauling oil and water thats got to be pretty expensive they say water flows uphill to money the customers will pay any price most of it wont quench the thirst of some poor bastard scratching a living in a dust bowl its for high tech one of the biggest polluters incidentally the whole thing is incredible hold on to your seat joe because thats only part of it he tapped the map of north america with his finger heres the big market the usa remember what i said about gogstad controlling the canadian water supply theres a plan to divert massive quantities of water from hudson bay through the great lakes to the us sun belt his finger moved to alaska california and the other desert states have sucked the colorado river practically dry so another scheme would take glacier water from the yukon and move it to the american west through a vast system of dams dikes and giant reservoirs a tenth of british columbia would be flooded and there would be massive natural resource and human disruptions the new hydroelectric plants would garner huge amounts of energy guess who is strategically placed to benefit from the energy and construction money i think i know the answer uhhuh theyll reap billions the plans for this boondoggle have been around for years theyve never advanced be cause theyre so destructive and expensive but they are getting some powerful support and theres a chance theyll go through gogstad again now youre getting it cohen said he was becoming more excited this time the opposition wont be there gogstad has bought up newspapers and tv stations it can create a drumbeat that wont be easy to resist the political clout gogstad can bring to bear is phenomenal theyve got expresidents prime ministers secretaries of state on their boards theres no way to fight it you put that kind of political and financial clout in the hands of someone willing to use street gang methods and youll know why im so damned nervous he stopped to catch his breath his face was flushed with excitement beads of sweat glistened on his forehead he stared at zavala as if daring him to argue with him then cohens whole body seemed to deflate sorry he apologized ive been close to this mess for too long i think im on the verge of a nervous breakdown this is the first chance ive had to get it out of my system zavala nodded the sooner the story is published the better how soon before you run it soon were putting the final pieces in place we want to know why gogstad has built so many supertankers that certainly fits in with their plans to ship bulk water yes we know they have the contracts in place to move glacier water from alaska but weve crunched the numbers there are far too many tankers for the existing market even if you add china it takes a while to build a ship maybe they want to be ready theyll mothball the ships until the time is ripe thats the strange thing these ships arent being moth balled each tanker has a captain and a crew theyre just sitting in alaskan waters as if theyre waiting waiting for what thats what we would like to know somethings going on zavala murmured my reporters nose for news says the same thing zavala got a cold feeling as if one of those slimy tentacles they talked about had tapped him on the shoulder he recalled the conversation he had had with austin about the unseen fears that sometimes come beneath the sea as usual kurts intuition was on the mark zavalas own instincts were telling him that a big hungry something lay hidden in the blue shadows watching and waiting and its name was gogstad chapter cia director erwin legrand beamed proudly as his fourteenyearold daughter katherine trotted over on the back of her chestnut gelding she slipped out of the saddle and presented her father with the trophy for first place english style this is for your office dad she said with excitement in her cornflowerblue eyes its for being the best father in the world youre the one who bought me val and paid for all those expensive riding lessons legrand took the trophy and put his arm around his daughters shoulders thinking how much she looked like her mother thank you katie but i wasnt the one who worked so hard to show valiant whos boss he smiled ill only take it on the condition that its on loan as soon as ive bragged to everyone at the agency its going back in your trophy case with the others legrands pride was mixed with guilt true he had sup ported his daughters love for riding financially but this was the first event he had attended in years the country club photographer came over and legrand posed with his daughter and her horse wishing as he did that his wife were still alive to make the picture complete katie led val back to the stable and legrand ambled across the field chatting with his assistant a plain but extremely intelligent woman named hester leonard legrand was sometimes likened in press reports to a beardless lincoln a comparison based on his reputation for honesty and his resemblance to the sixteenth president he was tall and homely but there was no mistaking the character etched into his large features he had earned a reputation for integrity in running the worlds largest intelligencegathering organization and in another age with no tv and sound bites he would have been considered seriously as a candidate for president leonards cell phone buzzed and she put it to her ear sir she said hesitantly call for you from langley legrand scowled muttering under his breath about no peace for the wicked he made no motion to take the phone didnt i ask that i not be disturbed for two hours while i was in mclean unless it was extremely urgent its john rowland and he says it is of utmost importance rowland well in that case he took the phone and stuck it in his ear hello john he said frown changing to a smile no apology needed youre just in time to hear the good news katie won first place in english riding at the country club thank you now whats so important that it interrupts possibly the most important moment of katies life legrands brow furrowed no ive never heard of it yes of course wait for me in my office he handed the phone to his aide looked at the trophy and shook his head tell the car to come around and pick me up immediately at the stable weve got to get back to langley immediately then put a call in to my office and tell them to render any assistance that john rowland asks for ive got to say my goodbyes and make amends hell this will probably cost me another horse he loped off to offer his apologies to his daughter twenty minutes later the black limo squealed to a halt in front of cia headquarters legrand got out striding through the lobby on his long legs an assistant met him inside the door he snatched the folder from his aides hand and scanned the material in the elevator moments later he stepped into his office john rowland was waiting with a nervous young man he introduced as a fellow analyst named browning rowland and the director shook hands like the old friends they were years before both were at the same level in the agency but legrand had political ambition and the drive to climb to the top of the ladder rowland was content to stay in his post where he was known as a mentor for the young analysts coming through the ranks legrand put unquestioning faith in rowland who on more than one occasion had saved his boss from stepping into a cow flap i just read the material you got off the database whats your take on it rowland lost no time outlining his analysis this thing cant be stopped legrand said the protocol has been activated the sanction will be carried out to the end damn heads are going to roll when im through whos the target rowland handed him a sheet of paper legrand read the name on it and the color drained from his face call the secret service tell them weve learned of an assassination plot against the speaker of the house he needs protection immediately dear god he said can anyone tell me how something like this happens were going to have to do some digging to get all the de tails rowland said we only know that the protocol was triggered by simultaneous queries to the intelligencegathering community that came from the national underwater amp marine agency numa the air over legrands head crackled blue as he gave an impressive demonstration of his renowned skill for inventive expletive he slammed his big hand down on the desk with enough force to topple the pen from its holder and yelled at the nearest assistant get james sandecker on the phone chapter were about twenty minutes from albany buzz martin said austin looked out the window of martins twoengine piper seneca the visibility was as unlimited as when they had left baltimore earlier that afternoon austin could practically read the names on the boats dotting the upper reaches of the hudson river thanks again for the lift my partner joe zavala usually chauffeurs me around on these junkets but hes still in california martin gave austin a thumbsup sign hell im the one who should be thanking you im sure you could have got up here on your own probably but my motives are not unselfish i need you to identify your father martin glanced off at the catskill mountains to the west i wonder if ill even recognize him after all these years its been a long time he could have changed a lot a cloud passed over his sunny features damn ever since you called and asked me to fly you up here ive been trying to figure out what im going to say to him i dont know whether to hug him or hit the old bastard you might shake his hand for starters taking a swing at your longlost father is no way to start a family reunion martin chuckled yeah youre right but i cant stop being angry with him i want him to tell me why he left my mother and me and why he stayed hidden all these years making us think he was dead good thing my mother is gone she was an oldfashioned girl and it would have killed her to think she had married while her first husband was still alive hell he said with a catch in his voice i just hope i dont start bawling he picked up the microphone and called the albany control tower for landing instructions within minutes they were on the ground the car rental counter had no lines and before long they were driving out of the city in a fourwheeldrive pathfinder austin headed southwest on route toward binghamton through rolling hills and small farms about an hour from albany he left the main highway and drove north to cooperstown an idyllic village whose neat main street looked like a set from a frank capra movie from cooperstown they headed west on a winding twolane country road this was james fenimore coopers leatherstocking country and with a little imagination austin could picture hawkeye skulking through the wooded valleys with his indian companions towns and houses grew even farther apart in this part of the world the cows outnumbered the people even with a map it was hard to find the place they were looking for austin stopped at a gas stationgeneral store and buzz went in for directions when he came out he was clearly excited the oldtimer in there says hes known bucky martin for years nice fella pretty much keeps to himself go up this road a half a mile and turn left the farm is about five miles from there the road became narrow and bumpy the tarmac almost an afterthought the farms alternated with thick patches of woods and they almost missed the turnoff the only marker was an aluminum mailbox with no name or number on it a dirt driveway past the mailbox into the woods they turned onto the driveway and passed through a copse of trees that shielded the house from the highway eventually the trees gave way to pastures where small herds of cows grazed finally at least a half a mile from the road they came upon the farmhouse the big twostory building was built in an era when three generations lived together to work a farm the decorative windows and stained glass indicated that the owner had been successful enough to afford extra touches a porch ran across the front behind the house was a red barn and silo next to the barn was a corral with two horses in it a fairly new pickup truck was parked in the yard austin swung into the circular driveway and parked in front of the house no one came out to greet them there was no curious face in the windows maybe you should let me go first austin suggested it might help if i do a little prep work before you meet faceto face thats fine buzz said im losing courage fast austin squeezed martins arm youll be fine he didnt know what he would have done in the mans place he doubted he would have been as calm ill check him out and break it to him gradually i appreciate that martin said austin left the car went up to the front door and knocked several times no one answered nor was there a response when he twisted the knob of the old doorbell he turned around and threw his hands apart so martin could see he descended the porch and walked behind the house to the barn the only sound was the soft clucking of chickens and the occasional grunt from a rooting pig the barn door was open he walked inside thinking that barns smelled the same the world over an unmistakable combination of manure hay and big animals a horse snorted as he walked by its stall maybe thinking he was bringing it sugar but there was no sign of martin he called out a hello and when there was no response walked out the back door the chickens under wild bill donovan i was what theyd call a hit man today i pulled a few assignments after the war then told them i wanted to retire the boss said there was no way they could let me do that i knew too much so we worked out a deal theyd keep me active for one more job the only problem was they didnt know when the order would be carried out it could be five months or five years he chuckled no one figured it would go on this long especially me austin noticed that martin had lost his folksy farm accent who were you supposed to kill the government had this big secret they didnt want any one to know about they devised a system so that if anyone started snooping and got too close the protocol would be activated heres the real clever thing they would make potential opposition come to me they set me up here in the middle of nowhere when you started poking around it triggered a series of commands one would tell you where i was the last would tell me to carry out the original sanction against the speaker of the house seems he heard about the governments secret and was going to blow the whistle this protocol youre talking about must be fifty years old the congressman you were supposed to kill has been dead for years that doesnt matter he said with a shake of his head im still under orders sad thing that secrets so old it probably doesnt make a difference one way or the other he lapsed back into his farm accent and the blue eyes grew hard and cold sure glad you came son im officially retired after this the gun came up austin braced himself for the deafening blast he tensed his stomach muscles as if by sheer will he could prevent the slug from tearing into his rib cage had he time o think about it he would have ruminated on the irony after surviving countless nearfatal assignments of dying at the hands of a halfdeaf nearblind octogenarian assassin a figure suddenly materialized behind martin it was buzz the old mans sight was still keen enough for him to detect an involuntary change in austins expression he whirled around as buzz cried out in surprise youre not my father the old mans body had shielded the shotgun but now buzzs eyes dropped from martins face to the weapon in his arms the farmer brought his gun up to his shoulder but his reflexes were dulled by the years austin had to make a split second decision he could put his head down and crash into the mans backside like an enraged bull not enough time he decided martin he yelled at the same time yanking the pitchfork from the bale the farmer turned back to austin who whipped the pitchfork at him like a javelin he was aiming for martins shooting side but the old man stepped into the oncoming pitchfork and the tines perforated his heart and lungs he cried out in pain and the shotgun went off barrel pointed toward the roof the horse went crazy and tried to kick down its stall the gun fell from martins fingers his eyes rolled into his head and he crumpled to the wooden floor austin kicked the shotgun out of reach more out of habit than necessity buzz had been frozen with shock but now he came over and knelt by the body austin turned it over so they could see the face buzz studied the mans features for a moment and to austins relief softly said no hes definitely not my father hes too tall to begin with my father was stocky like me and the face is all wrong who in gods name is he he called himself martin but thats not his real name i dont know what it is why was he trying to kill youi mean both of us he didnt really know he was like one of those trick bombs the germans used to drop theyd go off when the bomb squad tried to defuse them by the way i thought you were going to wait in the car i tried but i had to get out and walk i went behind the house didnt see anybody so i came into the barn looking for you im glad you did austin cocked his ear i think i hear something he took a last look at the body happy retirement bucky he said and walked toward the door buzz followed him out into the yard as a blackandwhite car with blue roof dome flashing burst from the woods and squealed to a stop in a cloud of dust printed in big letters on the car door was the word sheriff two men in blue uniforms got out one was burly and young and the other was slim and grayhaired the younger man came over with his hand on his holster his badge signified he was a deputy sheriff which one of you is austin he said thats me kurt said the deputy must have been prepared for an evasion because he didnt seem to know what to say next the older man gently pushed his deputy aside im sheriff hastings either one of you seen bucky martin hes in the barn austin said the deputy hustled into the barn and when he came out a moment later his face was white jeezus he said fumbling for his sidearm old bucky is dead stuck with a pitchfork which one of you two did it hastings gestured for his deputy to calm down and call the county homicide team could you tell me whats been going on mr austin martin tried to kill us with that shotgun next to the body t had to kill him i was trying to slow him down but thats not the way it worked out thanks but i mean whats realy going on with this whole thing me getting calls from washington and all washington you bet first the governors office calls and tells me to hold then they patch through this maniac admiral sandecker he says his man austin is in danger and id better get out to martins place or there will be a killing when i asked what makes him think somebodys going to be killed he promises to rip me a new belly button if i dont stop asking dumb questions and get on my way he grinned guess he was right he turned to buzz whats your name buzz martin the sheriff blinked in surprise any relation to the de ceased austin and martin looked at each other not sure how to answer the question finally austin shook his head and said hope youve got time sheriff because thats a long long story chapter the drums had been beating steadily for an hour the sound was cadenced at first coming from a lone drum at the same throbbing tempo as a human heartbeat then other drums had joined in the hollow thumping accelerated in pace and a monotonous chanting could be heard in the background francesca paced back and forth in the throne room like a caged lion her hands clasped behind her head bent low in thought the trouts sat next to the throne waiting patiently for francesca to speak tessa had pulled her vanishing act again something caused a commotion at the entrance seconds later francescas two handmaidens rushed into the throne room threw themselves on their knees and babbled excitedly calming the young indians with her soft voice francesca gently lifted them to their feet and brushed their disheveled hair away from their faces she listened to the women speak in turn then took two bracelets made of airplane parts and slipped them onto their wrists she kissed her attendants on the tops of their heads and sent them on their way turning to the trouts francesca said events are moving faster than i anticipated the women say alaric has talked the tribe into moving against us gamay frowned i thought they wouldnt enter your palace ive always said alaric was intelligent he sent my servants to tell me his plans evidently to exert psychological pressure the drums are his work she pointed to the ceiling the palace walls are clay but the roof is made of dry grass they will light the place on fire he says the true gods will rise from the ashes if we run outside to escape the flames it will prove that were the frauds he says we are and they will cut us down would they really harm their queen gamay asked it wouldnt be the first time royalty has fallen fatally out of favor have you forgotten mary queen of scots or anne boleyn i get your point gamay said what do we do now we escape are you ready since all we have are the clothes on our backs were ready when you are paul said but how are we going to get past that unruly crowd out there i still have a few white goddess tricks up my sleeve ah good tessa is back the indian woman had materialized as silently as a shadow she spoke a few words in her native language to francesca who answered with a nod tessa took one of the torches flanking the throne francesca said dr paul if you would be so kind as to help tessa trout went over and hoisted tessa up by the waist she was as light as a feather tessa tucked the torch in at an angle where the clay met the thatch the torch had only to burn a few inches before the flame touched the ceiling they repeated the procedure with another torch on the opposite wall i dont count arson among my talents but this crude time delay will create a distraction when we need it francesca said she looked around the throne room goodbye she said sadly to no one in particular in some ways ill miss being a queen she turned to tessa and they talked heatedly when the discussion was ended tessa had a satisfied look on her face francesca sighed heavily you see whats happening my subjects are al ready rebelling i ordered tessa to stay but she wants to go with us we dont have time to argue further follow me francesca led the way along the dim passageways to her bed room the two woven bags on the bed explained tessas temporary absence she had been packing for their escape francesca removed her battered aluminum suitcase from the wooden chest it had been rigged with a strap which she threw over her shoulder handing one bag to paul and the other to gamay francesca said that the containers held food and supplies and a few essentials gamay looked around the windowless room where do we go from here the sound of drums was muffled but the beating was more frenetic we take a shower of course francesca said she lit a small clay lamp from the torch went over to the shower stall and pulled up the polished wooden floor to reveal a rectangular opening theres a ladder its very steep be careful she descended first so the others could climb down by lamp light they were crowded together in a small space standing on the gravel drain that had been used to catch water from the shower a passage led off into the darkness my apologies to you dr paul i wasnt expecting someone as tall weve been digging this tunnel for years carrying the dirt out in small amounts and secretly disposing of it this passage way runs into a covered trench i had the men build years ago for future waterworks with paul stooping low to keep from bumping his head they half walked half crawled along the passageway the floor and walls had been smoothed and evenly spaced beams supported the ceiling francesca extinguished the light because of the smoke in the tight confines and they traveled in darkness after about fifty feet the tunnel angled into another slightly bigger passageway this is the water works francesca said in hushed tones we must be silent the tunnel is only a couple of feet below ground and the chulo have sharp ears using a primitive fire starter similar to the one carried by tessas halfbrother francesca got the lamp going again and they forged ahead they made slow progress but after about fifteen minutes the tunnel came to an end francesca motioned for paul to squeeze up beside her she pulled a small spade from her bag and chopped away at the blank dirt wall until the blade hit something with a thud ill need your strength again dr paul push against this hatch i dont think anyone is at the river but be cautious she backed off to give paul more room he put his shoulder against the wood braced himself and shoved gradually increasing the pressure until he felt the wood give he pushed harder the circular cover opened a few inches paul peered through the narrow space with one eye and saw water with a final shove he popped the hatch off the opening was in the side of a grassy embankment he slithered through the hole then helped the others climb out moving from the cool dark tunnel into the hot sunlight was a shock and they blinked their eyes like moles paul replaced the hatch while the others covered the opening he slid on his stomach to the top of the bank and peered over the edge the stockade fence and its grim decorations were a short distance away the tunnel had passed right under it a tall billowing plume of black smoke rose from beyond the fence what sounded like a flock of wild birds could be heard as he listened the bird cries became human voices he slid back down it looks like theyre having a weenie roast he announced with a grin turning to francesca he added dont ever tell me you dont have a talent for arson francesca responded by motioning for the others to follow her along the edge of the river they stayed low hidden by the embankment and after a few minutes came upon a dozen dugout canoes they hauled two dugouts aside trout thought of scuttling the others but their hulls were thick and not easily damaged anybody got a power saw he said even a hatchet would do francesca reached into her sack and came out with a covered pot using a flat stone from the riverbed she smeared the blackish yellow contents of the pot onto the other canoes she lit the substance on fire the wood flared into smoldering flames where she had daubed the unctuous mess greek fire she said its a combination of resin from local trees it will burn hotter than napalm if someone tries to put it out with water it only makes the fire spread the trouts looked on with wonder as the flames began to eat through the hulls they knew the sabotage would help but once the natives had discovered their scuttled craft they could race along the wellmaintained pathway that bordered the river they paired the stronger paddlers with weaker ones gamay and francesca got in one craft paul and tessa took the other they shoved off into the river and paddled for their lives after an hour they pulled over to the shore for a drink of water and five minutes of rest then set off again the paddles raised blisters on their palms as they pushed the canoes against the river current francesca passed around a medicinal ointment from her amazing bag and it numbed the pain in their hands they kept on trying to put as many miles between them and the village as possible before daylight failed darkness came all too soon travel on the river became difficult then impossible the canoes became tangled in thick grass or ran aground on sandbars they were quickly exhausting them selves and getting nowhere they gave up and paddled closer to shore where they dined on jerky and dried fruit they tried un successfully to sleep but the dugouts served poorly as beds and they were happy to see the gray light of morning with bleary eyes and stiff joints they set off again the sound of drums spurred them on and made them set aside their aches and pains the ominous drumming seemed to come from everywhere and echoed through the forest the canoes glided through the curtain of mist rising off the river the smokescreen hid them from chulo eyes but they had to move slowly to avoid obstacles as the sun rose it baked the mists off to a translucent haze with the river ahead once more visible they paddled furiously until the sound of drums faded they kept moving for another hour not daring to stop before long they began to hear a different sound gamay cocked her ear listen she said from a distance came a low roar as if a train were speeding through the forest francesca whose serious expression had not changed since they left the village ventured a slight smile the hand of god beckons with spirits renewed they forgot they were tired and hungry and that their buttocks were numb and dug their paddles in once more the roar grew louder but it didnt obliterate another sound a quick whirr as if a river bird had taken flight followed by a solid thunk paul looked down in disbelief a threefootlong arrow was embedded in the side of his canoe a few inches higher and it would have pierced his rib cage he looked toward the shore flashes of blueandwhitepainted bodies could be seen darting between the trees the ululating war cry filled the air were being attacked paul yelled unnecessarily spurred by the arrows chunking into the water around them gamay and francesca were bent low over their paddles the canoes shot forward out of range their pursuers had quickly caught up making good time following the path along the river at one point the trail turned in land to cut through the forest the natives had to fight their way through thick growth to get a clear shot at the canoes they made several attempts each time the canoes passed beyond the range of their arrows even the hightech weapons francesca helped forge had their limitations it was obvious that the catandmouse game soon would turn in favor of the hunters the paddlers were boneweary they were missing strokes and no longer paddled in a unified rhythm when it seemed they could go no farther they were out of the river and onto the lake they paused for a minute to reconnoiter and to firm up their plan they would cross the open expanse as quickly as possible aiming for the outlet to the main river the impenetrable forest growth along the river would protect them from chulo arrows heartened by the straightforward scheme they paddled with renewed vigor staying midway between the shore and the falls the thunder of thousands of tons of water plummeting from the five cascades was unimaginable the canoeists could barely see each other in the fine mist that was thrown up at the base of the falls paul vowed to tell gamay that he had changed his mind about building a hotel there they came out of the mist cloud into the open lake four pairs of eyes scanned the dense forest looking for the outlet gamay who was in the lead canoe pointed with her paddle toward the shore i see it over there where the tree line is bro ken oh hell they all saw the source of gamays agitation the flicker of blue and white as three canoes had come out of the river its a hunting party francesca said squinting against the suns reflection theyve been away and wont know were escaping im still their queen as far as they know ill try to bluff my way head right at them gamay and paul put their misgivings aside and kept the dugouts pointed toward the newcomers the men in the oncoming canoes showed no sign of hostility and a couple of them even waved there was shouting from shore alaric and his men had burst from the forest they were calling and beckoning to the hunting party the canoes hesitated then as the yelling grew louder they pointed the dugouts toward land the craft had barely touched shore when the hunters were ejected and the chase party took their place their prey had taken advantage of the slight pause and paddled madly for the river but their pursuers quickly cut down the angle we cant make it to the river gamay yelled theyll cut us off maybe we can lose them in the mists paul replied gamay spun the dugout around and pointed the bow toward the falls paul and tessa were right behind the water became choppy as they neared the falls the indians doggedly kept in pursuit with their strength and skill they were rapidly closing the gap the falls loomed closer and the mists enveloped them but it became apparent that they would be pounded to pieces by the falls if they got closer to the torrents paul shouted over the roar francesca we need help from your bag of tricks francesca shook her head tessa picked up on pauls frantic plea i have something she said she handed over the sack that had rested between her knees paul reached into the bag and his fingers closed on a hard object he pulled out a mm pistol where did this come from he said with astonishment it was dieters paul looked back at the oncoming canoes then at the cascading falls he had little choice regardless of francescas wishes that her former subjects not be hurt they were between the devil and the deep blue sea arrows were flying in their direction paul plunged his hand into the bag again looking for extra rounds this time he came out with a globalstar satellite phone dieter must have used it to keep in touch with his buyers he stared at it a moment before the significance of the find sank in he yelled with joy gamay had moved closer and saw the phone does that thing work he pushed the ready light and the phone was on ill be damned paul handed gamay the phone give it a try ill see if i can scare those guys off gamay punched a number out on the phone seconds later a familiar deep voice answered kurt gamay yelled into the phone its me gamay weve been worried about you are you and paul okay she glanced at the oncoming canoes and swallowed hard were in a hell of a mess and thats an understatement she had to shout over the roar of the falls cant talk im calling on a globalstar can you get a fix on our position crack paul had laid a shot across the bow of alarics canoe but it failed to slow him down was that a gun that was paul shooting hard to hear you with that background noise hold on the seconds ticked by like years gamay had no illusions about her call even with a position fix it could be days before someone came to their aid at least austin would know what happened to them austins voice came back on calm and reassuring weve got a lock on you good gotta go gamay answered ducking low as an arrow whizzed past like an angry bee with gamay and paul busy their canoes had drifted side ways to the waves they dug their paddles in and got the boats around both dugouts rocked dangerously but they moved closer to the falls where the mists might hide them the indians hesitated then sensing the end was near began their strange ululation the archers were kneeling in the bow they could stand off and let arrows fly at their helpless targets paul had lost all patience he raised the handgun and took a bead on alaric if he killed the leader the others might run for it francesca yelled he thought she was trying to spoil his shot but the white queen was pointing toward the top of the falls what looked like a huge insect flew over the crest of the falls and descended rapidly through the rainbows and the cloud of mist until it was a hundred feet above the lake the helicopter hovered for an instant then swooped low and buzzed the war canoes the archers dropped their bows grabbed their paddles and stroked madly for shore paul lowered the pistol and grinned at gamay they began to paddle back toward the quieter waters of the lake the helicopter circled around the lake then came back and hovered above the dugouts a smiling figure with a bushy silver mustache and deepset eyes leaned out a side door and waved it was dr ramirez the phone rang it was austin gamay are you and paul all right were fine she said laughing with relief thanks for sending the taxi but youre going to explain how you pulled this one off this is something even for the great kurt austin tell you about it later see you tomorrow i need you back here be ready to work a ladder was being lowered out of the chopper ramirez signaled for francesca to go first she hesitated then grabbed the lower rung and as befitting a white goddess began to climb into the sky from which she had descended ten years before chapter sandy wheeler was getting into her honda civic when the strange man approached and asked in accented english how to get to the los angeles times advertising department instinctively she hugged her purse close to her body and glanced around she was relieved to see other people in the newspapers garage she had grown up in la and was used to freaks but she was jumpy lately handling this crazy water story and even the cute pearlhandled caliber pistol in her pocketbook wasnt totally reassuring the stranger looked as if he could chew the barrel off her gun with his metal teeth wheeler had the reporters ability to take in people at a glance and what she saw was someone who looked as if he played the bad guy for the wwf he was her height and would have been taller if he had a neck the dark green sweatsuit was a couple of sizes too small for a square powerful body that looked as if it had been assembled from refrigerator parts the roundish grinning face framed by the prussiancut dirty blond hair re minded her of one of the monsters in maurice sendaks where the wild things are only uglier but it was the eyes that got her the irises were so black that the pupils were practically invisible after giving the man hurried directions sandy got into her car and instantly locked the doors she didnt care how unfriendly the gesture looked as she backed out of her space he seemed to be in no rush to go to the advertising department he stood there staring at her with eyes as hard as marbles she was in her thirties with long chestnut hair an athletic body from jogging and working out her nutbrown face was taut and angular but not unattractive dominated by large skyblue eyes she was pretty enough to attract occasional attention from the odd characters who seemed to drop from the palm trees around town she was streetsmart and had gained a layer of emotional calluses working as a police reporter before being assigned to the investigative team she didnt spook easily but this creep gave her the shivers it went beyond appearances there was some thing of the grave about him she checked her rearview mirror and was surprised to see that the man had disappeared easy come easy go she thought she scolded herself for letting him sneak up on her growing up in la she had learned early on to be aware of her surroundings at all times this damned water story had preoccupied her taken the edge off her alertness cohen had promised only a couple more days before they ran the story not soon enough she was getting sick of taking the file disks home cohen was positively paranoid about leaving them in the building every night he cleaned the files off the computer and put them on backup disks in the mornings he would load them back on not that sandy blamed him for being paranoid there was something special about this story the team had talked pulitzer prize cohen coordinated the work of the three reporters her area was the mulholland group and its mysterious president brynhild sigurd the other two reporters concentrated respectively on domestic acquisitions and international connections they had access to an accountant and a lawyer the secrecy was tighter than the manhattan project the editor was aware of the story but not its scope she sighed the story would be out in a few days and she could take that long vacation in maui she swung out of the garage and headed to her condo in culver city she stopped off at a shopping plaza and picked up a bottle of california zinfandel cohen was coming over later to talk about wrapping up loose ends and she had promised to whip up a pot of penne as she was paying the cashier she noticed someone standing in front of the window looking into the store it was that damned metaltooth creep and he was smiling this was no coincidence the jerk must have followed her she glared at him as she exited the store then strode purposefully to ward her car first she dug the pistol out of the purse and tucked it in her belt then she called cohen on her cell phone he had told her to report anything unusual cohen wasnt there but she left a message on his recorder saying she was on her way home and that she thought she was being followed starting the car she pulled slowly out of the plaza then gunned the engine and shot through an intersection just as the light changed to red the cars behind her all stopped she knew the neighborhood well and cut through a couple of motel parking lots then down a side street in a circular route to her apartment her heart was beating rapidly as she drove but her pulse slowed to normal when she pulled up in front of the sanctuary of the condominium building she buzzed herself into the five story apartment building and took the elevator up to the fourth floor she stepped out of the elevator and almost dropped her groceries in surprise the creep was at the far end of the hallway he stood there with that insane grin staring at her that did it she put the bag on the floor pulled her pistol from her belt and pointed it at him you come any nearer and ill blast your private parts off she said he made no motion if anything the grin got wider she wondered how he had got there ahead of her of course he must have known her address while she was zigzagging in an attempt to lose him he had simply driven directly to her apartment that didnt explain how he had got into the building the management was going to get an earful about the lack of security maybe shed even do a story on it still keeping the pistol leveled she fumbled in her purse for her keys opened the door and quickly shut it safe at last she put the pistol on a small table snapped the deadbolt and chain lock and put her eye to the peephole in the door the creep was standing just outside his face distorted even more grotesquely by the lens he was holding her bag of groceries as if he were a delivery boy the nerve of him she swore lustily she wasnt going to screw around with cohen this time a straight call to to report she was being stalked she suddenly had the odd feeling that she wasnt alone she turned from the door and stared with unbelieving eyes frozen with fear the man with the metallic teeth was standing in her way impossible he was out in the hall then the answer came to her in a flash twins the epiphany came too late as she backed against the door he began to walk slowly toward her his eyes glittering like black pearls cohen sounded frantic on the phone joe for godsakes ive been trying to reach you for an hour sorry i was out zavala apologized whats wrong sandys disappeared the bastards have got her calm down for a minute zavala said evenly tell me who sandy is and these bastards youre talking about start from the beginning okay okay cohen replied there was a pause as he pulled himself together and when he spoke again it was with his nor mal composure although it was clear from the tenseness of his voice that panic lurked close to the surface i went back to the paper i just had a funny feeling all our source material is missing we kept it in a locked file empty who had access just the members of the team theyre all solid the only way someone could get them to open the files is if they had a gun at their head oh god cohen said as the implication of his statement sank in zavala could sense that he was losing cohen tell me what happened next he said cohen took a deep breath and let it out okay sorry next i checked the computer disks nothing you needed a password to get into them everybody on the team was aware of it we backed everything up at the end of each working day we took turns sandy wheeler one of the reporters took the disks home with her today i got a message saying some guy was following her she was in a parking lot near her condo we were supposed to have dinner tonight go over some material for the first installment of the story i called when i heard her message there was no one home i came over sandy had given me a key the grocery bag was on the table the wine was still in it she always puts her wine into the rack shes compulsive about that theres no sign of her nothing i got the hell out of there as soon as i could a thought came to zavala what about the other reporters on your team i tried to call them no answer what should i do cohen probably saved his own life by going to sandys apartment and then leaving quickly those who were rolling up the investigative team had already been there but they might check back where are you calling from i hear music in the back ground im in a leather bar near sandys condo cohen nervously laughed through his fear i ducked in here when i thought someone was following me and wanted to be in a public place anyone follow you inside i dont think so this is pretty much a biker crowd theyd stand out can you call me back in five minutes joe asked yeah but make it fast theres a tall transvestite giving me the eye zavala looked up the number gomez had given him gomez answered the phone on the third try zavala brushed off the usual greetings im in la he said ive got someone who needs to be out of circulation can you help no questions now but i promise to fill you in as soon as i can does this happen to have anything to do with the business you were involved in down here that and more sorry to be so mysterious can you help pause then gomezs voice came back all business we maintain a safe house in inglewood theres a caretaker there ill call and let him know to expect a package he gave zavala directions to the safe house thanks talk to you later joe said i hope so gomez replied the phone rang as soon as he put it down he rattled off the address gomez had given him and told cohen to take a taxi there leave your car he cautioned it might have a transmitter on it of course i never thought of anything like that oh jeez i knew this thing was big poor sandy and the others i feel responsible for them there was nothing else you could have done randy you didnt know you were playing well out of your league what the hell is going on you had it right the first time we talked zavala said blue gold chapter the black rubber ball was only a meteor blur but sandecker had anticipated the bounce and his light wooden racket flicked out like a serpents tongue the quick backhand sent the ball speeding with a sharp thwack against the right wall legrand lunged but he had misjudged the spin and his racket swiped clumsily at thin air thats the game i believe said sandecker deftly scooping up the bouncing ball sandecker was a fitness and nutrition fanatic and his strict regimen of jogging and weightlifting gave him a competitive edge over men much younger and bigger he stood with legs wide apart the racket resting easily in the crook of his arm not one drop of perspiration beaded his forehead nor was a single red hair out of place on his head or the precisely trimmed fiery red van dyke beard by contrast legrand dripped with sweat as he removed his eye protectors and toweled his face dry he remembered why he had stopped playing with sandecker the cia director had the height and muscle advantage over sandecker who stood a few inches over five feet but as he learned each time he stepped onto the court with sandecker squash was a game of strategy not power under normal circumstances he would have put the admiral off when he called the day after the incident in new york state ive reserved a court at the club sandecker said cheer fully howd you like to bat the little black ball around for a bit despite the genial tone there was no doubt in legrands mind that this was a command performance legrand canceled his morning appointments and stopped at the watergate complex to pick up his gear sandecker was waiting at the squash club he was wearing a designer sweatsuit of navy blue with gold piping but even in his casual outfit it took little imagination to picture sandecker pacing the deck of a man o war in a bygone day barking commands to trim sail or unleash a broadside against a barbary pirate he ran numa the same way keeping one eye on the changes in the wind and the other on his adversaries like any good commander he took a keen interest in his crews welfare when he learned austin had been put in harms way by a cockeyed intelligence scheme he erupted in an explosion that would have put krakatoa to shame the cias involvement added to the violence of his reaction he was fond of legrand but in sandeckers uncompromising view the company was pampered and overfunded while he relished the chance to put the cia director in the hot seat he saw it as more than an opportunity to vent his spleen sandecker wasnt above political chicanery he was quite adept at it in fact one of his more valuable talents was the ability to stay ahead of his anger and use it to get his way targets of his rage had no idea that behind his laserhot fury he was often serene even joyful his ability served him well presidents of both parties deferred to him senators and congressmen went out of their way to cultivate his acquaintance cabinet members instructed their staff to put through his phone calls without question legrand had readily accepted the admirals invitation for a match because he was drenched with guilt over the incident in new york and welcomed the opportunity to make amends even if it meant being humiliated on the squash court to his surprise sandecker had greeted him with a smile and hadnt mentioned the incident throughout their play he even offered to buy the first round at the juice bar thanks for the match on such short notice sandecker said with his famous alligator smile legrand sipped his papaya juice and shook his head one of these days maybe ill beat you your backhand needs some work first sandecker offered by the way while i have your ear id like to thank you for averting a potential tragedy involving my man austin this might not be as bad as he expected legrand thought sandecker maintained his disconcerting smile pity you didnt get someone to respond more quickly he said you might have been able to save your asset he put heavy emphasis on the first syllable of the last word legrand groaned inwardly it was obvious sandecker was going to worry this one like a puppy with a bone ignoring the play on words the director said im sorry about that regrettable episode the full extent of this er problem wasnt apparent at first it was a very complex situation so i hear sandecker said lightly tell you what im going to do erwin i will forget for the time being that a screwball scheme hatched by the oss and carried out by the cia went awry almost killing the head of the numa special assignments team and an innocent bystander and placing the speaker of the house in jeopardy youre very gracious james legrand said sandecker nodded no details of this schoolboy spy prank will ever go beyond the walls of numa the agency appreciates your discretion legrand said sandecker raised a red eyebrow youre not entirely off the hook he said archly in exchange i want a full accounting of this sordid affair legrand knew there would be a quid pro quo there always was with sandecker he had already decided to lay his cards out on the table youre certainly justified in demanding an accounting he agreed i think so sandecker said agreeably it was quite a task to piece this story together especially on such short notice but ill do my best to explain what happened or thankfully in this case sandecker said what didnt happen legrand smiled wanly the end of world war ii is the be ginning of the story with germany defeated the allied coalition fell apart churchill came out with his iron curtain speech and the stage was set for the cold war the us was still complacent because it was the only country that had the bomb that smugness was eroded when the soviets exploded their own nuclear device and the arms race was on we gained headway with the hydrogen bomb but the russians were breathing down our necks and it was clearly a matter of time before the soviets gained parity as you know the hydrogen bomb utilized a different process to create an explosion the thermonuclear bomb uses fusion rather than fission said sandecker who was well versed in atomic physics having served on nuclearpowered submarines atoms are joined rather than split apart legrand nodded the hydrogen atom was fused with the helium atom the sun and other stars use the same process to create their energy once it became known that the main soviet fusion lab was in siberia there was talk in our government of sabotage hubris was still strong after defeating the axis and some people talked nostalgically of the commando raid on the heavywater plant in norway youre familiar with that mission of course you mean the plant that was producing an isotope needed for the production of a german abomb sandecker said thats right the raid delayed the german effort a similar commando raid in siberia would have been an ambitious undertaking to say the least as a matter of fact it would have been impossible legrand said the norway raid was incredibly difficult to launch even with accessibility and strong partisan support there was an other consideration as well sandecker who tended to see situations from a global perspective said germany was at war with the allies at the time of the norway raid the ussr and the us had not declared open hostilities both sides were careful to avoid direct military confrontation a raid on a soviet laboratory would be considered an overt act of war that could not be ignored thats correct it would be no different from the russians destroying a lab in new mexico it could have provoked a shooting war sandecker was not exactly innocent when it came to making end runs around politically dicey situations a raid might be feasible but it would have to be an ironclad secret with no way to trace it legrand nodded that was precisely what the president said when the situation was presented to him a tall order indeed sandecker noted granted but these were not ordinary men they had created the greatest military industrial machine in history virtually from scratch and ruthlessly used it to squash two formidable foes on several continents and seas but even all their determination and resourcefulness wasnt up to this challenge fortunately for them two unconnected developments intersected and showed them the way the first was the development of the air craft that came to be known as the flying wing the design had its problems but there was one unplanned characteristic that made it very attractive stealth technology the planes slim silhouette and clean surface meant that under the right circum stances it could slip undetected past radar my guess is that youre talking about russian radar sandecker said legrand smiled mysteriously supposedly all flying wings including those still in production were destroyed by the air force but the president gave the goahead for a modified version to be built in secret it had even greater range and speed than any of the original models in short here was a delivery system that could get in and out of siberia without being detected in my experience the russians are not a dull people sandecker said if their lab went up in smoke they would surmise the us was behind it undoubtedly which is why the second part of the equation was crucial legrand said that was the discovery of anasazium it was a byproduct of the work at los alamos the scientist who discovered the substance was an amateur anthropologist he was fascinated by the old pueblo culture that once lived in the southwest he named his discovery after the anasazi the material has a number of interesting properties the one that attracted the most interest was its ability to change the hydrogen atom in subtle ways if anasazium could be secretly introduced into a soviet weapons lab it might mess up the fusion research estimates were that it would hamstring their bomb project by several years the us would gain time to build an intercontinental bomber and missile fleet so advanced that the soviets would never catch up the plan was to float bombs down on parachutes they would explode and re lease the substance in liquid form which would get into the labs ventilation systems by itself the substance is not any more harmful than water to humans those under attack would think they heard a very strange thunderstorm of extremely short duration it doesnt sound exactly like pinpoint bombing it wasnt as they say desperate times call for desperate measures what if the plane crashed for some mechanical reason that possibility was taken into account there was no poi son pill like the one francis gary powers didnt take after his u crash they wanted no talkative survivors no parachutes were packed for the crew in fact it would have been impossible to parachute from the plane ejection seats had not yet been developed and the pilots canopy could not be jettisoned if wreckage were found it could always be said that this was an experimental plane tragically gone offcourse the crew knew this they were highly motivated volunteers with no sense of failure too bad the plan failed sandecker said to the contrary legrand said the mission was an un qualified success how so the soviets built a hydrogen bomb close on our heels as i recall quite true they exploded their first thermonuclear device in two years after the us remember what i said about hubris our people couldnt imagine that an ignorant peasant like stalin could outsmart them he was extremely suspicious of everyone he ordered igor kurchatov the soviet equivalent of our man oppenheimer to set up a duplicate hydrogen research lab in the ural mountains their research was successful stalin thought the siberian lab had failed on purpose and ordered its technicians liquidated im surprised a strike wasnt ordered into the ural operation a raid was contemplated but the mission was canceled maybe it was considered too dangerous or perhaps the flying wing had insurmountable technical problems what happened to the plane it was sealed in its hangar with the cargo the alaskan base it flew from was abandoned the men at the base were scattered all over the globe none of them had a complete picture of the operation that was almost the end of it almost you mean the protocol and the killing of the pilot legrand stirred uncomfortably in his chair that and more actually the entire flight crew was killed he said quietly the were the only nonpolitical types who knew the mission and the target intimately four men died their families were told they were in an accident they were buried with full military honors at arlington a lovely gesture legrand nervously cleared his throat you all know that ive done my best to clean things up at the agency sometimes ill scrape off one layer of dirt to reveal another even more filthy unfortunately much of the good work weve done has gone un heralded for obvious reasons but the intelligence community did some things that are nothing to be proud of this sad episode was one of them austin filled me in on his findings the pilot was at arlington attending his own funeral i understand his son saw him he insisted that he be allowed one more look at his wife and child the director said he was told he was going into protective custody for an indefinite time of course it was only a ruse shortly after he was placed under protection he was killed by his protector the man who lived in upstate new york thats right sandeckers blue eyes hardened sorry i dont feel any sad ness for the assassin he was a coldblooded killer at an age when we supposedly attain wisdom and he would have murdered austin what was the reason for the protocol wasnt murdering those crewmen enough the brass who decided this thing didnt want the faintest chance the secret would get out they thought it could start an other war relations were bad enough as it was between us and the soviets the protocol was set up to react blindly to any at tempt to unravel the secret they thought any spy snooping would come from abroad no one dreamed the threat would come from the us congress it was all totally unnecessary the speaker of the house was defeated for reelection and his expose never got off the ground it was probably assumed that the little land mine they left to blow up in the face of anyone following their trail would deactivate itself they never thought it would still be dangerous fifty years later sandecker leaned back in his chair and tented his fingers so this ancient scheme cooked up by a bunch of macho cow boys is what almost got my man killed i understand that the assassin had his bags packed ready to go with a snipers rifle and explosives apparently planning quite a retirement party for himself too bad we cant let the american public know what tomfoolery their tax dollars were used for in the name of democracy legrand said that would be a mistake it is still extremely sensitive reducing russias nuclear arsenal has been a struggle if this story got out it would strengthen the hand of the nationalists who say the us cant be trusted they would think that anyhow sandecker said dryly in my experience there is one thing powerful people fear the most embarrassment he smiled i trust there are no more protocols waiting out there to ambush the unwary it was a veiled warning ive already ordered a complete examination of our computer files to prevent exactly such a possibility legrand said no more surprises lets hope so sandecker said chapter austin poured himself a hot mug of jamaican blue mountain coffee straight took a sip of the highoctane brew and picked the aluminum cylinder off his desk he hefted it in his big hand staring at the battered convex surface as if it were a crystal ball the object yielded no secrets only a distorted reflection of his bronzed features and pale hair setting the cylinder aside he returned to the map of alaska spread out on his desk he had been to alaska several times and the sheer immensity of the fiftieth state never failed to boggle his mind searching for the old flying wing base in some of the most rugged territory on earth would be like trying to find a single grain of sand on malibu beach compounding the problem the base would have been built in a way to keep it from prying eyes he ran his finger from barrow deep inside the arctic circle south to the kenai peninsula the phone rang as the seed of an idea was beginning to sprout eyes glued on the map he grabbed the phone stuck it in his ear and snapped a perfunctory hello sandeckers crisp voice came on the line kurt can you come up to my office can this wait admiral austin said trying to hold on to his thought of course kurt sandecker said magnanimously is five minutes sufficient the notion withered and died like a flower in the sun sandecker must have been the original irresistible force the admirals mind operated at warp speed and consequently his sense of time tended to be compressed ill be there in two minutes splendid i think youll find it worth your while when austin walked into sandeckers tenthfloor office he expected to see the director of numa behind the immense desk made from a hatch taken from a confederate blockade runner instead the admiral sat off to the side in one of the comfortable dark leather chairs reserved for visitors he was chatting with a woman who sat with her back to austin sandecker who was wearing a navy blazer with gold anchors embroidered over the breast pocket rose to greet austin thank you for coming kurt theres someone here id like you to meet the woman stood and austins preoccupation with his alaskan puzzle evaporated in a single glance she was tall and slim with eurasian high cheekbones and almondshaped eyes in contrast to her exotic looks she was dressed conservatively in a long burgundy skirt and matching jacket her dark blond hair was tightly woven into a single braid down to her shoulder blades something about her went beyond natural beauty she had the erect carriage of someone born to royalty but at the same time she walked with the lithe easiness of a panther as she came over to shake hands the deep brown eyes with gold flecks seemed to radiate a tropical heat maybe it was his imagination but her musky scent made austin think of the throb of distant drums it suddenly dawned on him who the woman was youre dr cabral austin would not have been surprised if she had answered with a soft purr in a low mellow voice she said thank you for coming to see me mr austin i hope i havent interrupted any thing important i asked admiral sandecker if i might have the chance to thank you personally for your help youre very welcome but gamay and paul did all the hard work i simply answered the phone and pushed a couple of but tons you are far too modest mr austin she said with a smile that could have melted ice cubes if not for your quick action im afraid my head and those of your colleagues would be deco rating a village thousands of miles from these comfortable surroundings sandecker stepped between them and guided francesca back to her chair on that happy note dr cabral would you mind if we imposed and asked you to tell us your story from start to finish not at all she replied talking to someone about my experience has therapeutic value and i also find myself remembering details i had forgotten sandecker motioned for austin to sit then slipped into his desk chair and lit up one of the ten custommade cigars he smoked each day he and austin listened with rapt attention as francesca narrated the gripping tale of the hijacking the crash and her brush with death her ascension as a white goddess she went into great detail about the public works projects in the chulo village that she took so much pride in she ended with an account of the arrival of the trouts their mad flight and their rescue by helicopter fascinating sandecker said absolutely fascinating tell me what became of your friend tessa she stayed on with dr ramirez her knowledge of medicinal plants will be invaluable in his research i talked by phone to my parents to make sure they are well they wanted me to come home but i decided to stay in the us i need more of a decompression time before i insert myself back into the sao paulo social whirl beyond that i am determined to carry on the task that was interrupted ten years ago sandecker contemplated the stubborn set of francescas jaw i firmly believe past is not only present but also future it would help to know what lies ahead if you told us something about the events that led to your plane trip francesca stared into the distance as if she could see through time it goes back to my childhood i became aware at a very early age that i come from a privileged background even as a girl i knew i lived in a city with appalling slums as i grew older and traveled i learned that my city was a microcosm for the world here in one place were the haves and the havenots i also discovered that the difference between rich and poor nations is the earths most plentiful substance water fresh water lubricates development without water there is nothing to eat with out food there is no will to live to raise ones standard of living even the oilrich countries use much of their petroleum revenues to buy or produce water we take it for granted that when we turn on the tap water will flow but that will not always be the case the competition for water has become greater than ever the us is no stranger to water disputes sandecker said in the old days range wars were fought over water rights that will be nothing compared with the troubles of the future francesca said darkly in this century wars will not be fought over oil as in the past but over water the situation is becoming desperate the worlds water is strained by the population growth there is no more fresh water on the earth than two thousand years ago when the population was three percent of its current size even without the inevitable droughts like the cur rent one it will get worse as demand and pollution increase some countries will simply run out of water sparking a global refugee crisis tens of millions of people will flood across international borders it means the collapse of fisheries environmental destruction conflict lower living standards she paused for a moment as people who deal with the ocean you must see the irony we are facing a shortage on a planet whose surface is covered twothirds with water water water everywhere nor any drop to drink austin said quoting the samuel taylor coleridge poem precisely but suppose the mariner had a magic wand could wave over a bucket of seawater changing it into fresh his ship would have survived now extend that analogy to millions of buckets the global water crisis would be over austin said nearly seventy percent of the worlds population lives within fifty miles of the ocean exactly francesca said her mood lightening are you telling me you have this magic wand something almost as good i have developed a revolutionary means to extract salt from seawater you must know that desalting is hardly a new concept sandecker said francesca nodded the extraction of salt from seawater goes back to the ancient greeks desalination plants have been built around the world including many in the middle east there are several methods but all are costly in my doctorate i proposed a radically new approach i threw out all the old methods my goal was a process that would be efficient and cheap available to the poorest farmer trying to scratch a living from the dust think of the implications water would be nearly free deserts would be come centers of civilization im sure you thought of the undesirable consequences sandecker said the fact that cheap water would stimulate development population growth and the pollution that goes with them i thought long and hard about that admiral sandecker but the alternatives were even more unpalatable i would make orderly development a requirement before allowing a country to use my process it goes without saying then that your experimentation was a success austin said very much so i was bringing a working model of the process to the international conference seawater would go in one end fresh water come out at the other it would produce energy and little to no waste products a process like that would have been worth millions of dollars no doubt i had offers that would have made me immensely rich but i planned to give my process to the world free of charge that was quite generous of you you say you had offers then someone knew of your process and plans once i contacted the united nations to attend the conference it became an open secret she paused something has al ways puzzled me many people knew about my process the people who tried to kidnap me would be immediately exposed if they tried to profit from my work theres another possibility austin suggested maybe they wanted to bury your work and keep the process a secret from the world but why would anyone try to stop a boon to humanity perhaps youre too young to remember said sandecker who had been listening intently years ago stories circulated about the inventor who supposedly built a car engine that could go a hundred miles on a gallon or burn water the details arent important the oil companies reportedly bought the secret and buried it so they could continue to make profits the stories were apocryphal but do you see my point who would prevent the poor nations from enjoying cheap water our investigations have given us an advantage over you dr cabral let me ask you a theoretical question suppose you con trolled the worlds supply of fresh water how would you greet the arrival of a process that suddenly makes cheap water avail able to all my process would end your theoretical water monopoly but this is a moot point it is simply not possible for someone to control the worlds water sandecker and austin exchanged glances taking over from sandecker austin said a lot has been happening in the past ten years dr cabral we can fill you in on the whole story later but weve discovered that a huge pan national organization called the gogstad corporation is very close to acquiring a monopoly over the worlds fresh water impossible i wish it were francescas eyes hardened then this gogstad must be the one who tried to kidnap me who stole those ten years from my life we have no solid proof austin said there is certainly strong circumstantial evidence pointing in that direction tell me what do you know of a substance called anasazium francescas mouth dropped open in surprise recovering quickly she said is there anything you people at numa do not know quite a bit im sorry to say we know very little about this stuff other than the fact that it can affect the hydrogen atom in strange ways thats its most important property its a very complex relationship this material is at the heart of my desalting process only a few people know of its existence its extremely rare how did you come across it by chance i read an obscure paper written by a former los alamos physicist rather than try to improve on the existing methods of desalting i wanted to deal with it at a molecular or even nuclear level a solution had eluded me until i heard about this substance i contacted the scientist who wrote the article he had a small amount of the material and was willing to part with it when i told him why i needed it why is it so rare several reasons with no apparent economic use for it the demand was nonexistent then too the refinement process is quite complicated the main ore source is in a troubled part of africa that is constantly at war i had several ounces enough for a working model i would have proposed that the nations of the world pool their resources to produce enough anasazium to set up pilot projects working together we could have viable quantities of this substance within a short time gogstad was running an installation off the coast of mexico it was destroyed in a tremendous explosion tell me more about this installation austin gave her a quick summary starting with the death of the whales he described the storage cylinder after the explosion and how he traced it to the flying wing sandecker filled her in on the cold war mission to siberia a fantastic tale its too bad about the whales she said sadly my process produces heat which can be turned into energy the material can be unstable and under certain circum stances becomes a powerful explosive these people must have been trying to replicate my desalination process and were unaware of the materials instability where would they have acquired the anasazium we dont know austin said we are aware of a large source but dont know its exact location we must find it so i can resume my research francesca insisted theres an even more important reason sandecker interjected i know no more important reason than to continue my work she said defensively in time dr cabral in time your work will have little meaning if gogstad succeeds in its plans whoever controls the worlds water controls the world it sounds as if youre talking about global domination admiral sandecker why not napoleon and hitler failed but their attempts were made through force of arms in each case they came up against somebody with a bigger stick he took a smooth puff on his cigar and watched the cloud of smoke the people protesting globalization all that business with the world trade organization and the international monetary fund were onto something the danger is not in these entities but in the idct that it is easier now for someone to exert total control over a economic sector a sort of global al capone austin offered there are similarities capone was ruthless about exterminating the competition and had a fine instinct for organization his economic power gave him political clout bootleg booze is a far cry from water the world cant do without water those who control its flow will have the ultimate political power who will stand up against someone whose word can condemn you and your country to die of thirst that is why i say with all due respect dr cabral that there are more important matters to be taken care of first youre right admiral sandecker francesca conceded if this gogstad finds the main supply of anasazium it will control my process as well intelligence and beauty are such a welcome combination sandecker said with unveiled appreciation the young lady has stated my fears exactly its imperative that we find that longlost cache before gogstad does i was trying to figure out how to pinpoint the location when you called im going to need some help thats not a problem use any numa resource that you need and if we dont have them well find them else where i think joe and i should leave as soon as possible for alaska before you go dashing off to the yukon theres something else we have to discuss this buildup of tankers that joes re porter friend told him about has me worried what do you make of it at the very least gogstad is expecting to move lots of water from alaska to someplace that needs it there has been talk of transporting water to china perhaps sandecker said unconvinced ill talk to rudi gunn maybe he and yaeger can shed light on this mystery while you and joe are trying to nail down this flying wing they can see what they can find about the tankers austin rose and said ill start things moving he shook hands with francesca and said ill show you out dr cabral thank you and please call me francesca she said as they strolled to the elevator i will if you call me kurt tell me do you prefer korean thai italian or just plain old american cooking i beg your pardon no one told you he said with mock amazement dinner is part of the austin rescue package i hope you wont refuse who lknows how long i will have to subsist on whale blubber and walrus steaks after today in that case i would be happy to accept your invitation would seven oclock be convenient thats fine it will give me plenty of time to start making preparations for our trip to alaska ill see you then as you know i am staying with the trouts and korean would be fine austin bid francesca goodbye near the huge globe that rose from the center of the seagreen floor in the numa lobby an atrium surrounded by waterfalls and aquariums filled with colorful and exotic sea life then he went back to his fourthfloor office called zavala to let him know of his meeting with sandecker and lined up transportation for their trip francesca was ready when he arrived at the trouts georgetown house to pick her up he chatted with paul and gamay long enough to be polite then drove to his favorite korean restaurant housed in an unpretentious building in alexandria austin recommended that they order below thin strips of marinated beef cooked on a hot plate on the table ordinarily it was one of his favorite meals but he hardly tasted it he was too busy looking at francesca she was dressed simply in a stone washed denim dress whose light blue color set off her dark complexion and long luxurious hair that seemed to have captured the light of the sun it was hard for austin to reconcile the picture of this cultured and beautiful woman who was clearly de lighted over the simple pleasure of a civilized meal with the tale he had heard of her reign as a white goddess among savage indians she seemed relaxed and entirely at ease but even as they laughed over her inept use of chopsticks austin couldnt shake the feeling he experienced when they first met despite the civilized veneer the jungle had seeped into her blood he saw it in the feline gracefulness of her movement and the watchfulness in her dark eyes it was a quality that fascinated and attracted austin and he vowed to see more of francesca when he returned from his mission which was why it was all the more painful when austin apologized for calling it an early night he had much to do be fore leaving for alaska he explained as he dropped her off on the trouts doorstep he asked if she would like to go out again when he returned thank you id like that very much she said i plan to be in washington for some time and hope we can get to know each other better until then austin said at a time and place to be announced she smiled and pecked him lightly on the lips its a date chapter with sandeckers backing austin had no trouble commandeering a numa jet streaking across the country at five hundred miles per hour the turquoise cessna citation ultra had refueled at salt lake city before pushing on to anchorage after the allnight trip they arrived as the morning light cast a rosy glow over the chugach mountains on the outskirts of alaskas big city which some of the locals call los anchorage they were airborne within minutes dashing on to their destination in nome shortly after the numa jet took off from anchorage zavala came back from the galley with a couple of steaming mugs of coffee austin was studying an old map spread out on the table that folded down between the seats he was directing his attention to a fist of land whose knuckles jabbed at the former ussr a few miles across the bering strait settling into the chair opposite austins zavala sipped his coffee and looked out the window at the vast land mass below black mountains edged by rivers and heavy forests were visible through a scattering of whiskered cirrus clouds thats big country zavala said lazily any idea of our next port of call after nome austin leaned back laced his fingers behind his head and stared into space his broad mouth curled in a wry smile more or less he said zavala knew his partner wasnt trying to be mysterious austin simply didnt like surprises when time allowed he cautiously collected the facts before making a move zavala pointed downward im sure it doesnt come as any surprise to you that there is more down there than less something like six hundred thousand square miles last i heard i have no illusions about the formidable task were up against we could search until we became eligible for numa pensions and not find a thing austins brow furrowed in thought thats why i decided to work my way backward from what we know not what we dont know zavala swiftly grasped the premise we know what the tar get was in the soviet union he pointed on the map to the northwest coast of alaska where blunt fingers of the ragged coastline all that remained of the old land bridge reached to ward asia what was the flying wings statistical range around three thousand miles cruising at around five hundred miles per hour im assuming that its fuel storage capacity would have been beefed up to extend the range as much as possible for this mission theres always the possibility of midair refueling zavala said ive taken that into consideration im guessing that they would have kept the operation simple and short to avoid detection taking a sharp pencil in hand austin drew an arc from barrow to the yukon delta zavala let out a low whistle youre talking about a trip that could be more than a thousand miles from target thats still a lot of territory to cover its bigger than some states austin acknowledged so i made an educated guess the cloakanddagger boys wanted to keep this crazy scheme as hushhush as possible building a new base would be costly and timeconsuming and most important it might attract unwanted attention zavala snapped his fingers they would use an existing base austin nodded during world war ii alaska bristled with gun emplacements and airfields because of fears japan would invade each red dot on the map denotes an airstrip from world war ii zavala pondered the problem what if the base were secret it was secret at least up to now austin jabbed the map with his pencil at nome and drew a wide circle around the dot well find what were looking for here although i must admit that with all the suppositions ive made its still a crap shoot zavala studied the map and his lips twitched up at the corners in his trademark smile how can you be certain this is the right area the plane could have taken off from dozens of places i had a little help from a ghost austin reached into his jacket pocket and produced a small spiralbound notebook the brown cover was worn but it was still possible to read the words us army air force and the name inked just below he handed the notebook to zavala this is the diary of buzz martins father the pilot who flew the wing on its last mission zavala laughed with delight you should have been a magician you couldnt have done better pulling a rabbit out of a hat this rabbit jumped into my lap after sandecker met with legrand the cia poked around and came up with martins personal effects they must have been in a hurry to get rid of in criminating evidence and didnt vet the stuff thoroughly buzz found the notebook tucked into his fathers uniform he thought it might contain something of importance and gave it to me just before we left washington zavala thumbed through the curling pages i dont see a de tailed map to follow you didnt think this was going to be easy did you austin took the book back and opened to a page where he had placed a yellow sticky tab martin was a good soldier he knew that loose lips sink ships most of the diary is devoted to how he missed his wife and kid but he let a few things sneak in here let me read you the first paragraph to my dear wife phyllis and son buzz maybe someday you will read this i had a lot of time on my hands and started this diary on the way to noname if the brass knew i was taking notes id be in hot water this thing is even more secret than the manhattan project as the spooks frequently reminded me im just a dumb sky jockey whos sup posed to follow orders and not ask questions sometimes i feel more like a prisoner im kept under close supervision with the rest of the crew so i guess this journal is a way of saying hey im a person theyre feeding us well phyllis i know how you worry about the way i eat lots of good fresh meat and fish the quonset hut was not made for the frozen north the snow slides off the roof but metal is a lousy insulator we keep the wood stove going day and night wed be better off in an igloo the plane gets the firstclass accommodations in its hideyhole sorry to complain im lucky to be flying this baby i cant believe an aircraft as big as this can maneuver like a fighter plane its definitely the aviation wave of the future austin stopped reading he goes on to say how homesick he is and how glad hell be to get back too bad martin didnt get to enjoy that future he had no idea he was not only a prisoner but a condemned man as well martin wasnt the first or last patriot thrown to the dogs in the interests of what the higherups said was the greater good unfortunately he cant have the satisfaction of knowing his little diary will show us the way to noname thats even more obscure than the dateline they used to use during the war somewhere in the pacific i thought so too until i remembered a story i heard years ago seems a british navy officer sailing off alaska in the s saw land that wasnt on the chart so he wrote in name the admiralty draftsman who recopied the chart thought the question mark was a c and that the a in name was an o no name became cape nome which became nome heres something else uneventful trip from seattle plane handles like a dream touched down thirty minutes past noname what was the cruising speed of the wing zavala asked about four hundred to five hundred miles per hour that would put them two hundred to two hundred fifty miles beyond nome my calculations exactly heres where it starts to get interesting got my first look at our destination told the guys it looks like dougs nose from the air a dogs nose no the proper name doug that narrows it down to a few million guys zavala said wearily yeah i know i had the same reaction until i read the rest all it needs is a corn cob pipe to look like old eagle beak douglas macarthur who could forget that profile especially someone who had come out of the big war in addition nome is only one hundred and sixty one miles from russia i thought it was worth ordering up some satellite pictures while you snoozed your way over the continental united states i was going over the photos with a magnifying glass he handed the satellite views to zavala who examined them for a few minutes and shook his head i dont see anything that resembles an eagles beak i didnt find one either i told you it wasnt going to be easy they were still going over the photos and map when the numa pilot announced that the plane was starting its de scent to nome airport they gathered their gear in a couple of bags and were ready when the plane rolled to a stop on the tarmac of the small but modern airport a taxi took them to town along one of nomes three twolane gravel roads the bright sun did little to relieve the monotonous terrain of flat treeless tundra although the kigluaik mountains could be seen in the distance the cab took them onto front street which bordered the bluegray waters of the bering sea past the turnofthecentury city hall terminus for the iditarod dogsled race dropping them off at the barge port and fishing harbor where their leased float plane awaited with a full tank of fuel zavala was more than pleased with the plane a singleengine maule m with short takeoff and landing capability while joe checked out the plane austin picked up some sandwiches and coffee at fat freddies diner they were traveling light they brought clothing mostly although austin had packed his trusty bowen revolver zavala had brought along an ingram machine pistol capable of firing hundreds of rounds a minute when austin asked why he needed such lethal firepower in the desolate northland zavala had muttered something about grizzly bears with zavala at the controls the maule headed northeasterly along the coast the plane stayed low cruising at a hundred and seventyfive miles per hour the day was cloudy but with none of the rain the nome area is noted for they quickly settled into a routine austin called out a promisinglooking piece of real estate and zavala circled it a couple of times austin pencilshaded the areas they covered on his map their excitement at being on the hunt quickly faded as the plane droned over mile after mile of ragged coastline the barren land was broken only by lacy rivers and shallow ponds created by melted snow austin kept them amused by reciting poems of robert ser vice which zavala translated into spanish but even the shooting of dan mcgrew didnt dull the monotony of their quest zavalas usual good humor was beginning to wear weve seen parrot beaks pigeon beaks and even a turtle beak but no eagle he grumbled austin studied the shaded portions of his map a substantial amount of coastline had yet to be covered weve still got a lot of territory to check out id like to keep on going how are you doing im fine but the plane is going to need fuel before long we passed what looked like a fishing camp a short while back how about breaking for lunch while we tank up old betsy here zavala responded by putting the plane into a banking circle before long they picked up the river they had flown over earlier and followed it for about ten minutes until they sighted a cluster of plywood shacks two float planes were tied up in the river zavala scoped out a straight stretch of water he brought the plane down skimmed the surface in a near perfect landing and taxied the plane up to a weatherbeaten pier a stocky young man with a face as round as a full moon saw them coming and threw out a mooring line welcome to tinook village population one hundred and sixtyseven most of them related he said with a smile as dazzling as sunlight on new snow my name is mike tinook tinook didnt appear surprised to have a couple of strangers drop out of the sky to visit his remote village with vast distances to cover alaskans will fly a hundred miles just to have breakfast perhaps it has something to do with the scarcity of human contact outside anchorage but most alaskans spin out their stories about how they came north within five minutes of making an acquaintance mike related how he grew up in the village worked as an airplane mechanic in anchorage and came back home to stay austin explained they were with the national underwater amp marine agency had you figured for some kind of government guys tinook said knowingly too clean for oil men or hunters and too sure of yourselves to be tourists we had a numa team drop by a few years ago they were doing research in the chukchi sea what brings you to the land of the midnight sun were doing sort of a geological survey but i must confess that were not having much success austin said were looking for a point of land that sticks out into the water its shaped like an eagles beak tinook shook his head thats my plane out there i do a lot of flying when im not fishing or helping to tend the reindeer herd but it doesnt ring a bell cmon up to the store we can look at a map they climbed a rickety staircase to the plywood building it was the typical alaskan general store a combination of grocery pharmaceutical hardware gift shop and wilderness outfitter customers could take their pick from insect repellent canned goods snowmobile replacement parts and tv videos tinook checked a wall map of the area nope nothing like an eagles beak he scratched his head maybe you should talk to clarence clarence yeah my grandfather he used to get around a lot and likes visitors austins eyes glazed over he was impatient to get in the air again he was trying to think of a diplomatic way to put tinook off without hurting his feelings when he noticed a rifle hung on the wall behind the counter he walked over for a closer look it was a carbine ml the workhorse rifle carried by american infantrymen in world war ii he had seen ms before but this was in exceptionally mint condition is that your rifle he asked tinook my grandfather gave it to me but i use my own gun for hunting that thing has got quite a story behind it sure you wouldnt want to talk to clarence might be worth your while zavala saw austins newfound interest i wouldnt mind stretching my legs for a while longer at least we dont have to worry about getting home before dark joes point was well taken daylight was more than twenty two hours long and even after the sun set technically night was only a short period of dusk mike guided them along a muddy street past more shacks gangs of roundfaced children sleeping huskies and racks where crimson strips of salmon dried in the sun he went up to the door of a shack smaller than the others and knocked someone inside told them to come in they stepped into the oneroom house it smelled of wood smoke and something meaty cooking on a camp stove the house was sparsely furnished with a bunk bed in one corner and a table covered with a redandwhite checkered oilcloth a man who looked as old as a glacier sat at the table carefully painting a wooden polar bear figure about six inches high several others figures of wolves and eagles had been painted and lined up grandpa these men would like to hear the story about your rifle dark oriental eyes sparkled with intelligence and good humor from a face creased in a thousand wrinkles clarence wore darkframed glasses and his thick silvery hair was neatly parted on one side his mouth widened in a grin that seemed to take over his whole jaw although he must have been in his eighties he shook hands in a bonecrunching grip and looked as if he could still wrestle a sea lion to the floor yet the voice that should have been amplified by the powerful frame was as soft as windblown snow his grandson said i have to go back to the shop ill have the plane refueled by the time you get back i make these for the gift shops in anchorage the old man said putting the polar bear and paints aside glad you dropped by youre just in time for lunch he indicated a couple of rickety chairs and refusing the protests of his guests he spooned the stew from the stove pot into some chipped willowpattern china bowls he took a big spoonful as if to show there was no harm in his cooking how is it austin and zavala tentatively sampled the stew and pronounced it quite good the old man beamed with pleasure is it caribou zavala asked the old man reached into a trash bucket and pulled out a can of dinty moore beef stew mikes a good boy clarence said he and his wife buy me stuff so i wont have to cook they worry that im lonely since my wife died i like visitors but i dont want to bore you men austin looked around the room the walls were decorated with primitive harpoons and eskimo folk art a norman rock well print with the boy sitting in the dentists office was hung in congruously next to a fierce walrus mask there were family pictures including many of a stout handsome woman who could have been the old mans wife the most outofplace object was a computer tucked in the corner grandpa tinook saw austins amused gaze and said its amazing weve got the satellite so the kids can learn about the rest of the world i can talk on that machine with anyone so im never alone clarence was no old blubberchewing windbag austin deduced he was sorry he had been in such a rush to avoid meeting him if you dont mind wed very much like to hear your story he said grandpa tinook noisily scooped up the last of his stew put the bowls in the sink and sat down again he squinted as if the memory were hard to recall but when he started to talk it was clear he had spun this tale before one day many years ago i was out hunting there was some good trout and salmon fishing fox to trap and herds of caribou i always got something i had this little aluminum skiff and a fine motor got me around pretty good it was too far to come home after the hunt so i used to stay over a couple of nights at the old airfield austin glanced at zavala alaska is dotted with airfields hardly worth the name where was this airfield he asked up north a ways left over from the big war they used to ferry planes to russia and used it as a stopoff blimps there used to look for subs not much left there was a hut where i could light a fire and keep warm and dry i could store game and smoke it there til it was time to come home how long ago was that oh fifty years ago or so my memory aint what it used to be i remember when they said i had to stop going there though y the old man nodded for months i never seen anybody then one day two men come by in a plane just as im cooking up some trout hardlookin white men they flash their badges say theyre with the government and want to know what im doing i give them some fish and theyre a lot nicer they say theres going to be a big secret at the base and i cant come there anymore but they will buy any fresh meat and fish i can get them one of them gave me that gun you saw so i could shoot game i took them lots of game and fish never to the base though id meet them halfway did you see any planes sure lots coming and going once i was hunting and i heard one that sounded like a hundred rushing rivers big as this whole village and crazy shape what kind of shape he went to the wall and took down a harpoon touching the sharp metal point with his finger he said something like this austins gaze was unwavering how long did you hunt game for these men bout six months i think one day they showed up said they didnt need any more they told me to stay away from the airfield didnt want me to step on a mine said i could keep the rifle they left in a big hurry zavala said weve been looking for an old airfield supposed to be on a piece of land that looked like an eagles nose but we cant find it oh sure this place used to be like that things have changed from ice and wind in the summer the water comes in from rivers and floods the land doesnt look the same as it did back then you got a map kurt pulled the map from his jacket and unfolded it grandpa tinooks thick finger came down on a section of coast under the pencil shading right here he said we must have flown right over it zavala said tell me austin said those men did they give you their names sure hewy and dewy they said zavala chuckled i suppose lewy was busy the old man shrugged i read donald duck when i shipped out on merchant ships out of anchorage they figured i musta ate whale blubber all my life i let them think that it was probably a good thing that you did like i said they were hard men although we became pretty good friends i went back to the old base after the war i think they just said that about the mines to scare me off felt like something had been poisoned and left to rot he paused thoughtfully maybe you can tell me one thing i always wondered what was the big secret we werent fighting the japanese the war was over some men cant live without war austin replied if they dont have one they find another sounds crazy to me but what do i know well that was years ago why do you men want to go to that old place for once austin was at a loss for words he could have said how important it was to find an odd substance named anasazium before gogstad got its hands on it and made worldwide mischief but he suspected his real reasons were more visceral the story of buzz martins father had smoldered in him and offended his sense of right and wrong the best answer he could muster was there was a boy once who went to his fathers funeral only his father wasnt dead the old man nodded solemnly as if austin had been the soul of clarity austins mind was already racing toward the task ahead thank you very much for telling us your story kurt said rising and for lunch too wait clarence said he perused the wooden figures hed carved picked out two and gave one to each of the numa men take these the bear for strength and the wolf for cunning austin and zavala thanked the old man for his generosity makes me feel better to give you some luck after telling you how to get to that place you go back to that old base i got the feeling youre going to need it chapter the suns blinding reflection on the mirrored surface of the water had prevented a good look at the eagles beak on the first pass only a thin ragged crescent of tundra could be seen part of an inundated coastal plain ex tending into a pearshaped bay zavala angled the plane so that the dark outline of general macarthurs nose was visible under the translucent covering of water austin gave zavala the thumbs up this is it the thumb pointed down land zavala brought the plane around in a low sweep and flew the length of the peninsula at an altitude of about two hundred feet the crooked finger of land was more than a mile long and less than half as wide blackwater marsh had encroached on its borders and added to the ravages of wind and ice that had distorted its original shape see how close you can get us to those moraines austin said pointing to the low glaciercarved mounds that began where the peninsula joined the mainland zavala tapped the brim of his numa baseball cap no sweat this baby can land on the head of a pin stand by for a pictureperfect landing austin had every bit of confidence in his partners flying ability zavala had logged hundreds of hours flying every conceivable type of aircraft there were times though when he had visions of snoopy pretending his doghouse was a world war i sopwith camel he pushed the thought out of his mind as zavala circled the strip again dropped into a long glide and reduced speed until the planes floats skimmed the shallow water the plane was about to set down smoothly when they heard a loud thump under their feet followed by the tortured sound of metal tearing the plane snapped around like an amusement park ride the two men were flung against their seatbelts like rag dolls the spinning plane came to rest at a drunken angle zavala had the wind knocked out of him but managed to kill the engine as the propeller spun to a stop austin felt his head to make sure it was still attached to his shoulders if that was picture perfect id hate to see a rough landing what happened to the head of a pin zavala adjusted his baseball cap and straightened his reflecting sunglasses on his nose sorry he said with uncharacteristic humbleness they must be making pins bigger than they used to austin shook his head and suggested they inspect the dam age they climbed out onto the pontoons to be met by the local welcoming committee a cloud of condorsized alaskan mosquitoes thirsting for human blood drove them back into the cockpit after liberally dousing themselves with cutters industrialstrength bug repellent they ventured out again they stepped off the plane into about two feet of water and examined the twisted metal around the righthand float well have some splaining to do at the plane rental place but well be able to take off zavala said he sloshed back along their landing path moments later he bent over and said hey check this out austin came over and examined a metal post covered by a few inches of water metal gleamed brightly where the top was sheared off and copper electrical wires dangled out congratulations austin said i think you found a landing beacon the unerring zavala homing instinct never fails joe said as if he had hit the landing light on purpose he expanded his search and within minutes located another light this one had the glass lens and bulb socket still intact austin surveyed their surroundings and tried to get his bearings it was easy to see why the remote spot was picked for a secret airstrip the terrain was naturally as flat as an aircraft carrier and would have needed little grading he looked toward the hills where the sun sparkled off a lacework of streams that pooled into the lake that hid the strip they unloaded the plane slung their packs over their shoulders and waded toward the hills less than a quarter of a mile distant although they wore boots that kept their feet dry the water sloshed onto their waterproof goretex pants and they were glad the temperature was in the fifties the water became shallower and turned into spongy bog then they were crunching on permafrost as they made their way through patches of buttercup wild crocus and poppies they spotted more landing lights all leading in a line toward the hills at one point they stopped and looked off at a huge flock of eiders floating over the marsh like a dark plume of smoke with the unearthly quiet they could have been on the surface of another planet continuing their hike they came to the foot of an escarpment that angled sharply up from the ground the elongated hill was round at the top and shaped vaguely like a loaf of italian bread patches of black rock splotched with lichens and moss were visible through the thick vegetation that covered much of the hill austin thought it peculiar that the mound stood by it self isolated from the nearest hills by several hundred yards he mentioned his observation to zavala notice how the land here is flat except for this bump if i were a geologist i might be able to make something of it i was thinking more of the landing lights they lead right to the face of this hill he stared at an exposed section for a moment then put his face inches away and ran his fingers over the shiny surface using the large blade on his swiss army knife he poked at the rock and chipped off a thin piece about as big as his palm he examined the material then grinned and handed it to zavala paint zavala said with wonder he ran his hand over the shiny area exposed by austins knife sheetmetal and bolts someone went to a lot of trouble to keep this thing hidden austin took several steps back and raised his eyes to the top of the mound i remember clarence tinook saying something about an old blimp base maybe theres a dirigible hangar under this stuff that makes sense and goes with our theory that they used an existing base the next question is how we get inside try saying open sesame and hope for the best zavala stood back and bellowed the famous command from ali baba and the forty thieves when nothing happened he tried again in spanish also to no avail you know any more magic words he asked austin you just exhausted my entire repertoire kurt said with a shrug they walked around behind the hangar sticking out of the permafrost were the foundations of several small buildings that could have been quonset huts a dump area revealed piles of rusty tin cans and broken glass but no entrance to the mound presented itself it was zavala who stumbled literally on the entrance austin was walking several steps ahead of his partner when he heard a yell he turned quickly joe had vanished as if the earth had swallowed him up confirming this possibility zavalas disembodied voice swearing in the tongue of his ancestors issued eerily from the ground austin carefully back tracked and found zavala in a cellar hole that had been covered over by vegetation austin had walked right by the hole without seeing it are you okay austin called out more mutterings yeah the brush that covered this damned hole cushioned my fall cmon down theres a short set of stairs austin joined zavala at the bottom of the hole which was about eight feet deep joe was standing in front of a partially open door of heavily riveted steel dont tell me austin grunted the unerring zavala homing instinct what else zavala said austin pulled a small but powerful halogen light from his pack the door noisily opened with some persuasion from his shoulder he stepped inside with zavala close behind a blast of cold and fetid air hit them in the face as if they were standing in front of an air conditioner for a mausoleum the beam of light showed a corridor whose concrete walls and ceiling were inadequate insulation against permafrost and seemed to amplify the cold pulling their jacket collars tight around their necks they started along the corridor several doors led off the main hallway of the underground bunker austin flashed his light inside the rooms rusty bed frames and mattresses rotting with decay testified to the use of one space as a bunkroom farther along was a kitchen and pantry the last chamber was a communications room they left in a rush zavala said the smashed vacuum tubes and radio cabinets looked as if they had been attacked with a sledgehammer they continued along the passageway skirting a large rectangular hole in the floor the metal grating that once covered it had mostly rusted through austin pointed the flashlight down the deep shaft some sort of ventilation or heating maybe ive been thinking about what clarence tinook said about mines zavala said lets hope it was a concocted story they hoped would scare off hunters and fishermen austin said maybe he actually said mimes now that would certainly scare me zavala replied the corridor eventually ended in a short set of stairs that led to another steel door they guessed that they were under the hangar not entirely convinced of his own argument against booby traps austin took a deep breath opened the door and stepped through austin immediately sensed a change in atmosphere the cold was less biting and musty than in the concrete bunker the staleness of the air was overpowered by the smell of gasoline oil and heated metal on the wall to the right of the door was a switch a stenciled sign read generator austin gave zavala the goahead and joe yanked the switch down nothing happened at first then there was a click from somewhere in the darkness and a series of sputtering pops as a motor coughed reluctantly into life high above lights glimmered dimly then glowed brightly illuminating the vaulted ceilings of a huge artificial cave zavala was too awestruck to speak illuminated at center stage was what looked like a blackwinged avenger from a norse myth he walked over behind the scimitarshaped craft reached up and tentatively touched one of the vertical fins extending down from the trailing end of the fuselage beautiful he whispered as if he were talking about a lovely woman ive read about this thing seen pictures but i never dreamed it would be so magnificent austin went over and stood beside him taking in the broad sweep of sculpted aluminum either weve stumbled into the bat cave or we just found the longlost phantom flying wing he said zavala walked under the fuselage i did some reading about the plane these fins were added later for stabilization when they went from prop to jet power shes about a hundred seventy feet from wing tip to wing tip thats half the length of a football field austin said zavala nodded it was the largest plane of its day even though shes only about fifty feet from front to back check out these jet engines in the original all eight were built into the fuselage they slung these two underneath the wing to free up fuel space fits in with what you said about modifications to in crease range they walked around to the front of the plane the swept back aerodynamic lines were even more impressive from this angle although the plane weighed more than two hundred thou sand tons it seemed to balance lightly on its tripod landing gear jack northrop really had something when he designed this lady austin replied absolutely look at that slim silhouette theres hardly any surface for radar to bounce off theyve even painted it black like the stealth planes lets go inside zavala said eagerly they climbed up a ladder through a hatchway in the planes belly and made their way along a short ramp like the rest of the plane the flight deck was unconventional zavala sat in the rotating pilots seat and used a handoperated mechanism to pump the seat four feet higher into a plexiglas bubble he peered through the cowling which was to the left of the wings center line the conventional switches and instruments were located between the pilot and the copilot who sat at a lower level the throttle controls were suspended from the overhead similar to navy flying boats such as the catalina fantastic visibility zavala said it feels like being in a fighter plane austin had settled into the copilots seat on the right he could see through window panels in the wings leading edge while zavala ran his fingers lovingly over the controls austin went to explore the rest of the plane the flight engineer sat in front of an impressive array of instrument gauges about ten feet behind the copilot facing the rear he would have been unable to see out austin thought the layout was awkward but he was impressed by the headroom and the small bunkroom head and kitchen that indicated the plane was built for longrange missions he sat at the bombardiers seat and stared out the window trying to picture himself high above the bleak siberian landscape then he crawled into the bomb bays zavala was still in the pilots seat hands on the controls when austin returned to the cockpit find anything back there he asked austin its what i didnt find austin said the bomb bay racks are empty no canister bombs not even a water balloon he smiled at zavala fallen hopelessly in love with the old girl have we zavala grinned lasciviously a case of love at first sight older women have always appealed to me ill show you some thing theres still life in this baby his fingers played over the instrument console the bank of dials and gauges in front of them glowed red shes all gassed up and ready to go austin said with disbelief zavala nodded she must be hooked up to the generator theres no reason this stuff wouldnt still work its been cold and dry here and she was maintained in mint condition until they deserted this joint speaking of the joint lets take a look around zavala reluctantly left the cockpit they climbed down from the plane and walked around the interior perimeter of the hangar the space was obviously planned to service the plane efficiently within easy reach of the aircraft were hydraulic lifts and cranes test equipment fuel and oil pumps joe stopped to marvel at a wall hung with tools they were as clean as surgical instruments austin poked his head into a storage room he glanced around and called for zavala stacked from floor to ceiling inside the room were dozens of shiny cylinders like the one they had discovered floating in the water off the baja austin carefully lifted a cylinder from the stack and felt its weight this is much heavier than the empty can back in my office anasazium the unerring austin homing instinct kurt said with a smile you have to admit this is what we really came all this way to find i suppose so but i can see why martin fell in love with that plane out there lets hope it isnt a similar case of fatal attraction were going to have to figure out what to do next zavala eyed the contents of the storeroom well need something bigger than the maule to move this stuff austin said its been a long day lets get back to nome we can call in for reinforcements im not crazy about the way we came in lets see if we can find another door they walked around in front of the flying wing again the plane was positioned so that it pointed toward the broad side of the hangar facing onto the airstrip they tried a door that would have led to the outside but it was overgrown with vegetation and wouldnt open a big section of wall apparently moved up and down like a garage door austin saw a wall switch marked door since they had good luck with the generator he gave it a yank the hum of motors filled the air then came loud creaks and rattles and the squeal of metal against metal the motors strained to move the door against the vegetation that had taken over on the outside but finally it ripped free and rumbled to a clanking stop in fully open position it was near midnight and the sun had partially set casting the tundra in a leaden light the two men walked outside and turned around as they gazed at the strange craft resting in what buzz martins father had called its hideyhole they heard an intrusive clatter from behind them they turned to see a large helicopter dropping out of the sky like a raptor the helicopter made a pass over the float plane then stopped and hovered a short distance away it did a threehundredsixty spin in place there was a flash of light from the front of the chopper and the float plane disappeared in a blinding explosion of yellow and red flames a cloud of black smoke billowed from the funeral pyre that had been an air craft seconds before and the tundra was lit up for hundreds of yards i think we just lost the deposit on our leased plane zavala said finished with its first line of business the chopper swiveled so that its nose pointed toward the hangar austin and zavala had been dumbfounded in the seconds since the helicopter arrived and began its deadly work now austin realized how vulnerable they were they dashed for the open door as the chopper leaped forward white bursts of flame flowered from the guns on either side of the speeding aircraft and the bullets threw up geysers of water and mud as they stitched their way to ward the two running figures they ducked inside and austin hit the door switch there was another grinding of motors and machinery and slowly the door began to close the chopper landed a few hundred yards away armed men in dark green uniforms spilled out and advanced on the hangar with automatic weapons unfortunately zavala had left his machine pistol in the plane austins bowen revolver filled his hand and he let off a couple of shots to give the attackers something to think about then the door clanked shut and the gunfire became barely audible wed better bolt the back door austin said sprinting for the rear of the hangar where they had come in they ran along the corridor to the cellar hole the bolt was rusted away and they couldnt secure the door hoping their attackers were as stupid as they were bold they dragged one of the mattresses out of a bunkroom and covered the ventilation hole in the floor in a makeshift pitfall then they dashed back and secured the door leading directly into the hangar all was silent but they had no illusions about their security it was obvious that the attackers didnt want to damage the flying wing but a few wellplaced rockets or ex plosives could peel back the hangars metal walls like a sardine can who are those guys zavala said trying to catch his breath there was a sharp hammering on the metal skin of the hangar as if someone were testing it for weakness austins coral green eyes swept the hangar from one end to the other if im not mistaken were about to find out chapter the siege was announced with an earsplitting explosion that echoed off every square inch of steel as if the metalenclosed space were a huge bell shards of hot metal and pieces of burning vegetation rained down from a hole high in the front face of the hangar a patch of daylight opened but the thick cushion of vegetation and earth that had grown up around the hangar over the decades had dampened the explosion austin looked up at the ragged hole and said theyre aiming high so they wont hit the plane probably hoping to spook us theyre doing a good job zavala said im spooked in fact zavala looked anything but spooked he would have retired from the special assignments team long before if he succumbed easily to panic his eyes calmly scanned the interior of the hangar looking for something that would give them even the slightest edge the reverberations from the blast had barely faded when there was a loud hammering on the steel door at the rear of the hangar so much for our pitfall austin said they raced behind the plane and grabbed tool chests benches and storage lockers anything they could move stacking them against the door the makeshift barricade would stall deter mined attackers only a few minutes they were more concerned with the front of the hangar where the main firepower appeared to be concentrated as they darted under the planes fuselage zavala glanced up at the jet engines the yawning black exhausts protruding from the rear of the wing resembled cannon barrels lined up on a fort he grabbed austin by the arm look kurt those jets are pointed right at the rear wall if we got the engines started we could give those guys coming in the back door a warm welcome austin calmly walked under the planes fuselage seemingly oblivious to the steady thumping from the rear of the hangar he stood in front of the plane where the wings thin edge came to a point his hands on his hips and gazed up at the cockpit even if we somehow made it out of the hangar wed have no place to go maybe ive a got better idea he said thoughtfully working with austin had given zavala insight into the un orthodox way his partners mind functioned he caught austins drift instantly youre kidding he said austins eyes were deadly serious you said the systems are working if we can crank up the engines why waste fuel toasting a few bad guys when we can simply leave them in the dust admit it he said catching the gleam in zavalas eye youve been itching to fly this thing there are a lot of ifs here the engines may not start or the fuel could have gone sour zavala said he listed a few more un desirable possibilities but from the way the corners of his mouth were turned up in a smile it was clear he was discounting disaster austin had tapped into joes desire to fly every type of air craft that had ever been built i know it wont be easy those trucks over there were probably used to tow the plane outside where it could take off we wont have that luxury were going to have to make a running start id be happy if we could make any kind of start those engines havent been cranked over in fifty years zavala said just keep thinking about the scene in that woody allen movie where the volkswagen starts right up after centuries in a cave should be a piece of cake zavala grinned this isnt exactly a volkswagen he protested although it was clear from his excitement that the idea had gone beyond a matter of life and death it was now a challenge first ill have to see if i can get this old buggy cranked up were not going anywhere with those flat tires well have to get air into them i saw some air hoses but we dont have much time well start with the two outside tires under the fuselage and the nose wheel well get to the inside tires if we can they quickly uncoiled the air hose and fed the air into the tires the rattle of the compressor was slightly slower than their heartbeats austin stopped pumping air and listened the pounding had stopped although the back door was still firmly secured austin didnt like it the halt could mean the attackers were preparing to blow the door he didnt have time to worry another horrendous explosion came from the front of the hangar the blast sent them both sprawling facefirst onto the oilsoaked concrete floor a second rocket had been fired to open up the gap below the first hole smoke from burning vegetation hovered near the ceiling were out of time austin yelled well have to stop for air at a gas station leave the belly hatch open as soon as i hear the engines cranking ill hit the wall switch while the doors on its way up ill run for the plane dont forget to detach the plane from its power umbilical zavala said as he ran for the belly hatch austin took up his post next to the wall with his hand on the switch he knew the odds were against them but hoped american wartime engineering would prove its worth zavala scrambled into the pilots high seat and peered through the plastic cowling the dials blurred as he stared at the strange instrument panel this was going to be a fast learning curve he blinked his eyes and relaxed trying to remember the procedure he used to fly the catalina trying not to look at every dial only for needles that indicated trouble all systems checked out fine the centerline console between the two pilot stations contained the radio and the fuel and air speed gauges his fingers flew over the switches and the dials lit up like a pinball machine display holding his breath he hit the ignition switches for the engines one at a time the turbines began with a throaty rumble and worked themselves up to a high pitch satisfied that the engines were working he waved at austin who stood next to the wall austin waved back as zavala jumped into the copilots seat and adjusted the fuel feed austin hit the wall switch a thin line of daylight began to shine under the rising door kurt dashed beneath the plane and disconnected the umbilical then using the sledge hammer he had set aside for the task he knocked the wooden wheel chocks away austin groped his way through the smoke pulled himself into the plane and battened the hatch the hot exhaust from engines blasted the rear of the building anything not nailed down was blown against the wall by the tremendous force or melted by the intense heat the noise was so loud it was almost impossible to think and hot choking fumes and smoke filled the hangar austin crashed gasping for breath into the copilots seat shes all yours pal zavala gave him the thumbsup sign shes a little cranky but not bad for an old gal zavalas eyes were glued on the rising door he kept the brakes set and pushed each throttle forward until they were at full power if they had the luxury of a full crew zavala would have relied on a flight engineer to tell him if the engines were running the way they should but the best he could do was rely on his experienced ear it was impossible to distinguish individual engines but the unbroken roar was a good sign the door seemed to catch for an instant then it pulled free he released the brakes and the plane lurched forward zavala pushed the throttle levers smoothly forward and let out a rebel yell as the power from thousands of pounds of thrust pushed the plane out into the open but his jubilation was shortlived the big green helicopter was directly in the line of takeoff the helicopter had landed after blasting the second hole and now it sat on the tundra about a half mile away men in dark green uniforms were outside the hangar preparing for an assault when the wing emerged like a monstrous black bird hatching from its egg their surprise quickly turned to terror and they scattered like leaves before the wind the helicopter pilot was leaning against the chopper smoking a cigarette when he saw the monstrous aircraft bearing down in his direction he jumped back into the helicopter where he was faced with an immediate decision he could stay where he was and be rammed he could fire his rockets or guns at the oncoming wing and hope that his hurried shots would hit the slim fuselage or he could head for the sky austin was distracted by the sound of a giant woodpecker rapping on the fuselage zavala thought it was one of the engines falling apart and was only partially relieved when austin said theyre shooting at us are you going to fly this rig or drive it all the way to nome because of the unusual position of the instrument panel zavala could not see all the gauges aiming for the helicopter to keep the plane on a straight line zavala shouted at austin to call out the air speed forty austin yelled zavala was surprised at how quickly the plane accelerated despite its huge mass and the partially deflated tires he had to maintain a firm hand on the controls to keep the nose from lifting sixty the landing gear hit the water of the shallow lake but the planes speed continued to increase eighty even as austin called out zavala felt the lightness on the wheel indicating that the plane was near takeoff speed one hundred zavala counted to ten then pulled back on the wheel both men practically drove their feet through the floorboards as they pressed on imaginary accelerators the massive plane seemed to leap into the air zavala had assumed that they would easily clear the helicopter but once the plane was up at an angle all he could see was blue sky the helicopter pilot had finally chosen a course of action but it was the wrong one he mistakenly assumed that the huge batshaped aircraft lumbering across the permafrost in his direction would hit the chopper on the ground he lifted off about the same time zavala got the wing airborne from his level in the copilots seat austin had a clear view of the chopper rising into the path of the flying wing unaware of the impending collision zavala had been concentrating on the takeoff from his reading zavala knew that the wings rapid acceleration would blow the covers off the slowmoving landing gear the gear had been designed for slowermoving propellerdriven planes and took too long to retract pilots compensated by retracting the gear while the plane was only a few hundred feet off the ground and pulling the nose up at a fairly steep angle if not for the unusual maneuver the aircraft would have collided instead they missed by several feet but there was a horrendous metallic crunch as the landing gear grazed the whirling rotors the rotors disintegrated and the helicopter seemed to hang for a moment before it plummeted back to the ground where it exploded in a ball of flame the wing wobbled from the impact but zavala got it back under control he kept climbing before he leveled off at five thousand feet zavala realized he had forgotten to breathe he puffed out his cheeks and gulped air into his lungs so quickly the effort made him dizzy austin asked him to do a damage check he did a visual inspection of the plane from his perch the fuselage was riddled with bullet holes scraps of aluminum continued to peel off and a second engine was starting to smoke she looks like a wedge of swiss cheese but shes a tough old bird he put the flying wing on a course that would take them into the vicinity of nome there was no need for altitude and he kept the plane at a few thousand feet after a while he started laughing whats so funny compadre austin called out from his perch where he was fiddling with the radio i was just wondering what theyre going to say when we come tooling in all shot up with a fiftyyearold stealth bomber simple well say we were flying a mission and were kid napped by a ufo zavala shook his head thats almost as unbelievable as the real story he said the arrival of the bulletriddled flying wing had been the biggest event to hit nome since the original iditarod word of the odd shaped black plane that had landed without landing gear on a sheet of foam had spread like wildfire and before long it was surrounded by curious townspeople austin had called sandecker from the airport to report his findings and to request some muscle power sandecker got in touch with the pentagon and learned that a special operations team was on maneuvers at elendorf air force base outside anchorage the team was ordered to fly into nome after austin briefed the special ops leaders at a strategy session they decided to send the helicopter ahead to scope the situation out with a quick followup by the main assault force it was something of a coincidence that austin and zavala returned to the secret blimp base in a pave hawk helicopter the sixtyfourfootlong aircraft was the same kind of helicopter that patrolled area the topsecret location that ufo buffs say holds alien remains and a spaceship that crashed in roswell new mexico the helicopter had come in alone at a speed of a hundred and fifty miles per hour flying low over the tundra to avoid detection as it came up on the base it made one pass over the watercovered airstrip scouring the ground with its motion and vibration sensors finding no signs of life the chopper went into a wide circling pattern on board was a crew of three eight heavily armed special operations troops and two passengers austin and zavala who scanned the skies expectantly they didnt have long to wait a fixedwing plane appeared from the direction of the sea and passed over the base the fourengine turboprop combat talon was especially designed for inserting a special operations team under any conditions dark objects dropped from the fuselage and within seconds blossomed into twentysix parachutes the paratroopers floated down into the low hills behind the flying wing hangar the helicopter continued to circle the plane brought in the first contingent as part of a onetwo punch if the initial assault group ran into trouble the chopper would blast the opposition from the air with its twin mm guns and land the backup force where it was most needed several tense minutes passed then the voice of the team leader on the ground crackled over the choppers radio all clear okay to come in the hawk darted in over the scattered wreckage of the ski plane and the blackened hulk of the chopper that had been dispatched by the flying wing it landed directly in front of the hangar whose massive door gaped wide open like a patient in a dentist chair a contingent of camouflageclad special ops troops armed with mal assault rifles and grenade launchers each man a killing machine of formidable power guarded the outside while another squad explored the hangars cavernous interior the helicopter troops poured out of the side doors as soon as the wheels touched the ground and joined their comrades then the two numa men got out and walked into the hangar the space seemed even more enormous now that it no longer housed the flying wing blackened and charred debris left over from their takeoff was scattered throughout the hangar the rear walls which had felt the full force and heat of the jetengine exhaust were scorched and the paint blistered they picked their way around the smoldering rubble and went directly to the storeroom the door was open the canisters were gone empty as a bottle of tequila on a sunday morning zavala said i was afraid of this they must have brought in another chopper they walked outside to get away from the choking smoke inside the hangar the talon had found a flat dry strip of land and was landing about a quarter of a mile away they headed to ward the wreckage of the helicopter hoping it could provide clues to the attack blackened corpses were visible in and around the charred hulk the officer who had led the first wave came over and shook hands i dont know why you wanted us to come along he said jerking his thumb at the downed chopper you boys did fine on your own we didnt want to press our luck austin said the officer grinned this place is as clean as a whistle we checked the underground bunker as you suggested found a couple of dead guys at the bottom of the shaft you told us to watch out for you know anything about that austin and zavala exchanged a surprised glance joe and i set up a little tiger trap for our guests we never expected it to work oh it worked remind me never to come in your back door without knocking ill remember sorry you had to go through all this trouble for nothing austin said you can never be too careful you know what happened on atka and kiska austin nodded he knew the story of the two aleutian is lands occupied by the japanese after us troops were bloodied in the invasion of one island they planned a massive invasion of kiska only to find the japanese had quietly slipped away the night before the same thing happened here the chickens have flown the coop the officer surveyed the twisted wreckage again and let out a low whistle id say you clipped their wings austin shook his head unfortunately there was something back in that hangar they took with them thanks anyway for all your help major my pleasure drills are fine but there is no substitute for a mission where people might actually be shooting at you ill see if i can arrange that next time the officer smiled a tight smile from the looks of that old bomber you brought into nome id say youre probably a man of your word with that operation a bust austin and zavala accepted the offer of a ride to elendorf where they might be able to catch a flight to washington when the planes stopped at nome to re fuel zavala volunteered to use his considerable charm and the numa bank account to soothe the owner of the leased maule that had been destroyed he was coming out of the lease office after agreeing to buy the company a new plane when he saw austin striding toward him with a serious expression on his face he handed zavala a piece of paper this just came in zavala scanned the message from numa gamay and francesca kidnapped trout injured come home immediately s without exchanging a word they hustled across the tarmac toward the waiting talon chapter paul trout lay in his hospital bed with his chest and nose wrapped in bandages cursing him self repeatedly for not being more alert to danger when he and gamay were dodging the arrows of headhunters their survival instincts were at their sharpest but their return to the socalled civilized world had dulled their senses they had no idea that the eyes watching from the van parked outside their georgetown townhouse were far more savage than any they had encountered in the jungle the letters painted on the vans doors identifying it as be longing to the district of columbia department of public works were still tacky to the touch inside the vehicle was the latest in communications and electronic snooping equipment bent over the tv monitors and speakers that probed the brick walls of the house were the kradzik brothers watching and waiting did not come easily to the twins in bosnia they used a brutally simple routine they picked their target of choice then they and a couple of truckloads of paramilitary troops pulled up to the house in the dead of night bashed the door in and dragged the terrified occupants from their beds the men were taken away and shot the women raped and murdered the house systematically looted getting into the trouts townhouse presented a different problem the house was on a back street but it was well traveled with pedestrians and car traffic the street had been even busier than usual since the trouts returned the discovery of a white goddess by two numa scientists and their dramatic escape from bloodthirsty savages was the stuff of an adventure movie after cnn released the story a number of journalists had tracked down the trouts enterprising reporters and photographers from the washington post the new york times the national television networks and a handful of disreputable supermarket tabloids had gathered outside their door gamay and paul took turns politely telling them that they were trying to catch up on their rest and would answer all questions at a press conference to be given the next day at numa headquarters they referred inquiries to the numa press section the photographers took pictures of the house and the tv people gave reports with its facade as a backdrop eventually the river of attention dribbled to nothing the same news coverage that had fascinated people around the world drew interest from more malignant sources paul was in his secondfloor office typing a summary of their experiences into a report for numa in the downstairs study francesca and gamay discussed how to put the desalting project back on track as quickly as possible after francesca announced that she had delayed her return to sao paulo the trouts had offered her a haven from the hordes of media attention when the doorbell rang gamay sighed heavily it was her turn to answer the summons from the fourth estate the tv crews were the most persistent and as gamay expected she was greeted at the door by a reporter with note book in hand and a cameraman with his steadicam balanced on a shoulder a third man carried a flood lamp and a metal suitcase gamay resisted her first urge which was to tell these characters to buzz off instead she forced a smile and said you evidently havent heard about the press conference tomorrow morning excuse please said the reporter no one tell us about conference thats funny gamay thought the public affairs people at numa were well plugged into the press scene they were well respected by reporters for being up front with the amazing stories that came out of numa this guy in the illfitting suit was nothing like any of the coiffed pretty boys who read the news he was short and stocky his hair cut down to the scalp al though he was grinning his face was feral and thuggish besides since when had the networks been hiring news readers with thick eastern european accents she looked past him expecting to see a tv truck with disk antennas sprouting from the roof but saw only a city work van sorry she said and went to close the door the grin disappeared and he shoved his foot in startled at first by the move gamay quickly recovered from her surprise she put her weight against the door until the man winced with pain she drew her elbow back preparing to stiffarm the intruder in the face with the palm of her hand but the other two men lunged forward and threw their shoulders against the door she was knocked aside and went down on one knee she quickly regained her footing by then it was too late to run or fight she was looking down the barrel of a pistol in the hand of the socalled reporter the cameraman had put his video gear aside he came over and grabbed her by the neck until she could barely breathe then he slammed her up against the wall so hard that a nineteenthcentury gilded mirror crashed to the floor anger surged in gamays breast the mirror had cost weeks of hunting and thousands of dollars she put her fear aside and brought her knee up into the mans crotch the grip on her throat loosened for a second before he came at her again with a killers gleam in his eyes she braced herself but the reporter yelled something and the attacker retreated he drew his finger across his adams apple in an unmistakable gesture gamay glared at him which was all she could do but the significance of his sign language was not lost on her she knew instinctively that hed slit her throat in an instant her instincts were right on the mark although the kradziks preferred to work on their own from time to time they needed help from some old compatriots when brynhild sigurd had eased the exit of the kradzik brothers from bosnia they had insisted that she do the same for ten of the most loyal and coldblooded of their followers together they called themselves the dirty dozen after the american movie of the same name but this group made the movie misfits look like cub scouts collectively they had been responsible for the death maiming torture and rape of hundreds of innocent victims the men were scattered around the world but could be assigned to an assassination or called in for an operation within hours since going to work for gogstad they had approached their work with unbridled enthusiasm francesca had heard the mirror crash and come from the study into the narrow front hall the man in the suit barked a command and before francesca could make a move she was seized and shoved against the wall next to gamay the man who had been carrying the suitcase popped it open and drew out two czechmade skorpion machine pistols the phony reporter opened the front door and a moment later another man stepped inside gamays first thought was that he looked like an over grown troll although the day was warm he wore a long black leather jacket over a black turtleneck and slacks and a black militarystyle cap on his head he surveyed the situation and said something to the others that must have pleased them because they leered in response gamay had been around the world for her work and she guessed that the language he spoke was serbocroatian he barked an order and one of the men armed with a skorpion moved down the hallway the folding wire butt tight against his biceps the man peered cautiously into the rooms leading off the hallway which went to the back of the house then continued on his comrade climbed the stairs that led from the first level to the second floor the leatherclad man walked over to the mirror surveyed the broken glass then turned to gamay seven years bad luck he said with a grin that looked as if it had been forged in a foundry who are you gamay said he ignored the question where is husband gamay truthfully told the leather man that she didnt know where her husband was he nodded as if he knew something she didnt and spun her around to face the wall she expected a blow to the head or a bullet to the back instead there was a sharp beesting in her right arm a needle bastards they had jabbed her with a hypodermic she looked over in time to see the syringe plunge into francescas arm she tried to go to the aid of the other woman but her arm went dead within seconds the numbness spread to the rest of her body the room whirled and she felt as if she were hurtling into an abyss paul heard the mirror crash to the floor and from the top of the stairs saw the man throttle gamay he was about to spring from the staircase when the creep in the leather coat came in paul went back into his office and tried to call for help the phone was dead the lines must have been cut he crept silently down a narrow back stairway to the kitchen he kept a revolver in the study but the only way to get to it was along the hallway he saw the two armed men split off one heading upstairs the other coming his way and ducked back into the kitchen he looked around for a weapon knives were obvious but they were messy and wouldnt stand a chance against the ma chine pistol even if he got the upper hand the others would come running to finish him off at the slightest noise he needed someplace where he could dispatch the man with a minimum of racket the last time he and gamay remodeled the house they had sunk a years salary into the kitchen all new oak cabinets had been installed along with a restaurant type stove the biggest change was a walkin cooler whose ceiling was high enough for paul to go inside without bumping his head seeing no alternative he slipped into the cooler and left the door ajar about six inches he unscrewed the light bulb placed it just inside the door and plastered himself into the recess next to the heavy door just in time through the frosted glass he saw the man come into the kitchen his gun ready he stopped and looked around and the open door caught his attention he approached it warily pushed it open with his elbow and stepped inside the toe of his shoe sent the bulb skittering noisily across the wooden floor the gun barrel swung around and his finger tightened on the trigger then the roof fell in on his head his knees buckled and he crashed to the floor trout put down the frozen smoked virginia ham he had used as a club he grabbed the machine pistol and stepped out into the kitchen well aware that he and the women werent home free first he checked the stairs that led from the kitchen to the second floor he could hear the other man moving around up stairs hed deal with that after he made sure gamay and francesca were safe he slowly eased himself into the hallway the machine pistol only gave him limited leverage he didnt want to catch the women in the pistols scattershot spray as he stepped into the hall he saw the other men bending over the prone figures of his wife and francesca he brushed caution aside and moved forward so intent on the scene that he never saw the man come up behind him he felt the cold steel of a knife between his ribs and tried to turn to face his attacker only to have his legs turned to scram bled eggs he fell to the floor smashing his face on the rug and breaking his nose melo had been covering the back door for a possible escape when he saw trout emerge from the cooler seeing blood pool around pauls body he stepped over him and went over to pat his brother on the back your suggestion to cover the rear was a good one brother it seems so the other twin said looking at the sprawled figure what should we do with him leave him to bleed to death agreed we can take the women out the back way without being seen he called to the man upstairs to come back down then they carried the unconscious women to a waiting mercedes four wheel drive stuffed them in the back and drove off followed a few minutes later by the fake dpw truck the initial shock of the knife wound had turned to pain and paul regained consciousness for a few moments using every bit of strength at his command he dragged himself to the study where he had a cell phone and called he awoke in a hospital bed his cursing wore him out and he fell asleep again when he awoke he was aware someone else was in the room through gluey eyes he saw two figures standing by his bed he grinned feebly what took you so damned long we hitchhiked with a couple of fighter planes out of elendorf and came east as fast as we could austin said how do you feel the right half of my body isnt so bad but the left feels as if its being pinched by redhot pliers and my nose doesnt feel great the knife missed your lung by this much austin said pinching his thumb and forefinger it will take a while for the muscle to heal good thing youre not a southpaw figured it was something like that any word on gamay or francesca he said apprehensively we think theyre still alive but they were kidnapped by the goons who did this to you the police have checked airports and stations the usual stuff zavala said were going to start our own search the pain in pauls blue eyes was replaced by a look of steely determination he swung his long legs out of the bed and said im coming with you the painful effort made him dizzy and he stopped as his stomach roiled for a few seconds he jiggled the iv tube i may need a hand here fellas dont try to talk me out of this he said catching austins concerned expression the best thing you can do is spring me from the joint hope youve got some pull with the floor nurse austin knew paul well enough to realize he would drag himself from the hospital if he had to austin glanced at zavala who was smiling and knew hed get no help from that quarter ill see what i can do he shrugged in the meantime joe maybe you can get our friend here something more modest than that hospital johnny he said then he turned and headed for the nurses station chapter the mood in the tenthfloor numa conference room was as somber as a crepe hangers convention admiral sandecker hadnt expected trout to attend the emergency meeting given the dire reports from the hospital the lanky ocean geologist looked like warmedover spit but sandecker kept his thoughts to himself nothing he could say would dissuade paul from joining the hunt for gamay and francesca sandecker flashed trout a reassuring smile and looked around the table flanking paul in case he fell out of his chair were his numa colleagues austin and zavala the fourth figure at the table a slightly built narrowshouldered man whose heavy horn rimmed glasses gave him a professorial air was numa operations director rudi gunn second in command to the admiral sandecker checked his watch wheres yaeger his voice carried a hint of impatience yaegers special computer skills bought him latitude with the numa dress code but not even the president would dare show up late for a sandecker meeting especially one as important as this hell be along in a few minutes austin explained i asked hiram to check out something that might have a bearing on our discussion a thought had been fluttering around like a butterfly inside austins skull he had allowed himself a few hours of sleep after coming in from alaska the rest must have refreshed his mind on his way in from virginia he caught the elusive notion in an imaginary net seconds later he was talking to yaeger on his cell phone the computer whiz was driving in from the fashionable section of maryland where he lived with his artist wife and two teenage daughters austin quickly outlined his idea asked yaeger to follow through and said he would cover for him at the meeting sandecker got right down to business we have a mystery on our hands gentlemen two people have been kidnapped and one attacked by unknown assailants kurt would you bring us up to date austin nodded the dc police are investigating every possible lead the city van was found abandoned near the washing ton monument the vehicle had been stolen a few hours earlier no trace of fingerprints was found all the airports and train stations are being watched with help from paul the fbi put together a composite of the leader of the gang and its being circulated with interpol i suspect they will get nowhere sandecker said the people were dealing with are professionals the job of finding gamay and dr cabral will be up to us as you know rudi has been out of the country on assignment ive kept him current as best as i could but it might help if you quickly gave us a chronological summary of the situation austin was prepared for the question this thing began ten years ago with the failed attempt to kidnap francesca cabral her plane crashed in the venezuela rain forest and it was assumed she was dead fastforward ten years joe and i quite literally run into a dead pod of gray whales off san diego the whales died after being exposed to extreme heat emanating from an underwater facility off baja california in mexico the facility blew up while we were investigating it i talked to a mexican mobster who was a front for the real owner a california consulting firm called the mulholland group the mobsters lawyer confirmed that mulholland in turn is part of a transnational conglomerate named the gogstad corporation the mobster and his lawyer were assassinated shortly after they talked to us rather spectacularly as i recall sandecker noted thats correct these werent exactly driveby shootings the murders were well planned and the hit men used sophisticated weaponry that would suggest wellorganized assassins with extensive resources said gunn who had once served as director of logistics at numa and was well acquainted with the difficulties in pulling together any operation we came to the same conclusion austin agreed it was the kind of organization and resources that could be provided by a big corporation so motivated gogstad austin nodded im not sure i understand the significance of the name gogstad gunn said the only connection i could find was the company logo it shows the gogstad viking ship that was discovered back in the s i asked hiram to see what he could dig up on the company there isnt a lot even max had problems finding information but basically its a huge conglomerate with holdings worldwide its run by a woman named brynhild sigurd a woman gunn noted with surprise interesting name brynhild was a valkyrie one of the norse maidens who carry the fallen heroes from the battlefield to valhalla sigurd was her lover you dont suppose that was her real name do you we dont know much about the woman i know megacorporations can be ruthless in their business dealings gunn said with a shake of his head but were talking about gangland methods here thats the way it seems austin said he turned to zavala joe could you fill rudi in on your findings kurt called me in california with the gogstad lead zavala said i talked to a newspaper reporter from the los angeles times he knew gogstad quite well in fact he was heading an investigative team looking into the corporation he told me they were doing a story on what he called the water pirates it would reveal how gogstad is cornering the worlds supply of water i cant believe its possible for one company to control the worlds water gunn said i was pretty skeptical too zavala replied but from what the reporter told me its not that farfetched gogstads companies have legally taken over the privatization of the colorado river water is going from public to private ownership on every continent gogstad has muscled out the competition the re porter said that there have been deaths and disappearances worldwide over the past several years the missing or dead were all people who competed with gogstad or opposed gogstad takeovers gunn whistled softly that story should cause quite a stir when it hits the headlines that wont happen any time soon the paper killed the gogstad story for no reason the other three members of the investigative team have disappeared and my friend has gone into hiding youre sure theres no mistake gunn said with alarm zavala slowly shook his head there was silence in the room then gunn spoke theres obviously a pattern then he said let me think about this gunns unprepossessing appearance was misleading his graduation at the top of his class in the naval academy was no accident he was a sheer genius and his analytical skills were uncanny he cradled his chin between his thumb and forefinger and lost himself in deep thought for a moment something has changed he said abruptly what do you mean rudi sandecker said their methodology has shifted gears lets assume that our basic premise is right and gogstad is behind all this murder and mayhem according to joe they have acted quietly people quite simply vanished or were killed in socalled accidents this changed with the murders of the mexican and the crooked lawyer i believe the word the admiral used to describe them was spectacular austin chuckled those were love pats compared with the attack in alaska joe and i had to contend with an allout military assault the attack on my house was on the heavyhanded side too trout added i think i see where youre headed with this rudi sandecker said paul how soon did word get out that dr cabral was alive almost immediately trout said dr ramirez called caracas from the helicopter that rescued us the venezuelan government lost no time making the news public i would guess that cnn was broadcasting the story around the globe while we were still in the rain forest events accelerated shortly thereafter sandecker said the situation is clear to me the catalyst was the news that francesca cabral was alive her emergence from the grave meant that her waterdesalting process was again within the realm of possibility with her expertise once more available all that was needed was the rare substance that makes her process work dr cabral again planned to give her discovery to the world the people who opposed this simply picked up where they left off ten years ago only this time they succeeded austin said okay that explains francescas kidnapping trout said but why did they take gamay this outfit does nothing at random austin replied gamay may have been lucky she might have been killed if they didnt have need of her is there anything else you can remember about the kidnapping paul i didnt see much after the first few minutes they were in the house the leader the guy in black leather spoke with an ac cent i cant place his pals had heavier accents sandecker had been sitting back in his chair fingers tented in front of him listening to the conversational byplay he snapped upright these hoodlums are the small fry we must go right to the top we must find this woman with the wagnerian name who runs gogstad shes a ghost austin said nobody even knows where she lives she and gogstad are the key sandecker said firmly do we know where their headquarters are they have offices in new york washington and the west coast there must be a dozen scattered across europe and asia quite the hydra sandecker said even if we knew where their central office was it wouldnt do much good to outward appearances gogstad is a legitimate business theyll deny any accusations we make hiram yaeger slipped quietly into the room and settled into a chair sorry he said i had to run some stuff off for the meeting he looked expectantly at austin who took the cue i was thinking about something hiram showed me earlier it was a hologram of a viking ship the same ship is the centerpiece of the gogstad corporate logo i reasoned that this ship must have some significance to be given such a prominent place i asked hiram to start playing around with gogstad to go beyond the scant corporate stuff max dug up for us yaeger nodded at kurts suggestion i asked max to go back and brush over the historical and maritime links i had pretty much ignored before tons of material on the subject exist as you might imagine kurt had said to look for a california connection perhaps with the mulholland group max picked up an interesting newspaper story a norwegian designer of antique ships had come to california to do a replica of the gogstad ship for a wealthy client who was the client austin asked the article didnt say but it was easy to track down the norwegian designer i called him a few minutes ago and asked about the job he had been sworn to secrecy but it was years ago and he didnt mind saying he built the replica for a big woman in a big house big woman he meant tall a giantess sounds like a scandinavian folktale whats this about the house he said it was like a modernday viking compound on the shores of a large lake in california surrounded by mountains tahoe that was my conclusion a big viking house on the shores of lake tahoe shouldnt be too hard to find already done max linked up to a commercial satellite yaeger passed around copies of the satellite photos there are some big places around the lake trophy homes resorts and hotels but nothing like this the first picture showed the icy blue waters of lake tahoe viewed from a high altitude as if it were a puddle in another photo the camera had zoomed down on a dot alongside the lake enlarging the details so that the sprawling building and the nearby helicopter pad were clear does this hovel have an owner austin said i was able to tap into the local assessors office and tax data base yaeger grinned if he had a tail hed be wagging it its owned by a realty trust that doesnt give us much to go on how about this then the trust is part of the gogstad corporation sandecker looked up from the photos he had kept his famous temper in control throughout the meeting but he was furious at the kidnapping of one of his favored staffers and the wounding of another he was enraged too after all she had suffered at the abduction of the lovely dr cabral once again a discovery with lifesaving implications was being kept from the world thank you hiram he glanced around the table with cold commanding blue eyes well gentlemen he said with a voice as sharpedged as a razor we know what we have to do chapter the men watching francesca were either twins or some mad cloning experiment gone bad the most terrifying thing was not their repulsiveness it was their absolute silence they sat a few yards away one on either side leaning on the backs of chairs that had been turned around they were identical in every way from their trolllike ugliness to their preference for black leather she tried not to look at the dark redrimmed eyes under beetling brows the metallic dental work and the bloodless pallor of the psychopathic faces they were looking at her hungrily but there was nothing sexual in their leers this was not the ignorant savagery she was used to with the chulo this was pure animal lust hunger for blood and bone she glanced around the strange circular white room with the plain walls and uncomfortably cool temperature at its center was a computer console she was thinking how absurdly big the furniture was and wondered whether the outsized chairs like the low temperature were a psychological ploy to make people brought there feel small and inadequate she could be anywhere in the world francesca had no idea how she had come to this sterile chamber she was vaguely aware of being moved from one place to the other at one point she thought she heard jet engines but she was injected with drugs again and slipped off into black unconsciousness she had seen no sign of gamay and that worried her too she had felt a pinprick in her arm and awakened quickly as if she had been injected with a stimulant as her eyes fluttered open she saw the twins no one had spoken for several minutes she was grateful when the door hissed open and the woman entered and waved the grotesque twins away francesca wondered if she had blundered into a freak show or the set of a fellini movie she knew the reason for the out sized furniture the woman dressed in the dark green uniform was a giantess settling into a big sofa she smiled pleasantly but without warmth are you well dr cabral what did you do with gamay your numa friend she is comfortably quartered in her room i want to see her the woman lazily reached over and tapped her computer screen and gamay appeared on the monitor lying on her side on a cot francesca held her breath then gamay stirred tried to rise only to fall back onto the cot she has not been given the drug antidote as you were she will sleep it off and awaken in a few hours i want to see her in person to make sure she is all right later perhaps the answer was uncompromising the woman touched the screen and it went dark francesca looked around where exactly is this place thats not important why have you brought us here the woman ignored her question did melo and radko frighten you do you mean the human mushrooms who just left she smiled at the comparison a clever metaphor but you would do better to compare them to poisonous toadstools de spite your bravado i can see the fear in your eyes good they should frighten you during the ethnic cleansing campaign in bosnia the kradzik brothers personally killed hundreds of people and planned the deaths of thousands they destroyed entire villages and engineered numerous massacres if not for me they would be sitting in the prisoners dock at the world court in the hague charged with crimes against humanity there is no war crime they did not commit they have absolutely no conscience no morals no sense of remorse for anything they do maiming and killing are second nature to them she paused to let her words sink in am i making my point yes that you have no scruples yourself about hiring murderers exactly their murderous character is precisely why i hired them it is no different from a carpenter buying a hammer to drive nails into a board the kradzik twins are my hammer people arent nails some are some arent dr cabral francesca wanted to change the subject how do you know my name i have known and admired your work for years dr cabral in my opinion your fame as one of the worlds leading hydro engineers easily eclipses your more recent notoriety as a white goddess you know who i am but who are you my name is brynhild sigurd although your name is better known than mine we are both accomplished in our chosen field the movement of the earths most precious substance its water youre a hydroengineer i studied at the finest technological institutions in europe after i finished my studies i moved to california where i started my consulting company now one of the biggest in the world francesca shook her head she thought she knew everyone in the water engineering fraternity ive never heard of you i prefer it that way ive always operated behind the scenes im nearly seven feet tall my stature makes me a freak subject to derision from those very much inferior to me despite her predicament francesca felt a slight pang of empathy i had my share of harassment from idiots who dont like the idea of a woman excelling in their field i never let it bother me perhaps you should have in the long run my resentment at having to hide from the public has been an asset i directed my anger retooling it into an unstoppable ambition i acquired other companies all with an eye toward the future there was only one fly in the ointment the cold smile again you dr cabral ive never considered myself an insect ms sigurd my apologies for the label but the analogy is precise some years ago it became clear to me that in time the demand for the worlds water would exceed the supply and i wanted to be the one with her hand on the tap then i heard about your revolutionary desalting process if you were successful it would torpedo my carefully laid plans i couldnt allow that to happen i considered making you an offer but i had studied your personality and knew i could never get through your impractical altruism i re solved to prevent you from giving the process to the world francesca felt the heat rising in her cheeks her voice came out in a hiss you were the one behind my attempted kidnap ping i had hoped to persuade you to work for me i would have set you up in a laboratory to perfect your process unfortunately my plans went awry and you disappeared into the amazon everyone thought you were dead then i read with admiration about your adventures among the savages how you became their queen i knew that we were both survivors in a hostile world francesca had gotten her initial fury under control and her reply was in measured tones what would you have done with the process if i had given it to you i would have kept it secret while i consolidated my grip on the worlds water i was going to give my findings to the world free of charge francesca said disdainfully my goal was to relieve suffering not profit by it laudable but selfdefeating with you apparently dead i set up a plant in mexico to duplicate your work it was destroyed in an explosion francesca almost laughed she knew the reason for the blast and was tempted to throw it in this womans face instead she said im not surprised working with high pressure and extreme heat can be tricky no matter the main lab here was working on another aspect of the process then came the happy announcement of your escape from the amazon again you disappeared but i knew of your ties to numa weve been watching the trouts since they returned too bad youre wasting your time once again i dont think so its not too late to put your talents to work you have a strange way of recruiting employees your first kidnapping attempt was the reason i spent ten years in the wilderness now you drug and kidnap me again why would i want to do anything for you i can offer you unparalleled support for your research a dozen foundations would be glad to fund my work even if i were inclined to work for you which im not there is a major obstacle the desalting process involves a complex molecular metamorphosis that works only in the presence of a rare substance i know about anasazium my supply of the material was destroyed in the blast at the mexican facility too bad francesca said the process cant work without it so if youll be so kind as to allow me to leave youll be pleased to know that i have all the anasazium youll need to develop your process when i heard of your re turn i acquired a substantial amount of the refined material just in time i might add numa had dispatched part of its special assignments team on a similar mission now i can carry out my full plan to control the worlds fresh water you alone would appreciate the simple brilliance of my scheme dr cabral francesca feigned a reluctant agreement as if she were secretly pleased at the compliment well of course as a water scientist i would be curious about such an ambitious endeavor the world is entering one of the most serious droughts in its history this dry spell could last a hundred years if the past is any indication the first impacts have been felt in africa china and the middle east europe is beginning to experience a thirst that cannot be quenched i simply plan to accelerate the process of drying out the world excuse my skepticism but thats absurd is it brynhild replied with a smile the united states is not immune the great desert cities of the southwest los angeles phoenix las vegas draw their water from the colorado river which is now under my control they rely on a tenuous network of dams reservoirs and river diversion the water sup ply hangs by a thread any disruption in the water supply would be disastrous youre not going to blow up a dam francesca said with alarm nothing so crude with their regular water supply at the breaking point the cities have been depending more and more on private sources gogstads straw corporations have been buying up water systems everywhere we can create a water shortage wherever and whenever we want to simply by turning the handle of the tap then we will sell only to the places that can afford it the big cities and the hightech centers what of those who cant afford it theres an old saying in the west water flows uphill to money the wealthy have always been assured of a cheap water source at the expense of others under my plan water will no longer be cheap we will be doing this on a worldwide scale in europe and asia south america and africa it will be capitalism at its purest the market will determine price but water isnt a commodity like pork bellies youve been in the jungle too long globalization is nothing more than the promotion of monopolies in communication agriculture food or power why not water under the new international treaties no one country owns its water resources anymore they go to the highest bidder and gogstad will be the highest bidder you will deny water to thousands who will be forced out of the market there will be famine and chaos in countries that cant afford to buy water chaos will be our friend it will prepare the way for gogstads political takeover of weakened governments think of it as water darwinism the strong will survive the icy blue eyes seemed to bore into francescas skull dont think this is retribution for all the slights i have received because of my stature i am a businesswoman who realizes the proper political climate is necessary to do business this has required no small investment on my part i have spent millions building up a fleet of water tankers that would transport water from places that have it towing it behind them in huge ocean going bags i have been waiting years for this moment i have not dared to move because i feared your process it could destroy my monopoly within weeks now that i have you and the anasazium i can strike within days the entire western half of the country will run out of water thats impossible is it we will see once the colorado river is finished as a supplier the rest of the pieces will fall rapidly into place my company controls most of the fresh water supplies in other parts of the world we will simply turn the faucet off so to speak gradually at first then more forcefully if there are any com plaints we will say that we are producing as much water as possible you know the results francesca said levelly youre talking about turning much of the world into desert the consequences would be terrible terrible for some but not those who control the worlds water we could get any price we ask from desperate people you would soon be exposed as the monster you are to the contrary gogstad will say that we are ready to move water from alaska british columbia and the great lakes to other parts of the world in the tanker fleet i have been building when gogstads beautiful tankers appear off the coast we will be hailed as heroes youre already apparently rich beyond the dreams of many why do you need more wealth this could benefit the world in the long run i will prevent wars from being fought over water apax gogstad imposed by force force will not be necessary i will reward those who bend to my will punish those who dont by letting them wither and die if thats necessary yes you must wonder where your desalination process fits in i assume you would never allow it to spoil your mad plot to the contrary your process is an important part of my scheme i dont intend to keep my tankers at sea forever they are only a stopgap measure while the world builds the fantastic infrastructure that will run water down from the polar ice cap vast agricultural areas that have gone to desert will have to be invigorated with hugescale irrigation no country could afford that whole nations will go bankrupt the better to snatch them up at a fire sale eventually i will build desalting plants using the cabral process but i alone will control their output again to the highest bidder of course now let me present my new offer i will place you in a lab with everything you need at your command if i say no then i will turn your numa friend over to the kradzik brothers she will not die quickly or pleasantly shes an innocent she has no part in this nonetheless she is a nail that must be hammered down if necessary francesca was silent for a moment then she said how do i know i can trust you you cant trust me dr cabral you should know that you can never trust anyone but you are intelligent enough to see that you are far more valuable to me than your friends life and that i am willing to trade as long as you cooperate she lives do you agree this woman and the deeds hatched in the dark recesses of her brilliant mind revolted francesca brynhild was obviously a megalomaniac and like so many of her ruthless predecessors was impervious to the sufferings of the innocent francesca had not survived ten years among savage headhunters bloodsucking bats and stinging insects and plants without inner resources she could be as machiavellian as the most devious living in the jungle had given her the quiet ferocity of a stalking jaguar since her escape she had been consumed with the desire for revenge she knew it was wrong and misplaced but it sustained and helped maintain her grip on her sanity she pushed her thirst for vengeance aside for the moment this woman must be stopped suppressing a smile she bowed her head in submission and with a feigned catch in her voice said you win i will help in developing the process agreed ill show you the facility youll be working in youll be quite impressed i want to talk to gamay to make sure she is all right brynhild punched a button on the intercom two men in dark green uniforms appeared francesca was relieved to see that they were not the kradziks take dr cabral to see our other guest brynhild ordered then bring her back to me she turned to francesca you have ten minutes i want you to get to work immediately flanked by the guards francesca was led through a labyrinth of passageways to an elevator that dropped several levels they stopped in front of an unmarked door opened by punching out the code on a keypad the guards stood outside while francesca entered the small windowless room gamay was sitting on the edge of her cot she looked groggy like a fighter who has taken one too many punches she brightened and smiled when she saw francesca she tried to rise but her legs buckled and she had to sit again francesca sat on the cot and put her arm around her friends shoulders are you all right gamay brushed her straggly hair aside my legs are wobbly but ill be fine what about you they gave me a stimulant ive been awake for some time your drugs will wear off soon did anyone mention what happened to paul he was up stairs when the kidnappers broke in francesca shook her head putting aside her worst fears gamay said do you have any idea where we are no our host didnt tell us you mean youve spoken to someone i can thank for these glorious accommodations her name is brynhild sigurd those were her men who kid napped us gamay started to reply but francesca pursed her lips and shifted her eyes from left to right gamay caught the hint they were being bugged and probably watched i only have a few minutes i just wanted you to know ive agreed to work with ms sigurd on my desalting process well have to stay here until the project is complete i dont know how long it will take youre going to work with the person who kidnapped us yes francesca replied with a stubborn tilt of her chin i wasted ten years of my life in the jungle theres a great deal of money to be made but beyond that i believe gogstad has the best chance of bringing my process to the world in an orderly and controlled fashion are you sure this is what you want to do yes im absolutely sure she said the door slid open and one of the guards motioned for francesca to leave she nodded then leaned over and gave gamay a hug then she stood quickly and went off with the guards alone once more gamay pondered what had just happened as their eyes met briefly francesca had winked there was no mistake about it gamay was pleased to think there was more to francescas startling announcement that she was working for the enemy but there were more immediate concerns she lay back on her cot and closed her eyes her first priority was to give her body and brain a rest then she would try to figure out how to escape chapter the man floated high above the cobaltblue waters of lake tahoe suspended from the parasail under a redandwhite canopy that billowed over his head like an oldfashioned round parachute he sat in a reclining skyrider chair attached by a towline to the moving winch boat two hundred feet below the rider clicked on his handheld radio lets go around for one more pass joe zavala who was at the wheel of the boat waved to show that he had heard austins instruction he put the paranautique winch boat into a big slow turn that would take them back along the lakes california side the maneuver gave austin a sweeping view of the lake lake tahoe is on the californianevada border in the sierra nevada about twentythree miles southwest of reno ringed by rugged mountains that are covered with snow in the winter tahoe is the largest alpine lake in the united states it is more than a mile high more than sixteen hundred feet deep the lake is twenty two miles long and about a dozen miles wide and lies in a fault basin created by ancient forces deep in the earth twothirds of its twohundredsquaremile area is in california at the north end it empties into the truckee river at the south end a river of money empties into the coffers of the highrise gambling casinos at stateline the first white man to discover the lake was john c freemont who was on a surveying mission to english speakers the washoe indian name for the lake daow which means much water sounded like tahoe and the pronunciation stuck as the parasail brought austin around in a wide arc he concentrated his attention on a particular stretch of shoreline and the dark forest rising behind it imprinting the image on his mind he would have preferred to use a video or still camera in stead of his imperfect memory but traffic this close to gogstads lair was sure to come under close scrutiny any undue interest on his part such as pointing a camera lens in the wrong direction would set off alarms he drifted past a long pier that jutted from the rocky shore a powerboat was tied up at the pier behind a boathouse or storage shed the black rocks rose at a sharp angle then leveled off into a heavily wooded natural tableland several hundred yards back from shore the land rose again in thick forest the towers roofs and turrets peeking above the tall trees reminded austin of the castle ramparts in a grimm fairy tale austins eye was drawn by sudden movement several men in dark clothes had run out to the end of the pier he was too far away to see details but he wouldnt be surprised if pictures of him parasailing wound up in a gogstad family album the pier disappeared in his wake as the winch boat towed him another mile south when they were safely out of view he gave zavala the okay to haul him in the winch pulled the skyrider in like a boy reeling in a kite the reclining chair splashed down and floated in the water austin was grateful he wasnt using the old harnessstyle rig which would have dunked him in the lake even in summer the water temperature was in the sixties see anything interesting zavala asked as he helped austin back into the winch boat theres no welcome mat on the doorstep if thats what you mean i think i saw a welcoming committee on the dock they came charging out the minute we did our second fly by we were right about the tight security they had assumed the compound would be well guarded and that there would be no point sneaking around reasoning that the obvious was often the most innocuous they had flashed a wad of bills and their numa ids and persuaded the owner of the parasail and the winch boat to spare his equipment for a few hours they implied that they were investigating the mafia which was not implausible given the nearness to the gambling casinos since business was off and he stood to make more in the deal than he earned in a week he went along with the deal austin helped zavala stow the skyrider and parasail then he opened a waterproof bag and dug out a sketch pad and pen apologizing for his draftsmanship which was really quite good he drew several sketches of what he had seen from the air he had brought along the satellite photos yaeger provided and com pared the sketches to them at the top of the bluff the staircase from the dock connected with a walkway this in turn widened into a road that led to the main complex a spur from the road shot off to a helicopter pad a full frontal waterborne assault is out of the question he said cant say im disappointed i havent forgotten our shoot out in alaska zavala said i had hoped to see down into the water in the old days the lake was as clear as crystal but the runoff from all the development around the shores has clouded up the water with algae growth zavala had been studying another photo after their strategy meeting at numa headquarters austin called up a noaa satellite photo of lake tahoe the shot showed the water temperature of the lake in colors the lake was almost entirely blue except for one spot along the western shore where the red shade denoted high temperatures the heated water was practically under the gogstad pier it was similar to the heat pulse in the ocean off the baja coast pictures dont lie zavala said theres always the possibility of a hot spring austin frowned okay say youre right that theres an underwater facility like the one in the baja theres one thing i dont understand were talking about a desalting plant this is a freshwater lake i agree it doesnt make sense but theres only one way to find out for sure lets head back and see if our package has arrived austin started the engine and pointed the winch boat toward south lake tahoe they skimmed over the intense blue waters and before long they were pulling into a marina a lanky figure stood at the end of a finger pier waving at them paul had stayed on shore his wound was still too tender to allow him to bounce around in a boat as they pulled up to the slip he grabbed the line with his good hand and tied them off your package has arrived he announced its in the parking lot that was fast austin said lets take a look he and zavala set off toward the parking lot wait paul said austin was eager to check out the delivery well fill you in later he said over his shoulder paul shook his head cant say i didnt try to warn you he muttered the flatbed truck was pulled up off to the side the object on the trailer was about the shape and size of two cars one be hind the other it was covered with padding and dark plastic austin had moved in for a closer look when the passenger door of the truck opened and a familiar figure stepped out jim contos skipper of the sea robin strolled over with a grin on his face uhoh zavala said jim austin said what a nice surprise what the hell is going on kurt the grin had vanished it was an emergency jim yeah i figured it was an emergency when rudi gunn called in the middle of sea trials and told me to ship the seabus out to tahoe asap so i just tagged along on the ride in from san diego to see who was on the receiving end austin noticed a picnic table and suggested they sit down then he laid out the situation using the photos and drawings as visual aids contos sat silently through the entire explanation his dark features growing graver with each added detail so there you have it austin said when we saw that there might be only one way in we checked on the nearest submersible to do the job unfortunately it happened to be the one you were testing why play blind mans bluff contos said referring to daring covert underwater operations during the cold war why not just go in first of all the place has better security than fort knox we checked on land access the complex is surrounded by razorwire fence rigged to set off alarms if you so much as breathe on it the perimeter is heavily patrolled there is only one access road in and out it runs through dense forest and is heavily guarded if we send a swat team in with guns blazing its likely someone would get hurt beyond that what if were wrong about the whole thing that the women are not being held there and whats behind all those fences is perfectly legal you dont think thats the case do you no i dont contos gazed out at the sailboats peacefully gliding across the lake then turned to paul who had joined them at the table do you think your wife is in there yep i have every intention of getting her out contos noted trouts arm in its sling id say you could use an extra hand and your friends here will need some help launching the seabus i designed it zavala said im well aware of that but you havent been the one testing it so you dont know the quirks for instance the batteries are supposed to be good for six hours they barely make it past four from what you say this facility is quite a way from here have you given any thought to how youre going to get it to the launch point austin and zavala exchanged an amused glance as a matter of fact we have already lined up a delivery sys tem austin said would you like to see it contos nodded and they got up from the table and walked through the parking lot to the dock the closer they got to the water the more puzzled was the expression on contoss face used to numas stateoftheart equipment he was looking for something like a hightech barge fitted out with cranes there was nothing like that wheres your delivery system he said i think i see it coming in now austin said contos looked out at the lake and his eyes grew wider as the oldfashioned paddlewheel tour boat made its way in their direction the vessel was painted red white and blue and deco rated with bunting and fluttering flags youre kidding he said youre going to launch from that it looks like a waterborne wedding cake it is pretty festive the old girl makes the trip from one end of the lake to the other every day no one gives it a second look anymore its the perfect cover for a covert operation dont you think joe ive heard they serve a pretty good breakfast aboard zavala said with a straight face contos stared grimly at the approaching vessel then with out warning he wheeled about and headed for the parking lot hey captain where are you going austin called after him back to the truck to get my banjo chapter francesca stood on the deck of the viking ship taking in its long sweeping lines its graceful upturned bow and stern the painted square sail even with the thick planking and massive keel it seemed almost delicate in its construction she looked around at the huge chamber with its vaulted ceiling the flaming torches and high stone walls hung with medieval weapons and she wondered how anything so beautiful could be in a setting so bizarre and ugly standing by the tiller brynhild sigurd mistook francescas silence for appreciative awe its a masterpiece isnt it the norsemen called this a skuta when they built the original nearly two thousand years ago it was not the biggest of their boats like the dragon ship but it was the fastest i have had her duplicated in every way from the oak planking to the spun cows hair that was used as caulking she is more than seventynine feet long and sixteen feet wide the original is in oslo norway an earlier replica actually sailed across the atlantic you must be wondering why i went through the trouble to have her built and placed in the great hall some people collect old stamps others old cars theres no accounting for tastes this goes beyond a collectors whim brynhild took her hand off the tiller and came over to stand before francesca who shuddered at their physical proximity although brynhilds towering body was hard and muscular the menace she projected went beyond the physical she seemed capable of reaching up and wringing the power from a lightning bolt i chose this ship as the symbol of my vast holdings because it embodies the viking spirit it was sailed by those who seized what they wanted i come here often for inspiration so shall it be with you dr cabral come i will show you where you will be working francesca had been escorted back to brynhilds aerie after the brief visit with gamay brynhild had led the way through a bewildering maze of passageways that reminded francesca of being on a cruise ship they were unguarded at all times but the thought of escape never crossed francescas mind even if she were able to disable the giant woman an unlikely prospect she would have become lost in minutes and she suspected the guards were not far away now they got into an elevator that dropped with kneebending swiftness the door opened on a room where a monorail car awaited brynhild motioned for francesca to get into the front then got in the back sitting in a space especially made for her tall form their weight activated the accelerator the tram went through an opening and sped along a lighted tunnel when it seemed the car would go rocketing out of control the computers controlling its speed decelerated it to a comfortable stop in a room very much like the one they had just left this room too had an elevator but unlike the more conventional box on a cable its transparent plastic walls were egg shaped there were seats for four people of ordinary stature the door hissed shut and the elevator passed through blackness then descended into a deep blue watching the fluid interplay of light and shadow through the transparent walls francesca realized they were sinking into water the blue became darker until all at once it was as if they were caught in the beam of a searchlight the door opened and they stepped out francesca could hardly believe her eyes they were in a brightly lit circular space hundreds of feet across a curving roof arched overhead the exact size of the room was difficult to estimate because it was filled with thick pipes coils and vats of all sizes a dozen or so whitefrocked technicians moved quietly among the conduits and tanks or were bent over computer monitors well what do you think brynhild said with obvious pride its incredible the awe in her voice was real where are we at the bottom of the sea the giantess smiled this is where youll do your work come ill show you around francescas scientific mind quickly made order out of her chaotic first impression although the pipes went off at different angles there was definitely a scientific organization to the mad ness no matter which way the pipes went they eventually led toward the center of the room this controls the various conditions that affect the core material brynhild said pointing to the blinking lights on a control board this underwater facility stands on four legs two of the support legs double as intake pipes and the other two as out flow since we are on a fresh body of water we first infuse the liquid we pump in with salt and sea minerals from those containers it is indistinguishable from actual seawater they walked toward the center of the chamber it was occupied by a massive cylindrical tank some twenty feet across and ten feet high this must contain the anasazium francesca said thats right the water is circulated around the core then returned to the lake through the other two supports they walked back to the master control console well how close are we to duplicating the cabral process francesca examined the gauges refrigeration electrical cur rent heat monitoring all good you were close very close we have subjected the anasazium to heat cold and electrical current but with only limited success im not surprised the sonic component is missing of course sound vibrations you have the right idea but the process wont work unless the material is subjected to a certain level of sound waves in con cert with the other forces its like removing the cello from a string quartet ingenious how did you come up with that technique it was simply a matter of thinking in unconventional terms as you know there have been three main methods of desalting be fore this in electrodialysis and reverse osmosis electrified water passes through membranes that remove the salt the third method is distillation which evaporates the water the way the suns heat turns the ocean to vapor all require tremendous expenditures of energy that made the cost of desalting prohibitive my method changes molecular and atomic structure in the process it creates energy and becomes selfsustaining the combination of forces must be exactly right the process wont work if it is off by a hair now that youve seen it how long do you think it would take to modify this facility to your standards she shrugged a week three days brynhild said flatly why the time limit the gogstad board of directors is due to meet here i am bringing people in from all parts of the world i want to give them a demonstration of your process once they have seen it work they will go home and we can implement the greater plan francesca thought about it a moment and said i can have it working for you within twentyfour hours thats quite a difference from a week i work faster with incentive there is a price youre in no position to bargain i realize that but i want you to let your prisoner go she was drugged she has no idea where she is or how she got here she could never identify or cause you any trouble you keep her prisoner to make sure i make this plant work once the process is working you have no need of her agreed brynhild said i will let her go as soon as you show me the first ounce of pure water what guarantees can you give me that you will stand by your word none but you have no alternative francesca nodded i will need certain equipment and un questioning assistance anything you want brynhild said she waved over several technicians dr cabral is to have whatever she requests do you understand she barked an order and another technician came over carrying a battered aluminum suitcase brynhild took it from the man and handed it to francesca i believe this belongs to you we found it at your friends house i must leave you now call when you are about to run a test as francesca ran her hand lovingly over the suitcase that contained the original working model for her process brynhild strode off toward the elevator within minutes she was back in her turret room she had summoned the kradzik brothers on a portable phone and they were waiting for her when she returned after all these years of waiting and disappointments the cabral process will soon be ours she announced with triumph how long one of the twins asked it should be up and running within twentyfour hours no said the other twin the light glittering on his metal teeth how long before we can have the women to play with she should have known the brothers were programmed like malevolent computers to carry out torture and murder brynhild had no intention of letting francesca live after she had delivered the process part of her treachery stemmed from her envy of francescas scientific prowess and beauty part was pure vindictiveness the brazilian woman had cost her in time and money she had nothing in particular against gamay brynhild simply didnt like loose ends her smile brought the already low temperature in the room down another ten degrees soon she said chapter the night shift guard was having a cigarette at the end of the valhalla pier when his relief man arrived and asked for a report the swarthy exmarine squinted out at the sunsparkled lake and flicked the butt into the water its been busiern a onelegged man at a kickass contest he replied in an alabama drawl choppers coming and going all night the relief guard a former green beret looked up at the whupwhup sound of an approaching helicopter looks like more guests are arriving whats going on the alabaman said i dont hear much working nights and sleeping days bunch of big shots are coming in for a meeting we got the full crew on and security around the compounds tight as a ticks ass he glanced toward the lake theres the ol tahoe queen right on time he brought his binoculars up and focused on the stern wheeler as it crawled toward the north end of the lake the tahoe queen looked like something out of showboat the boat was painted white like vanilla frosting with light blue trim that marked the divide between the enclosed first and second decks two tall black smoke stacks were located at the front the paddle wheels that churned up the placid lake water and gave the boat its forward motion were painted fireengine red the top deck rail was overhung with red white and blue bunting flags fluttered in the breeze hmm the guard said surveying the deck not many tourists aboard today the guard would have been less sanguine if he knew the same coralgreen eyes that had scrutinized him the day before from the parasail were watching him again austin stood inside the pilothouse that was perched like a cigar box on the top for ward deck he was studying the guards and assessing their state of alertness austin could see that the men were armed but their lackadaisical posture suggested a bored attitude the boats captain a weathered lake veteran from emerald bay was at the helm want me to drop the queens speed down a couple of knots the captain asked the paddle wheeler was a charming anachronism built more for comfort than for speed any slower and it would stop austin thought id keep it steady captain launch shouldnt be a problem he checked out the pier again and saw that one of the guards was leaving and the other ducked into the shade of a shelter austin hoped the man would take a nap he extended his hand thanks for your cooperation captain hope we didnt disappoint your regular customers by chartering your boat at the last minute i just drive this old girl back and forth no matter whos on it besides this is a lot more exciting than a boatload of day trippers the captains excitement had come at a price the boat line was reluctant to lose a days revenue and it took deep pockets and highlevel calls from washington to persuade it to charter the paddle wheeler for official business glad to help make your day austin said got to go just keep steaming after you drop us off how will you get back were working on that austin said with a grin austin left the pilothouse and descended to the spacious salon on the lowest deck on a normal day the salon would be crowded with tourists eating and drinking as they took in the magnificent scenery only two people were in the salon joe and paul zavala was already in his blackhooded viking pro military dry suit and trout was going over a checklist austin lost no time suiting up then he and zavala went through an opening in the side of the boat that was used to let passengers on and off they would have stepped directly into the lake if not for a wooden platform slung alongside the stern wheeler the raft floated on ocean salvage tubes elongated pontoons made of tough nylon fabric and capable of lifting several tons of weight the assembly had been cobbled together in the late hours of the morning contos was on the raft making sure they hadnt made any major mistakes in hastily putting the thing together hows she look austin said not quite as good as the one huckleberry finn used on the mississippi contos said with a shake of his head but shell do in a pinch i think thanks for your unqualified endorsement of our building skills zavala said as he stepped off the raft contos rolled his eyes look guys please try not to lose the seabus its tough as hell to run a test program without something to test without its protective covering the seabus looked like a fat plastic sausage it was a small workhorse version of a tourist sub working in florida designed to take crews to and from underwater jobs of moderate depth it carried up to six passengers and their gear in a transparent pressure hull of acrylic plastic the hull rested on fat round skids that carried the hard ballast trim drop weights and thrusters higher on the sides were additional ballast tanks and compressed air containers the external structures were attached to the pressure hull by a tough ring frame the twoseat cockpit was at the front in the aft section was the electrical hydraulic and mechanical heart of the sub and an air lock that allowed divers to go in and out while the seabus was submerged trout stuck his head out of the stern wheeler were coming up on target he said checking his watch three minutes to launch were as ready as well ever be austin said how about you paul finest kind cap he said with a lopsided grin trout was far from fine despite his stolid yankee facade he was worried about gamay and desperately wanted to go on the mission he knew that with his bad arm he would just get in the way austin convinced trout that they needed someone with a level head above water to call in the troops in case the situation got dicey a crane had been brought in to lift the submersible from the truck onto the raft the stern wheeler left early in the morning before the waterfront got busy the boat hunkered offshore until it was time to make its usual crossing even with its heavy load the raft pitched and yawed as it was towed along austin and zavala had to brace themselves as they knelt at the rear each man above one of the lift bags on signal they simultaneously stabbed the rubber pontoons with their dive knives the air shot out in a loud hiss that rapidly turned to a flatulent bubbling squeezed between the water and the raft the pontoons rapidly deflated as the back of the raft settled into the water they un hooked the tie lines securing the seabus then they scrambled through the aft hatch made sure all was tight and settled into the cockpit the front of the raft tilted upward at an angle then as the lift bags deflated it leveled out and began to sink it was a primitive launching system for such a sophisticated craft but it worked the seabus maintained its buoyancy as the raft sank and was pulled out by the forward motion of the paddle wheeler the submersible danced in the larger boats wake and sank into the foam kicked up by the stern paddles as they gained depth the water changed from bluegreen to blueblack austin adjusted the ballast and the sub attained neutral buoyancy at fifty feet the batterydriven motors whined as zavala goosed the throttle and pointed the submersible toward shore they were lucky to have no current pushing against the round almost blunt bow of the submersible and could keep it at a steady ten knots within half an hour they had covered the five miles to land as zavala steered austin consulted the sonar screen the rocky shore continued its vertical drop into the water for more than a hundred feet before jutting out in a wide ledge the sonar picked up an extremely large object resting on the ledge directly under the floating pier moments later they looked up and saw the long shape of the pier and its floats silhouetted against the shimmer of surface light austin hoped his earlier assessment was correct that the guard was too numb from boredom to notice any disturbance the submersible might cause zavala took the seabus down in a shallow spiral while austin alternated between radar and visual checks level out fast austin said zavala responded instantly and the submersible circled like a hungry shark were we getting too close to the ledge not exactly take her out and go down another fifty feet the seabus moved away from the shore and spun around so they were facing a ledge madre de dios zavala said last time i knew the astrodome was still in texas i doubt youll find any dallas cowgirls inside that thing austin said its similar to the one that went kapop in the baja hate to admit it but you were right as usual just lucky i dont know how lucky you are weve got to get inside that thing theres no time like the present i suggest we take a look at the underside with a nod of his head zavala cranked up the throttle and put the seabus into a glide that took them directly under the massive structure the surface was made of a translucent green material that emitted a dull glow zavalas hyperbole not with standing the facility would have been an impressive engineering feat even on dry land like the baja operation this structure also rested on four cylindrical legs around the perimeter there are openings in the outside legs austin said probably like the ones in mexico used for intake and exhaust zavala brought the submersible in close to a fifth support at the very center of the structure he switched on the subs twin spotlights no duct openings hello what have we here he nudged the seabus closer to an oval depression in the otherwise smooth surface of the support looks like a door still no welcome mat though maybe they forgot it austin said what say we park the bus and pay a neighborly social call zavala dropped the seabus lightly onto the ledge next to the support leg they pulled on their air tanks and the headsets for their divelink communicators austin tucked his big bowen and some spare ammunition into a waterproof fanny pack the pack held a mm glock to replace the machine pistol zavala lost in alaska austin crawled into the snug airlock first flooded the chamber then opened the outer hatch minutes later zavala joined him outside the seabus they swam to the support leg and rose up the thick cylinder where they hung on to hand bars on either side of the door to the right of the tight seam was a panel en cased in clear plastic were two large buttons one red and the other green the green one was glowing they hesitated she might be connected to an alarm zavala said echoing austins own thoughts i was wondering the same thing but why would they bother the neighborhood around here isnt exactly swarming with burglars we dont have a lot of choice zavala said go for it austin pushed against the glowing button if an alarm went off they didnt hear it a section in the support leg slid silently aside to reveal an opening shaped like a mouth wide open in a yawn zavala gave austin the okay sign and swam in first austin was right on his fins they were in a chamber shaped like the inside of a hat box a metal ladder hung down from the ceiling on the wall was a duplicate of the switch that opened the door austin pushed the glowing green button he accidentally nudged the pack with their weapons and it fell through the opening in the air lock forget it he said anticipating zavalas question we dont have time the outer door closed and a ring of lights flicked on inside the chamber was quickly pumped dry and a circular hatch popped open in the ceiling still no sign that their presence had been noted all was quiet except for the hum of distant machinery austin pulled himself up the ladder and poked his head through the hatch then he motioned for zavala to follow and climbed the rest of the way they were in another larger circular room several dark green dry suits hung from the wall air tanks were stacked on shelves a large cabinet held various specialized tools austin removed his headset mask and tank and picked up a longhandled brush with stiff steel bristles they must use this stuff to clean the intake ports out there the openings would get clogged up with algae otherwise zavala went over to a door in the curving wall and pointed to another redgreen switch im beginning to feel like a monkey in one of those intelligence tests where the chimp presses a button for food not me austin said a chimp would be too smart to be in a place like this on austins signal he hit the green button the door opened and they stepped into a room with four walls the room contained shower stalls and shelves austin removed a plastic wrapped packet from a shelf and opened it inside was a white twopiece suit made of a light synthetic material without further conversation they got out of their dry suits and quickly pulled the white uniforms over their thermal underwear austins distinctive silverplatinum hair made him stand out from the crowd so he was glad to see that each packet held a tightfitting plastic cap how do i look he said aware that the suit wasnt made to accommodate his wide shoulders like a large and unsavory white mushroom exactly the image i was trying for lets go they were in a cavernous chamber with a high curving roof pipes and conduits of varying widths crossed the space the hum they heard earlier was so loud it almost hurt their ears the sound seemed to be coming from everywhere bingo austin murmured softly zavala said reminds me of a scene from that movie alien i wish these were aliens austin said a whiteclad figure unexpectedly emerged from behind a fat vertical duct they tensed and groped for their missing weapons but the technician who was carrying a portable gauge hardly gave them a glance before disappearing into the maze the huge room had two levels divided from each other by metal scaffolding and catwalks they decided to climb above the main floor where they would have a better view of the entire facility and have less chance of running into other technicians they ascended the nearest stairs and made their way toward the center the technicians below were intent on their work and no one looked up from their elevation the facility was even more impressive it looked like a futuristic hive filled with drones we could spend all day searching this place austin said lets see if we can find a guide they descended stairs that took them back onto the main floor and hid behind a large pipe standing before a large console were three technicians the figures had their backs turned obviously engrossed in their task two technicians moved off leaving the third alone with a quick glance to make sure he was unobserved austin swiftly closed on the unsuspecting figure and hooked his thick arm around the persons throat dont make a sound or ill snap your neck he growled then dragged his catch back behind the pipe meet our new guide he said zavala stared at the technician weve already met austin spun the technician around francesca the terror in her face turned to relief what are you doing here the pleasure at seeing francesca overcame austins surprise we had a date remember he said with a grin time and place to be announced francesca smiled through her nervousness calmer now she glanced around and said we cant stay here follow me they wound their way through the labyrinth into a small room furnished with a plain plastic desk and chair i asked for this space so i could work quietly well be safe for a few minutes if anyone comes pretend you know what youre doing she shook her head in wonder how in gods name did you get in here we took the bus austin said wheres gamay this is the desalting facility shes in the main compound they have her in a heavily guarded cell on the first level how do we get there ill show you theres an elevator that takes you from the lab it goes to a tram the car goes through a tunnel to the main compound then an elevator will take you up to her level do you think you can rescue her we wont know until we try zavala said with a slight smile it will be very dangerous you may have a chance though the guards are preoccupied theres some kind of meeting planned you must move quickly before people start coming here what kind of meeting zavala asked i dont know only that its extremely important i have to have this facility up and working by then or theyll kill gamay she glanced out of the office to see if the coast was clear then she led them to the elevator austin thought that she looked exhausted there were black circles under her redrimmed eyes she wished them well and disappeared into the network of pipes wasting no time they stepped into a strange eggshaped elevator the elevator rose through the water to the tram room francesca had described they got aboard the tram car and sped along the tunnel to its terminus from the tram room they stepped into a passageway the elevator door was a few paces away the light over the door indicated that the elevator was moving down do we go naughty or nice zavala asked see if nice works the door opened and a guard stepped out a machine pistol was slung from his shoulder he looked at zavala suspiciously then at austin pardon me zavala said politely could you tell us where to find the woman from numa cant miss her tall with red hair the guard began to raise his machine pistol the move brought austins hamsized right fist crashing into the mans midsection he made a sound like a deflating balloon and his legs went limp i thought we were going to try nice zavala said that was nice austin replied he grabbed the mans arms and with zavala holding the feet they dragged the guard into the elevator zavala brought the elevator halfway to the next floor and locked it in place austin kneeled and lightly patted the guards cheek the mans eyes rolled then popped wide open when he saw austins face were feeling generous today you get a second chance wheres the woman the guard shook his head austin wasnt in the mood for stalling he brought the gun muzzle to the bridge of the guards nose so close that the man looked crosseyed at it im not going to waste any time austin said quietly we know shes on the first level if you dont tell us where she is well find someone who can understand the guard nodded good austin said he pulled the man to a standing position by the scruff of his neck and zavala hit the button for the next floor nobody was waiting for the elevator they pushed the guard out into the deserted hall whats the security like ahead the guard shrugged most of the guards are upstairs taking care of the big shots coming in for the meeting austin was curious about the purpose of the meeting and who the vips were but he was more concerned about gamay he stuck the gun in the guards ribs fetch he said the guard reluctantly led the way down a corridor and stopped in front of a door with a keypad lock he hesitated wondering if he could stall by saying he didnt know the combination but one look at the thunder and lightning on austins brow told him hed better not try he punched out the code and the door opened the room was empty this is her room the guard said he looked worried they pushed him inside and looked around the small room was evidently used as a cell because it could only be opened from the outside zavala went over to the bed plucked some thing off the pillow and grinned she was here the dark red strand he held in his fingers was unmistakably gamays austin turned back to the guard where did they take her i dont know the guard answered sullenly make believe that the next thing you say may be your last words and think very carefully about it the guard knew that austin would shoot him without hesitation im not protecting those creeps he said what are you talking about the kradzik brothers they had her taken to the great hall who are these guys couple of killers who do the bosss dirty work he said with obvious disgust tell us how to get there the guard gave them the directions austin told him to expect a return visit if he sent them on a wild goose chase they left him in the room and locked the door then bolted down the hall to the elevator they didnt know who the kradzik brothers were and they didnt care one thing they could be certain of whatever was planned for gamay couldnt be good chapter the fifty men gathered around the table on the deck of the gogstad ship were dressed in dark business suits rather than cloaks and armor but the scene could have been taken from a thousandyearold pagan celebration torchlight glinted off the sharp metal edges of the medieval armaments lining the walls and cast flickering shadows on the mens faces the theatrical effect was not accidental brynhild had designed the entire chamber as an elaborate stage set with herself as director the gogstad board of directors was made up of some of the most prominent individuals in the world they came from many countries and every continent their ranks included the chief executives of multinational corporations trade representatives whose secret negotiations gave them more power than some governments and politicians past and present who owed their careers to the plutocracies that were the real ruling class in the countries they came from the men represented every race and color but despite the differences in their physical stature and skin complexion they were bound together by a common denominator their insatiable avarice with every disdainful facial expression and gesture they projected the same polished arrogance brynhild stood on the deck of the viking ship at the head of the table welcome gentlemen she said thank you for coming on short notice i know many of you traveled a long way but i assure you the journey will have been worth it she looked from face to face glorying in the greed she saw lurking behind the practiced smiles and the knifing eyes we in this room rep resent the heart and soul of gogstad an invisible government more powerful than any the world has ever seen you are more than a corporate elite you are priests in a secret society like the knights templar pardon me for interrupting your stirring pep talk right at the start said a fisheyed english arms dealer named grimley youre not telling us anything new i hope i didnt just fly six thousand miles to hear you tell us what an extraordinary group this is brynhild smiled the directors were the only people on earth who could talk to her as equals no lord grimley i called you together to inform you that our plans have been drastically accelerated the englishman was still unimpressed his long nose sniffed the air as if he smelled an unpleasant odor you were originally talking of years to gain the monopoly on the worlds water supply that has been changed to months i take it no lord grimley im talking a target date of days there was a low murmur around the table an unctuous smile crossed grimleys face disregard my earlier comment he said please go on id be happy to brynhild said as you know from my monthly reports our plans have been moving smoothly but slowly every day we have acquired another water source but it has taken time to build up our tanker fleet the huge storage bags that would be used to transport water across oceans have been a problem only now has the technology to construct the bags been achieved and most recently our project has elicited interest from the national underwater and marine agency an american real estate baron named howes was the first to pounce on the significance of her last sentence numa how did they come to know about us its a complicated story you will all be provided with reports detailing numas interest suffice it to say for now that their people are very persistent and lucky this is serious said the american first the newspaper investigation now this the newspaper will not be running the story nor will any one else all the investigative records have been destroyed in regard to numa that situation too has been neutralized its still damned worrisome howes said weve spent mil lions keeping our activities secret this whole thing could un ravel in no time i agree wholeheartedly brynhild replied we have done everything possible to preserve our privacy but an operation of this size and duration could not go undetected forever the facade we erected to hide our activities from public view is be ginning to crack it was only a matter of time so im not surprised but it did suggest the need for haste are you saying that you are rushing our plans because of numa no only that there has been a fortunate turn of events a german banker named heimmler was the first to catch on there is only one way the plan can be advanced so dramatically he said with the expression of a boa constrictor presented with a live rabbit you have perfected the cabral desalting method brynhild waited for the buzzing around the table to die down better still she said triumphantly dr cabral is perfecting the process for us cabral the german said i read press reports that she was still alive but alive and quite well she has agreed to work with gogstad since we control the only supply of anasazium at this moment she is in our laboratory where she is preparing a demonstration in a short time i will show you this miracle i spoke to dr cabral before our meeting she said she would be ready in an hour in the meantime you are invited to enjoy the refreshments we have prepared for you in the dining room i must check on transport arrangements and will see you shortly as the directors filed out of the great hall brynhild went to the front entrance of the main complex several dark green suburbans were lined up in front of the spacious porch a driver and armed guard stood next to each vehicle is everything ready she asked the guard standing by the lead vehicle yes maam we can move the guests whenever they are ready to go the underground tram was the fastest way to get to the lab but it was built mainly to shuttle small parties of technicians back and forth it was quicker to transport a large group such as the board of directors in vehicles brynhild left nothing to chance she got in the passenger side of the lead vehicle and ordered the driver to take her to the lake a few minutes later the suv pulled up at the edge of the low hill that overlooked the water she descended a short stairway to the pier and went in side the boathouse the structure was actually a cover for the elevators that serviced the lab she walked past the fast eggshaped lift and into the large freight elevator moments later she was striding across the lab toward the main core there was a discernible air of excitement in the domeshaped structure francesca was working at the control console when she saw brynhild she said i was just about to call you i can perform the demonstration earlier than i anticipated youre absolutely sure it will work i can give you a preview now if youd like brynhild considered the offer then said no i cant wait to see their faces when they observe how our process works francesca ignored the use of the plural possessive in describing ownership of the process im sure they will be surprised brynhild used her small belt phone to order the shuttles to start transporting the directors in less than half an hour the en tire board was gathered in the lab around the core container brynhild introduced francesca there was a murmur of admiration when the lovely brazilian scientist stepped forward even as she smiled at the hardfaced men gathered around her francesca thought how much they resembled hungry reptiles gathered around a water hole she didnt have to remind herself that their quest for more power and money was responsible for her years in the rain forest while she lived with the chulo awaiting rescue possibly millions of people who could have benefited from her work died from thirst francesca had never seen so much evil gathered in one room but she covered her loathing well i dont know how many of you have a scientific background but technical knowledge is not necessary to grasp the basic principle behind what you are about to see while my process is difficult in execution its rather simple in concept desalting methods have been around since the time of the ancient greeks but those techniques always used a physical process heating the water to steam treating it with electricity pushing it through membranes to screen out the salt the way a child sifts through shells at the beach i reasoned that it might be easier in some respects to change the molecular structure of the chemicals in salt water at an atomic and subatomic level the smoothfaced german banker said your process sounds somewhat like alchemy dr cabral thats a very appropriate analogy although alchemy never achieved its goal it set the stage for the science of chemistry like the alchemists i too was trying to transform a base metal into gold in my case it was blue gold water more precious than any mineral on earth i needed a sorcerers stone that would make that possible she turned to the anasazium core contained here is the catalyst that makes the process work the salted water is brought into contact with this material which purifies the water when will we get a demonstration of this miracle said lord grimley if you would step this way she said leading the way to the console her hands danced over the keyboard there was a muffled growl of pumps and the sound of rushing water thats the salt water coming through the main over your heads it is flowing into the container it takes a few minutes francesca herded the group to the other side of the catalytic container she said nothing for several moments as the suspense built then she checked a gauge and pointed to another main this is the outtake pipe that carries the fresh water you can feel the heat produced during the transformation the american said as i understand it that heat can be used to produce energy thats correct right now the water is being pumped into the cold waters of the lake where the heat is dissipated but with a few adjustments this facility could be modified so the heat comes back as power to run the plant there would even be surplus energy that could be exported there was a murmur from the board francesca could almost feel the aura of greed that emanated from the men as they tallied the billions to be made aside from the water by producing cheap energy she went over to a vertical set of coils that hung down from the freshwater pipe at the base of the coil was a tap and beside it a stack of paper cups this is a cooling unit that removes heat from the water she explained turning to a technician she said what has been the quality of the water produced by the process before today brackish at the very best the technician said francesca opened the tap and filled one of the cups she held the cup to the light like a wine connoisseur took a sip then downed the contents a little warm still but quite comparable to any spring water ive had brynhild stepped forward poured herself water and drank it nectar of the gods she said triumphantly the directors pushed their way to the tap like thirstcrazed steers there were cries of amazement with each cup sampled before long everyone was talking at once while the directors gathered around the tap as if it were the fountain of youth brynhild guided francesca away from the babble of voices congratulations dr cabral it seems that the process is a success i knew that ten years ago francesca said brynhilds thoughts were on the future not the past youve instructed my technicians so they can make the process work yes i had to make only a few adjustments in the procedure you were quite close to perfecting the process you know then we would have developed it in time francesca thought about it a moment probably not your process and mine were like parallel lines no matter how close they come they never touch now that i have done what i said i would it is time for you to fulfill your side of the bargain ah yes the bargain brynhild took the radio from her belt and switched it on she smiled her cold blue eyes boring into francescas and said tell the kradzik brothers that the numa woman is all theirs wait francesca grabbed brynhilds muscular arm you promised brynhild easily shook the smaller woman off i also re minded you that i could not be trusted now that you have demonstrated your process your friend is of no use to me she brought the phone up to her ear again her smile suddenly vanished replaced by a frown what do you mean she snapped storm clouds gathered on her wide brow how long ago she tucked the radio in her belt i deal with you later she promised francesca with a military heel spin she marched for the staff elevator francesca was frozen in shock then as brynhilds treachery sank in the fiery anger that had sustained her for ten years was rekindled if gamay were dead it would only make her decision easier to live with with her jaw set in renewed determination she headed back into the labyrinth of pipes chapter gamay was almost relieved when the pair of husky guards came to take her away she was bored to pieces having concluded that the cell was escapeproof un less she could figure a way to blow the door off its hinges she re solved to talk to someone at numa about coming up with james bond gadgets but that would have to wait her only option now was to watch for a chance to run for it once she was out of the cell her heart sank as the guards ushered her through a maze of corridors she would become lost before she went ten feet they stopped in front of a pair of heavy bronze doors at least eight feet high the surface of the doors was cast with mythological scenes the theme was heavy on skulls but for variety there were giants and dwarfs strange monsters fierce horses twisted trees runes and lightning around a central motif a sleek doubleended sailing ship one guard pressed a button on the wall and the doors swung in noiselessly the other guard prodded her into the room with his gun this isnt our idea he said in what sounded like an apology the doors clicked shut and she looked around to get her bearings charming she murmured under her breath she was in an enormous chamber bigger than a football field she could trace its outline by the torches lining the walls of the cavernous space in the center of the room illuminated by four tall braziers was a ship its one square sail unfurled that looked like the twin of the vessel carved on the doors before becoming a marine biologist gamay had been a nautical archaeologist and she knew immediately that it was a viking ship or a very good replica of one she wondered if she were in a museum no she decided it was more like an elaborate crypt maybe the ship served as a sepulchre as was the custom of the norsemen partly out of curiosity but mostly because there was no alternative she began to walk toward the vessel as she made her lonely way across the great hall two pairs of redrimmed eyes observed her progress from the shadows the same eyes had hungrily watched her earlier on a tv monitor as she languished in her cell the kradzik twins had spent hours in front of the screen they had taken in her every physical feature from the distinctive dark red hair to the long slim legs there was nothing sexual in their voyeurism that would have been too natural their interest was purely in inflicting pain they were like a dog trained to balance a treat on its nose until the owner gives the okay to swallow with gamay enticingly within their reach their sadistic urges surfaced gamay and the other woman had been promised to them with brynhild busy in the lab they decided to claim their toy they ordered gamay brought to the great hall the guards obeyed with some reluctance the small army that protected gogstad and occasionally projected its reach as in alaska were all exmilitary men plucked from elite services around the world in their ranks were former french legionnaires us special forces seals red army infantry british paratroopers and other assorted mercenaries it was jokingly said in their barracks that a dishonorable discharge was a minimum requirement to work for gogstad and jail time was worth a bonus they would shoot to kill on order but they considered themselves professionals simply doing their job the kradziks were different everybody knew the stories of massacre and murder in bosnia and there were rumors of their special assignments for gogstad the men also knew of their close ties to brynhild when they were ordered to deliver the prisoner they did so without argument gamay was halfway to the ship when she heard the unmistakable sound of motors starting up the staccato snarl was made even more intense as it echoed off the hard stone walls single headlights appeared to the right and left of the ship and began to move slowly in her direction motorcycles she could see the silhouettes of the riders gamay felt like a deer caught crossing a highway then the motors revved up to a highpitched whine and the motorcycles came at her like twin rockets her eyes went to the sharppointed lances resting on the handlebars the riders came at her like grotesque caricatures of jousting knights just when it seemed the spears would penetrate her midsection the motorcycles swerved off they quickly reversed course and came in behind her she whirled as they flashed by in a precision crisscross they spun around their motors idling and once more the headlights faced her on either side like the glowing eyes of a huge purring cat the kradziks were riding the yamaha dirt bikes that the security guards used to patrol the perimeter of the giant com pound the lances had been borrowed from the weapon collection decorating the great hall the twins were not imaginative men and their activities whether the victim was a teenage girl or an elderly man always followed the same formula intimidate terrorize inflict pain and kill a voice came out from the darkness on the left if you run then from the right maybe we wont catch you fat chance gamay thought she could tell from the voices that she was dealing with the same metalmouthed morons who had broken into her house it was obvious to her they simply wanted a little challenge in their sport she called out let me see you the only sound was the popping idle of the motors the kradziks were accustomed to having victims cower and beg for their lives they didnt know how to deal with questions especially from a defenseless woman curious they edged their bikes closer and stopped a few yards away who are you she said we are death they said as one the short reprieve was over the motors revved the motor bikes reared up on their back wheels the front wheels came down and with a double shriek of burning rubber the bikes shot forward did another crisscross then began to circle they wanted gamay to spin until she became dizzy and collapsed into a helpless blubbering heap she refused to play their game instead she stood her ground with her eyes straight ahead arms tight by her side the wind created by their passes blew choking exhaust fumes in her face it took every measure of selfcontrol not to bolt for it theyd be on her in a second and use their spears to cut her legs out from under her when they saw she had no intention of running they angled in a spear tip came so close that it lacerated the front of her shirt she sucked her stomach in this wouldnt do she began to walk she moved deliberately with measured steps so she wouldnt throw their timing off delighted at the new challenge the riders took turns cutting in front of her pulling their spears away at the last possible second she kept on going her ears filled with the whine of motors she refused to break her stride gamay knew they could kill her any time they wanted to she heard a bike coming in from the right taking a big chance she stopped suddenly the rider misjudged and went wide the bike skidded around in a tight turn but the move threw off the uncanny communication the riders seemed to have and they wheeled around in confusion she ran past the upturned bow of the boat intending to vault onto the deck but she encountered a barrier of overhanging round shields that protected the side above the oar ports she saw why the kradziks had let her get this close to the boat they knew there was no way she could easily climb over the shields the only access to the deck was a ramp near the stern they probably hoped she would run for it she made a motion in that direction and they shot over to cut her off she grabbed one of the shields off the side of the boat then turned and held it in front her back to the boat the twins spun around and came at her with lances leveled the heavy shield made of thick wood braced with iron was designed more for a brawny norseman than a slim woman fortunately gamay was tall and athletic and managed to get her left arm through the straps and hold the shield in front of her just in time tunk the spears hit the front of the shield as one the force drove her back against the side of the boat and knocked the wind from her lungs the bikes peeled off to the left and the right did quick turns and headed back gamay put the shield down on the floor braced her foot against it and pulled out the spears in contrast to the shield they were surprisingly light with thin wooden shafts and slender bronze tips they were probably de signed more for throwing than for jousting she held the spears vertically and the shield at ready with their weapons gone she assumed the brothers were making a feint but there was a blur of motion as a spiked ball whirled at the end of a chain slammed into the shield even with her legs braced she was thrown back and went down on her right knee she managed to keep the shield high in a move that saved her life as a punishing blow from the second rider crunched into the shield and splintered the outer layer of protective wood the brothers had exchanged their spears for maces the weapons developed to smash their way through armor the bikes swooped down on her before she had the chance to stand again the spiked iron balls crashed into the shield the wood protected her from the main shock but disintegrated after the second blow until all that was left were the leather straps and useless frame work she grabbed for a spear and held it at an angle the bikes held off their attack and went back and forth then one attacker came in the spear spun in his direction like a compass needle gamay held her breath at the last second he turned away the other came in from her left she pivoted quickly to face him only to be distracted by another attack on the right it was a classic flanking tactic they were not ready for a full press yet probably just testing to see her reaction one bike passed directly in front of her its rider thinking he was safely beyond the reach of the spear instead of jabbing gamay brought the spear back on her shoulder and hurled it at the rider he was moving fast her aim was too low the spear hit the spokes of the front wheel the force of the wheel shattered the shaft but not before the skinny knobbed tire turned at a sharp angle the bike jackknifed and the rider flew over the handlebars the bike skidded along the floor leaving a trail of red and white sparks gamay saw him hit the floor and lie still the second motorcycle halted its attack and the rider pointed his headlight at the still form he dismounted but he knew even before he crouched down beside the twisted body that his brother was dead he had felt his brothers fear and pain as his neck snapped then came a moan that rose to an agonizing scream a chill went up gamays spine as the remaining kradzik brother began to howl like a wolf she edged toward the rear of the boat hoping that if she made it to the deck shed find another weapon the brother saw her move he straddled his bike in an instant she held her spear out straight as he came in from the side she felt the spear jerk then heard a clink of metal he had chopped the spear tip neatly off with a short handled battleax he stopped and held the ax high above his head with both hands then he came for her she ran for the stern of the boat he caught up in an instant and crashed his motorcycle into the back of her legs knocking her down pain shot up from her knees and elbows as they smashed against the hard floor but she had more to worry about a figure was standing over her my brother is dead he spoke haltingly as if he were waiting for a cadenced answer from his twin you killed now i will kill you i will start with legs one by one then your arms with his black leather pants and sleeveless jacket he looked like an executioner his teeth gleamed as he grinned in anticipation gamay tried to roll out of the way but he put his boot on her ankle and she cried out as the ax came up there was a whirring sound and he grunted in surprise his free hand reached up to feel the shaft of a crossbow bolt protruding from the side of his head but he was already dead by then the gleam disappeared from the red rimmed eyes and he keeled over gamay rolled out of the way as the falling ax clanked onto the floor she heard quick footsteps strong arms were picking her up and she saw zavalas familiar grin then austin appeared he was holding an old crossbow in his hands are you okay austin asked nothing a good skin transplant wont cure she saw that joe was carrying the gun he had borrowed from the guard not that im ungrateful but why play william tell when you had that thing this throws quite a spray of bullets zavala said its great for cutting down a full assault but not very good for a precision sniper shot i would have backed kurt up if he missed he knelt beside the dead twin you were supposed to hit the apple on top of his head next time ill aim higher austin said tossing the crossbow aside she gave them each a peck on the cheek nice to see you even if i have to endure your dumb wisecracks austin inspected the dead man near the motorcycle it looks like you were doing pretty well on your own i was about to go to pieces gamay said wondering how she could joke about her near dismemberment where are we lake tahoe tahoe how did you find me well explain after we pick up francesca can you walk ill crawl on my knees to get out of this dump nice out fits she said eyeing their white caps and suits is that what got you past the guards at the door there werent any guards i guess they didnt want to be responsible for daryll and daryll truth is we blundered in here we saw you playing a losing game of tag with your friend i grabbed a crossbow off the wall and watched as you set him up beautifully for a shot austin took a pistol from one of the dead men what say we saddle up before the posse comes gamay nodded and started to limp toward the doors protectively flanked by the two men the doors opened and brynhild stepped in she was alone but that didnt make her any less imposing as she strode across the hall she barely glanced at the dead bodies as she came over and stood before them muscular legs spread wide apart like tree trunks her hands on her hips i take it this is your handiwork she said austin shrugged sorry about the mess they were fools if you hadnt killed them i would have they disobeyed my orders and defiled this sacred place still i know how hard it is to get good help these days not as hard as you think theres no shortage of people who like to kill how did you get in here we walked in the front door what is this place its the heart and soul of my empire you must be the elusive brynhild sigurd austin said thats correct and i know who you are mr austin and your friend mr zavala weve been watching you since you visited our facility in mexico it was thoughtful of you to honor us with your visit dont mention it you must let us know who your interior decorator is what do you think joe early addams family or late transylvanian i was thinking more like munster modern the boatshaped coffee table is a nice touch you will learn the woman said that boat symbolizes the past the present and the glorious future austin laughed an appropriate symbol that boat isnt going anywhere and neither is your empire you numa people are becoming tiresome i was just telling joe the same thing before you arrived we dont want to wear out our welcome if youll excuse us well be on our way saddle up guys zavala who was in the lead tried to step around brynhild out of habit he flashed his trademark smile brynhild was a freak he reasoned but she was still a female the famous zavala charm was lost on the giantess she reached out and grabbed him by the shirt shook him like a terrier with a rat then with her great strength threw him onto the floor zavala quickly re gained his feet ever the gentleman when it came to women of any size or age he smiled again i know how you feel but this isnt a good way to end our relationship brynhild replied with a backhand slap across his face joe staggered back a few steps and wiped the blood that was trick ling from a corner of his mouth brynhild cocked her right fist for another blow austin moved in to protect joe he was watching brynhilds hands so when she lashed out to the left leg in a classic kickboxing maneuver he was caught by surprise her boot smashed into his chest he felt ribs crack from the tremendous force even before he slammed against the floor with an impact that rattled his teeth seeing austin fall removed all of zavalas inhibitions against striking a woman that makes two sucker punches he said softly joe had financed his way through the new york maritime college by boxing professionally as a middleweight he won most of his fights many by knockouts he had gained weight since college but still managed to keep down to a fighting trim of one hundred seventyfive pounds he was five foot ten which gave brynhild a height advantage of about a foot she probably outweighed him by fifty pounds none of it fat brynhilds kick had put her in a good position to unload a roundhouse right aimed at removing zavalas head from his shoulders zavalas old ring instincts were coming back he saw the punch coming and ducked as the right fist grazed the top of his head and then he drove a left hard into brynhilds midsection the effort almost cost him a broken wrist but it threw off his opponents timing she threw a long loose left that caught air tucking his chin in and bringing his hands up he tried a threepunch combo that had decked more than one opponent in his college days he followed up a quick left jab with a short right cross and a left hook the right missed but the left hook caught brynhild solidly in the jaw her eyes went glassy but only for a second she stepped back as he moved in and shot a hard overhand right to the heart that took his breath away while he sucked in air she got past his lowered guard and clouted him in the midsection zavala absorbed the blow with his hard stomach muscles and swung a right and a left aimed at her jaw both missed brynhild had been surprised by joes quick and skillful reaction but now that she had his measure she stood off and used her superior height and reach to pound him with the long artillery zavala guessed her strategy and tried to move in for an uppercut to her chin but each time she lobbed haymakers at him while staying safely out of reach his left eye was partially closed and his nose was bleeding he threw a long overhand left that caught brynhild in the throat but it cost him another stinging punch to the head in return in spite of her size she was as fast as any middleweight he had ever seen the old ring aficionados used to say that a good big man can beat a good small man any day zavala hoped the same truism didnt apply to a big woman he kept doggedly on his timing completely off throwing soggy punches that caught air hed only last another minute then shed finish him off with a couple of necksnapping kicks quite unexpectedly brynhild lowered her guard before zavalas weary reflexes could take advantage the giant woman collapsed in a heap joe stood there stupidly and wiped the sweat out of his eyes he saw gamay standing over brynhild holding one of the wooden shields from the ship in both hands theres more than one way to swat a viking bitch she said with fury in her eyes austin had managed to get to his feet holding his cracked ribs he looked at the others and said i hope we feel better than we look ill feel a hell of a lot better when were out of here zavala said through puffy lips wait austin said looking around we need a diversion without hesitation he went over to one of the braziers near the boat he picked it up by the metal legs and dumped the burning coals onto the boats deck then he went on board and tossed the shields into a pile the flames from the impromptu bonfire flared up the mast and licked the bottom of the hide sail within seconds the square sail was a sheet of fire black noxious smoke from the blaze curled up to the roof and began to move horizontally along the ceiling with his work done austin led the way to the doors they waited off to the side as the chamber filled with smoke within minutes the big doors swung open and a group of shouting guards piled into the hall the new supply of fresh air fueled the fire and sent the black clouds billowing throughout the great hall the guards who ran directly to the boat never saw the three shadowy figures slip through the open portal chapter inside the domed underwater facility francesca was becoming increasingly frantic one more piece in place and her plan would be complete she didnt dare make her move until she knew the others were safe especially after brynhilds hurried exit she glanced around the technicians were busy currying favor with the directors who milled around tossing back cups of purified water as if it were moet champagne the party wouldnt last forever someone was bound to notice her continued attention to the control panel the babble of conversation stopped suddenly and francesca turned to see three bizarre figures step out of the staff elevator she gasped at the sight of her friends they were almost unrecognizable gamay was limping her beautiful dark red hair looked as if it had been caught in an egg beater and her arms and legs were marked with angry bruises the white coveralls austin and zavala wore were streaked with blood and soot zavalas face was puffy and he had adopted a popeye squint they shoved their way through the crowd and came up to francesca austin managed a grin sorry we took so long we ran into a few uh obstacles thank god youre here austin put his arm around her shoulders we dont plan to stay weve got a taxi sitting under this thing can we offer you a lift francesca said there is one more thing i have to do she went over to the control panel and punched a series of numbers into the computer keyboard she watched the digital gauges for a moment satisfied all was going as planned she turned and said im ready zavala had been keeping the gogstad people cowed with his weapon in the event someone had an unexpected attack of courage austin inspected the board of directors with curiosity they returned his gaze with glares of pure hatred at one point the englishman named grimley stepped forward he stuck his nose in austins face and said we demand that you tell us who you are and what you want here austin laughed unpleasantly put his hand on the mans bony chest and shoved him back with the others who is this clown he asked francesca he and his friends are a symbol of all that is wrong with the world as an amateur philosopher austin had long been intrigued by questions of good and evil but metaphysical discussions would have to wait he ignored the englishman and took francescas arm guiding her toward the exit that would take them down to the air lock and the submersible gamay followed then zavala who covered their rear they had taken only a few steps when the freight elevator doors flew open and about twenty guards spilled out into the lab they quickly surrounded the fugitives and relieved zavala of his gun brynhild strode from the elevator and the guards stepped aside to let her through her blond hair was disheveled as a result of the encounter with gamays shield and her pale face was smudged with soot but her disarray didnt diminish her imposing physique and the malevolence in her pale blue eyes quivering with rage she pointed to the numa crew as if she were about to unleash a bolt of lightning kill them she ordered the gogstad directors murmured with pleasure at the turn of events and their eyes glittered in anticipation of the slaughter of the upstarts but as the guards raised their weapons and pre pared to unleash a lethal volley francesca stepped in front of her battered friends in a voice whose strength and tenor evoked her reign as a white goddess she shouted stop get out of the way or theyll kill you as well brynhild ordered francesca thrust her chin out i dont think so brynhild seemed to grow another foot who are you to defy me she snarled in reply francesca walked over and stood before the controls the panel was lighting up like a pinball machine numerical phalanxes marched across the computer screen there was no mistaking the fact that something was dreadfully out of kilter brynhild swooped down on francesca like an avenging angel what have you done see for yourself francesca said and stepped aside brynhild stared at the colorful display whats happening the instrumentation is having a nervous breakdown as it tries to deal with the equivalent of a chain reaction what do you mean tell me or ill youll kill me go ahead im the only one who can stop the reaction she smiled theres something you never knew about anasazium left alone its no more dangerous than iron but its atoms become highly unstable when the material is subjected to certain conditions what kind of conditions exactly the combination of temperature power and sonic vibration that the core is being subjected to at this minute un less i alter the instructions the core will explode youre bluffing see for yourself the heat levels are going off the charts still not convinced she said think about the mysterious explosion at your mexican facility the moment you told me about the blast i knew exactly what had caused it only a few pounds of material destroyed your facility think of what will happen when hundreds of pounds reach critical mass brynhild turned to the technicians who had gathered around and shouted for someone to stop the reaction the head technician had been watching the insane pattern on the computer screen with fascination he stepped forward sweat beading on his forehead and said we dont know how anything we do might make it worse brynhild yanked a machine pistol out of the hands of the nearest guard and pointed it at gamay if you dont stop this i will kill your friends one by one her first now whos bluffing francesca replied you plan to kill them anyhow this way well all die together brynhilds white skin grew impossibly paler she lowered the gun tell me what you want she demanded her voice taut with anger i want these people safely out of here brynhild had been trained as an engineer to assemble the facts before making a decision if the reaction were not stopped the resulting explosion would destroy the plant francesca was the only one who knew how to defuse the situation brynhild would let the numa people go as soon as the reaction was stabilized she would order her security forces to round them up then she would deal with francesca she wanted revenge for the destruction of her ship but she could be patient it had taken her years to get to this moment she handed the machine pistol back to the guard agreed she said but you must stay francesca heaved a sigh of relief and turned to austin you said you came by water yes we have scuba gear and a submersible waiting for us directly under the lab you wont be able to go that way francesca said the heat levels have already built up too far youd be boiled before you got to your submarine well try to take the elevator up to the pier theres a boat there thats your best course we cant leave you its all right they wont hurt me as long as im of use to them she smiled beguilingly ill look forward to being rescued by numa once again she turned to brynhild ill see them to the elevator no tricks she snarled she ordered two guards to escort the group francesca pressed the button that opened the door on the eggshaped lift youre injured ill help you in when they were all seated she leaned in and whispered does anyone have a gun the guards who relieved zavala of his machine pistol assumed that because austin didnt have a gun in his hand he wasnt carrying one but he still had the revolver he had taken from one of the kradzik brothers tucked under his shirt i have one austin said but it would be suicide to try to shoot your way out of here i dont intend to the gun please austin reluctantly handed the gun over in return she reached under her smock and handed him a manila envelope its all here kurt guard this with your life she said what is it youll see when you give it to the world she gave austin a long and lingering kiss im sorry but well have to postpone our date she said with a smile then she turned to the others goodbye my friends thank you for everything the finality in her voice was unmistakable austin suddenly realized that she had no intention of being rescued get in austin yelled and made a grab for her arm she stepped easily out of reach and glanced at her watch you have exactly five minutes use them well then she punched the up button the door slid shut and the elevator quickly shot out of sight the guards diverted their attention to watch the elevator francesca eased the gun from under her smock and shot out the elevator controls then she did the same with the freight elevator and tossed the gun aside as brynhild rushed over with the other guards a loud klaxon began to sound from loudspeakers set around the dome what have you done brynhild shouted thats the fiveminute warning francesca yelled back the reaction has been locked into place nothing will stop it now you said you would stop the reaction if i let your friends go francesca laughed i lied you told me never to trust any one flinging brynhilds words back at her the technicians had realized the danger before anyone and while attention was diverted they silently slipped off to climb a narrow emergency staircase that spiraled in a separate water proof shaft that led to the surface the directors saw them trying to flee and tried to follow the discipline of the guards quickly dissolved under the influence of fear they used their gun butts to drive the directors back then opened up on those who wouldnt yield bodies piled up in front of the portal that led to the stairway guards scrambled over the heap of corpses only to be stuck in the narrow space none would give way and others pushed from behind within seconds the only way out was clogged with crushed bodies brynhild couldnt believe how quickly her world had deteriorated she focused all her anger on francesca who had made no move to get away scooping austins handgun from the floor she aimed it at francesca you will die for this she screamed i died ten years ago when your mad plan sent me into the rain forest brynhilds finger squeezed the trigger and let off three shots the first two went wild but the third caught francesca in the chest her knees buckled and she fell to the floor landing in a sitting position with her back to the wall as a black curtain fell over her eyes she smiled beatifically then she was dead brynhild threw the gun aside and walked over to the control panel she stood helplessly in front of the computer screen as if she could make the reaction stop through sheer force of will she bunched her fists and held them high over her head her howl of rage mingled with the hoarse bray of the klaxon then the tortured atoms and molecules trapped within the core material broke free unleashing a tremendous burst of energy blasted by the internal pressures the core container turned to molten metal brynhild was incinerated instantly in the whitehot explosion and a giant fireball turned the lab into an inferno superheated smoke reared up the elevator shafts along the tram tunnel and into the complex where it filled every passage way then into the great hall the smoke burst into billowing flames that boiled the air touched off the banners hanging on the walls the smoldering gray ashes of the gogstad ship in the heart of valhalla vanished in a final firestorm chapter the boston whaler streaked across the lake with its bow up on plane austin pushing the twin overdue outboard motors for all they were worth his face was a bronze mask of anger and frustration he had tried to go back to the lab but the elevator had gone dead after it delivered them to the boathouse the freight elevator wasnt working either he had started down a staircase only to have gamay pull him back its no use she said there isnt time listen to gamay zavala agreed weve got less than four minutes austin knew they were right he would die and jeopardize their lives if he attempted a futile rescue he led the way out of the boathouse onto the pier the guard sat outside dozing in the sun he got up and tried to unsling his gun austin who was in no mood for marquis of queensberry rules rushed the terrified guard he slammed his shoulder into the mans midsection and knocked him off the pier they piled into the boat the key was in the ignition and the gas tanks were full the motors started right away they cast off and austin gunned the throttle and steered the boat on a direct line for the nevada shore he heard a shout from zavala and turned his head joe and gamay were looking back toward the pier where the lake bubbled like water boiling in a pot there was a muffled roar and a bloodred geyser shot hundreds of feet into the air like a water spout they covered their faces with their hands against the scalding rainfall and the cloud of steam that followed when they dared to look they saw that the pier had completely vanished a wave at least ten feet tall was rolling in their direction these boats are supposed to be unsinkable zavala said tensely thats what they said about titanic gamay reminded him austin brought the boat around so the bow was facing into the wave they braced themselves expecting to be swamped but the surge simply lifted them high in the air and rolled beneath them austin remembered that even a tsunami doesnt amount to much until it hits the shore he hoped the power of the wave would ease before it hit the nevada side things were happening on land as well a plume of smoke rose from the forest where austin had seen the turrets of the building complex from his parasail as they watched the smoke changed in character becoming thicker and darker austin reduced their speed and stared at the great black billows streaked with red and yellow flames that were rising high above the trees gotterdammerung he murmured gamay overheard him twilight of the gods i was thinking more of a goddess they were all silent the only sound the drone of the motors and the hiss of the bow through water then they heard a hooting like a deranged owl and turned to see a red white and blue confection steaming in their direction the tahoe queen blew its whistle again pauls tall figure could be seen waving from the top deck austin waved back goosed the throttle and pointed the whaler toward the oncoming riverboat epilogue libyan desert six months later the village elder was as thin as a stork and his leathery face so creased by decades of desert sun that it would have been impossible to find room for one more wrinkle years of malnutrition had reduced his inventory of teeth down to two one up and one down but the lack of dentures didnt keep him from smiling with pride as he stood in the center of his domain a cluster of yellow clay hovels and a few palm trees marking a muddy oasis he could have been any big city mayor presiding over the ribbon cutting at a public works project the village was located far to the west of the great pyramids at giza in one of the most inhospitable regions in the world between egypt and libya lie thousands of square miles of hot dry sand broken here and there by the bones of panzers left over from world war ii a few scattered settlements cling precariously to life around oases of unpredictable reliability sometimes the oases dry up and when that happens the crops die and famine stalks the villages the cycle between subsistence and starvation had been a way of life for centuries but all that was about to change in recognition of good things to come the village was decked out with colorful banners strips of fabric were braided into the tail of every camel a large pavilion tent striped in blue and white the colors of the united nations had been set up in the square actually no more than a dusty open space in the center of the settlement lined up on the edge of the village were several helicopters diplomats from the un and several middle eastern and african countries stood in the shade of the tent the village elder stood next to a structure unlikely to be found in the middle of the desert it was a circular fountain made of marble and consisting of a large basin enclosing a smaller one surmounted by a statue of a winged woman the fountain was made so that the water flowed from the out stretched palms of the figure the elder was ready with great ceremony he removed a tin cup from around his neck scooped it full of water and took a sip his toothless grin became even wider and in a frail reedy voice he called out in arabic elhamdelillah lilmayya he was joined by the other village men who took turns drinking from the cup as if it and not the fountain were the magical source of water the women who had been waiting rushed in to fill their clay water jugs the children hovering around the fountain took their mothers action as a signal to cool off before long the basin was full of laughing and splashing naked children the diplomats and government officials left the protection of their tent and gathered around the fountain watching with amusement from the shade of a palm tree was the numa special assignments team and the skipper of the sea robin does anyone know what the old man said zavala said my arabic is pretty limited gamay said but i believe he is saying big thanks to allah for water the wonderful gift of life paul put his good right arm around his wifes shoulders too bad francesca isnt here to see herself carved in marble it re minds me of her old white goddess days austin nodded from my impression of francesca she wouldnt give it a second glance shed check out the water tower and the irrigation setup make sure the pipeline from the desalting plant didnt leak then shed be off to get more plants going i think youre right paul replied once the other countries see how well the cabral process works for the mediterranean pilot plant theyll all come running with their tin cups out bahrain and saudi have said theyre ready to finance something but the un has promised to abide by the request francesca en closed with the plans she gave you and will make the big push in the subsaharan african countries i heard the southwest states and mexico are taking the initiative to build plants on the california coast austin said that should relieve the stress on the colorado river gamay said i think francesca would be pleased to see some of those who have been fighting over water working together to bring it to places hit by the drought theres a whole new spirit of cooperation maybe there is hope for the species yet im optimistic austin said the un has promised to speed up its usual bureaucratic pace they did a good job setting up a refining plant for that new anasazium site in canada francescas plans are amazingly simple from what weve seen of how fast and cheap this plant went up any country is going to be able to bring in lowcost fresh water ironic isnt it gamay said anasazium came out of los alamos where they were working on weapons of mass destruction it came close to being just that in the hands of gogstad austin said gamay shivered although the temperature was in the nineties sometimes that giant woman her two dreadful henchmen and her horrible lair seem like
