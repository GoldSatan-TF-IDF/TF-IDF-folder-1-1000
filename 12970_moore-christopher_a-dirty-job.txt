child that holds your hand let your wife delight in your embrace for these alone are the concerns of man the epic of gilgamesh because i could not stop for deathhe kindly stopped for me charlie asher walked the earth like an ant walks on the surface of water as if the slightest misstep might send him plummeting through the surface to be sucked to the depths below blessed with the beta male imagination he spent much of his life squinting into the future so he might spot ways in which the world was conspiring to kill himhim his wife rachel and now newborn sophie but despite his attention his paranoia his ceaseless fretting from the moment rachel peed a blue stripe on the pregnancy stick to the time they wheeled her into recovery at st francis memorial death slipped in shes not breathing charlie said shes breathing fine rachel said patting the babys back do you want to hold her charlie had held baby sophie for a few seconds earlier in the day and had handed her quickly to a nurse insisting that someone more qualified than he do some finger and toe counting hed done it twice and kept coming up with twentyone they act like thats all there is to it like if the kid has the minimum ten fingers and ten toes its all going to be fine what if there are extras huh extracredit fingers what if the kid has a tail charlie was sure hed spotted a tail in the sixmonth sonogram umbilical indeed hed kept a hard copy she doesnt have a tail mr asher the nurse explained and its ten and ten weve all checked perhaps you should go home and get some rest ill still love her even with her extra finger shes perfectly normal or toe we really do know what were doing mr asher shes a beautiful healthy baby girl or a tail the nurse sighed she was short wide and had a tattoo of a snake up her right calf that showed through her white nurse stockings she spent four hours of every workday massaging preemie babies her hands threaded through ports in a lucite incubator like she was handling a radioactive spark in there she talked to them coaxed them told them how special they were and felt their hearts fluttering in chests no bigger than a balledup pair of sweat socks she cried over every one and believed that her tears and touch poured a bit of her own life into the tiny bodies which was just fine with her she could spare it she had been a neonatal nurse for twenty years and had never so much as raised her voice to a new father theres no goddamn tail you doofus look she pulled down the blanket and aimed baby sophies bottom at him like she might unleash a fusillade of weaponsgrade poopage such as the guileless beta male had never seen charlie jumped backa lean and nimble thirty he wasthen once he realized that the baby wasnt loaded he straightened the lapels on his tweed jacket in a gesture of righteous indignation you could have removed her tail in the delivery room and wed never know he didnt know hed been asked to leave the delivery room first by the obgyn and finally by rachel him or me rachel said one of us has to go in rachels room charlie said if they removed her tail i want it shell want it when she gets older sophie your papa isnt really insane he just hasnt slept for a couple of days shes looking at me charlie said shes looking at me like i blew her college money at the track and now shes going to have to turn tricks to get her mba rachel took his hand honey i dont think her eyes can even focus this early and besides shes a little young to start worrying about her turning tricks to get her mfa mba charlie corrected they start very young these days by the time i figure out how to get to the track she could be old enough god your parents are going to hate me and that would be different how new reasons thats how now ive made their granddaughter a shiksa shes not a shiksa charlie weve been through this shes my daughter so shes as jewish as i am charlie went down on one knee next to the bed and took one of sophies tiny hands between his fingers daddys sorry he made you a shiksa he put his head down buried his face in the crook where the baby met rachels side rachel traced his hairline with her fingernail describing a tight uturn around his narrow forehead you need to go home and get some sleep charlie mumbled something into the covers when he looked up there were tears in his eyes she feels warm she is warm shes supposed to be its a mammal thing goes with the breastfeeding why are you crying you guys are so beautiful he began arranging rachels dark hair across the pillow brought a long lock down over sophies head and started styling it into a baby hairpiece it will be okay if she cant grow hair there was that angry irish singer who didnt have any hair and she was attractive if we had her tail we could transplant plugs from that charlie go home your parents will blame me their bald shiksa granddaughter turning tricks and getting a business degreeit will be all my fault rachel grabbed the buzzer from the blanket and held it up like it was wired to a bomb charlie if you dont go home and get some sleep right now i swear ill buzz the nurse and have her throw you out she sounded stern but she was smiling charlie liked looking at her smile always had it felt like approval and permission at the same time permission to be charlie asher okay ill go he reached to feel her forehead do you have a fever you look tired i just gave birth you squirrel im just concerned about you he was not a squirrel she was blaming him for sophies tail thats why shed said squirrel and not doofus like everyone else sweetie go now so i can get some rest charlie fluffed her pillows checked her water pitcher tucked in the blankets kissed her forehead kissed the babys head fluffed the baby then started to rearrange the flowers that his mother had sent moving the big stargazer lily in the front accenting it with a spray of babys breath charlie im going jeez he checked the room one last time then backed toward the door can i bring you anything from home ill be fine the ready kit you packed covered everything i think in fact i may not even need the fire extinguisher better to have it and not need it than to need it go ill get some rest the doctor will check sophie out and well take her home in the morning that seems soon its standard should i bring more propane for the camp stove well try to make it last but rachel held up the buzzer as if her demands were not met the consequences could be dire love you she said love you too charlie said both of you bye daddy rachel puppeted sophies little hand in a wave charlie felt a lump rising in his throat no one had ever called him daddy before not even a puppet he had once asked rachel whos your daddy during sex to which she had replied saul goldstein thus rendering him impotent for a week and raising all kinds of issues that he didnt really like to think about he backed out of the room palming the door shut as he went then headed down the hall and past the desk where the neonatal nurse with the snake tattoo gave him a sideways smile as he went by charlie drove a sixyearold minivan that hed inherited from his father along with the thrift store and the building that housed it the minivan always smelled faintly of dust mothballs and body odor despite a forest of smellgood christmas trees that charlie had hung from every hook knob and protrusion he opened the car door and the odor of the unwantedthe wares of the thriftstore ownerwashed over him before he even had the key in the ignition he noticed the sarah mclachlan cd lying on the passenger seat well rachel was going to miss that it was her favorite cd and there she was recovering without it and he could not have that charlie grabbed the cd locked the van and headed back up to rachels room to his relief the nurse had stepped away from the desk so he didnt have to endure her frosty stare of accusation or what he guessed would be her frosty stare of accusation hed mentally prepared a short speech about how being a good husband and father included anticipating the wants and needs of his wife and that included bringing her musicwell he could use the speech on the way out if she gave him the frosty stare he opened the door to rachels room slowly so as not to startle heranticipating her warm smile of disapproval but instead she appeared to be asleep and there was a very tall black man dressed in mint green standing next to her bed what are you doing here the man in mint green turned startled you can see me he gestured to his chocolatebrown tie and charlie was reminded just for a second of those thin mints they put on the pillow in nicer hotels of course i can see you what are you doing here charlie moved to rachels bedside putting himself between the stranger and his family baby sophie seemed fascinated by the tall black man this is not good said mint green youre in the wrong room charlie said you get out of here charlie reached behind and patted rachels hand this is really really not good sir my wife is trying to sleep and youre in the wrong room now please go before shes not sleeping said mint green his voice was soft and a little southern im sorry charlie turned to look down at rachel expecting to see her smile hear her tell him to calm down but her eyes were closed and her head had lolled off the pillow honey charlie dropped the cd he was carrying and shook her gently honey baby sophie began to cry charlie felt rachels forehead took her by the shoulders and shook her honey wake up rachel he put his ear to her heart and heard nothing nurse charlie scrambled across the bed to grab the buzzer that had slipped from rachels hand and lay on the blanket nurse he pounded the button and turned to look at the man in mint green what happened he was gone charlie ran into the hall but no one was out there nurse twenty seconds later the nurse with the snake tattoo arrived followed in another thirty seconds by a resuscitation team with a crash cart there was nothing they could do a fine edge theres a fine edge to new grief it severs nerves disconnects realitytheres mercy in a sharp blade only with time as the edge wears does the real ache begin so charlie was barely even aware of his own shrieks in rachels hospital room of being sedated of the filmy electric hysteria that netted everything he did for that first day after that it was a memory out of a sleepwalk scenes filmed from a zombies eye socket as he ambled undead through explanations accusations preparations and ceremony its called a cerebral thromboembolism the doctor had said a blood clot forms in the legs or pelvis during labor then moves to the brain cutting off the blood supply its very rare but it happens there was nothing we could do even if the crash team had been able to revive her shed have had massive brain damage there was no pain she probably just felt sleepy and passed charlie whispered to keep from screaming the man in mint green he did something to her he injected her with something he was there and he knew that she was dying i saw him when i brought her cd back they showed him the security tapesthe nurse the doctor the hospitals administrators and lawyersthey all watched the blackandwhite images of him leaving rachels room of the empty hallway of his returning to her room no tall black man dressed in mint green they didnt even find the cd sleep deprivation they said hallucination brought on by exhaustion trauma they gave him drugs to sleep drugs for anxiety drugs for depression and they sent him home with his baby daughter charlies older sister jane held baby sophie as they spoke over rachel and buried her on the second day he didnt remember picking out a casket or making arrangements it was more of the somnambulant dream his inlaws moving to and fro in black like tottering specters spouting the inadequate clichés of condolence were so sorry she was so young what a tragedy if theres anything we can do rachels father and mother held him their heads pressed together in the apex of a tripod the slate floor in the funeralhome foyer spotted with their tears every time charlie felt the shoulders of the older man heave with a sob he felt his own heart break again saul took charlies face in his hands and said you cant imagine because i cant imagine but charlie could imagine because he was a beta male and imagination was his curse and he could imagine because he had lost rachel and now he had a daughter that tiny stranger sleeping in his sisters arms he could imagine the man in mint green taking her charlie looked at the tearspotted floor and said thats why most funeral homes are carpeted someone could slip poor boy said rachels mother well sit shivah with you of course charlie made his way across the room to his sister jane who wore a mans doublebreasted suit in charcoal pinstripe gabardine that along with her severe eighties popstar hairstyle and the infant in the pink blanket that she held made her appear not so much androgynous as confused charlie thought the suit actually looked better on her than it did on him but she should have asked him for permission to wear it nonetheless i cant do this he said he let himself fall forward until the receded peninsula of dark hair touched her gelled flock of seagulls platinum flip it seemed like the best posture for sharing grief this forehead lean and it reminded him of standing drunkenly at a urinal and falling forward until his head hit the wall despair youre doing fine jane said nobodys good at this what the fucks a shivah i think its that hindu god with all the arms that cant be right the goldsteins are going to sit on it with me didnt rachel teach you anything about being jewish i wasnt paying attention i thought we had time jane adjusted baby sophie into a halfback onearmed carry and put her free hand on the back of charlies neck youll be okay kid seven said mrs goldstein shivah means seven we used to sit for seven days grieving for the dead praying thats orthodox now most people just sit for three they sat shivah in charlie and rachels apartment that overlooked the cablecar line at the corner of mason and vallejo streets the building was a fourstory brick edwardian architecturally not quite the grand courtesan couture of the victorians but enough tarty trim and trash to toss off a sailor down a side street built after the earthquake and fire of had leveled the whole area of what was now north beach russian hill and chinatown charlie and jane had inherited the building along with the thrift shop that occupied the ground floor when their father died four years before charlie got the business the large double apartment theyd grown up in and the upkeep on the old building while jane got half the rental income and one of the apartments on the top floor with a bay bridge view at the instruction of mrs goldstein all the mirrors in the house were draped with black fabric and a large candle was placed on the coffee table in the center of the living room they were supposed to sit on low benches or cushions neither of which charlie had in the house so for the first time since rachels death he went downstairs into the thrift shop looking for something they could use the back stairs descended from a pantry behind the kitchen into the stockroom where charlie kept his office among boxes of merchandise waiting to be sorted priced and placed in the store the shop was dark except for the light that filtered in the front window from the streetlights out on mason street charlie stood there at the foot of the stairs his hand on the light switch just staring amid the shelves of knickknacks and books the piles of old radios the racks of clothes all of them dark just lumpy shapes in the dark he could see objects glowing a dull red nearly pulsing like beating hearts a sweater in the racks a porcelain figure of a frog in a curio case out by the front window an old cocacola tray a pair of shoesall glowing red charlie flipped the switch fluorescent tubes fired to life across the ceiling flickering at first and the shop lit up the red glow disappeared okaaaaaaay he said to himself calmly like everything was just fine now he flipped off the lights glowing red stuff on the counter close to where he stood there was a brass businesscard holder cast in the shape of a whooping crane glowing dull red he took a second to study it just to make sure there wasnt some red light source from outside refracting around the room and making him uneasy for no reason he stepped into the dark shop took a closer look got an angle on the brass cranes nope the brass was definitely pulsing red he turned and ran back up the steps as fast as he could he nearly ran over jane who stood in the kitchen rocking sophie gently in her arms talking baby talk under her breath what jane said i know you have some big cushions down in the shop somewhere i cant charlie said im on drugs he backed against the refrigerator like he was holding it hostage ill go get them here hold the baby i cant im on drugs im hallucinating jane cradled the baby in the crook of her right arm and put a free arm around her younger brother charlie you are on antidepressants and antianxiety drugs not acid look around this apartment theres not a person here thats not on something charlie looked through the kitchen passthrough women in black most of them middleaged or older shaking their heads men looking stoic standing around the perimeter of the living room each holding a stout tumbler of liquor and staring into space see theyre all fucked up what about mom charlie nodded to their mother who stood out among the other grayhaired women in black because she was draped in silver navaho jewelry and was so darkly tanned that she appeared to be melting into her oldfashioned when she took a sip especially mom jane said ill go look for something to sit shivah on i dont know why you cant just use the couches now take your daughter i cant i cant be trusted with her take her bitch jane barked in charlies earsort of a whisper bark it had long ago been determined who was the alpha male between them and it was not charlie she handed off the baby and cut to the stairs jane charlie called after her look around before you turn on the lights see if you see anything weird okay right weird she left him standing there in the kitchen studying his daughter thinking that her head might be a little oblong but despite that she looked a little like rachel your mommy loved aunt jane he said they used to gang up on me in riskand monopolyand argumentsand cooking he slid down the fridge door sat splayedlegged on the floor and buried his face in sophies blanket in the dark jane barked her shin on a wooden box full of old telephones well this is just stupid she said to herself and flipped on the lights nothing weird then because charlie was many things but one of them was not crazy she turned off the lights again just to be sure that she hadnt missed something right weird there was nothing weird about the store except that she was standing there in the dark rubbing her shin but then right before she turned on the light again she saw someone peering in the front window making a cup around his eyes to see through the reflection of the streetlights a homeless guy or drunken tourist she thought she moved through the dark shop between columns of comic books stacked on the floor to a spot behind a rack of jackets where she could get a clear view of the window which was filled with cheap cameras vases belt buckles and all manner of objects that charlie had judged worthy of interest but obviously not worthy of a smashandgrab the guy looked tall and not homeless nicely dressed but all in a single light color she thought it might be yellow but it was hard to tell under the streetlights could be light green were closed jane said loud enough to be heard through the glass the man outside peered around the shop but couldnt spot her he stepped back from the window and she could see that he was indeed tall very tall the streetlight caught the line of his cheek as he turned he was also very thin and very black i was looking for the owner the tall man said i have something i need to show him theres been a death in the family jane said well be closed for the week can you come back in a week the tall man nodded looking up and down the street as he did he rocked on one foot like he was about to bolt but kept stopping himself like a sprinter straining against the starting blocks jane didnt move there were always people out on the street and it wasnt even late yet but this guy was too anxious for the situation look if you need to get something appraised no he cut her off no just tell him shes notell him to look for a package in the mail im not sure when jane smiled to herself this guy had somethinga brooch a coin a booksomething that he thought was worth some money maybe something hed found in his grandmothers closet shed seen it a dozen times they acted like theyve found the lost city of eldoradotheyd come in with it tucked in their coats or wrapped in a thousand layers of tissue paper and tape the more tape generally the more worthless the item would turn out to bethere was an equation there somewhere nine times out of ten it was crap shed watched her father try to finesse their ego and gently lower the owners into disappointment convince them that the sentimental value made it priceless and that he a lowly secondhandstore owner couldnt presume to put a value on it charlie on the other hand would just tell them that he didnt know about brooches or coins or whatever they had and let someone else bear the bad news okay ill tell him jane said from her cover behind the coats with that the tall man was away taking great prayingmantis strides up the street and out of view jane shrugged went back and turned on the lights then proceeded to search for cushions among the piles it was a big store taking up nearly the whole bottom floor of the building and not particularly well organized as each system that charlie adopted seemed to collapse after a few weeks under its own weight and the result was not so much a patchwork of organizational systems but a garden of mismatched piles lily the maroonhaired goth girl who worked for charlie three afternoons a week said that the fact that they ever found anything at all was proof of the chaos theory at work then she would walk away muttering and go out in the alley to smoke clove cigarettes and stare into the abyss although charlie noted that the abyss looked an awful lot like a dumpster it took jane ten minutes to navigate the aisles and find three cushions that looked wide enough and thick enough that they might work for sitting shivah and when she returned to charlies apartment she found her brother curled into the fetal position around baby sophie asleep on the kitchen floor the other mourners had completely forgotten about him hey doofus she nudged his shoulder with her toe and he rolled onto his back the baby still in his arms these okay did you see anything glowing jane dropped the stack of cushions on the floor what glowing red did you see things in the shop glowing like pulsating red no did you kind of give em up what the drugs hand them over theyre obviously much better than you led me to believe but you said they were just antianxiety give up the drugs ill watch the kid while you shivah you cant watch my daughter if youre on drugs fine surrender the crumb snatcher and go sit charlie handed the baby up to jane you have to keep mom out of the way too oh no not without drugs theyre in the medicine cabinet in the master bath bottom shelf he was sitting on the floor now rubbing his forehead as if to stretch the skin out over his pain she kneed him in the shoulder hey kid im sorry you know that right goes without saying right yeah a weak smile she held the baby up by her face then looked down in adoration mother of jesus style what do you think i should get one of these huh you can borrow mine whenever you need to nah i should get my own i already feel bad about borrowing your wife jane kidding jeez youre such a wuss sometimes go sit shivah go go go charlie gathered the cushions and went to the living room to grieve with his inlaws nervous because the only prayer he knew was now i lay me down to sleep and he wasnt sure that was going to cut it for three full days jane forgot to mention the tall guy from the shop beneath the number fortyone bus it was two weeks before charlie left the apartment and walked down to the autoteller on columbus avenue where he first killed a guy his weapon of choice was the number fortyone bus on its way from the trans bay station by the bay bridge to the presidio by the golden gate bridge if youre going to get hit by a bus in san francisco you want to go with the fortyone because you can pretty much figure on there being a nice bridge view charlie hadnt really counted on killing a guy that morning he had hoped to get some twenties for the register at the thrift store check his balance and maybe pick up some yellow mustard at the deli charlie was not a brown mustard kind of guy brown mustard was the condiment equivalent of skydivingit was okay for racecar drivers and serial killers but for charlie a fine line of frenchs yellow was all the spice that life required after the funeral friends and relatives had left a mountain of cold cuts in charlies fridge which was all hed eaten for the past two weeks but now he was down to ham dark rye and premixed enfamil formula none of which was tolerable without yellow mustard hed secured the yellow squeeze bottle and felt safer now with it in his jacket pocket but when the bus hit the guy mustard completely slipped charlies mind it was a warm day in october the light had gone autumn soft over the city the summer fog had ceased its relentless crawl out of the bay each morning and there was just enough breeze that the few sailboats that dotted the bay looked like they might have been posing for an impressionist painter in the split second that charlies victim realized that he was being run over he might not have been happy about the event but he couldnt have picked a nicer day for it the guys name was william creek he was thirtytwo and worked as a market analyst in the financial district where he had been headed that morning when he decided to stop at the autoteller he was wearing a light wool suit and running shoes his work shoes were tucked into a leather satchel under his arm the handle of a compact umbrella protruded from the side pocket of the satchel and it was this that caught charlies attention for while the handle of the umbrella appeared to be made of faux walnut burl it was glowing a dull red as if it had been heated in a forge charlie stood in the atm line trying not to notice trying to appear uninterested but he couldnt help but stare it was glowing for fucks sake didnt anyone see it william creek glanced over his shoulder as he slid his card into the machine saw charlie looking at him then tried to will his suit coat to expand into great mantaray wings to block charlies view as he keyed in his pin number creek snatched his card and the expectorated cash from the machine turned and headed away quickly toward the corner charlie couldnt stand it any longer the umbrella handle had begun to pulsate red like a beating heart as creek reached the curb charlie said excuse me excuse me sir when creek turned charlie said your umbrella at that point the number fortyone bus was coming through the intersection at columbus and vallejo at about thirtyfive miles per hour angling toward the curb for its next stop creek looked down at the satchel under his arm where charlie was pointing and the heel of his running shoe caught the slight rise of the curb he started to lose his balance the sort of thing we all might do on any given day while walking through the city trip on a crack in the sidewalk and take a couple of quick steps to regain equilibrium but william creek took only one step back off the curb you cant really sugarcoat it at this point can you the number fortyone bus creamed him he flew a good fifty feet through the air before he hit the back window of a saab like a great gabardine sack of meat then bounced back to the pavement and commenced to ooze fluids his belongingsthe satchel the umbrella a gold tie bar a tag heuer watchskittered on down the street ricocheting off tires shoes manhole covers some coming to rest nearly a block away charlie stood at the curb trying to breathe he could hear a tooting sound like someone was blowing a toy train whistleit was all he could hear then someone ran into him and he realized it was the sound of his own rhythmic whimpering the guythe guy with the umbrellahad just been wiped out of the world people rushed crowded around a dozen were barking into cell phones the bus driver nearly flattened charlie as he rushed down the sidewalk toward the carnage charlie staggered after him i was just going to ask him no one looked at charlie it had taken all of his will as well as a pep talk from his sister to leave the apartment and now this i was just going to tell him that his umbrella was on fire charlie said as if he was explaining to his accusers but no one accused him really they ran by him some headed toward the body some away from itthey batted him around and looked back baffled like theyd collided with a rough air current or a ghost instead of a man the umbrella charlie said looking for the evidence then he spotted it almost down at the next corner lying in the gutter still glowing red pulsating like failing neon there see but people were gathered around the dead man in a wide semicircle their hands to their mouths and no one was paying any attention to the frightened thin man spouting nonsense behind them he threaded his way through the crowd toward the umbrella determined now to confirm his conviction too far in shock to be afraid when he was only ten feet away from it he looked up the street to make sure another bus wasnt coming before he ventured off the curb he looked back just as a delicate tarblack hand snaked out of the storm drain and snatched the compact umbrella off the street charlie backed away looking around to see if anyone had seen what he had seen but no one had no one even made eye contact a policeman trotted by and charlie grabbed his sleeve as he passed but when the cop spun around and his eyes went wide with confusion then what appeared to be real terror charlie let him go sorry he said sorry i can see youve got work to dosorry the cop shuddered and pushed through the crowd of onlookers toward the battered body of william creek charlie started running across columbus and up vallejo until his breath and heartbeat in his ears drowned all the sounds of the street when he was a block away from his shop a great shadow moved over him like a lowflying aircraft or a huge bird and with it charlie felt a chill vibrate up his back he lowered his head pumped his arms and rounded the corner of mason just as the cable car was passing full of smiling tourists who looked right through him he glanced up just for a second and he thought he saw something above disappearing over the roof of the sixstory victorian across the street then he bolted through the front door of his shop hey boss lily said she was sixteen pale and a little bottom heavyher grownwoman form still in flux between baby fat and baby bearing today her hair happened to be lavender fiftieshousewife helmet hair in easterbasket cellophane pastel charlie was bent over leaning against a case full of curios by the door sucking in deep raspy gulps of secondhand store mustiness ithinkijustkilledaguy he gasped excellent lily said ignoring equally his message and his demeanor were going to need change for the register with a bus charlie said ray called in she said ray macy was charlies other employee a thirtynineyearold bachelor with an unhealthy lack of boundaries between the internet and reality hes flying to manila to meet the love of his life a ms loveyoulongtime rays convinced that they are soul mates there was something in the sewer charlie said lily examined a chip in her black nail polish so i cut school to cover ive been doing that since youve been uh gone im going to need a note charlie stood up and made his way to the counter lily did you hear what i said he grabbed her by the shoulders but she spun out of his grasp ouch fuck back off asher you sado freak thats a new tattoo she punched him in the arm hard and backed away rubbing her own shoulder i heard you cease your trippin sil vous plaît lately since discovering baudelaires fleurs du mal in a stack of used books in the back room lily had been peppering her speech with french phrases french better expresses the profound noirness of my existence she had said charlie put both hands on the counter to keep them from shaking then spoke slowly and deliberately like he was speaking to someone for whom english was a second language lily im having kind of a bad month and i appreciate that you are throwing away your education so you can come here and alienate customers for me but if you dont sit down and show me a little fucking human decency then im going to have to let you go lily sat down on the chromeandvinyl diner stool behind the register and pulled her long lavender bangs out of her eyes so you want me to pay close attention to your confession to murder take notes maybe get an old cassette recorder off the shelf and get everything down on tape youre saying that by trying to ignore your obvious distress which i would have to later recall to the police so i can be personally responsible for sending you to the gas chamber that im being inconsiderate charlie shuddered jeez lily he was continually surprised at the speed and accuracy of her creepiness she was like some creepiness child prodigy but on the bright side her extreme darkness made him realize that he probably wasnt going to go to the gas chamber it wasnt that kind of killing there was something following me and silence lily put her hand up id rather not show my employee spirit by committing every detail of your heinous crime to my photographic memory to be recalled in court later ill just say that i saw you but you seemed normal for someone without a clue you dont have a photographic memory i do too and its a curse i can never forget the futility of you forgot to take out the trash at least eight times last month i didnt forget charlie took a deep breath the familiarity of arguing with lily was actually calming him down okay then without looking what color shirt are you wearing he raised an eyebrow like he had her there lily smiled and for a second he could see that she was just a kid kind of cute and goofy under the fierce makeup and attitude black lucky guess you know i only own black she grinned glad you didnt ask hair color i just changed this morning thats not good for you you know that dye has toxins lily lifted the lavender wig to reveal her closecut maroon locks underneath then dropped it again im all natural she stood and patted the bar stool sit asher confess bore me lily leaned back against the counter and tilted her head to look attentive but with her dark eye makeup and lavender hair it came off more like a marionette with a broken string charlie came around the counter and sat on the stool i was just in line behind this william creek guy and i saw his umbrella glowing and charlie went through the whole story to her the umbrella the bus the hand from the storm sewer the bolt for home with the giant dark shadow above the rooftops and when he was finished lily asked so how do you know his name huh charlie said of all of the horrible fantastic things she might have asked about why that how do you know the guys name lily repeated you barely spoke to the guy before he bit it you see it on his receipt or something no i he didnt have any idea how he knew the mans name but suddenly there was a picture in his head of it written out in big block letters he leapt off the stool i gotta go lily he ran through the door into the stockroom and up the steps i still need a note for school lily shouted from below but charlie was dashing through the kitchen past a large russian woman who was bouncing his baby daughter in her arms and into the bedroom where he snatched up the notepad he kept on his nightstand by the phone there in his own blocky handwriting was written the name william creek and under it the number he sat down hard on the bed holding the notepad like it was a vial of explosives behind him came the heavy steps of mrs korjev as she followed him into the bedroom mr asher what is wrong you run by like burning bear and charlie because he was a beta male and there had evolved over millions of years a standard beta response to things inexplicable said someone is fucking with me lily was touching up her nail polish with a black magic marker when stephan the mailman came through the shop door sup darque stephan said sorting a stack of mail out of his bag he was forty short muscular and black he wore wraparound sunglasses which were almost always pushed back on his head over hair braided in tight cornrows lily had mixed feelings about him she liked him because he called her darque short for darquewillow elventhing the name under which she received mail at the shop but because he was cheerful and seemed to like people she deeply mistrusted him need you to sign stephan said offering her an electronic pad on which she scribbled charles baudelaire with great flourish and without even looking stephan plopped the mail on the counter working alone again so where is everyone rays in the philippines charlies traumatized she sighed weight of the world falls on me poor charlie stephan said they say thats the worst thing you can go through losing a spouse yeah theres that too today hes traumatized because he saw a guy get hit by a bus up on columbus heard about that he gonna be okay well fuck no stephan he got hit by a bus lily looked up from her nails for the first time i meant charlie stephan winked despite her harsh tone oh hes charlie hows the baby evidently she leaks noxious substances lily waved the magic marker under her nose as if it might mask the smell of ripened baby all good then stephan smiled thats it for today you got anything for me i took in some red vinyl platforms yesterday mens size ten stephan collected vintage seventies pimp wear lily was to be on the lookout for anything that came through the shop how tall four inches low altitude stephan said as if that explained everything take care darque lily waved her magic marker at him as he left and started sorting through the mail there were mostly bills a couple of flyers but one thick black envelope that felt like a book or catalog it was addressed to charlie asher in care of ashers secondhand and had a postmark from nights plutonian shore which evidently was in whatever state started with a u lily found geography not only mindnumbingly boring but also in the age of the internet irrelevant was it not addressed to the care of ashers secondhand lily reasoned and was she lily darquewillow elventhing not manning the counter the sole employeenaythe de facto manager of said secondhand store and wasnt it her rightnayher responsibility to open this envelope and spare charlie the irritation of the task onward elventhing your destiny is set and if it be not destiny then surely there is plausible deniability which in the parlance of politics is the same thing she drew a jewelencrusted dagger from under the counter the stones valued at over seventythree cents and slit the envelope pulled out the book and fell in love the cover was shiny like a childrens picture book with a colorful illustration of a grinning skeleton with tiny people impaled on his fingertips and all of them appeared to be having the time of their lives as if they were enjoying a carnival ride that just happened to involve having a gaping hole being punched through the chest it was festivelots of flowers and candy in primary colors done in the style of mexican folk art the great big book of death was the title spelled out across the top of the cover in cheerful human femur font letters lily opened the book to the first page where a note was paperclipped this should explain everything im sorry mf lily removed the note and opened the book to the first chapter so now youre death heres what youll need and it was all she needed this was very possibly the coolest book she had ever seen and certainly not anything charlie would be able to appreciate especially in his current state of heightened neurosis she slipped the book into her backpack then tore the note and the envelope into tiny pieces and buried them at the bottom of the wastebasket the beta male in his natural environment jane said charlie i am convinced by the events of the last few weeks that nefarious forces or peopleunidentified but no less realare threatening life as we know it and in fact may be bent on unraveling the very fabric of our existence and thats why i have to eat yellow mustard jane was sitting at charlies breakfast counter eating little smokies cocktail sausages out of the package dipping them in a ramekin of frenchs yellow baby sophie was sitting on the counter in her carseatbassinetimperialstormtrooperhelmet thingy charlie paced the kitchen marking off his evidentiary points in the air with a sausage as he went first there was the guy in rachels room that mysteriously disappeared from the security tapes because he was never there look sophie likes yellow mustard like you second charlie continued despite his sisters persistent indifference all the stuff in the shop was glowing like it was radioactive dont put that in her mouth oh my god charlie sophies straight look at her go after that lil smokie and third that creek guy got hit by a bus up on columbus yesterday i knew his name and he had an umbrella that was glowing red im so disappointed said jane i was looking forward to raising her on the allgirls teamgiving her the advantages i never had but look at her work that sausage this kid is a natural get that out of her mouth relax she cant eat it she doesnt even have teeth and its not like theres a moaning teletubby on the other end of it oh jeez its going to take major tequila to get that picture out of my head she cant have pork jane shes jewish are you trying to turn my daughter into a shiksa jane snatched the cocktail sausage out of sophies mouth and examined it even as the fiberoptic strand of drool stayed connected to the tiny kid i dont think i can eat these things ever again jane said theyll always conjure visions of my niece blowing a terrycloth puppet person jane charlie grabbed the sausage from her and flung it into the sink what are you listening at all yes yes you saw some guy get hit by a bus so your fabric is unraveling so so someone is fucking with me and why is that news charlie youve thought someone was fucking with you since you were eight they have been probably but this time its real it could be real hey these are allbeef lil smokies sophies not a shikster after all shiksa whatever jane youre not helping with my problem what problem you have a problem charlies problem was that the trailing edge of his beta male imagination was digging at him like bamboo splinters under the fingernails while alpha males are often gifted with superior physical attributessize strength speed good looksselected by evolution over the eons by the strongest surviving and essentially getting all the girls the beta male gene has survived not by meeting and overcoming adversity but by anticipating and avoiding it that is when the alpha males were out charging after mastodons the beta males could imagine in advance that attacking what was essentially an angry woolly bulldozer with a pointy stick might be a losing proposition so they hung back at camp to console the grieving widows when alpha males set out to conquer neighboring tribes to count coups and take heads beta males could see in advance that in the event of a victory the influx of female slaves was going to leave a surplus of mateless women cast out for younger trophy models with nothing to do but salt down the heads and file the uncounted coups and some would find solace in the arms of any beta male smart enough to survive in the case of defeat well there was that widows thing again the beta male is seldom the strongest or the fastest but because he can anticipate danger he far outnumbers his alpha male competition the world is led by alpha males but the machinery of the world turns on the bearings of the beta male the problem charlies problem is that the beta male imagination has become superfluous in the face of modern society like the sabertoothed tigers fangs or the alpha males testosterone theres just more beta male imagination than can really be put to good use consequently a lot of beta males become hypochondriacs neurotics paranoids or develop an addiction to porn or video games because while the beta male imagination evolved to help him avoid danger as a side effect it also allows him fantasyonly access to power money and leggy modeltype females who in reality wouldnt kick him in the kidneys to get a bug off their shoe the rich fantasy life of the beta male may often spill over into reality manifesting in neargenius levels of selfdelusion in fact many beta males contrary to any empirical evidence actually believe that they are alpha males and have been endowed by their creator with advanced stealth charisma which although awesome in concept is totally undetectable by women not constructed from carbon fiber every time a supermodel divorces her rockstar husband the beta male secretly rejoices or more accurately feels great waves of unjustified hope and every time a beautiful movie star marries the beta male experiences a sense of lost opportunity the entire city of las vegasplastic opulence treasure for the taking vulgar towers and cocktail waitresses with improbable breastsis built on the selfdelusion of the beta male and beta male selfdelusion played no small part in charlie first approaching rachel that rainy day in february five years before when he had ducked into a clean welllighted place for books to get out of the storm and rachel granted him a shy smile over a stack of carson mccullers she was shelving he quickly convinced himself that it was because he was dripping with boyish charm when it was in fact simply because he was dripping youre dripping she said she had blue eyes fair skin and dark loose curls that fell around her face she gave him a sideways glancejust enough consideration to spur his beta male ego yeah thanks charlie said taking a step closer can i get you a towel or something nah im used to it youre dripping on cormac mccarthy sorry charlie wiped all the pretty horses with his sleeve while he tried to see if she had a nice figure under the floppy sweater and cargo pants do you come here often rachel took a second before responding she was wearing a name tag working inventory from a metal cart and she was pretty sure shed seen this guy in the store before so he wasnt being stupid he was being clever sort of she couldnt help it she laughed charlie shrugged damply and smiled im charlie asher rachel rachel said they shook hands rachel would you like to get a cup of coffee or something sometime that sort of depends charlie id need you to answer a few questions first of course charlie said if you dont mind i have some questions too he was thinking what do you look like naked and how long before i can check fine then rachel put down the ballad of the sad café and counted on her fingers do you have a job a car and a place to live and are the last two things the same thing she was twentyfive and had been single for a while shed learned to screen her applicants uh yes yes yes and no excellent are you gay shed been single for a while in san francisco i asked you out that means nothing ive had guys not realize they were gay until wed gone out a few times turns out thats my specialty wow youre kidding he looked her up and down and decided that she probably had a great figure under the baggy clothes i could see it going the other way but right answer okay ill have coffee with you not so fast what about my questions rachel threw out a hip and rolled her eyes sighed okay shoot i dont really have any i just didnt want you to think i was easy you asked me out thirty seconds after we met can you blame me there you were eyes and teethhair dry holding good books ask me do you think that theres any chance you know after we get to know each other that youll like me i mean can you see it happening it didnt matter that he was pushing itwhether he was sly or just awkward she was defenseless against his beta male charm sans charisma and she had her answer not a chance she lied i miss her charlie said and he looked away from his sister as if there was something in the sink that really really needed studying his shoulders shook with a sob and jane went to him and held him as he slumped to his knees i really miss her i know you do i hate this kitchen right there with you kid the good sister she was i see this kitchen and i see her face and i cant handle it yes you can you will it will get better maybe i should move or something you do what you think you need to but pain travels pretty well jane rubbed his shoulders and his neck as if his grief was a knot in a muscle that could be worked out under direct pressure after a few minutes he was back functioning sitting at the counter between sophie and jane drinking a cup of coffee you think im just imagining all this then jane sighed charlie rachel was the center of your universe anyone who saw you guys together knew that your life revolved around her with rachel gone its like you have no center nothing to ground you youre all wobbly and unstable so things seem unreal but you do have a center i do its you i dont have a rachel or anyone like her on the horizon but im not spinning out of control so youre saying i need to be selfcentered like you i guess i am do you think that makes me a bad person do you care good point are you going to be okay i need to go buy some yoga dvds im starting a class tomorrow if youre going to take a class then why do you need dvds i have to look like i know what im doing or no one will go out with me you going to be okay ill be okay i just cant go in the kitchen or look at anything in the apartment or listen to music or watch tv okay then have fun jane said tweaking the babys nose on the way out the door when she was gone charlie sat at the counter for a while looking at baby sophie strangely enough she was the only thing in the apartment that didnt remind him of rachel she was a stranger she looked at himthose wide blue eyeswith sort of an odd glazed look not with the adoration or wonder that you might expect more like shed been drinking and would be leaving as soon as she found her car keys sorry charlie said averting his gaze to a stack of unpaid bills by the phone he could feel the kid watching him wondering he thought how many terrycloth puppet people shed have to blow to get a decent father over here still he checked that she was securely strapped in her chair then went off to grab the undone laundry because he was in fact going to be a very good father beta males almost always make good fathers they tend to be steady and responsible the kind of guys a girl if she was resolved to do without the sevenfigure salary or the thirtysixinch vertical leap would want as a father for her children of course shed rather not have to sleep with him for that to happen but after youve been kicked to the curb by a few alpha males the idea of waking up in the arms of a guy who will adore you if for no other reason than gratitude for sex and will always be there even past the point where you can stand to have him around is a comfortable compromise for the beta male if nothing else is loyal he makes a great husband as well as a great best friend he will help you move and bring you soup when you are sick always considerate the beta male thanks a woman after sex and is often quick with an apology as well he makes a great house sitter especially if you arent especially attached to your house pets a beta male is trustworthy your girlfriend is generally in safe hands with a beta male friend unless of course she is a complete slut in fact the complete slut through history may be exclusively responsible for the survival of the beta male gene for loyal as he may be the beta male is helpless in the face of charging unimaginary bosoms and while the beta male has the potential to be a great husband and father the skills still need to be learned so for the next few weeks charlie did little but care for the tiny stranger in his house she was an alien reallya sort of eating pooping tantrum machineand he didnt understand anything about her species but as he tended to her talked to her lost a lot of sleep over her bathed her watched her nap and admonished her for the disgusting substances that oozed and urped out of her he started to fall in love one morning after a particularly active night of the feedandchange parade he awoke to find her staring goofily at the mobile over her crib and when she saw him she smiled that did it like her mother before her she set the course of his life with a smile and as it had with rachel that wet morning in the bookstore his soul lit up the weirdness the bizarre circumstances of rachels death the red glowing items in the shop the dark winged thing above the street all of it took a backseat to the new light of his life he didnt understand that she loved him unconditionallyso when he got up in the middle of the night to feed her he put on a shirt and combed his hair and tested to see that his breath was free of funk within minutes of getting poleaxed with affection for his daughter he started to develop a deep fear for her safety which over the course of a few days blossomed into a whole new garden of paranoia it looks like nerf world in here jane said one afternoon when she brought in the bills from the store and the checks for charlie to sign charlie had padded every sharp corner or edge in the apartment with foam rubber and duct tape put plastic covers on all of the electrical outlets childproofed locks on all cabinets installed new smoke carbon monoxide and radon detectors and activated the vchip on the tv so that now he was incapable of watching anything that didnt feature baby animals or learning the alphabet accidents are the number one cause of death among children in america charlie said but she cant even roll over on her stomach yet i want to be ready everything i read says that one day youre breastfeeding them and the next day you wake up and theyre dropping out of college he was changing the baby on the coffee table and had used ten baby wipes so far if jane had the count right i think that might be a metaphor you know for how fast they grow up well its done when shes ready to crawl why dont you just make a big foamrubber suit for her its easier than padding the world charlie its scarylooking in here you cant bring a woman here shed think youre nuts charlie looked at his sister for a long second without saying anything just frozen there holding a disposable diaper in one hand and his daughters ankles scissored between the fingers of the other when youre ready jane stumbled on i mean im not saying that youd bring a woman here okay because im not of course not im not saying that but you have to leave the apartment for one thing you need to go downstairs to the store ray has turned the pointofsale computer into some kind of dating service and the truant officer has stopped by three times looking for lily and i cant keep doing the accounts and trying to run things and do my job too charlie dad left you the business for a reason but theres no one to watch sophie you have mrs korjev and mrs ling right here in the building let one of them watch her hell ill watch her for a few hours in the evening if that will help im not going down there in the evening thats when things are radioactive jane set the stack of papers on the coffee table next to sophies head and backed away with her arms crossed play what you just said back in your head would you charlie did then shrugged okay that sounds a little crazy go make an appearance at the shop charlie just a few minutes to get your feet wet and put the fear of god in ray and lily okay ill finish changing her jane slid in between the couch and the coffee table nudging her brother out of the way in the process she knocked the dirty diaper to the floor where it fell open oh my god she gagged and turned her head another reason not to eat brown mustard huh charlie said you bastard he backed away okay im going downstairs youre sure you got this go jane said waving him out of the room with one hand while holding her nose with the other darkness gets uppity hey ray charlie said as he came down the steps into the storeroom he always tried to make a lot of noise on the steps and usually fired a loud and early hello to warn his employees that he was coming hed worked a number of jobs before coming back to take over the family business and had learned from experience that nobody liked a sneaky boss hey charlie ray said ray was out front sitting on a stool behind the counter he was pushing forty tall balding and moved through the world without ever turning his head he couldnt as a san francisco policeman hed caught a gangbangers bullet in the neck six years ago and that was the last time hed looked over his shoulder without using a mirror ray lived on a generous disability pension from the city and worked for charlie in exchange for free rent on his fourthfloor apartment thus keeping the transaction off both their books he spun around on the stool to face charlie heyuhi wanted to say that you know your situation i mean your loss everybody liked rachel you know if i can do anything it was the first time charlie had seen ray since the funeral so the awkwardness of secondary condolences had yet to be forded youve done more than enough by picking up my shifts whatcha working on charlie was trying desperately to not look at the various objects in the shop that were glowing dull red oh this ray rotated and pushed back so that charlie could see the computer screen where there were displayed rows of portraits of smiling young asian women its called desperate filipinas dotcom is this where you met miss loveyoulongtime that was not her name did lily tell you that that kid has problems yeah well kids charlie said suddenly noticing a matronly woman in tweed who was browsing the curio shelves at the front of the store she was carrying a porcelain frog that was glowing dull red ray clicked on one of the pictures which opened a profile look at this one boss it says shes into sculling he spun on his stool again and bounced his eyebrows at charlie charlie pulled his attention from the woman with the glowing frog and looked at the screen thats rowing ray no its not look it says she was a coxswain in college again with the eyebrow bounce he offered a high five also rowing charlie said leaving the excop hanging the person at the back of the boat who yells at the rowers is called the coxswain really ray said disappointed hed been married three times and been left by all three wives because of an inability to develop normal adult social skills ray reacted to the world as a cop and while many women found that attractive initially they expected him eventually to leave the attitude along with his service weapon in the coat closet when he arrived home he didnt when ray had first come to work at ashers secondhand it had taken two months for charlie to get him to stop ordering customers to move along theres nothing to see here ray spent a lot of time being disappointed in himself and humanity in general but dude rowing charlie said trying to make it all better he liked the excop in spite of his awkwardness ray was basically a good guy kindhearted and loyal hardworking and punctual but most important ray was losing his hair faster than charlie ray sighed maybe i should search for another web site whats a word that means that your standards are lower than the desperate charlie read down the page a little this woman has a masters degree in english lit from cambridge ray and look at her shes gorgeous and nineteen why is she desperate hey wait a minute a masters degree at nineteen this girl is too smart for me no shes not shes lying ray spun on the stool as if charlie had poked him in the ear with a pencil no ray look at her she looks like one of those asian models for sour apple flavored calamari treats they have that charlie pointed to the left side of the front window ray let me introduce you to chinatown chinatown this is ray ray chinatown ray smiled embarrassed there was a store two blocks up that sold nothing but dried shark parts the windows full of pictures of beautiful chinese women holding shark spleens and eyeballs like theyd just received an academy award well the last woman i met through here did have a few errors and omissions in her profile like charlie was watching the woman in tweed with the glowing frog who was approaching the counter well she said that she was twentythree five feet tall a hundred five pounds so i thought okay i can have fun with a petite woman turns out it was a hundred and five kilos so not what you expected charlie said he smiled at the approaching woman feeling panic rise she was going to buy the frog five foottwothirty she was built like a mailbox i might have gotten past that but she wasnt even twentythree she was sixtythree one of her grandsons tried to sell her to me maam im sorry you cant buy that charlie said to the woman you hear the expression all the time ray went on but you hardly ever meet anyone really trying to sell his own grandmother why not the woman asked fifty bucks ray said thats outrageous the woman said its marked ten no its fifty for the grandmother ray is dating charlie said the frog is not for sale maam im sorry its defective then why do you have it on the shelf why is it marked for sale i dont see any defect evidently she couldnt see that the goofy porcelain frog was not only glowing in her hands it had started to pulsate charlie reached across the counter and snatched it away from her its radioactive maam im sorry you cant buy it i wasnt dating her ray said i just flew to the philippines to meet her it is not radioactive the woman said youre just trying to jack up the price fine ill give you twenty for it no maam public safety charlie said trying to look concerned holding the frog to his chest as if shielding her from its dangerous energy and its clearly ridiculous youll note that this frog is playing a banjo with only two strings a travesty really why dont you let my colleague show you something in a cymbalplaying monkey ray could you show this young woman something in a monkey please charlie hoped that the young woman would win him points the woman backed away from the counter holding her purse before her like a shield im not sure i want to buy anything from you wack jobs hey ray protested as if to say that there was only one wack job on duty and he wasnt it then she did it she quickstepped to a rack of shoes and picked up a pair of sizetwelve red converse all stars they too were glowing i want these no charlie tossed the frog over his shoulder to ray who fumbled it and almost dropped it those arent for sale either the tweed woman backed away toward the door holding the sneakers behind her charlie stalked her down the aisle taking the occasional grab at the all stars give them when the woman buttbumped into the front door and the bell over the jamb jingled she looked up and charlie made his move faking hard left then going right reaching around her and grabbing the laces of the sneakers as well as a scoop of big tweedy ass in the bargain he quickstepped back toward the counter tossed the sneakers to ray and then turned and fell into a sumo stance to challenge the tweed woman she was still at the door looking as if she couldnt decide to be terrified or disgusted you people need to be put away im reporting you to the better business bureau and the local merchants association and you mr asher can tell ms severo that i will be back and with that she was through the door and gone charlie turned to ray ms severo lily she was here to see lily truant officer ray said shes been in a couple of times you might have said something i didnt want to lose the sale so lily ducks out the back when she sees her coming the woman also wanted to check with you that the notes for lilys absences were legitimate i vouched well lily is going back to school and as of right now im back to work thats great i took this call todayan estate in pacific heights lots of nice womens clothes ray tapped a piece of notepaper on the counter im not really qualified to handle it ill do it but first we have a lot to catch up on flip the closed sign and lock the front door would you ray ray didnt move sure butcharlie are you sure that youre ready to go back to work he nodded to the sneakers and frog on the counter oh those i think theres something wrong with them you dont see anything unusual about those two items ray looked again nope or that once i took the frog away from her she went right for a pair of sneakers that are clearly not her size ray weighed the truth against the sweet deal he had here with an apartment and underthetable income and a boss that had really been a decent guy before he went and he said yeah there was something strange about her aha said charlie i just wish i knew where i could get a geiger counter i have a geiger counter ray said you do sure you want me to get it maybe later charlie said just lock up and help me gather up some of the merchandise over the next hour ray watched as charlie moved a set of what seemed randomly chosen items from the store to the back room directing him to under no circumstances put them back out or sell them to anyone then he retrieved the geiger counter that hed obtained on a sweet trade for a stringless oversized tennis racket and tested each item as charlie instructed and of course they were as inert as dirt and you dont see any glowing or pulsating or anything in this pile charlie asked sorry ray shook his head feeling a little embarrassed that he was witnessing this good first day back to work though ray said trying to make it all better maybe you should call it a day go check on the baby and make that estate call in the morning ill box this stuff up and mark it so lily wont sell or trade it okay charlie said but dont throw it out either im going to figure this out you betcha boss see you in the morning yeah thanks ray you can go home when you finish charlie went back to his apartment checking his hands the whole way to see if any of the red glow from the pile of objects had rubbed off on them but they seemed normal he sent jane home fed and bathed sophie and read her to sleep with a few pages from slaughterhousefive then went to bed early and slept fitfully he awoke the next morning in a haze then sat bolt upright in bed eyes wide and heart pounding when he saw the note sitting on the nightstand another one then he noticed that this time it wasnt his handwriting and the number was obviously a phone number and he sighed it was the estate appointment that ray had made for him hed put it on the nightstand so he wouldnt forget mr michael mainheart it read then upscale womens clothing and furs with a double underline the phone number had a local exchange he picked up the note and under it was a second piece of notepaper this one with the same name written in his own handwriting and under it the numeral he didnt remember writing any of it at that moment something large and dark passed by the secondstory bedroom window but by the time he looked up it was gone a blanket of fog lay over the bay and from pacific heights the great orange towers of the golden gate bridge jutted through the fog bank like carrots from the faces of sleeping conjoined twin snowmen in the heights the morning sun had already opened the sky and workmen were scurrying about tending yards and gardens around the mansions when he arrived at the home of michael mainheart the first thing charlie noticed was that no one noticed him there were two guys working in the yard to whom charlie waved as he passed but they did not wave back then the mailman who was coming off the big porch drove him off the walkway into the dewy grass without so much as an excuse me excuse me charlie said sarcastically but the mailman was wearing headphones and listening to something that was inspiring him to bob his head like a pigeon feeding on amphetamines and he bopped on charlie was going to shout something devastatingly clever then thought better of it for although it had been some years since hed heard of a postal employee perpetrating a massacre as long as the term going postal referred to anything besides choosing a shipping carrier he felt he shouldnt press his luck called a wack job by a complete stranger one day and shouldered off the sidewalk by a civil servant the next this city was becoming a jungle charlie rang the bell and waited to the side of the twelvefoot leadedglass door a minute later he heard light shuffling steps approaching and a diminutive silhouette moved behind the glass the door swung open slowly mr asher said michael mainheart thank you for coming the old man was swimming in a houndstooth suit that he must have bought thirty years ago when he was a more robust fellow when he shook charlies hand his skin felt like an old wonton wrapper cool and a little powdery charlie tried not to shudder as the old man led him into a grand marble rotunda with leadedglass windows running to a vaulted fortyfoot ceiling and a circular staircase that swept up to a landing that led off to the upper wings of the house charlie had often wondered what it was like to have a house with wings how would you ever find your car keys come this way mainheart said ill show you where my wife kept her clothes im sorry about your loss charlie said automatically hed been on scores of estate calls you dont want to come off as some kind of vulture his father used to say always compliment the merchandise it might be a piece of crap to you but they might have a lot of their soul poured into it compliment but never covet you can make a profit and preserve everyones dignity in the process holy shit charlie said as he followed the old man into a walkin closet the size of his own apartment i meanyour wife had exquisite taste mr mainheart there was row upon row of designer couture clothing everything from evening gowns to racks two tiers high of knit suits arranged by color and level of formalityan opulent rainbow of silk and linen and wool cashmere sweaters coats capes jackets skirts blouses lingerie the closet was shaped like a t with a large vanity and mirror at the apex and accessories on each wing even the closet with wings shoes on one side belts scarves and handbags on the other a whole wing of shoes italian and french handmade from the skins of animals who had led happy blemishfree lives fulllength mirrors flanked the vanity at the end of the closet and charlie caught the reflection of himself and michael mainheart in the mirror he in his secondhand gray pinstripe and mainheart in his illfitting houndstooth studies in gray and black stark and lifelesslooking in this vibrant garden the old man went to the chair at the vanity and sat down with a creak and a wheeze i expect it will take you some time to assess it he said charlie stood in the middle of the closet and looked around for a second before replying it depends mr mainheart on what you want to part with all of it every stitch i cant stand the feel of her in here his voice broke i want it gone he looked away from charlie at the shoe wing trying not to show that he was tearing up i understand charlie said not sure what to say this collection was completely out of his league no you dont understand young man you couldnt understand emily was my life i got up in the morning for her i went to work for her i built a business for her i couldnt wait to get home at night to tell her about my day i went to bed with her and i dreamed about her when i slept she was my passion my wife my best friend the love of my life and one day without warning she was gone and my life is a void you couldnt possibly understand but charlie did do you have any children mr mainheart two sons they came back for the funeral then they went home to their own families they offer to do whatever they can but they cant charlie finished for him no one can now the old man looked up at him his face as bereft and barren as a mummified basset hound i just want to die dont say that charlie said because thats what you say that feeling will pass which he said because everyone had been saying it to him as far as he knew he was just slinging bullshit clichés she was mainhearts voice caught on the edge of a sob a strong man at once overcome by his grief and embarrassed that he was showing it i know charlie said thinking about how rachel still occupied that place in his heart and when he turned in the kitchen to say something to her and she wasnt there it took his breath she was i know charlie interrupted trying to give the old man a pass because he knew what mainheart was feeling she was meaning and order and light and now that shes gone chaos falls like a dark leaden cloud she was so phenomenally stupid what charlie looked up so quickly he heard a vertebra pop in his neck hadnt seen that coming the dumb broad ate silica gel mainheart said irritated as well as agonized what charlie was shaking his head as if trying to rattle something loose silica gel what silica gel silica gel silica gel you idiot charlie felt as if he should shout the name of some arcane stuff back at him well symethicone symethicone symethicone you buttnugget instead he said the stuff fake breasts are made of she ate that the image of a welldressed older woman macking on a goopish spoonful of artificial boob spooge was running across the lobes of his brain like a stuttering nightmare mainheart pushed himself to his feet on the vanity no the little packets of stuff they pack in with electronic equipment and cameras the do not eat stuff exactly but it says right on the packetshe ate that yes the furrier put packets of it in with her furs when he installed that cabinet mainheart pointed charlie turned and behind the large closet door where they had entered was a lighted glass cabinetinside hung a dozen or so fur coats the cabinet probably had its own airconditioning unit to control the humidity but that wasnt what charlie was noticing even under the recessed fluorescent light inside the cabinet one of the coats was clearly glowing red and pulsating he turned back to mainheart slowly trying not to overreact not sure in fact what would constitute an overreaction in this case so he tried to sound calm but not willing to take any shit mr mainheart i appreciate your loss but is there something more going on here than youve told me im sorry i dont understand what you mean i mean charlie said why of all the usedclothing dealers in the bay area did you decide to call me there are people who are much more qualified to deal with a collection of this size and quality charlie stormed over to the fur cabinet and pulled open the door it made a flooftha sound that the seal on a refrigerator door makes when opened he grabbed the glowing jacketfox fur it appeared to be or was it this did the call have something to do with this charlie brandished the jacket like he was holding a murder weapon before the accused in short he thought about adding are you fucking with me you were the first usedclothing dealer in the phone book charlie let the jacket drop ashers secondhand starts with an a mainheart said slowly carefullyobviously resisting the urge to call charlie an idiot again so it has nothing to do with this jacket well it has something to do with that jacket id like you to take it away with all the rest of it oh charlie said trying to recover mr mainheart i appreciate the call and this is certainly a beautiful collection amazing really but im not equipped to take on this kind of inventory and ill be honest with you even though my father would be spinning in his grave for telling you this there is probably a million dollars worth of clothes in this closet maybe more and given the time and space to resell it its probably worth a quarter of that i just dont have that kind of money we can work something out mainheart said just to get it out of the house i could take some of it on consignment i suppose five hundred dollars what give me five hundred dollars and get it out of here by tomorrow and its yours charlie started to object but he could feel what felt like the ghost of his father rising up to bonk him on the head with a spittoon if he didnt stop himself we provide a valuable service son we are like an orphanage to art and artifact because we are willing to handle the unwanted we give them value i couldnt do that mr mainheart i feel as if id be taking advantage of your grief oh for christs sake you fucking loser you are no son of mine i have no son was that the ghost of charlies father rattling chains in his head why then did it have the voice and vocabulary of lily can a conscience be greedy you would be doing me a favor mr asher a huge favor if you dont take it my next call is to the goodwill i promised emily that if something ever happened to her that i wouldnt just give her things away please and there was so much pain in the old mans voice that charlie had to look away charlie felt for the old man because he did understand he couldnt do anything to help couldnt say it will get better like everyone kept saying to him it wasnt getting better different but not better and this fellow had fifty more years in which to pack his hopes or in his case his history let me think about it check into storage if i can handle it ill call you tomorrow would that be all right id be grateful mainheart said then for no reason that he could think of charlie said may i take this jacket with me as an example of the quality of the collection in case i have to divide it among other dealers that would be fine let me show you out as they passed into the rotunda a shadow passed across the leadedglass windows three stories up a large shadow charlie paused on the steps and waited for the old man to react but he just tottered on down the staircase leaning heavily on the railing as he went when mainheart reached the door he turned to charlie extending his hand im sorry about that uh outburst upstairs i havent been myself since as the old man began to open the door a figure dropped outside casting the silhouette of a bird as tall as a man through the glass no charlie dove forward knocking the old man aside and slamming the door on the great birds head the heavy black beak stabbing through and snapping like hedge clippers rattling an umbrella stand and scattering its contents across the marble floor charlies face was only inches from the birds eye and he shoved the door with his shoulder trying to keep the beak from snapping off one of his hands the birds claws raked against the glass cracking one of the thick beveled panels as the animal thrashed to free itself charlie threw his hip against the doorjamb then slid down it dropped the fox jacket and snatched one of the umbrellas from the floor he stabbed up into the birds neck feathers but lost his purchase on the doorjambone of the black talons snaked through the opening and raked across his forearm cutting through his jacket his shirtsleeve and into the flesh charlie shoved the umbrella with all he had driving the birds head back through the opening the raven let out a screech and took flight its wings making a great whooshing noise as it went charlie lay on his back out of breath staring at the leadedglass panels as if any moment the shadow of the giant raven would come back then he looked to michael mainheart who lay crumpled on his side like a stringless marionette beside his head lay a cane with an ivory handle that had been carved into the shape of a polar bear that had fallen from the umbrella stand the cane was glowing red the old man was not breathing well thats fucked up charlie said variable speed heroes in the alley behind ashers secondhand the emperor of san francisco handfed olive focaccia to the troops and tried to keep dog snot from fouling his breakfast patience bummer the emperor said to the boston terrier who was leaping at the dayold wheel of flat bread like a furry super ball while lazarus the solemn golden retriever stood by waiting for his share bummer snorted an impatient reply thus the dog snot hed worked up a furious appetite because breakfast was running late today the emperor had slept on a bench by the maritime museum and during the night his arthritic knee had snaked out of his wool overcoat into the damp cold making the walk to north beach and the italian bakery that gave them free dayold a slow and painful ordeal the emperor groaned and sat down on an empty milk crate he was a great rolling bear of a man his shoulders broad but a little broken from carrying the weight of the city a white tangle of hair and beard wreathed his face like a storm cloud as far as he could remember he and the troops had patrolled the city streets forever but upon further consideration it might have just been since wednesday he wasnt entirely sure the emperor decided to make a proclamation to the troops about the importance of compassion in the face of the rising tide of heinous fuckery and political weaselocity in the nearby kingdom of the united states he found his audience was most attentive to his proclamations when the meatlaced focaccia were still nuzzled in the larder of his overcoat pockets and presently a pepperoni and parmesan reposed fragrant in the woolly depths so the royal hounds were rapt but just as he cleared his throat to begin a cargo van came screeching around the corner went up on two wheels as it plowed through a row of garbage cans and slid to a stop not fifty feet away the driversside door flew open and a thin man in a suit leapt out carrying a cane and a womans fur coat and made a beeline for the back door of ashers but before he got two steps the man fell to the concrete as if hit from behind then rolled on his back and began flailing at the air with the cane and the coat the emperor who knew most everyone recognized charlie asher bummer erupted into a fit of yapping but the more levelheaded lazarus growled once and took off toward charlie lazarus the emperor shouted but the retriever charged on followed now by his bugeyed brother in arms charlie was back on his feet and swinging the cane as if he was fencing with some phantom using the coat like a shield living on the street the emperor had seen a lot of people battling with unseen demons but charlie asher was apparently scoring some hits the cane was making a thwacking noise against what appeared to be thin airbut no there was something there a shadow of some sort the emperor climbed to his feet and limped into the fray but before he got two steps lazarus had leapt and appeared to be attacking charlie but he soared over the shopkeeper and snapped at a spot above his headthen hung there his jaws sunk into the substantial neck of thin air charlie took advantage of the distraction stepped back and swung the cane above the levitating golden retriever there was a smack and lazarus let go but now bummer launched himself at the invisible foe he missed whatever was there and ended up performing a doggy swish shot into a garbage can charlie made for the steel door of ashers again but found it locked and as he reached for his keys something caught him from behind let go fuckface the shade screeched the fur coat charlie was holding appeared to be swept out of his hand and was pulled straight up over the fourstory building and out of sight charlie turned and held the cane at ready but whatever had been there seemed to be gone now arent you just supposed to sit above the door and nevermore and be poetic and stuff he shouted at the sky then for good measure added you evil fuck lazarus barked then whined a sharp and metallic yapping rose from bummers garbage can well you dont see that every day said the emperor as he limped up to charlie you could see that well no not really merely a shadow but i could see that something was there there was something there wasnt there charlie charlie nodded trying to catch his breath it will be back it followed me across the city he dug into his pocket for his keys you guys should duck into the store with me your majesty of course charlie knew the emperor every san franciscan knew the emperor the emperor smiled thats very kind of you but we will be perfectly safe for now i need to free my charge from his galvanized prison the big man tipped the garbage can and bummer emerged snorting and tossing his head as if ready to tear the ass out of any man or beast foolhardy enough to cross him and he would have as long as they were kneehigh or shorter charlie was still having trouble with the key he knew he should have had the lock replaced but it worked if you finessed it a little so hed never made it a priority who the hell thought youd ever have to get in quick to escape a giant bird then he heard a screech and turned to see not one but two huge ravens coming over the roof and diving into the alley the dogs arfed a frantic barking salvo at the avian intruders and charlie put so much body english into wiggling the key in the lock that he felt an atrophied dancing muscle tear in his hip theyre back cover me charlie threw the cane to the emperor and braced himself for the impact but as soon as the cane touched the old mans hand the birds were gone you could almost hear the pop of the air replacing the space they had taken up the dogs caught themselves in midruff bummer whimpered what the emperor said what theyre gone the emperor looked at the sky youre sure for now i saw two shadows really saw them this time the emperor said yes there were two this time what are they i have no idea but when you took the cane theywell they disappeared you really saw them im sure of it like smoke with a purpose finally the key turned in the lock and the door to ashers back room swung open you should come in rest ill order something to eat no no the men and i must be on our rounds ive decided to make a proclamation this morning and we need to see the printer youll be needing this the emperor presented the cane to charlie like he was turning over a sword of the realm charlie started to take it then thought better of it your majesty i think youd better keep that it looks as if you might be able to use it charlie nodded toward the emperors creaky knee the emperor held the cane steady i am not a worshiper of the material you know i understand that i am a firm believer that desire is the source of most of human suffering youre aware and no culprit is more heinous than desire for material gain i run my business based on those very principles still i insist you keep the caneas a favor to me if you would charlie found himself affecting the emperors formal speech patterns as if somehow he had been transported to a royal court where a nobleman was distinguished by bread crumbs in his beard and the royal guard were not above licking their balls well as a favor i will accept it is a fine piece of craftsmanship but more importantly it will permit you to make your rounds in good time the emperor now betrayed the desire in his heart as he let fly a wide grin and hugged the cane to his chest it is fine indeed charlie i must confess something to you but i ask you to grant me the credulity due a man who has just shared witness with a friend of two giant ravenshaped shades of course charlie smiled when even a moment before he would have thought his smile lost somewhere in the months past i hope you wont think me base but the second i touched this i felt as if i had been waiting for it my whole life then for no reason that he could think of charlie said i know a few minutes before inside the store lily had been brooding it wasnt her general brood the reaction to a world where everyone was stupid and life was meaningless and the mere act of living was futile especially if your mother forgot to get coffee at the store this one was a more specific brood that had started out when she arrived at work and ray had pointed out that it was her turn to wear the vacuuming tiara and insisted that if she wore the tiara she actually vacuum the store in fact she liked wearing the rhinestone tiara that charlie in a move of blatant bourgeois sneakiness had designated be worn by whoever did the vacuuming and sweeping each day and no other time it was the vacuuming and sweeping she objected to she felt manipulated used and generally taken advantage of and not in the fun way but today after shed put the tiara and the vacuum away and had finally gotten a couple of cups of coffee in her system the brooding had gone on building to fullscale angst when it began to dawn on her that she was going to have to figure out this collegecareer thing because despite what the great big book of death said she had not been chosen as a dark minion of destruction fuck she stood in the back room looking at all the items that charlie had piled there the day before shoes lamps umbrellas porcelain figures toys a couple of books and an old blackandwhite television and a painting of a clown on black velvet he said this stuff was glowing she asked ray who stood in the doorway to the store yes he made me check it all with my geiger counter ray why the fuck do you have a geiger counter lily why do you have a nose stud shaped like a bat lily ignored the question and picked up the ceramic frog from the night before which now had a note taped to it that read do not sell or display in charlies meticulous blockletter printing this was one of the things this that was the first one he freaked out about said ray matteroffactly the truant officer tried to buy it that started it all lily was shaken she backed over to charlies desk and sat in the squeaky oak swivel chair do you see anything glowing or pulsating ray have you ever ray shook his head hes under a lot of stress losing rachel and taking care of the baby i think maybe he needs to get some help i know after i had to leave the force ray paused there was a commotion going on out in the alley dogs barking and people shouting then someone was working a key in the lock of the back door a second later charlie came in a little breathless his clothes smudged here and there with grime one sleeve of his jacket torn and bloodstained asher lily said youre hurt she quickly vacated his chair while ray took charlie by the shoulders and sat him down im fine charlie said no big deal ill get the firstaid kit ray said get that jacket off of him lily im fine charlie said quit talking about me like im not here hes delirious lily said trying to pry charlie out of his jacket do you have any painkillers ray i dont need painkillers charlie said shut up asher theyre not for you lily said automatically then she considered the book rays story the notes on all the items in the back room and she shuddered it appeared that charlie asher might not be the hapless geek she always thought him to be sorry boss let us help you ray came back from the front with a small plastic firstaid kit he peeled back charlies sleeve and began to clean the wounds with gauze and peroxide what happened nothing charlie said i slipped and fell in some gravel the wounds pretty cleanno gravel in it that must have been some fall long story charlie sighed ouch what was all the noise in the alley lily asked needing badly to go smoke but unable to pull herself away she just couldnt imagine that charlie asher was the one how could it be him he was so so unworthy he didnt understand the dark underbelly of life the way she did yet he was the one seeing the glowing objects he was it she was crestfallen just the emperors dogs after a seagull in the dumpster no big deal i fell off a porch in pacific heights the estate ray said howd that go not well the husband was griefstricken and had a heart attack while i was there youre kidding no he just sort of became overwhelmed thinking about his wife and collapsed i gave him cpr until the emts came and took him off to the hospital so lily said did you get theuhdid you get anything special what charlies eyes went wide what do you mean special there was nothing special chill boss i just meant will we get the grandmas clothes hes it lily thought the fucker charlie shook his head i dont know its so strange the whole thing is so strange he shuddered when he said it strange how lily said strange in a cool and dark way or strange because youre asher and youre out of it most of the time lily ray snapped go out front dust something youre not the boss of me ray im just showing my concern its okay ray charlie looked like he was considering how exactly to define strange and not coming up with anything that was working finally he said well for one thing this womans estate is way out of our league the husband said he called me because we were the first secondhand store in the phone book but he doesnt seem like the kind of man to do something like that thats not that strange lily said just confess she thought you said that he was griefstricken ray said dabbing antibiotic ointment on charlies cuts maybe hes doing things differently yes and he was angry at his wife too for the way she died how lily asked she ate silica gel charlie said lily looked at ray for an explanation because silica gel sounded technogeeky which was rays particular field of geekdom ray said its the antidesiccant that they pack with electronics and other things that are sensitive to humidity the do not eat stuff lily said oh my god thats so stupid everyone knows you dont eat the do not eat stuff charlie said mr mainheart was pretty broken up well i guess so lily said he married a complete fucktard charlie cringed lily thats not appropriate lily shrugged and rolled her eyes she hated it when charlie dropped into dad mode okay okay im going outside to smoke no charlie jumped out of the chair and put himself between lily and the back door out front from now on if you have to smoke you go out front but you said that i look like a child hooker when i smoke out front ive reassessed youve matured lily closed one eye to see if she could better glimpse into his soul and thus figure out his true agenda she smoothed over her black vinyl skirt which made a tortured squeaking noise at the touch youre trying to say i have a big butt arent you i absolutely am saying no such thing charlie insisted i am simply saying that your presence in front of the store is an asset and will probably attract business from the tourists on the cable car oh okay lily snatched her box of cloves off the desk and headed out past the counter and outside to brood grieve really because as much as she had hoped she was not death the book was charlies that evening charlie was watching the store wondering why he had lied to his employees when he saw a flash of red passing by the front window a second later a strikingly pale redhead came through the door she was wearing a short black cocktail dress and black fuckme pumps she strode up the aisle like she was auditioning for a music video her hair cascaded in long curls around her shoulders and down her back like a great auburn veil her eyes were emerald green and when she saw him looking she smiled and stopped some ten feet away charlie felt an almost painful jolt that seemed to emanate from somewhere in the area of his groin and after a second he recognized it as an autonomic lust response he hadnt felt anything like that since rachel had passed and he felt vaguely ashamed she was examining him looking him over like you would examine a used car he was sure he must be blushing hi charlie said can i help you the redhead smiled again just a little and reached into a small black bag that he hadnt noticed shed been carrying i found this she said holding up a silver cigarette case something charlie didnt see very often anymore even in the secondhand business it was glowing pulsating like the objects in the back room i was in the neighborhood and something made me think that this belonged here she moved to the counter opposite charlie and set the cigarette case down in front of him charlie could barely move he stared at her not even conscious that to avoid her eyes he was staring at her cleavage and she appeared to be looking around his head and shoulders as if following the path of insects that were buzzing around him touch me she said huh he looked up saw she was serious she held out her hand her nails were manicured and painted the same deep red as her lipstick he took her hand as soon as she touched him she pulled away youre warm thanks in that moment he realized that she wasnt her fingers had been icecold then youre not one of us he tried to think of what us might be irish low blood pressure nymphomaniac why did he even think that us what do you mean us she backed away a step no you dont just take the weak and the sick do you you take anyone take what do you mean take you dont even know do you know what charlie was getting very nervous as a beta male he found it difficult enough to function under the attention of a beautiful woman but she was just plain spooky wait can you see this thing glowing he held out the cigarette case no glow it just felt like it belonged here she said whats your name charlie asher this is ashers well charlie you seem like a nice guy and i dont know exactly what you are and it doesnt seem like you know you dont do you ive been going through some changes charlie said wondering why he felt compelled to share this at all the redhead nodded as if confirming something to herself okay i know what its like to uh to find yourself thrown into a situation where forces beyond your control are changing you into someone something you dont have an owners manual for i understand what it is to not know but someone somewhere does know someone can tell you whats going on what are you talking about but he knew what she was talking about what he didnt know was how she could possibly know you make people die dont you charlie she said it like she had worked up the courage to tell him that he had some spinach in his teeth more of a service to him than an accusation how do you how did she because its what i do not like you but its what i do find them charlie backtrack and find whoever was there when your world changed charlie looked at her then at the cigarette case then at the redhead again who was no longer smiling but was stepping backward toward the door trying to stay in touch with normal he focused on the cigarette case and said i suppose i can do an appraisal he heard the bell over the door jingle and when he looked up she was gone he didnt see her moving by the windows on either side of the door she was just gone he ran to the front of the store and out the door onto the sidewalk the mason street cable car was just topping the hill up by california street and he could hear the bell there was a thin fog coming up from the bay that threw colorful halos around the neon signs of the other businesses but there was no striking redhead on the street he went to the corner and looked down vallejo but again no redhead just the emperor sitting against the building with his dogs good evening charlie your majesty did you see a redhead go by here just now oh yes spoke to her im not sure you have a chance there charlie i believe shes spoken for and she did warn me to stay away from you why did she say why she said that you were death i am charlie said am i his breath caught in his throat as the day played back in his head what if i am you know son the emperor said i am not an expert in dealing with the fairer sex but you might want to save that bit of information until the third date or so after theyve gotten to know you a little thanatoast while charlies beta male imagination may have often turned him toward timidity and even paranoia when it came to accepting the unacceptable it served him like kevlar toilet paperbulletproof if a tad disagreeable in application the inability to believe the unbelievable would not be his downfall charlie asher would never be a bug splattered on the smoky windscreen of dull imagination he knew that all the things that had happened to him in the last day were outside of the limits of possibility for most people and since his only corroborating witness was a man who believed himself to be the emperor of san francisco charlie knew he would never be able to convince anyone that he had been pursued and attacked by giant foulmouthed ravens and then declared the tour guide to the undiscovered country by a sultry oracle in fuckme pumps not even jane would give him that kind of quarter only one person would have could have and for the tenthousandth time he felt rachels absence collapsing in his chest like a miniature black hole thus sophie became his coconspirator the tiny kid dressed in elmo overalls and baby doc martens courtesy of aunt jane was propped up in her car seat on the breakfast bar next to the goldfish bowl charlie had bought her six big goldfish about the time shed started to notice moving objects a girl needs pets hed named them after tv lawyers currently matlock was tracking perry mason trying to eat a long strand of fish doo that was trailing out of perrys poop chute sophie was starting to show some of her mothers dark hair and if charlie saw it right the same expression of bemused affection toward him plus a drool slick so i am death charlie said as he tried to construct a tunafish sandwich daddy is death sweetie he checked the toast not trusting the popup mechanism because the toaster people sometimes just liked to fuck with you death charlie said as the can opener slipped and he barked his bandaged hand on the counter dammit sophie gurgled and let loose a happy baby burble which charlie took to mean do tell daddy please go on pray tell i cant even leave the house for fear of someone dropping dead at my feet im death honey sure you laugh now but youll never get into a good preschool with a father who puts people down for their dirt nap sophie blew a spit bubble of sympathy charlie popped the toast up manually it was a little rare but if he pushed it down again it would burn unless he watched it every second and popped it up manually again so now hed probably be infected with some rare and debilitating undercooked toast pathogen mad toast disease fucking toaster people this is the toast of death young lady he showed her the toast deaths toast he put the toast on the counter and went back to attacking the tuna can maybe she was speaking figuratively i mean maybe the redhead just meant that i was you know deadly boring of course that didnt really explain all the other weird stuff that had been happening you think he asked sophie he looked for an answer and the kid was wearing that rachelesque smartass grin minus teeth she was enjoying his torment and strangely enough he felt better knowing that the can opener slipped again spurting tuna juice on his shirt and sending his toast scooting to the floor and now there was fuzz on it fuzz on his toast fuzz on the toast of death what the hell good was it to be the lord of the underworld if there was fuzz on your underdone toast fuck he snatched the toast from the floor and sent it sailing by sophie into the living room the baby followed it with her eyes then looked back at her father with a delighted squeal as if saying do it again daddy do it again charlie picked her up out of the car seat and held her tight smelling her soursweet baby smell his tears squeezing out onto her overalls he could do this if rachel was here but he couldnt he wouldnt without her he just wouldnt go out that was the solution the only way to keep the people of san francisco safe was to stay in his apartment so for the next four days he stayed in the apartment with sophie sending mrs ling from upstairs out for groceries and he was accumulating a fairly large collection of vegetables for which he had no name nor any idea of how to prepare as mrs ling regardless of what he put on the list always did her shopping in the markets of chinatown and after two days when a new name appeared on the message pad next to his bed charlie responded by hiding the message pad under the phone book in a kitchen drawer it was on day five that he saw the shadow of a raven against the roof entrance of the building across the street at first he wasnt sure whether it was a giant raven or just a normalsized raven projecting a shadow but when he realized that it was noon and any normal shadow would be cast straight down the tiny raven of denial vanished in a wisp he pulled the blinds on that side of the apartment and sat in the locked bedroom with sophie a box of pampers a basket of produce a sixpack each of baby formula and orange soda and hid out until the phone rang what do you think youre doing said a very deep mans voice on the other end of the line are you insane charlie was taken aback from the caller id hed expected a wrong number im eating this thing i think is either a melon or a squash he looked at the green thing which tasted like a melon but looked more like a squash with spikes mrs ling had called it shutupandeatitgoodforyou the man said youre screwing up you have a job to do do what the book says or everything that means anything to you will be taken away i mean it what book who is this charlie asked he thought the voice sounded familiar and it immediately sent him into alarm mode for some reason i cant tell you that im sorry said the man i really am ive got caller id you nit i know where youre calling from oops said the man you should have thought of that what kind of ominous power of darkness do you think you are if you dont even block caller id the little readout on the phone said fresh music and a number charlie called the number back but no one answered he ran to the kitchen dug the phone book out of the drawer and looked up fresh music it was a record store off upper market in the castro district the phone rang again and he grabbed the handset off the counter so violently he nearly chipped a tooth in answering you merciless bastard charlie screamed into the phone do you have any idea what ive been going through you heartless monster well fuck you asher lily said just because im a kid doesnt mean i dont have feelings and she hung up charlie called back ashers secondhand lily answered familyowned by bourgeoisie douche waffles for over thirty years lily im sorry i thought you were someone else what did you call about moi lily said je me fous de ta gueule espèce de gaufre de douche lily stop speaking french i said i was sorry theres a cop down here to see you she said charlie had sophie strapped to his chest like a terrorist baby bomb when he came down the back steps she had just gotten to the point where she could hold up her head so he had strapped her in faceout so she could look around the way her arms and legs waved around as charlie walked she looked as if she was skydiving and using a skinny nerd as a parachute the cop stood at the counter opposite lily looking like a cognac ad in an italiancut doublebreasted suit in indigo raw silk with a buff linen shirt and yellow tie he was about fifty hispanic lean with sharp facial features and the aspect of a predatory bird his hair was combed straight back and the gray streaks at the temples made it appear that he was moving toward you even when he stood still inspector alphonse rivera the cop said extending his hand thanks for coming down the young lady said you were working last monday night monday the day hed battled the ravens back in the alley the day the pale redhead had come into the store you dont have to tell him anything asher lily said obviously renewing her loyalty in spite of his douche wafflosity thanks lily why dont you take a break and go see how things are going in the abyss she grumbled then got something out of the drawer under the register presumably her cigarettes and retreated out the back door why isnt that kid in school rivera asked shes special charlie said you know homeschooled that what makes her so cheerful shes studying the existentialists this month asked for a study day last week to kill an arab on the beach rivera smiled and charlie relaxed a little he produced a photograph from his breast pocket and held it out to charlie sophie made as if to grab it the photograph was of an older gentleman in his sunday best standing on the steps of a church charlie recognized the cathedral of sts peter and paul which was just a few blocks away on washington square did you see this man monday night he was wearing a charcoal overcoat and a hat that night no im sorry i didnt charlie said and he hadnt i was here in the store until about ten we had a few customers but not this fellow are you sure his name is james omalley he isnt well cancer his wife said he went out for a walk about dusk monday night and he never came back no im sorry charlie said did you ask the cablecar operator already talked to the guys working this line that night we think he may have collapsed somewhere and we havent found him it doesnt look good after this long charlie nodded trying to look thoughtful he was so relieved that the cop wasnt here about anything connected with him that he was almost giddy maybe you should ask the emperoryou know him right he sees more of the nooks and crannies of the city than most of us rivera cringed at the mention of the emperor but then relaxed into another smile thats a good idea mr asher ill see if i can track him down he handed charlie a card if you remember anything give me a call would you i will uh inspector charlie said and rivera paused a few steps from the counter isnt this sort of a routine case for an inspector to be investigating yes normally uniform personnel would handle something like this but it may relate to something else im working on so you get me instead oh okay charlie said beautiful suit by the way couldnt help noticing its my business thanks rivera said looking at his sleeves a little wistful i had a short run of good fortune a while back good for you charlie said it passed rivera said cute baby you two take care huh and he was out the door charlie turned to go back upstairs and nearly ran into lily she had her arms crossed under the hell is other people logo on her tshirt and was looking even more judgmental than usual so asher you have something you want to tell me lily i dont have time for she held out the silver cigarette case that the redhead had given him it was still glowing red sophie was reaching for it what charlie said could lily see it was she picking up on the weird glow lily opened the case and pushed it into charlies face read the engraving james omalley read the ornate script charlie took a step back lily i canti dont know anything about that old man look i have to get mrs ling to watch sophie and get over to the castro ill explain later okay i promise she thought about it for a second staring at him accusingly like shed caught him feeding froot loops to her bête noire and then relented go she said a streetcar named confusion into the breech of the castro district charlie asher charged an antique swordcane from the store on the van seat beside him his jaw set like a bayonet his visage a study in fearsome intensity half a block half a block half of a block onwardinto the valley of overpriced juice bars and outlandish hair highlightsrode the righteous beta male and woe be unto the foolish neerdowell who had dared to fuck with this secondhand death dealer for his raggedy life would be fast for the bargain table theres going to be a showdown in gay town charlie thought and i am gunning for justice well not really gunningsince he had a sword concealed in a walking stick not a gunmore of a poking for justicewhich didnt really have the avenging angel connotation he was looking forhe was mad and ready to kick ass thats all so you know just watch out coincidentally poking for justice was the title currently second in popularity at castro video rentals closely edging out a star is born the directors cut and outranked only by cops without pants which was number one with a bullwhip charlie turned off market street and just around the corner on noe street he saw it fresh music the sign done in blocky craftsmanstyle stained glass and he felt the hair at the back of his neck bristle and an urgency in his bladder his body had gone into fightorflight mode and for the second time in a week he was going against his beta male nature and choosing to fight well so be it he thought so be it he would confront his tormentor and lay him low as soon as he found a parking placewhich he didnt he circled the block cutting between cafés and bars both of which were in abundance in the castro he drove up and down the side streets lined with rows of immaculately kept exorbitantly priced victorians and found no quarter for his trusty steed after a half hour of orbiting the neighborhood he headed back uptown and found a spot in a parking garage in the fillmore then took the antique streetcar back down market street to the castro a cute little green italianmade antique streetcar with oak benches brass railings and mahogany window framesa charming brass bell and a top speed of about twenty miles per hour this is how charlie asher charged into battle he tried to imagine a horde of huns hanging off the sides waving wicked blades and firing arrows as they passed the murals in the mission district perhaps viking raiders shields fastened to the sides of the car a great drum pounding as they rowed in to pillage the antique shops the leather bars the sushi bars the leather sushi bars dont ask and the art galleries in the castro and here even charlies formidable imagination failed him he got off the car at castro and market and walked back a block to fresh music then paused outside the shop wondering what in the hell he was going to do now what if the caller had just borrowed the phone what if he stormed in screaming and threatening and there was just some confused kid behind the counter but then he looked in the door and there standing behind the counter all alone was an extraordinarily tall black man dressed completely in mint green and at that point charlie lost his mind you killed her charlie screamed as he stormed by the racks of cds toward the man in mint he drew the sword as he ran or tried to hoping to bring it out in a single fluid movement from the cane sheath and across the throat of rachels killer but the swordcane had been in the back of charlies shop for a long time and except for three times when lilys friend abby tried to leave with it once trying to buy it when charlie refused to sell it to her then twice trying to steal it the sword hadnt been drawn in years the little brass stud that you pushed to release the blade had stuck so when charlie delivered the deathblow he swung the entire cane which was heavierand slowerthan the sword would have been the man in mint greenquick for his sizeducked and charlie took out an entire row of judy garland cds lost his balance bounced off the counter spun around and again tried for the single drawandcut move that he had seen so many times in samurai movies and had practiced so many times in his head on the way here this time the sword came free of the scabbard and slashed a deadly arch three feet in front of the man in mint completely decapitating a lifesized cutout of barbra streisand that is ununfucking called for thundered the tall man as charlie recovered his balance for a backhand slash he saw something large and dark coming down over him and recognized it at the last instant as the antique cash register slammed down on his head there was a flash a ding and everything got dark and gooey when charlie came to he was tied to a chair in the back room of the record store which looked remarkably like the back room of his own store except all the stacked boxes were full of records and cds instead of all variety of used jetsam the tall black man was standing over him and charlie thought at first that he might be turning to mist or smoke but then he realized it was just that his vision was going wavy and then pain lit up the inside of his head like a strobe light ouch hows your neck asked the tall man does your neck feel broken can you feel your feet go ahead kill me you fucking coward said charlie bucking around in the chair trying to lunge at his captor and feeling a little like the black knight in monty pythons holy grail after his arms and legs had been hacked off if this guy took one step closer charlie could headbutt him in the nads he was sure of it the tall man stomped on charlies toes a sizeeighteen gloveleather loafer driven by two hundred and seventy pounds of death and usedrecord dealer ouch charlie hopped his chair in a little circle of pain goddammit ouch so you do have feeling in your feet get it over with go ahead charlie stretched his neck as if offering his throat to be cuthis strategy was to lure his captor into range then sever the tall mans femoral artery with his teeth then gloat as the blood coursed all over his mintgreen slacks onto the floor charlie would laugh long and sinister as he watched the life drain out of the evil bastard then he would hop his chair out to the street and onto the streetcar at market transfer to the number fortyone bus at van ness hop off at columbus and hop the two blocks home where someone would untie him he had a planand a bus pass with four more days left on itso this son of a bitch had picked the wrong guy to fuck with i have no intention of killing you charlie said the tall man keeping a safe distance im sorry i had to hit you with the register you didnt really leave me any options you could have tasted the fatal sting of my blade charlie glanced around for his swordcane just in case the guy had left it within reach yeah sure there was that one but i thought id go with the one without the stains and the funeral charlie strained against his bonds which he realized now were plastic shopping bags youre messing with death you know i am death yeah i know you do sure the tall man spun another wooden chair around and sat on it reversed facing charlie his knees were up at the level of his elbows and he looked like a great green tree frog crouched to pounce on an insect charlie noticed for the first time that he had golden eyes stark and striking in contrast to his dark skin so am i said the evil mintgreen frog guy you youre death a death not the death i dont think there is a the death not anymore anyway charlie couldnt grasp it so he struggled and wobbled until the tall man had to reach out and steady him to keep him from toppling over you killed rachel i did not i saw you there yes you did thats a problem will you please stop thrashing around he shook charlies chair but i wasnt instrumental in rachels death thats not what we do not anymore anyway didnt you even look at the book what book you said something about a book on the phone the great big book of death i sent it to your shop i told a woman at the counter that i was sending it and i got delivery confirmation so i know it got there what womanlily shes not a woman shes a kid no this was a woman about your age with new wave hair jane no she didnt say anything and i didnt get any book oh shit that explains why theyve been showing up you didnt even know who what they mint green death sighed heavily i guess were going to be here awhile im going to make some coffee do you want some sure try to lull me into a false sense of security then spring youre tied the fuck up motherfucker i dont need to lull you into shit youve been fucking with the fabric of human existence and someone needed to shut your ass down oh sure go black on me play the ethnic card mint green climbed to his feet and headed toward the door to the shop you want cream and two sugars please charlie said this is really cool why are you giving it back said abby normal abby was lilys best friend and they were sitting on the floor in the back room of ashers secondhand looking through the great big book of death abbys real name was alison but she would no longer tolerate the ignominy of what she called her daylightslave name everyone had been much more responsive to calling her by her chosen name than they had been to lilys darquewillow elventhing which you always had to spell for people turns out its asher not me lily said hell be really pissed if he finds out i took it and hes death now i guess so i could get in trouble are you going to tell him you had the book abby scratched the silver spider stud in her eyebrow it was a fresh piercing and still healing and she couldnt stop messing with it abby like lily was dressed all in black boots to hair the difference being that she had a blackwidows red hourglass on the front of her black tshirt and she was thinner and more waiflike in her affected creepiness no ill just say it got misfiled that happens a lot here how long did you think it was you like a month what about the dreams and the names and stuff it talks about you didnt have any of that right i thought i was just growing into my powers i made a lot of lists of people i wanted gone yeah i do that and you just found out yesterday that it was asher yeah said lily that sucks said abby life sucks said lily so what now asked abby junior college they both nodded woefully and looked into the depths of their respective nail polishes to avoid sharing the humiliation of one of them having gone from dark demigod to local loser in an instant they lived their lives hoping for something grand and dark and supernatural to happen so when it had they took it more in stride than was probably healthy fear after all is a survival mechanism so all these things are soul objects asked abby as cheerfully as her integrity would allow she waved to the piles of stuff charlie had marked with do not sell signs theres like a persons soul in there according to the book said lily asher says he can see them glow i like the red converse all stars take them theyre yours said lily really yeah lily said she took the all stars off the shelf and held them out hell never miss them cool i have the perfect pair of red fishnets i can wear with them they probably have the soul of some sweaty jock in them lily said he may worship at my feet said abby doing a pirouette and an arabesque remnants along with an eating disorder of ten years of ballet lessons so im like a santas helper of death charlie said waving his coffee cup the tall man had untied his one arm so he could drink his coffee and charlie was baptizing the stockroom floor with french roast with every gesture mr fresh frowned what in the hell are you talking about asher fresh felt bad about hitting charlie asher with a cash register and tying him up and now he was wondering if the blow hadnt caused some sort of brain damage im talking about the santa at macys fresh when youre a kid and you notice that the santa claus at macys has a fake beard and that there are at least six salvation army santas working union square you ask your parents about it and they tell you that the real santa is in the north pole and hes really busy so all these other guys are santas helpers who are out helping him with his work thats what youre saying that were santas helpers to death mr fresh had been standing by his desk but now he sat down again across from charlie so he could look him in the eye very softly he said charlie you know that thats not true now right i mean about santas helpers and all of course i know that theres no santa claus im using it as a metaphor you tool mr fresh took this opportunity to reach out and smack charlie upside the head then immediately regretted it hey charlie put down his cup and rubbed one of his recedinghairline inlets which was going red from the blow rude said mr fresh lets not be rude so youre saying that there is a santa charlie said cringing in anticipation of another smack oh my god how deep does this conspiracy go no theres no goddamn santa im just saying that i dont know what we are i dont know if there is a big death with a capital d although the book hints that there used to be im just saying that there are many of us a dozen that i know of right here in the cityall of us picking up soul vessels and seeing that they get into the right hands and thats based on someone randomly coming into your shop and buying a record then charlies eyes went wide as it hit him rachels sarah mclachlan cd you took it yes fresh looked at the floor not because he was ashamed but to avoid seeing the pain in charlie ashers eyes where is it i want to see it said charlie i sold it to who find it i want rachel back i dont know to a woman i didnt get her name but im sure it was meant for her youll be able to tell i will why will i he asked why me i dont want to kill people we dont kill people mr asher thats a misconception we simply facilitate the ascendance of the soul well one guy died because i said something to him and another had a heart attack because of something i did a death that results from your actions is basically killing someone unless youre a politician right so why me im not that highly skilled at bullshit so why me mr fresh considered what charlie was saying and felt like something sinister had crawled up his spine in all his years he didnt remember ever having his actions directly result in someones death nor had he heard of it happening with the other death merchants of course you occasionally showed up at the time when the person was passing but not often and never as a cause well charlie said mr fresh shrugged because you saw me surely youve noticed that no one sees you when youre out to get a soul vessel ive never gone out to get a soul vessel yes you have and you will at least you should be you need to get with the program mr asher yeah so you said so youreuhwere invisible when were out getting these soul vessels not invisible so to speak its just that no one sees us you can go right into peoples homes and theyll never notice you standing right beside them but if you speak to someone on the street theyll see you waitresses will take your order cabs will stop for youwell not me im black but you know they would its sort of a will thing i think ive tested it animals can see us by the way youll want to watch out for dogs when youre retrieving a vessel so thats how you got to be awhat do they call us death merchants get out really its not in the book i came up with it its very cool thanks mr fresh smiled relieved for a moment not to be thinking about the gravity of charlies unique transition to death merchant actually i think its a character from an album cover guy behind a cash register eyes glowing red but i didnt know that when i came up with it well it makes perfect sense yeah i thought so said mr fresh more coffee please charlie held out his empty cup so someone saw you thats how you became a death merchant no thats how you became one i think that you may uh fresh didnt want to mislead this poor guy but on the other hand he didnt actually know what had happened i think you may be different from the rest of us no one saw me i was working security for a casino in vegas when that went sour for mei have a problem with authority im toldso i came to san francisco and opened this shop started dealing in used records and cds mostly jazz at first after a while it just started happening the glowing soul vessels people coming in with them finding them at estate sales i dont know why or how it just did and i didnt say anything about it to anyone then the book came in the mail the book again dont you have a copy around theres only one copy at least that i know of and you just mailed it out i sent it certified mail fresh boomed someone at your store signed for it i think i did my part okay sorry go on anyway when i got to the castro it was a very sad place the only guys you saw on the street were very old or very young all the ones in the middle were either dead or sick with hiv walking with canes towing oxygen cylinders death was everywhere its like there needed to be a soul way station and i was here trading records then the book showed up in the mail there were a lot of souls coming in for those first few years i was picking up vessels every day sometimes two or three times a day youd be surprised how many gay men have their souls in their music have you sold them all no they come in they go out theres always some inventory but how can you be sure the right person gets the right soul not my problem is it mr fresh shrugged hed worried about it at first but it seemed to all happen as it should and hed gotten into the rhythm of trusting whatever mechanism or power was behind all of this well if thats your attitude why do it at all i dont want this job i have a job and a kid you have to do it believe me after i got the book i tried not doing it we all did at least the ones ive talked to did im guessing youve already seen what happens if you dont youll start hearing the voices then the shades start coming the book calls them underworlders the giant ravens them they were just indistinct shadows and voices until you showed up theres something going on starting with you and continuing with you you let them get a soul vessel didnt you me you said theres a bunch of death merchants the others know better it was you you fucked up i thought i saw one flying over earlier in the week then today i was out walking and the voices were bad really bad thats when i called you it was you wasnt it charlie nodded i didnt know how could i know so they got one two charlie said a hand came out of the sewer it was my first day well thats it said fresh cradling his head in his hands we are most certainly fucked now you dont know that charlie said trying to look on the bright side we could have been fucked before i mean we run secondhand stores for dead people thats sort of a definition of fucked mr fresh looked up the book says if we dont do our jobs everything could go dark become like the underworld i dont know what the underworld is like mr asher but ive caught some of the road show from there a couple of times and im not interested in finding out how bout you maybe its oakland charlie said whats oakland the underworld oakland is not the underworld mr fresh leapt to his feet he was not a violent man you really didnt have to be when you were his size but the tenderloin charlie suggested dont make me smack you neither of us wants that do we mr asher charlie shook his head ive seen the ravens charlie said but i havent heard any voices what voices they talk to you when youre on the street sometimes youll hear a voice coming out of a heating vent a downspout sometimes a storm drain its them all right female voices taunting ive gone years without hearing them ill almost forget then ill be going to pick up a vessel and one will call to me i used to phone the other merchants ask them if theyd done something but we stopped that right away why because thats part of what we think brings them up were not supposed to have any contact it took us a while to figure that out i had only found six of the merchants in the city back then and we were having lunch once a week talking about what we knew comparing notesthats when we saw the first of the shades in fact just to be safe this will be the last time that you and i have contact mr fresh shrugged again and began to untie charlies bonds thinking it all changed that day at the hospital this guy has changed everything and im sending him out like a lamb to the slaughteror maybe hes the one to do the slaughtering this guy might be the one wait i dont know anything charlie pleaded you cant just send me out to do this without more background what about my daughter how do i know who to sell the souls to he was panicked and trying to ask all the questions before he was set free what are the numbers after the names do you get the names like that how long do i have to do this before i can retire why are you always dressed in mint green as mr fresh untied one ankle charlie was trying to tie the other back to the chair my name said mr fresh pardon charlie stopped tying himself up i dress in mint green because of my first name its minty charlie completely forgot what he was worried about minty your name is minty fresh charlie appeared to be trying to stifle a sneeze but then snorted an explosive laugh then ducked the dragon the bear and the fish in the hallway of the third floor of charlies building a meeting was going on between the great powers of asia mrs ling and mrs korjev mrs ling by holding sophie had the strategic advantage while mrs korjev who was fully twice the size of mrs ling possessed the threat of massive retaliatory force what they had in common besides being widows and immigrants was a deep love for little sophie a precarious grasp on the english language and a passionate lack of confidence in charlie ashers ability to raise his daughter alone he is angry when he leave today like bear said mrs korjev who was possessed of an atavistic compulsion toward ursine simile he say no poke said mrs ling who limited herself to english verbs in the present tense only as a devotion to her chan buddhist beliefs or so she claimed who give poke to baby pork is good for child make her grow strong said mrs korjev who then quickly added like bear he say it turn her into shih tzu shih tzu is dog what kind father think little girl turn into dog mrs ling was especially protective of little girls as she had grown up in a province of china where each morning a man with a cart came around to collect the bodies of baby girls who had been born during the night and hurled into the street she was lucky that her own mother had spirited her away to the fields and refused to come home until the new daughter was accepted as part of the family not shih tzu corrected mrs korjev shiksa okay shiksa dog is dog said mrs ling is irresponsible not once was the letter r heard in mrs lings pronunciation of irresponsible is yiddish word for not a jew girl rachel is jew you know mrs korjev unlike most of the russian immigrants left in the neighborhood was not a jew her people had come from the steppes of russia and she was in fact descended from cossacksnot generally considered a hebrewfriendly race she atoned for the sins of her ancestors by being ferociously protective not unlike a mother bear of rachel and now sophie the flowers need water today said mrs korjev at the end of the hallway was a large bay window that looked out on the building across the street and a window box full of red geraniums on afternoons the two great asian powers would stand in the hallway admire the flowers talk of the cost of things and complain about the increasing discomfort of their shoes neither dared start her own window box of geraniums lest it appear that she had stolen the idea from across the street and in the process set off an escalating windowbox competition that could ultimately end in bloodshed they agreed tacitly to admirebut not covetthe red flowers mrs korjev liked the very redness of them she had always been angry that the communists had coopted that color for otherwise it would have evoked an unbridled happiness in her then again the russian soul conditioned by a thousand years of angst really wasnt equipped for unbridled happiness so it was probably for the best mrs ling was also taken with the red of the geraniums for in her cosmology that color represented good fortune prosperity and long life the very gates of the temples were painted that same color red and so the red flowers represented one of the many paths to wueternity enlightenmentessentially the universe in a flower she also thought that they would taste pretty good in soup sophie had only recently discovered color and the red splashes against the gray shiplap was enough to put a toothless smile on her little face so the three were staring into the joy of red flowers when the black bird hit the window throwing a great spiderweb crack around it but rather than fall away the bird seemed to leak into the very crack and spread like black ink across the window and in onto the walls of the hallway and the great powers of asia fled to the stairway charlie was rubbing his left wrist where the plastic bag had been tied around it what did your mother name you after a mouthwash ad mr fresh looking somewhat vulnerable for a man of his size said toothpaste actually really yeah sorry i didnt know charlie said you could have changed it right mr asher you can resist who you are for only so long finally you decide to just go with fate for me that has involved being black being seven feet tallyet not in the nbabeing named minty fresh and being recruited as a death merchant he raised an eyebrow as if accusing charlie i have learned to accept and embrace all of those things i thought you were going to say gay charlie said what a man doesnt have to be gay to dress in mint green charlie considered mr freshs mintgreen suitmade from seersucker and entirely too light for the seasonand felt a strange affinity for the refreshinglynamed death merchant although he didnt know it charlie was recognizing the signs of another beta male of course there are gay betas the beta male boyfriend is highly prized in the gay community because you can teach him how to dress yet you can remain relatively certain that he will never develop a fashion sense or be more fabulous than you charlie said i suppose youre right mr fresh im sorry if i made assumptions my apologies thats okay said mr fresh but you really should go no i still dont understand how do i know who the souls go to i mean after this happened there were all kinds of soul vessels in my store i hadnt even known about how do i know i didnt sell them to someone who already had one what if someone has a set that cant happen at least as far as we know look youll just know take my word for it when people are ready to receive the soul they get it have you ever studied any of the eastern religions i live in chinatown said charlie and although that was technically kindasorta true he knew how to say exactly three things in mandarin good day light starch please and i am an ignorant white devil all taught to him by mrs ling he believed the last to translate to top of the morning to you let me rephrase that then said mr fresh have you ever studied any of the eastern religions oh eastern religions charlie said pretending he had just misinterpreted the question before just discovery channel stuffyou know buddha shiva gandalfthe biggies you understand the concept of karma how unresolved lessons are represented to you in another life yes of course duh charlie rolled his eyes well think of yourself as a soul reassignment agent we are agents of karma secret agents charlie said wistfully well i hope it goes without saying said mr fresh that you cant tell anyone what you are so yes i suppose we are secret agents of karma we hold a soul until a person is ready to receive it charlie shook his head as if trying to clear water from his ears so if someone walks into my store and buys a soul vessel until then theyve been going through life without a soul thats awful really said minty fresh do you know if you have a soul of course i do why do you say that because im me charlie tapped his chest here i am thats just a personality said minty and barely one you could be an empty vessel and youd never know the difference you may not have reached a point in life where you are ready to receive your soul huh your soul may be more evolved than you are right now if a kid fails tenth grade do you make him repeat grades k through nine no i guess not no you just make him start over at the beginning of tenth grade well its the same with souls they only ascend a person gets a soul when they can carry it to the next level when they are ready to learn the next lesson so if i sell one of those glowing objects to someone theyve been going through life without a soul thats my theory said minty fresh ive read a lot on this subject over the years texts from every culture and religion and this explains it better than anything else i can come up with then its not all in the book you sent thats just the practical instructions theres no explanations its dickandjane simple it says to get a calendar and put it next to your bed and the names will come to you it doesnt tell you how you will find them or what the object is just that you have to find them get a day planner thats what i use but what about the number when i would find a name written next to the bed there was always a number next to it mr fresh nodded and grinned a little sheepishly thats how many days youll have to retrieve the soul vessel you mean its how long before the person dies i dont want to know that no not how long before the person dies how long you have to retrieve the vessel how many days are left ive been looking at this for a long time and the number is never above fortynine i thought that might be significant so i started looking for it in literature about death and dying fortynine days just happens to be the number of days of bardo the term used in the tibetan book of the dead for the transition between life and death somehow we death merchants are the medium for moving these souls but we have to get there within the fortynine days thats my theory anyway dont be surprised sometimes if the person has been dead for weeks before you get his name you still have the number of days left in bardo to get the soul vessel and if i dont make it in time charlie asked minty fresh shook his head dolefully shades ravens dark shit rising from the underworldwho knows thing is you have to find it in time and you will how if theres no address or instructions like its under the mat sometimesmost of the time in factthey come to you circumstances line up charlie thought about the stunning redhead bringing him the silver cigarette case you said sometimes fresh shrugged sometimes you have to really search find the person go to their houseonce i even hired a detective to help me find someone but that started to bring the voices you can tell if youre getting close by checking to see if people notice you but i have to make a living i have a kid youll do that too charlie the money comes as part of the job youll see charlie did see he had seen already the mainheart estate clothinghed make tens of thousands on it if he got it now you have to go said minty fresh he held out his hand to shake and a grin cut his face like a crescent moon in the night sky charlie took the tall mans hand his own hand disappearing into the death merchants grip im still sure i have questions can i call you no said the mint one okay then im going now charlie said not really moving completely at the mercy of forces of the underworld and stuff you take care said minty fresh no idea what the hell im doing charlie went on taking tentative baby steps toward the door the weight of all of humanity on my shoulders yeah make sure you stretch in the morning said the big man by the way charlie said out of rhythm with his whining are you gay what i am said minty fresh is alone completely and entirely okay charlie said im sorry its okay im sorry i smacked you in the head charlie nodded grabbed his swordcane from behind the counter and walked out of fresh music into an overcast san francisco day well he wasnt exactly death but he wasnt santas helper either it didnt really matter that no one would believe him even if he told them death merchant seemed a little dire but he liked the idea of being a secret agent an agent of karmakarma assessment reassignment murder and assokay he could work on the acronym later but a secret agent nevertheless actually although he didnt know it charlie was well suited to be a secret agent because they function below the radar beta males make excellent spies not the james bond aston martin with missiles boning the beautiful russian rocket scientist on an ermineskin bedspread sort of spymore the bad combover deepcover bureaucrat fishing coffeesodden documents out of a dumpster spy his overt nonthreateningness allows him access to places and people that are closed to the alpha male wearing his testosterone on his sleeve the beta male can in fact be dangerous not so much in the jet li entire body is a deadly weapon way but more in the drunk on the riding mower making a luke skywalker assault on the toolshed sort of way so as charlie headed for the streetcar stop on market street he mentally tried on his new persona as a secret agent and was feeling pretty good about it when as he passed a storm drain he heard a female voice whisper harshly well get the little one youll see fresh meat well have her soon as soon as charlie walked into his store from the alley lily bolted into the back room to meet him that cop was here again that guy died did you kill him to the machinegun update she added uh sir then she saluted curtsied then did a prayinghands japanese bow thing charlie was thrown by all of it coming as it did when he was in a panic about his daughter and had just driven across town like a madman he was sure the gestures of respect were just some dark coverup for a favor or a misdeed or as often was the case the teenager was messing with him so he sat down on one of the high hardwood stools near the desk and said cop guy splain please and i didnt kill anyone lily took a deep breath that cop that was by here the other day came back turns out that guy you went up to see in pacific heights last weekshe looked at something she had written on her arm in red inkmichael mainheart killed himself and he left a note to you saying that you were to take his and his wifes clothes and sell them at the market rate and then he wroteand here she again referred to her inkstained armwhat about i just want to die did you not understand lily looked up thats what he said after i gave him cpr the other day charlie said so did you kill him or whatever you call it you can tell me she curtsied again which disturbed charlie more than somewhat hed long ago defined his relationship with lily as being built on a strong base of affectionate contempt and this was throwing everything off no i did not kill him what kind of question is that did you kill the guy with the cigarette case no i never even saw that guy you realize that i am your trusted minion lily said this time adding another bow lily what the hell is wrong with you nothing theres nothing wrong at all mr asheruh charles do you prefer charles or charlie youre asking now what else did the cop say he wanted to talk to you i guess they found that mainheart guy dressed in his wifes clothing he hadnt been home from the hospital for an hour before he sent the nurse away got all crossdressed up then took a handful of painkillers charlie nodded thinking about how adamant mainheart had been about having his wifes clothes out of the house he was using any way he could to feel close to her and it wasnt working and when wearing her clothes didnt put him closer hed gone after her the only way he knew how by joining her in death charlie understood if it hadnt been for sophie he might have tried to join rachel pretty kinky huh lily said no charlie barked no its not lily its not like that at all dont even think that mr mainheart died of grief it might look like something else but thats what it was sorry lily said youre the expert charlie was staring at the floor trying to put some sense to it all wondering if his losing the fur coat that was mrs mainhearts soul vessel meant that the couple would never be together again because of him oh yeah lily added mrs ling called down all freaked out and yelling all chinesey about a black bird smashing the window charlie was off the stool and taking the stairs two at a time shes in your apartment lily called after him there was an orange slick of tv attorneys floating on the top of the fishbowl when charlie got to his apartment the asian powers were standing in his kitchen mrs korjev was holding sophie tight to her chest and the infant was virtually swimming trying to escape the giant marshmallowy canyon of protection between the massive cossack fun bags charlie snatched his daughter as she was sinking into the cleavage for the third time and held her tight what happened he asked there followed a barrage of chinese and russian mixed with the odd english word bird window broken black and make shit on myself stop charlie held up a free hand mrs ling what happened mrs ling had recovered from the bird hitting the window and the mad dash down the steps but she was now showing an uncharacteristic shyness afraid that charlie might notice the damp spot in the pocket of her frock where the recently deceased barnaby jones lay orangely awaiting introduction to some wonton green onions a pinch of five spices and her soup pot fish is fish she said to herself when she squirreled that rascal away there were after all five more dead attorneys in the bowl who would miss one oh nothing said mrs ling bird break window and scare us not so bad now charlie looked to mrs korjev where on our floor we are talking in hall speaking of what is best for sophie when boom bird hits window and black ink run through window we run here and lock door both the widows had keys to charlies apartment ill have it fixed tomorrow charlie said but thats all nothingno one came in is third floor charlie no one comes in charlie looked to the fishbowl what happened there mrs lings eyes went wide i have to go mahjongg night at temple we come in lock door explained mrs korjev fish are fine put sophie in car seat like always we are doing then go look in hallway for coast to be clear when mrs ling look back fish are dead not me is russian who see dead fish said mrs ling its okay charlie said did you see any birds anything dark in the apartment the two women shook their heads only upstairs mrs ling said lets go look charlie said moving sophie to his hip and picking up his swordcane he led the two women to the little elevator did a quick assessment of mrs korjevs size versus the cubic footage and led them up the stairs when he saw the broken bay window he felt a little weak in the knees it wasnt so much the window it was what was on the roof across the street refracted a thousand times in the spiderwebbed safety glass was the shadow of a woman that was cast on the building he handed the baby to mrs korjev approached the window and knocked a hole in the glass to see better as he did the shadow slid down the side of the building across the sidewalk and into the storm drain next to where a dozen tourists had just disembarked from a cable car none of them appeared to have seen anything it was just past one and the sun was casting shadows nearly straight down he looked back at the two windows did you see that you mean break window mrs ling said slowly approaching the window and peering through the hole charlie had made oh no what what mrs ling looked back at mrs korjev you are right flowers need water charlie looked through the hole in the window and saw that mrs ling was referring to a window box full of dead black geraniums safety bars on all the windows tomorrow charlie said not far away as the crow flies under columbus avenue in a wide pipe junction where several storm sewers met orcus the ancient one paced bent over like a hunchback the heavy spikes that jutted from his shoulders scraping the sides of the pipe throwing off sparks and the smell of smoldering peat youre going to fuck up your spikes if you keep pacing like that said babd she was crouched in one of the smaller pipes to the side next to her sisters nemain and macha except for nemain who was beginning to show a gunmetal relief of bird feathers over her body they were devoid of depth flat absences of light absolute black even in the gloom filtering down through the storm gratesshadows silhouettes reallythe darker ancestors of the modern mudflap girls shades delicate and female and fierce sit have a snack what good to take the above if you look like hell in the end orcus growled and spun on the morrigan the three too long out of the air too long from the basket on his belt he hooked a human skull on one of his claws popped it in his mouth and crunched down on it the morrigan laughed sounding like wind through the pipes pleased that he was enjoying their gift theyd spent much of the day under san franciscos graveyards digging out the skulls orcus liked them decoffinated and polishing off the dirt and detritus until they shone like bone china we flew said nemain she took a moment to admire the blueblack feather shapes on her surface above she added unnecessarily they are everywhere like cherries waiting to be stolen not stolen said orcus you think like a crow they are ours for the taking oh yeah well where were you i got these the shade held up william creeks umbrella in one hand and the fur jacket shed ripped away from charlie asher in the other they still glowed red but were rapidly dimming because of these i was above i flew when no one reacted nemain added above i flew too said babd timidly a little she was a tad selfconscious that shed manifested no feather patterns or dimension orcus hung his great head the morrigan moved to his side and began stroking the long spikes that had once been wings we will all be above soon said macha this new one doesnt know what he is doing he will make it so we can all be above look how far weve comeand we are so close now two above in such a short time this new meat this ignorant one he may be all we need orcus lifted his bulllike head and grinned revealing a sawmill of teeth they will be like fruit for the picking see said nemain like i said did you know that above you can see really far miles and the wonderful smells i never realized how damp and musty it is down here is there any reason that we cant have a window shut up growled orcus jeez bite my head off why dont you dont tease said the bullheaded death he rose and led the other deaths the morrigan down the pipe toward the financial district to the buried gold rush ship where they made their home part two secondhand souls do not seek death death will find you but seek the road which makes death a fulfillment dag hammarskjöld death takes a walk mornings charlie walked at six after an early breakfast he would turn the care of sophie over to mrs korjev or mrs ling whoevers turn it was for the workday and walkstroll really pacing out the city with the swordcane which had become part of his daily regalia wearing soft blackleather walking shoes and an expensive secondhand suit that had been retailored at his cleaners in chinatown although he pretended to have a purpose charlie walked to give himself time to think to try on the size of being death and to look at all the people out and about in the morning he wondered if the girl at the flower stand from whom he often bought a carnation for his lapel had a soul or would give hers up while he watched her die he watched the guy in north beach make cappuccinos with faces and fern leaves drawn in the foam and wondered if a guy like that could actually function without a soul or was his soul collecting dust in charlies back room there were a lot of people to see and a lot of thinking to be done being out among the people of the city when they were just starting to move greeting the day making ready he started to feel not just the responsibility of his new role but the power and finally the specialness it didnt matter that he had no idea what he was doing or that he might have lost the love of his life for it to happen he had been chosen and realizing that one day as he walked down california street down nob hill into the financial district where hed always felt inferior and out of touch with the world as the brokers and bankers quickstepped around him barking into their cell phones to hong kong or london or new york and never making eye contact he started to not so much stroll as strut that day charlie asher climbed onto the california street cable car for the first time since he was a kid and hung off the bar out over the street holding out the swordcane as if charging with hondas and mercedes zooming along the street beside him passing under his armpit just inches away he got off at the end of the line bought a wall street journal from a machine then walked to the nearest storm drain spread out the journal to protect his trousers against oil stains then got down on his hands and knees and screamed into the drain grate i have been chosen so dont fuck with me when he stood up again a dozen people were standing there waiting for the light to change looking at him had to be done charlie said not apologizing just explaining the bankers and the brokers the executive assistants and the humanresource people and the woman on her way to serve up clam chowder in a sourdough bowl at the boudin bakery all nodded not sure exactly why except that they worked in the financial district and they all understood being fucked with and in their souls if not in their minds they knew that charlie had been yelling in the right direction he folded his paper tucked it under his arm then turned and crossed the street with them when the light changed sometimes charlie walked whole blocks when he thought only of rachel and would become so engrossed in the memory of her eyes her smile her touch that he ran straight into people other times people would bump into him and not even lift his wallet or say excuse me which might be a matter of course in new york but in san francisco meant that he was close to a soul vessel that needed to be retrieved he found one a bronze fireplace poker set out by the curb with the trash on russian hill another time he spotted a glowing vase displayed in the bay window of a victorian in north beach he screwed up his courage and knocked on the door and when a young woman answered and came out on the porch to look for her visitor and was bewildered because she didnt see anyone there charlie slipped past her grabbed the vase and was out the side door before she came back in his heart pounding like a war drum adrenaline sizzling through his veins like a hormonal tiltawhirl as he headed back to the shop that particular morning he realized with no little sense of irony that until he became death hed never felt so alive every morning charlie tried to walk in a different direction on mondays he liked to go up into chinatown just after dawn when all the deliveries were being madecrates of produce carrots lettuce broccoli cauliflower melons and a dozen varieties of cabbage tended by latinos in the central valley and consumed by chinese in chinatown having passed through anglo hands just long enough to extract the nourishing money on mondays the fishing companies delivered their fresh catchesusually strong italian men whose families had been in the business for five generations handing off their catch to inscrutable chinese merchants whose ancestors had bought fish from the italians off horsedrawn wagons a hundred years before all sorts of live and recently live fish were moved across the sidewalk snapper and halibut and mackerel sea bass and ling cod and yellowtail clawless pacific lobster dungeness crab ghastly monkfish with their long saberlike teeth and a single spine that jutted from their head bracing a luminous lure they used to draw in prey so deep in the ocean that the sun never shone charlie was fascinated by the creatures from the very deep sea the bigeyed squid cuttlefish the blind sharks that located prey with electromagnetic impulsescreatures who never saw light they made him think of what might be facing him from the underworld because even as he fell into a rhythm of finding names at his bedside and soul vessels in all manner of places and the appearance of the ravens and the shades subsided he could feel them under the street whenever he passed a storm sewer sometimes he could hear them whispering to one another hushing quickly in the rare moments when the street went quiet to walk through chinatown at dawn was to become part of a dangerous dance because there were no back doors or alleys for loading and all the wares went across the sidewalk and although charlie had enjoyed neither danger nor dancing up till now he enjoyed playing dance partner to the thousand tiny chinese grandmothers in black slippers or jellycolored plastic shoes who scampered from merchant to merchant squeezing and smelling and thumping looking for the freshest and the best for their families twanging orders and questions to the merchants in mandarin all the while just a second or a slip away from being run over by sides of beef great racks of fresh duck or hand trucks stacked high with crates of live turtles charlie was yet to retrieve a soul vessel on one of his chinatown walks but he stayed ready because the swirl of time and motion forecast that one foggy morning someones granny was going to get knocked out of her moo shoes one monday just for sport charlie grabbed an eggplant that a spectacularly wizened granny was going for but instead of twisting it out of his hand with some mystic kung fu move as he expected she looked him in the eye and shook her headjust a jog barely perceptible reallyit might have been a tic but it was the most eloquent of gestures charlie read it as saying o white devil you do not want to purloin that purple fruit for i have four thousand years of ancestors and civilization on you my grandparents built the railroads and dug the silver mines and my parents survived the earthquake the fire and a society that outlawed even being chinese i am mother to a dozen grandmother to a hundred and greatgrandmother to a legion i have birthed babies and washed the dead i am history and suffering and wisdom i am a buddha and a dragon so get your fucking hand off my eggplant before you lose it and charlie let go and she grinned just a little three teeth and he wondered if it ever did fall to him to retrieve the soul vessel of one of these crones of chronos if hed even be able to lift it and he grinned back and asked for her phone number which he gave to ray she seemed nice charlie told him mature sometimes charlies walks took him through japantown where he passed the most enigmatic shop in the city invisible shoe repair he really intended to stop in one day but he was still coming to terms with giant ravens adversaries from the underworld and being a merchant of death and he wasnt sure he was ready for invisible shoes let alone invisible shoes that needed repair he often tried to look past the japanese characters into the shop window as he passed but saw nothing which of course didnt mean a thing he just wasnt ready but there was a pet shop in japantown house of pleasant fish and gerbil where he had originally gone to buy sophies fish and where he returned to replace the tv attorneys with six tv detectives who also simultaneously took the big ambien a week later charlie had been distraught to find his baby daughter drooling away in front of a bowl floating more dead detectives than a film noir festival and after flushing all six at once and having to use the plunger to dislodge magnum and mannix he vowed that next time he would find more resilient pals for his little girl he was coming out of house of pfg one afternoon with a habitrail pod containing a pair of sturdy hamsters when he ran into lily who was making her way to a coffeehouse up on van ness where she was planning to meet her friend abby for some lattefueled speed brooding hey lily how are you doing charlie was trying to appear matteroffact but he found that the awkwardness between him and lily over the last few months was not mitigated by her seeing him on the street carrying a plastic box full of rodents nice gerbils lily said she wore a catholic schoolgirls plaid skirt over black tights and doc martens with a tight black pvc bustier that was squishing pale lilybits out the top like a can of biscuit dough thats been smacked on the edge of the counter the hair color du jour was fuchsia over violet eye shadow which matched her violet elbowlength lace gloves she looked up and down the street and when she didnt see anyone she knew fell into step next to charlie theyre not gerbils theyre hamsters charlie said asher do you have something youve been keeping from me she tilted her head a little but didnt look at him when she asked just kept her eyes forward scanning the street for someone who might recognize her walking next to charlie thus forcing her to commit seppuku jeez lily these are for sophie charlie said her fish died so im bringing her some new pets besides that whole gerbil thing is an urban myth i meant that youre death lily said charlie nearly dropped his hamsters huh its so wrong lily continued walking on after charlie had stopped in his tracks so now he had to scurry to catch up to her just so wrong that you would be chosen of all of lifes many disappointments id have to say that this is the crowning disappointment youre sixteen charlie said still stumbling a little at the matteroffact way she was discussing this oh throw that in my face asher im only sixteen for two more months then what in the blink of an eye my beauty becomes but a feast for worms and i a forgotten sigh in a sea of nothingness your birthday is in two months well well have to get you a nice cake charlie said dont change the subject asher i know all about you and your death persona charlie stopped again and turned to look at her this time she stopped as well lily i know ive been acting a little strangely since rachel died and im sorry you got in trouble at school because of me but its just been trying to deal with it all with the baby with the business the stress of it all has i have the great big book of death lily said she steadied charlies hamsters when he lost his grip i know about the soul vessels about the dark forces rising if you fuck up all that stuffall of it ive known longer than you have i think charlie didnt know what to say he was feeling panic and relief at the same timepanic because lily knew but relief because at least someone knew and believed it and had actually seen the book the book lily do you still have the book its in the store i hid it in the back of the glass cabinet where you keep the valuable stuff that no one will ever buy no one ever looks in that cabinet no kidding i thought if you ever found it id say it had always been there i have to go he turned and started walking the other direction but then realized that they had already been heading toward his neighborhood and turned around again where are you going to get some coffee ill walk with you you will not lily looked around again wary that someone might see them but lily im death that should at least have given me some level of cool yeah youd think but it turns out that you have managed to suck the cool out of being death wow thats harsh welcome to my world asher you cant tell anyone about this you know that like anyone cares what you do with your gerbils hamsters thats not chill asher lily giggled i know what you mean im not going to tell anyoneexcept abby knowsbut she doesnt care she says shes met some guy whos her dark lord shes in that stage where she thinks a dick is some kind of mystical magic wand charlie adjusted his hamster box uncomfortably girls go through a stage like that why was he just hearing about this now even the hamsters looked uncomfortable lily turned on a heel and started up the street im not having this conversation with you charlie stood there watching her go balancing the hamsters and his completely useless swordcane while trying to dig his cell phone out of his jacket pocket he needed to see that book and he needed to see it sooner than the hour it would take him to get home lily wait he called im calling a cab ill give you a ride she waved him off without looking and kept walking as he was waiting for the cab company to answer he heard it the voice and he realized that he was standing right over a storm drain it had been over a month since hed heard them and he thought maybe theyd gone well have her too meat shes ours now he felt the fear rise in his throat like bile he snapped the phone shut and ran after lily cane rattling and hamsters bouncing as he went lily wait wait she spun around quickly and her fuchsia wig only did the quarter turn instead of the half so her face was covered with hair when she said one of those icecream cakes from thirtyone flavors okay after that despair and nothingness well put that on the cake charlie said the girls can get a little dark at times the great big book of death as it turned out wasnt that big and certainly wasnt that comprehensive charlie read through it a dozen times took notes made copies ran searches trying to find some reference to any of the stuff covered but all of the material in the twentyeight lavishly illustrated pages boiled down to this congratulations you have been chosen to act as death its a dirty job but someone has to do it it is your duty to retrieve soul vessels from the dead and dying and see them on to their next body if you fail darkness will cover the world and chaos will reign some time ago the luminatus or the great death who kept balance between light and darkness ceased to be since then forces of darkness have been trying to rise from below you are all that stands between them and destruction of the collective soul of humanity in order to hold off the forces of darkness you will need a number two pencil and a calendar preferably one without pictures of kitties on it names and numbers will come to you the number is how many days you have to retrieve the soul vessel you will know the vessels by their crimson glow dont tell anyone what you do or dark forces etc etc etc people may not see you when you are performing your death duties so be careful crossing the street you are not immortal do not seek others do not waver in your duties or the forces of darkness will destroy all that you care about you do not cause death you do not prevent death you are a servant of destiny not its agent get over yourself do not under any circumstances let a soul vessel fall into the hands of those from belowbecause that would be bad a few months passed before charlie worked the shop again alone with lily she asked him well did you get a number two pencil no i got a number one pencil you rogue asher hello forces of darkness if the world without this luminatus is so precariously balanced that my buying a pencil with onegradeharder lead is going to cast us all into the abyss then maybe its time whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa lily chanted like she was trying to bring a spooked horse under control its one thing for me to be all nihilistic and stuff for me its a fashion statement i have the outfits for it you cant be all horny for the grave wearing your stupid savile row suits charlie was proud of her for recognizing that he was wearing one of his expensive secondhand savile rows she was learning the trade in spite of herself im tired of being afraid he said ive dealt with the forces of darkness or whatever lily and you know what were one and one should you be telling me this i mean the book said i think im different than what the book says lily the book says that i dont cause death but there have been two now that have died more or less because of my actions and i repeat should you be telling me this as you have pointed out many times i am a kid and wildly irresponsible its wildly irresponsible right im never listening that closely youre the only one who knows charlie said and youre seventeen now not a kid youre a young woman now dont fuck with me asher if you keep talking like that ill get another piercing take x until im dehydrated like a mummy talk on my cell phone until the battery is dead then find some skinny pale guy and suck him until he cries so it will be like a friday charlie said what i do with my weekends is my own business i know well then shut up im tired of being afraid lily well then stop being afraid charlie they both looked away embarrassed lily pretended to shuffle through the days receipts while charlie pretended to be looking for something in what he called his walking satchel and jane called his man purse sorry lily said without looking up from the receipts sokay charlie said me too still not looking up lily said but really should you be telling me any of this probably not charlie said its sort of a big burden to carry sort of a dirty job lily looked up now and grinned yeah charlie smiled relieved i wont bring it up again thats okay its kind of cool really charlie couldnt remember anyone ever referring to him as cool he was touched not you the whole death thing yeah right charlie said yes still batting a thousand on the zerocool quotient but youre right its not safe no more talk about my uh avocation and ill never call you charlie again lily said ever that would be fine charlie said well act like this never happened excellent good talk resume your thinly veiled contempt fuck off asher atta girl they were waiting for him the next morning when he took his walk he expected it and he wasnt disappointed hed stopped in the shop to pick up an italian suit hed just taken in as well as a cigar lighter that had languished in a curio case in the back for two years which he stuffed in his satchel with the glowing porcelain bear that was the soul vessel of someone who had passed long ago then he stepped outside and stood just above the opening of the storm drainwaved at the tourists on the cable car as it clanked by good morning he said cheerily anyone watching him might have thought he was greeting the day since there was no one around well peck out her eyes like ripe plums hissed a female voice out of the drain bring us up meat bring us up so we can lap your blood from the gaping wound we tear in your chest and crunch your bones in our jaws like candy added a different voice also female yeah agreed the first voice like candy yeah said a third charlie felt his entire body go to gooseflesh but he shook it off and tried to keep his voice steady well today would be a good day for it charlie said im well rested from sleeping in my comfy bed with the down comforter not like i spent the night in a sewer or anything bastard a hissing female chorus well talk to you on the next block strolled up the block into chinatown pacing out the sidewalk jauntily with his swordcane the suit inside a light garment bag thrown over his shoulder he tried whistling but thought that might be a little too cliché they were already under the next corner when he got there im going to suck the babys soul out through her soft spot while you watch meat oh nice charlie said gritting his teeth and trying not to sound as horrified as he was shes starting to crawl around pretty well now so dont miss breakfast that day because if she has her little rubber spoon shell probably kick your ass there was a screech of anger from the sewers and a harsh hissing chatter he cant say that can he say that does he know who we are taking a left at the next block see you there there was a young chinese man dressed in hiphop wear who looked at charlie and took a quick step to the side so as not to catch whatever kind of crazy this welldressed lo pak white man was carrying charlie tapped his ear and said sorry wireless headset the hiphop guy nodded curtly like he knew that and despite appearances to the contrary he had not been trippin but had in fact been chillin like a mofuckin villain so step the fuck off wigga he crossed against the light limping slightly under the weight of the subtext charlie entered golden dragon cleaners and the man at the counter mr hu whom charlie had known since he was eight greeted him with an expansive and warm twitch of the left eyebrow which was his usual greeting and a good indicator to charlie that the old man was still alive a cigarette streamed at the end of a long black holder clinched in hus dentures good morning mr hu charlie said beautiful day isnt it suit said mr hu looking at the suit charlie had slung over his shoulder yes just the one today charlie said charlie brought all of his finer merchandise to golden dragon to be cleaned and hed been giving them a lot of business the last few months with all the estate clothes hed been taking in he also had them do his alterations and mr hu was considered to be the best threefingered tailor on the west coast and perhaps the world three fingered hu he was known as in chinatown although to be fair he was actually possessed of eight fingers and was only missing the two smaller fingers from his right hand tailor hu asked no thank you charlie said this ones for resale not for me hu snatched the suit out of charlies hand tagged it then called one suit for the white devil in mandarin and one of his granddaughters came speeding out of the back grabbed the suit and was gone through the curtain before charlie could see her face one suit for the white devil she repeated for someone in the back wednesday said three fingered hu he handed charlie the ticket theres something else charlie said okay tuesday said hu but no discount no mr hu i know its been a long time since i needed it but i wonder if you still have your other business mr hu closed one eye and looked at charlie for a full minute before he replied when he did he said come then disappeared behind the curtain leaving a cloud of cigarette smoke charlie followed him into the back through a noisy steaming hell of cleaning fluids mangle irons and a dozen scurrying employees to a tiny plywoodwalled office in the back where hu closed the door and locked them in as they did their business something theyd first done over twenty years ago the first time three fingered hu had led charlie asher through the stygian back room of golden dragon cleaners the tenyearold beta male was sure that he was going to be kidnapped and sold into drycleaning slavery butchered and turned into dim sum or forced to smoke opium and fight fifty kung fu fighters at once while still in his pjs charlie had a very tenuous grasp of his neighbors culture at age ten but despite his fear he was driven by a passion that had been embedded in his very genes millions of years ago a quest for fire yes it was a crafty beta male who first discovered fire and true it was almost immediately taken away from him by an alpha male alphas missed out on the discovery of fire but because they did not understand about grabbing the hot orangey end of the stick they are credited with inventing the thirddegree burn still the original spark burns bright in every betas veins when alpha boys have long since moved on to girls and sports betas will still be pursuing pyrotechnics well into adolescence and sometimes beyond alpha males may lead the armies of the world but its the betas who actually get the shit blowed up and what better testimonial for a purveyor of fireworks than to be missing critical digits three fingered hu when hu opened his thick trifold case across the desk revealing his wares young charlie felt he had passed through the fires of hell to arrive at last in paradise and he gladly handed over his wad of crumpled sweaty dollar bills and even as long silver ashes from hus cigarette fell over the fuses like deadly snow charlie picked his pleasure he was so excited he nearly peed himself the deathdealing charlie who walked out of golden dragon cleaners that morning with a compact paper parcel tucked under his arm felt a similar excitement for as much as it was against his nature he was rushing once again into the breech he headed to the storm sewer grate and waving the glowing porcelain bear from his satchel at the street shouted im going over one block and up four bitches join me the white devil has finally gone around the bend said three fingered hus eleventh grandchild cindy lou hu who stood at the counter next to her venerated and digitally challenged ancestor his money not crazy said three charlie had noticed the alley on one of his walks to the financial district it lay between montgomery and kearney streets and had all the things a good alley should have fire escapes dumpsters various steel doors tagged with graffiti a rat two seagulls assorted filth a guy passed out under some cardboard and a halfdozen no parking signs three with bullet holes it was the platonic ideal of an alley but what distinguished it from other alleys in the area was that it had two openings into the stormdrain system spaced not fifty yards apart one on the street end and one in the middle concealed between two dumpsters having recently developed an eye for storm drains charlie couldnt help but notice he chose the drain that was hidden from the street crouched down about four feet away and opened the parcel from three fingered hu he removed eight ms and trimmed the twoinchlong waterproof fuses to about a half inch with a pair of nail clippers he kept on his key chain an m is a very large firecracker purported to have the explosive power of a quarter of a stick of dynamite rural children use them to blow up mailboxes or school plumbing but in the city they have largely been replaced by the mm glock pistol as the preferred instrument of mischievous fun kids charlie called into the drain you with me sorry i didnt get your names he drew the sword from his cane set it by his knee then dug the porcelain bear out of his satchel and sat it by his other knee there you go he called there was a vicious hiss from the drain and even as he thought it was completely dark it got even darker he could see silver disk shapes moving in the blackness like coins tumbling through a dark ocean but these were paired upeyes give it meat give it whispered a female voice come and get it charlie said trying to fight down the greatest case of the willies hed ever felt it was like dry ice was being applied to his spine and it was all he could do not to shiver the shadow in the drain started to leak out across the pavement just an inch or so but he could see it like the light had changed but it hadnt the shadow took the shape of a female hand and moved another six inches toward the glowing bear thats when charlie grabbed the sword and snapped it down on the shadow it didnt hit pavement but connected with something softer and there was a deafening screech you piece of shit screamed the voicenow in anger not pain you worthless littleyou quick and the dead ladies charlie said quick and the dead cmon give it another shot a second handshaped shadow snaked out of the drain on the left then another on the right charlie pushed the bear away from the drain as he pulled the cigar lighter from his pocket he lit the short fuses of four of the ms and tossed them into the drain even as the shadows were reaching out what was that what did he throw move i cant charlie put his fingers in his ears the ms exploded and charlie grinned he sheathed the sword in the cane gathered up his stuff and sprinted for the other drain inside an enclosed space the noise would be punishing brutal even he kept grinning he could hear a chorus of screaming and cursing in half a dozen dead languages some of them running over others like someone was spinning the dial on a shortwave radio that spanned both time and space he dropped to his knees and listened at the drain careful to stay an arms length away he could hear them coming tracking him under the street he hoped he was right that they couldnt come out but even if they did he had the sword and the sunlight was his turf he lit four more ms these with longer fuses and tossed them one by one into the drain whos new meat now he said what what did he say said a sewer voice i cant hear shit charlie waved the porcelain bear in front of the drain you want this he tossed in another m you like that do you charlie shouted throwing in the third firecracker thatll teach you to use your beak on my arm you fucking harpies mr asher came a voice from behind him charlie looked around to see alphonse rivera the police inspector standing over him oh hi charlie said then realizing that he was holding a lit m he said excuse me a second he tossed the firecracker in the drain at that moment they all started going off rivera had retreated a few steps and had his hand in his jacket presumably on his gun charlie put the porcelain bear in his satchel and climbed to his feet he could hear the voices shrieking at him cursing you fucking loser screeched one of the dark ones ill weave a basket of your guts and carry your severed head in it yeah said another voice a basket i think you threatened that already said a third i did not said the first shut the fuck up charlie yelled at the drain then he looked at rivera who had drawn his weapon and was holding it at his side so rivera said problems with uh someone in the drain charlie grinned you cant hear that can you the cursing was ongoing but now in some language that sounded as if it required a lot of mucus to speak properly gaelic or german or something i can hear a distinct ringing in my ears mr asher from the report of your distinctly illegal fireworks but beyond that nothing no rats charlie said unconsciously raising an eyebrow in a so are you gonna buy that load of horseshit way hate the rats uhhuh rivera said flatly the rats they used their beak on your arm and evidently you feel that they have a secret desire for cheap animal curios so that you heard charlie asked yep thats gotta make you wonder then huh yep said the cop nice suit though armani canali actually charlie said but thanks not what id pick for bombing storm drains but to each his own rivera hadnt moved he was standing just off the curb about ten feet away from charlie his weapon still at his side a jogger ran by them and used the opportunity to quicken his pace charlie and rivera both nodded politely as he passed so charlie said youre a professional where would you go with this rivera shrugged not on any prescriptions you might have taken too many of are you i wish charlie said up all night drinking thrown out by the wife out of your mind with remorse my wife passed away im sorry how long going on a year now well thats not going to work said rivera do you have any history of mental illness nope well you do now congratulations mr asher you can use that next time do i have to do the perp walk charlie asked thinking about how hed explain this to child services poor sophie her dad an ex con and death school was going to be tough this jacket is tailored i dont think i can get it over my head for the perp walk am i going to jail not with me youre not you think this would be any easier for me to explain im an inspector i dont arrest guys for throwing firecrackers and yelling into storm drains then why do you have your weapon drawn makes me feel more secure i can see that charlie said i probably appeared a little unstable ya think so wheres that leave us that the rest of your stash rivera nodded toward the paper bag of firecrackers under charlies arm charlie nodded how about you toss that down the storm drain and well call it a day no way i have no idea what theyll do if they get their hands on fireworks now it was riveras turn to raise an eyebrow the rats charlie threw the bag in the storm sewer he could hear whispering from below but tried not to show rivera that he was listening rivera holstered his weapon and shot his lapels so do you take suits like that into your shop very often he asked more now than i used to ive been doing a lot of estate work charlie said you still have my card give me a call if you get a forty long anything italian mediumto lightweight wool oh or raw silk too yeah silks perfect for our weather sure ill be happy to save you something by the way inspector how did you happen to be in a back alley off a side street in the middle of a tuesday morning i dont have to tell you that said rivera with a smile you dont no you have a nice day mr asher you too said charlie so now he was being followed both above and below the street why else would a homicide detective be here neither the great big book nor minty fresh had said a word about the cops how were you supposed to keep this whole deathdealing thing a secret when a cop was watching you his elation at having taken the battle to the enemy something that was deeply against his nature evaporated he wasnt sure why but something was telling him that he had just fucked up below the street the morrigan looked at one another in amazement he doesnt know said macha examining her claws which shone like brushed stainless steel in the dim light coming from above her body was beginning to show the gunmetalblue relief of feathers and her eyes were no longer just silver disks but now had the full awareness of a predatory birds she had once flown over the battlefields of the north landing on those soldiers who were dying of their wounds pecking out their souls in her bird form of a hooded crow the celts had called the severed heads of their enemies machas acorn crop but they had no idea that she cared nothing for their tributes or their tribes only for their blood and their souls it had been a thousand years since she had seen her woman claws like this i still cant hear said her sister nemain who groomed the blueblack feather shapes on her own body hissing with the pleasure as she ran the dagger points over her breasts she was showing fangs as well which dented her delicate jet lips it had been her lot to drip venom on those she would mark for death there was no fiercer warrior than one who had been touched by the venom of nemain for with nothing to lose he took the field without fear in a frenzy that gave him the strength of ten and dragged others to their doom with him babd raked her rediscovered claws across the side of the culvert cutting deep gouges into the concrete i love these i forgot i even had these ill bet we can go above want to go above i feel like i could go above tonight we can go above we could tear his legs off and watch him drag himself around in his own blood that would be fun babd was the screamerher shriek on the battlefield said to send armies into retreatranks of soldiers a hundred deep would die of fright she was all that was fierce furious and not particularly bright the meat doesnt know repeated macha why would we give away our advantage in an early attack because it would be fun said babd above fun i know instead of a basket you can weave a hat from his entrails nemain slung some venom off her claws and it hissed in a steaming line across the concrete we should tell orcus hell have a plan about the hat asked babd you have to tell him it was my idea he loves hats we have to tell him that new meat doesnt know the three moved like smoke down the pipes toward the great ship to share the news that their newest enemy among other things did not know what he was or what he had wrought on the world the bay city book of the dead charlie named the hamsters parmesan and romano or parm and romy for short because when the time came for thinking up names he just happened to be reading the label on a jar of alfredo sauce that was all the thought that went into it and that was enough in fact charlie thought he might have even gone overboard considering that when he returned home the day of the great firecrackersewer debacle he found his daughter gleefully pounding away on the tray of her high chair with a stiff hamster romano was the poundee charlie could tell because hed put a dot of nail polish between his little ears so he could tell it apart from its companion parmesan who was equally stiff inside the plastic habitrail box in the bottom of the exercise wheel actually dead at the wheel mrs ling charlie called he pried the expired rodent from his darling daughters little hand and dropped it in the cage is vladlena mr asher came a giant voice from the bathroom there was a flush and mrs korjev emerged from the bathroom pulling at the clasps of her overalls im sorry i am having to crap like bear sophie was safe in chair she was playing with a dead hamster mrs korjev mrs korjev looked at the two hamsters in the plastic habitrail boxgave it a little tap shook it back and forth they sleep they are not sleeping theyre dead they are fine when i go in bathroom playing running on wheel having laugh they were not having a laugh they were dead sophie had one in her hand charlie looked more closely at the rodent that sophie had been tenderizing its head looked extremely wet in her mouth she had it in her mouth he grabbed a paper towel from the roll on the counter and started wiping out the inside of sophies mouth she made a lalala sound as she tried to eat the towel which she thought was part of the game where is mrs ling anyway she have to go pick up prescription so i watch sophie for short time and tiny bears are happy when i go in bathroom hamsters mrs korjev not bears how long were you in there maybe five minute i am thinking i am now having a strain in my poop chute so hard i am pushing

little sleepers these hamsters she liked ham i take care she said she tucked the cage under her arm and backed toward the door waving byebye sophie byebye byebye bubeleh said mrs korjev byebye sophie said with a baby wave when did you learn byebye charlie said to his daughter i cant leave you for a second but he did leave her the very next day to find replacements for the hamsters he took the cargo van to the pet store this time whatever courage or hubris hed rallied in order to attack the sewer harpies had melted away and he didnt even want to go near a storm drain at the pet store he picked out two painted turtles each about as big around as a mayonnaisejar lid he bought them a large kidneyshaped dish that had its own little island a plastic palm tree some aquatic plants and a snail the snail presumably to bolster the selfesteem of the turtles you think were slow look at that guy to shore up the snails morale in the same way there was a rock everyone is happier if they have someone to look down on as well as someone to look up to especially if they resent both this is not only the beta male strategy for survival but the basis for capitalism democracy and most religions after he grilled the clerk for fifteen minutes on the vitality of the turtles and was assured that they could probably survive a nuclear attack as long as there were some bugs left to eat charlie wrote a check and started tearing up over his turtles are you okay mr asher asked the petshop guy im sorry charlie said its just that this is the last entry in the register and your bank didnt give you a new one no i have a new one but this is the last one that my wife wrote in now that this one is used up ill never see her handwriting in the check register again im sorry said the petshop guy who until that moment had thought the rough patch that day was going to be consoling a guy over a couple of dead hamsters its not your problem charlie said ill just take my turtles and go and he did squeezing the check register in his hand as he drove she was slipping away every day a little more a week ago jane had come down to borrow some honey and found the plum jelly that rachel liked in the back of the refrigerator covered in green fuzz little brother this has got to go jane said making a face no it was rachels i know kid and shes not coming back for it what else do youoh my god she dove away from the fridge what was that lasagna rachel made it this has been in here for over a year i couldnt make myself throw it out look im coming over saturday and cleaning out this apartment im going to get rid of all the stuff of rachels that you dont want i want it all jane paused while moving the greenandpurple lasagna to the trash bin pan and all no you dont charlie this kind of stuff doesnt help you remember rachel it just hurts you you need to focus on sophie and the rest of both of your lives youre a young guy you cant give up we all loved rachel but you have to think about moving on maybe going out im not ready and you cant come over this saturday thats my day in the shop i know jane said its better if youre not here but you cant be trusted jane charlie said as if that was as obvious as the fact that jane was irritating youll throw out all the pieces of rachel and youll steal my clothes jane had been swiping charlies suits pretty regularly since hed started dressing more upscale she was wearing a tailored doublebreasted jacket that hed just gotten back from three fingered hu a few days ago charlie hadnt even worn it yet why are you still wearing suits anyway isnt your new girlfriend a yoga instructor shouldnt you be wearing those baggy pants made out of hemp and tofu fibers like she does you look like david bowie jane there ive said it im sorry but it had to be said jane put her arm around his shoulder and kissed him on the cheek you are so sweet bowie is the only man ive ever found attractive let me clean out your apartment ill watch sophie that daygive the widows a day to do battle down at the everything for a dollar store okay but just clothes and stuff no pictures and just put it in the basement in boxes no throwing anything away even food items chuck the lasagna i mean okay food items can go but dont let sophie know what youre doing and leave rachels perfume and her hairbrush i want sophie to know what her mother smelled like that night when he finished at the shop he went down to the basement to the little gated storage area for his apartment and visited the boxes of all of the things that jane had packed up when that didnt work he opened them and said goodbye to every single itempieces of rachel seemed like he was always saying goodbye to pieces of rachel on his way home from the pet shop he had stopped at a clean welllighted place for books because it too was a piece of rachel and he needed a touchstone but also because he needed to research what he was doing hed scoured the internet for information on death and while hed found that there were a lot of people who wanted to dress like death get naked with the dead look at pictures of the naked and the dead or sell pills to give erections to the dead there just wasnt anything on how to go about being dead or death no one had ever heard of death merchants or sewer harpies or anything of the sort he left the store with a twofoothigh stack of books on death and dying figuring as a beta male typically does that before he tried to take the battle to the enemy again hed better find out something about what he was dealing with that evening he settled in on the couch next to his baby daughter and read while the new turtles bruiser and jeep so named in hope of instilling durability in them ate freezedried bugs and watched csi safariland on cable well honey according to this küblerross lady the five stages of death are anger denial bargaining depression and acceptance well we went through all of those stages when we lost mommy didnt we mama sophie said the first time she had said mama had brought charlie to tears he had been looking over her little shoulder at a picture of rachel the second time she said it it was less emotional she was in her high chair at the breakfast bar and was talking to the toaster thats not mommy soph thats the toaster mama sophie insisted reaching out for the toaster youre just trying to fuck with me arent you charlie said mama sophie said to the fridge swell charlie said he read on realizing that dr küblerross had been exactly right every morning when he woke up to find another name and number in the day planner at his bedside he went through the entire fivestep process before he finished breakfast but now that the steps had a namehe started to recognize the stages as experienced by the family members of his clients thats how he referred to the people whose souls he retrieved clients then he read a book called the last sack about how to kill yourself with a plastic bag but it must not have been a very effective book because he saw on the back cover that there had been two sequels he imagined the fan mail dear last sack author i was almost dead but then my sack got all steamed up and i couldnt see the tv so i poked an eyehole i hope to try again with your next book the book really didnt help charlie much except to instill in him a new paranoia about plastic bags over the next few months he read the egyptian book of the dead from which he learned how to pull someones brain out through his nostril with a buttonhook which he was sure would come in handy someday a dozen books on dealing with death grief burial rituals and myths of the underworld from which he learned that there had been personifications of death since the dawn of time and none of them looked like him and the tibetan book of the dead from which he learned that bardo the transition between this life and the next was fortynine days long and that during the process you would be met by about thirty thousand demons all of which were described in intricate detail none of which looked like the sewer harpies and all of which you were supposed to ignore and not be afraid of because they werent real because they were of the material world strange charlie said to sophie how all of these books talk about how the material world isnt significant yet i have to retrieve peoples souls which are attached to material objects it would appear that death if nothing else is ironic dont you think no sophie said at eighteen months sophie answered all questions either no cookie or like bearthe last charlie attributed to leaving his daughter too often in the care of mrs korjev after the turtles two more hamsters a hermit crab an iguana and two widemouthed frogs passed on to the great wok in the sky or more accurately on the third floor charlie finally acquiesced and brought home a threeinchlong madagascar hissing cockroach that he named bear just so his daughter wouldnt go through life talking total nonsense like bear sophie said shes talking about the bug charlie said one night when jane stopped by shes not talking about the bug jane said what kind of father buys a cockroach for a little girl anyway thats disgusting nothings supposed to be able to kill them theyve been around for like a hundred million years it was that or a white shark and theyre supposed to be hard to keep why dont you give up charlie just let her get by with stuffed animals a little kid should have a pet especially a little kid growing up in the city we grew up in the city and we didnt have any pets i know and look how we turned out charlie said gesturing back and forth between the two of them one who dealt in death and had a giant cockroach named bear and the other who was on her third yogainstructor girlfriend in six months and was wearing his newest harris tweed suit we turned out great or at least one of us did jane said gesturing to the splendor of her suit like she was a gameshow model giving the big prize package on lets get androgynous you have got to gain some weight this is tailored way too tight in the butt she said lapsing once again into selfobsession am i cameltoeing i am not looking not looking not looking charlie chanted she wouldnt need pets if she ever saw the outside of this apartment jane said pulling down on the crotch of her trousers to counteract the dreaded dromedarydigit effect take her to the zoo charlie let her see something besides this apartment take her out i will tomorrow ill take her out and show her the city charlie said and he would have too except he woke to find the name madeline alby written on his day planner and next to her name the number one oh yeah and the cockroach was dead i will take you out charlie said as he put sophie in her high chair for breakfast i will honey i promise can you believe that theyd only give me one day no sophie said juice she added because she was in her chair and this was juice time im sorry about bear honey charlie said brushing her hair this way then that then giving up he was a good bug but he is no more mrs ling will bury him that window box of hers must be getting pretty crowded he didnt remember there being a window box in mrs lings window but who was he to question charlie threw open the phone book and mercifully found an m alby with an address on telegraph hillnot ten minutes walk away no client had ever been this close and with almost six months without a peep or a shade from the sewer harpies he was starting to feel like he had this whole death merchant thing under control hed even placed most of the soul vessels that hed collected the short notice felt bad really bad the house was an italianate victorian on the hill just below the coit tower the great granite column built in honor of the san francisco firemen who had lost their lives in the line of duty although its said to have been designed with a firehose nozzle in mind almost no one who sees the tower can resist the urge to comment on its resemblance to a giant penis madeline albys house a flatroofed white rectangle with ornate scrolling trim and a crowning cornice of carved cherubs looked like a wedding cake balanced on the towers scrotum so as charlie trudged up the nut sack of san francisco he wondered exactly how he was going to get inside the house usually he had time he could wait and follow someone in or construct some kind of ruse to gain entrance but this time he had only one day to get inside find the soul vessel and get out he hoped that madeline alby had already died he really didnt like being around sick people when he saw the car parked out front with the small green hospice sticker his hopes for a dead client were smashed like a cupcake with a sledgehammer he walked up the front porch steps at the left of the house and waited by the door could he open it himself would people be able to see it or did his special unnoticeability extend to objects he moved as well he didnt think so but then the door opened and a woman about charlies age stepped out onto the porch im just having a smoke she called back into the house and before she could close the door behind her charlie slipped inside the front door opened into a foyer to his right charlie saw what had originally been the parlor there was a stairway in front of him and another door beyond that that he guessed led to the kitchen he could hear voices in the parlor and peeked around the corner to see four elderly women sitting on two couches that faced each other they were in dresses and hats and they might have just come from church but charlie guessed they had come to see their friend off youd think shed give up the smoking with her mother upstairs dying of cancer said one of the ladies wearing a gray skirt and jacket with matching hat and a large enameled pin in the shape of a holstein cow well she always was a hardheaded girl said another wearing a dress that looked as if it had been made from the same floral material as the couch you know she used to meet with my son jimmy up in pioneer park when they were little she said she was going to marry him said another woman who looked like a sister of the first the ladies laughed whimsy and sadness mixed in their tones well i dont know what she was thinking hes as flighty as can be said mom yeah and brain damaged added the sister well yes he is now since the car ran over him said sis didnt he run right in front of a car asked one of the ladies who had been silent until now no he ran right into it said mom he was on the drugs then she sighed i always said i had one of eacha boy a girl and a jimmy they all nodded this was not the first time this group had done this charlie guessed they were the type that bought sympathy cards in bulk and every time they heard an ambulance go by they made a note to pick up their black dress from the cleaners you know maddy looked bad said the lady in gray well shes dying sweetheart thats what happens i guess another sigh the tinkle of ice in glasses they were all nursing neat little cocktails charlie guessed theyd been mixed by the younger woman who was outside smoking he looked around the room for something that was glowing red there was an oak rolltop desk in the corner that hed like to get a look in but that would have to wait until later he ducked out of the doorway and into the kitchen where two men in their late thirties maybe early forties were sitting at an oak table playing scrabble is jenny coming back its her turn she might have gone up to see mom with one of the ladies the hospice nurse is letting them go up one at a time i just wish it was over i cant stand this waiting i have a family i need to get back to im about to crawl out of my fucking skin the older of the two reached across the table and set two tiny blue pills by his brothers tiles these help what are they timereleased morphine really the younger brother looked alarmed you hardly even feel them they just sort of take the edge off jennys been taking them for two weeks thats why you guys are taking this so well and im a wreck you guys are stoned on moms pain medication yep i dont take drugs those are drugs you dont take drugs the older brother sat back in his chair pain medication bill what are you feeling no im not taking moms pain meds suit yourself what if she needs them theres enough morphine in that room to bring down a kodiak bear and if she needs more then hospice will bring more charlie wanted to shake the younger brother and yell take the drugs you idiot maybe it was the benefit of experience having now seen this situation happen again and again families on deathwatch out of their minds with grief and exhaustion friends moving in and out of the house like ghosts saying goodbye or just covering some sort of base so they could say they had been there so perhaps they wouldnt have to die alone themselves why was none of this in the books of the dead why didnt the instructions tell him about all the pain and confusion he was going to see im going to go find jenny said the older brother see if she wants to get something to eat we can finish the game later if you want thats okay i was losing anyway the younger brother gathered up the tiles and put the board away im going to go upstairs and see if i can catch a nap tonights my night watching mom the older brother walked out and charlie watched the younger brother drop the blue pills into his shirt pocket and leave the kitchen leaving the death dealer to ransack the pantry and the cabinets looking for the soul vessel but he felt before he even started that it wouldnt be there he was going to have to go upstairs he really really hated being around sick people madeline alby was propped up and tucked into bed with a down comforter up around her neck she was so slight that her body barely showed under the covers charlie guessed that she might weigh seventy or eighty pounds max her face was drawn and he could see the outlines of her eye sockets and her jawbone jutting through her skin which had gone yellow charlie guessed liver cancer one of her friends from downstairs was sitting at her bedside the hospicecare worker a big woman in scrubs sat in a chair across the room reading a small dog a yorkshire terrier charlie thought was snuggled up between madelines shoulder and her neck sleeping when charlie stepped into the room madeline said hey there kid he froze in his steps she was looking right at himcrystalblue eyes and a smile had the floor squeaked had he bumped something what are you doing there kid she giggled who do you see maddy asked the friend she followed madelines gaze but looked right through charlie a kid over there okay maddy do you want some water the friend reached for a childs sippy cup with a builtin straw from the nightstand no tell that kid to come in here though come in here kid madeline worked her arms out of the covers and started moving her hands in sewing motions like she was embroidering a tapestry in the air before her well id better go said the friend let you get some rest the friend glanced at the hospice woman who looked over her reading glasses and smiled with her eyes the only expert in the house giving permission the friend stood and kissed madeline alby on the forehead madeline stopped sewing for a second closed her eyes and leaned into the kiss like a young girl her friend squeezed her hand and said goodbye maddy charlie stepped aside and let the woman pass he watched her shoulders heave with a sob as she went through the door hey kid madeline said come over here and sit down she paused in her sewing long enough to look charlie in the eye which freaked him out more than a little he glanced at the hospice worker who glanced up from her book then went back to reading charlie pointed to himself yeah you madeline said charlie was going into a panic she could see him but the hospice nurse could not or so it seemed an alarm beeped on the nurses watch and madeline picked up the little dog and held it to her ear hello hi how are you she looked up at charlie its my oldest daughter the little dog looked at charlie too with a distinct save me look in its eyes time for some medicine madeline the nurse said cant you see im on the phone sally madeline said hang on a second okay ill wait the nurse said she picked up a brown bottle with an eyedropper in it filled the dropper and checked the dosage and held bye love you too madeline said she held the tiny dog out to charlie hang that up would you the nurse snatched the dog out of the air and set it down on the bed next to madeline open up madeline the nurse said madeline opened wide and the nurse squirted the eyedropper into the old womans mouth mmm strawberry madeline said thats right strawberry would you like to wash it down with some water the nurse held the sippy cup no cheese id like some cheese i can get you some cheese said the nurse cheddar cheese cheddar it is said the nurse ill be right back she tucked the covers around madeline and left the room the old woman looked at charlie again can you talk now that shes gone charlie shrugged and looked in every direction his hand over his mouth like someone looking for an emergency spot to spit out a mouthful of bad seafood dont mime honey madeline said no one likes a mime charlie sighed heavily what was there to lose now she could see him hello madeline im charlie i always liked the name charlie madeline said how come sally cant see you only you can see me right now charlie said because im dying i think so okay youre a nicelooking kid you know that thanks youre not bad yourself im scared charlie it doesnt hurt i used to be afraid that it would hurt but now im afraid of what happens next charlie sat down on the chair next to the bed i think thats why im here madeline you dont need to be afraid i drank a lot of brandy charlie thats why this happened maddycan i call you maddy sure kid were friends yes we are maddy this was always going to happen you didnt do anything to cause it well thats good maddy do you have something for me like a present like a present you would give to yourself something i can keep for you and give you back later when it will be a surprise my pincushion madeline said id like you to have that it was my grandmothers id be honored to keep that for you maddy where can i find it in my sewing box on the top shelf of that closet she pointed to an oldstyle single closet across the room oh excuse me phone madeline talked to her oldest daughter on the edge of the comforter while charlie got the sewing box from the top shelf of the closet it was made of wicker and he could see the red glow of the soul vessel inside he removed a pincushion fashioned from red velvet wrapped with bands of real silver and held it up for madeline to see she smiled and gave him the thumbsup just as the nurse returned with a small plate of cheese and crackers its my oldest daughter madeline explained to the nurse holding the edge of the comforter to her chest so her daughter didnt hear oh my is that cheese the nurse nodded and crackers ill call you back honey sally has brought cheese and i dont want to be rude she hung up the sheet and allowed sally to feed her bites of cheese and crackers i believe this is the best cheese ive ever tasted madeline said charlie could tell from the expression on her face that it was indeed the best cheese she had ever tasted every ounce of her being was going into tasting those slivers of cheddar and she let loose little moans of pleasure as she chewed you want some cheese charlie madeline asked spraying cracker shrapnel all over the nurse who turned to look at the corner where charlie was standing with the pincushion tucked safely in his jacket pocket oh you cant see him sally madeline said tapping the nurse on the hand but hes a handsome rascal a little skinny though then to sally but overly loud to be sure that charlie could hear he could use some fucking cheese then she laughed spraying more crackers on the nurse who was laughing too and trying not to dump the plate what did she say came a voice from the hall then the two sons and the daughter entered chagrined at first at what they had heard but then laughing with the nurse and their mother i said that cheese is good madeline said yeah mom it is said the daughter charlie stood there in the corner watching them eat cheese and laughing thinking this should have been in the book he watched them help her with her bedpan and give her drinks of water and wipe her face with a damp clothwatched her bite at the cloth the way sophie did when he washed her face the eldest daughter who charlie realized had been dead for some time called three more times once on the dog and twice on the pillow around lunchtime madeline was tired and she went to sleep and about a half hour into her nap she started panting then stopped then didnt breathe for a full minute then took a deep breath then didnt and charlie slipped out the door with her soul in his pocket cry havoc and let slip the gogs of war watching madeline alby die had shaken charlie it wasnt her death so much it was the life hed seen in her minutes before she passed he thought if you have to stare death in the eye to be able to take the life out of your moments then who better to do it than the man who shaves deaths face cheese wasnt in the book charlie said to sophie as he walked her out of the shop in her new runners strollerwhich looked like someone had crossbred a carbonfiber bicycle and a baby carriage and ended up with a vehicle you could use to take a day trip to thunderdomebut it was strong easy to push and kept sophie safely wrapped in an aluminum frame because of the cheese he didnt make her wear her helmet he wanted her to be able to look around see the world around her and be in it it was watching madeline alby eat cheese with every ounce of her being like it was the first and best time that made him realize that he had never really tasted cheese or crackers or life and he didnt want his daughter to live that way hed moved her into her own room the night before the bedroom that rachel had decorated for her with clouds painted on the ceiling and a happy balloon carrying a happy bunch of animal friends across the sky in its basket he hadnt slept well and had gotten up five times during the night to check on her only to find her sleeping peacefully but he could lose a little sleep if sophie could go through life without his fears and limitations he wanted her to experience all the glorious cheese of life they strolled through north beach he stopped and bought a coffee for himself and some apple juice for sophie they shared a giant peanutbutter cookie and a crowd of pigeons followed them down the sidewalk feasting on the river of crumbs that flowed from sophies stroller the world cup soccer championships was playing on televisions in bars and cafés and people spilled out onto the sidewalks and out into the street watching the game cheering jeering hugging swearing and generally acting out waves of elation and dejection in the company of new companions who were visiting this italianamerican neighborhood from all around the world sophie cheered with the soccer fans and shrieked with joy because they were happy when the crowd was disappointeda kick blocked a play foiledsophie was distressed and would look to her daddy to fix it and make everyone happy again and daddy did because a few seconds later they were all cheering again a tall german man taught sophie to sing goooooooooooooooooooooal the way the announcer did practicing with her until she got the full fivesecond sustain and she was still practicing three blocks away when charlie had to shrug at confused onlookers as if to say the kids a soccer fan what can you do as naptime approached charlie looped through the neighborhood and headed up through washington square park where people were reading and lounging in the shade a guy played guitar and sang dylan songs for change two white rasta boys kicked a hacky sack around and people were generally settling in for a pleasant and windless summer day charlie spied a black kitten sneaking out of a hedge near busy columbus avenue stalking a wild mcmuffin wrapper it appeared and he pointed it out to sophie look sophie kitty charlie felt bad about the demise of bear the cockroach maybe this afternoon hed go to the pet shop and get a new friend for sophie sophie screamed with glee and pointed to the little cat can you say kitty charlie said sophie pointed and gave a drooly grin would you like a kitty can you say kitty sophie sophie pointed to the cat kitty she said the little cat dropped on the spot dead fresh music minty fresh answered the phone his voice a bass sax sketch of cool jazz what the fuck is this you didnt say anything about this the book didnt say anything about this what the fuck is going on youll be wanting the library or a church minty said this is a record store we dont answer general questions this is charlie asher what the fuck did you do what have you done to my little girl minty frowned and ran his hand over his scalp hed forgotten to shave this morning he should have known something was going to go wrong charlie you cant call me i told you that im sorry if something has happened to your little girl but i promise you that i she pointed at a kitten and said kitty and it fell over stone dead well that is an unfortunate coincidence charlie but kittens do have a pretty high mortality rate yeah well then she pointed to an old guy feeding the pigeons and said kitty and he dropped over dead too minty fresh was glad that there was no one in the store right then to see the look on his face because he was sure that the full impact of the willies dancing up and down his spine was blowing his appearance of unflappable chill that child has a speech disorder charlie you should have her looked at a speech disorder a speech disorder a cute lisp is a speech disorder my daughter kills people with the word kitty i had to keep my hand over her mouth all the way home theres probably video somewhere people thought i was one of those people who beats their kid in department stores dont be ridiculous charlie people love the parents who beat their kids in department stores its the ones who just let their kids wreak havoc that everybody hates can we stay on point fresh please what do you know about this what have you figured out in all your years as a death merchant minty fresh sat down on the stool behind the counter and stared into the eyes of the cardboard cutout of cher hoping to find answers there but the bitch was holding out charlie i got nothin the kid was in the room when you saw me and you saw what it did to you who knows what it did to her i told you i thought you were in a different league than the rest of us well maybe the kid is something else too ive never heard of a death merchant who could just kitty someone to death or cause anyone to die outside of normal mortal means have you tried having her use other words like puppy yeah i was going to do that but i thought it might fuck up property values if everyone in my neighborhood suddenly fell over dead no i didnt try any other words i dont even want to make her eat her green beans for fear shell kitty me im sure you have some kind of immunity the great big book says that were not immune to death ourselves id say the next time a kitten comes on the discovery channel my sister could be picking out caskets im sorry charlie i dont know what to tell you ill check out my library at home but it sounds like the kid is a lot closer than we are to how all the legends portray death things tend to balance however maybe theres some positive side to this uh disorder she has in the meantime maybe you should head over to berkeley see if you can find anything at the library there its a repository libraryevery book thats printed goes there havent you tried that yes but i wasnt looking for something specific like this look just be careful going over dont take the bart tunnel you think the sewer harpies are in the bart tunnels charlie asked sewer harpies whats that its what i call them charlie said oh i dont know its underground and ive been on a train when the power goes out i dont think you want to risk it it feels like their territory speaking of that from my end theyve been conspicuously silent for the last six months or so not a peep yeah the same here charlie said but i suppose this phone call might change that yeah it probably will but with your daughters condition we might be in a whole new game too you watch your ass charlie asher you too minty mr fresh i meant mr fresh goodbye charlie in his cabin on the great ship orcus picked his teeth with the splintered femur of an infant babd combed his black mane with her claws as the bullheaded death pondered what the morrigan had seen from the drain on columbus avenue charlie and sophie in the park it is time said nemain havent we waited long enough she clacked her claws like castanets flinging drops of venom on the walls and floor would you be careful macha said that shit stains i just put new carpet in here nemain stuck out a black tongue washerwoman she said whore macha replied i dont like this orcus said this child disturbs me nemain is right look how strong weve become babd said stroking the webbing that was growing back between the spikes on orcuss shouldersit looked as if he had fans mounted there like some ornate samurai armor let us go the childs sacrifice might give you your full wings back you think you can we can once its dark said macha were stronger than weve been in a thousand years just one of you go and go in stealth said orcus hers is a very old talent even in this new body if she masters it our chance may have passed for another thousand years kill the child and bring its corpse to me dont let her see you until you strike and her father kill him youre not that strong but if he wakes to find his child gone then maybe his grief will destroy him you dont have any idea what youre doing do you said nemain you stay here tonight said orcus dammit said nemain slinging steaming venom across the wall oh pardon me for questioning the exalted one hey head of the bull i wonder what comes out of the other end ha said babd ha good one and what kind of brain do you find under the feathers said orcus oh he got you nemain think about how bad he got you when im killing the child tonight i was talking to you orcus said macha goes she came in through the roof tearing up the bubble skylight over the fourth floor and dropping into the hallway she moved as silent as a shadow down the hall to the stairs then appeared to float down her feet barely touching the steps on the second floor she paused at the door and examined the locks there were two strong dead bolts in addition to the one in the main plate she looked up and saw a stainedglass transom latched with a tiny brass latch a claw slipped quickly through the gap and with a twist of the wrist the brass lock popped off and clattered on the hardwood floor inside she slithered up and through the transom and flattened herself against the floor inside waiting like a pool of shadow she could smell the child hear the gentle snoring coming from across the apartment she moved to the middle of the great room and paused new meat was there too she could sense him sleeping in the room across from the child if he interfered shed tear his head from his body and take it back to the ship as proof to orcus that he should never underestimate her she was tempted to take him anyway but not until she had the child a nightlight in the childs room sent a soft pink band of light across the living room macha waved a taloned hand and the light went out she trilled a small purr of selfsatisfaction there had been a time when she could extinguish a human life in the same way and maybe that time was coming again she slid into the childs room and paused by the moonlight streaming through the window she could see that the child lay curled on her side in her crib hugging a plush rabbit but she couldnt see into the corners of the roomthe shadows so dark and liquid that even her nightcreature eyes couldnt penetrate them she moved to the crib and leaned over it the child was sleeping with her mouth wide open macha decided to drive a single claw through the roof of her mouth into her brain it would be silent leave plenty of blood for the father to find and she could carry the childs corpse that way hooked on her claw like a fish for the market she reached down slowly and leaned into the crib so shed have maximum leverage for the plunge the moonlight sparkled off the threeinch talon and she drew back and she was distracted for an instant by its pretty shininess when the jaws locked down on her arm motherfu she screeched as she was whipped around and slammed against the wall another set of jaws clamped onto her ankle she twisted herself into a halfdozen forms which did nothing to free her and she was tossed around like a rag doll into the dresser the crib the wall again she raked at her attacker with her claws found purchase then felt as if her claws were being ripped out by the root so she let go she could see nothing just felt wild disorienting movement then impact she kicked hard at whatever had her ankle and it released her but the attacker on her arm whipped her through the window and against the security bars outside she heard glass hitting the street below pushed with all her might shapeshifting at a furious rate until she was through the bars and falling to the pavement ouch fuck came the shout from out on the street a female voice ouch charlie flipped on the light to see sophie sitting up in her crib holding her bunny and laughing the window behind her had been shattered and the glass was gone every piece of furniture except the crib had been overturned and there were basketballsized holes in the plaster of two walls the wooden lath behind it splintered as well all over the floor there were black feathers and what looked like blood but even as charlie watched the feathers started to evaporate into smoke goggy daddy sophie said goggy then she giggled sophie slept the rest of the night in daddys bed while daddy sat up in a chair next to her watching the locked door his swordcane at his side there was no window in charlies bedroom so the door was the only way in or out when sophie awoke just after dawn charlie changed her bathed her and dressed her for the day then he called jane to make her breakfast while he cleaned up the glass and plaster in sophies room and went downstairs to find some plywood to nail over the broken window he hated that he couldnt call the police couldnt call someone but if this is what one phone call to another death merchant was going to cause he couldnt risk it and what would the police say anyway about black feathers and blood that dissolved to smoke as you watched someone threw a brick through sophies window last night he told jane wow on the second floor too i thought you were crazy when you put security bars all the way up the building but i guess not so much now you should replace the window with that glass with the wire running through it just to be safe i will charlie said safe he had no idea what had happened in sophies room but the fact that she was safe amid all the destruction scared the hell out of him hed replace the window but the kid was sleeping in his room from now until she was thirty and married to a huge guy with ninja skills when charlie returned from the basement with the sheet of plywood and hammer and nails he found jane sitting at the breakfast counter smoking a cigarette jane i thought you quit yeah i did a month ago found this one in my purse why are you smoking in my house i went into sophies room to get her bunny for her yeah wheres sophie there might still be some glass on the floor in there you didnt yeah shes in there and youre not funny asher your thing with the pets has gone completely overboard im going to have to do three yoga classes get a massage and smoke a joint the size of a thermos bottle to take the adrenaline edge off they scared me so bad i peed myself a little what in the hell are you talking about jane funny she said smirking thats really funny im talking about the goggies daddy charlie shrugged at his sister as if to say could you be any more incoherent or incomprehensible a gesture he had perfected over thirtytwo years then ran to sophies room and threw the door open there on either side of his darling daughter were the two biggest blackest dogs he had ever seen sophie was sitting leaning against one while hitting the other in the head with her stuffed bunny charlie took a step toward rescuing sophie when one of the dogs leapt across the room and knocked charlie to the floor pinning him there the other put itself between charlie and the baby sophie daddys coming to get you dont be afraid charlie tried to squirm out from under the dog but it just lowered its head and growled at him it didnt budge charlie figured that it could take the better part of one of his legs and some of his torso off in one bite the things head was bigger than the bengal tigers at the san francisco zoo jane help me get this thing off of me the big dog looked up keeping its paws on charlies shoulders jane swiveled on her bar stool and took a deep drag on her cigarette no i dont think so little brother youre on your own after springing this on me i didnt ive never seen these things before no ones ever seen these things before you know we dykes have very high dog tolerance but that doesnt give you the right to do this well ill leave you to it jane said gathering up her purse and keys from the breakfast bar you enjoy your little canine pals im going to go call in freaked out to work jane wait but she was gone he heard the front door slam the big dog didnt seem to be interested in eating charlie just holding him there every time he tried to slither out from under it the thing growled and pushed harder down heel off charlie tried commands hed heard dog trainers shout on tv fetch roll over get the fuck off me you beast he adlibbed that last one the animal barked in charlies left ear so loud that he lost hearing and there was just a ringing on that side in his other ear he heard a littlegirl giggle from across the room sophie honey its okay goggie daddy sophie said goggie she stumbled over and looked down at charlie the big dog licked her face nearly knocking her over at eighteen months sophie moved like a small drunk most of the time goggie sophie said again she grabbed the giant hound by its ear and dragged it off charlie or more accurately it let her lead it by the ear off of him charlie leapt to his feet and started to reach for sophie but the other hound jumped in front of him and growled the things head came up to charlies chest even with its feet flat on the ground he figured the hounds must weigh four or five hundred pounds apiece they were easily twice the size of the biggest dog hed seen before a newfoundland that hed seen swimming in the aquatic park down by the maritime museum they had the short fur of a doberman the broad shoulders and chest of a rottweiler but the wide square head and upturned ears of a great dane they were so black that they appeared to actually absorb light and charlie had only ever seen one type of creature that did that the ravens from the underworld it was clear that wherever these hounds had come from it wasnt from around here but it was also clear that they were not here to hurt sophie she wouldnt even make a good meal for animals this size and they certainly could have snapped her in two long before now if theyd meant her harm the damage in sophies room the night before might have been caused by the hounds but they had not been the aggressors something had come here to hurt her and they had protected her even as they were now charlie didnt care why he was just grateful that they were on his side where theyd been when he first rushed into the room after the window broke he didnt know but it appeared that now that they were here they were not going to go away okay im not going to hurt her charlie said the dog relaxed and backed off a few steps shes going to need to go potty charlie said feeling a little stupid he just noticed that they were both wearing wide silver collars which strangely disturbed him more than their size after the stretching it had gotten over the last year and a half his beta male imagination fit easily around two giant hounds showing up in his little girls bedroom but the idea that someone had put collars on them was throwing him there was a knock at the front door and charlie backed out of the room honey daddy will be right back barking mad charlie opened the door and lily breezed by jane said you have two huge black dogs up here i need to see lily wait charlie called but she was across the living room and into sophies room before he could stop her there was a low growl and she came backing out oh my fucking god dude she said around a huge grin they are so cool where did you get them i didnt get them anywhere they were just here charlie joined lily just outside the door to sophies room she turned and grabbed his arm are they like instruments of your death dealing or something lily i thought we agreed that we wouldnt talk about that and they had in fact lily had been great about it since shed first found out about him being a death merchant shed hardly brought it up at all shed also gone on to graduate from high school without getting a major criminal record and enroll in the culinary institute the upside of which was that she actually wore her white chef s coat checked pants and rubber clogs to work which tended to soften her makeup and hair which remained severe dark and a little scary sophie giggled and rolled over against one of the hounds they had been licking her and she was covered with hellish dog spit her hair was plastered into a dozen unlikely spikes making her appear a little like a wideeyed animé character sophie saw lily in the doorway and waved goggie ily goggie she said hi sophie yes those are nice doggies lily said then to charlie what are you going to do i dont know what to do they wont let me near her thats good then theyre here to protect her charlie nodded i think they are something happened last night you know how the great big book talks about the others i think one of them came after her last night and these guys showed up im impressed id think youd be more freaked out charlie didnt want to tell her that he was worn out from freaking out the day before about his little girl killing an old man with the word kitty lily already knew too much and it was obvious now that whatever lay below was dangerous i guess i should be but they arent here to hurt her i need to go check the library in berkeley see if theres anything about them there i need to get sophie away from them lily laughed yeah thats going to happen look i have work and school today but ill go do your research for you tomorrow in the meantime you can try to make friends with them i dont want to make friends with them lily looked at the hounds one of whom sophie was pounding on with her little fists as she laughed gleefully then looked back at charlie yes you do yeah i guess i do charlie said have you ever seen a dog that size before there are no dogs that size what do you call those then those arent dogs asher those are hellhounds how do you know that i know that because before i started learning about herbs and reductions and stuff i spent my free time reading about the dark side and those guys come up from time to time if we know that then what are you going to do research on im going to try to find out what sent them she patted his shoulder i have to go open the shop you go make nice with the goggies what do i feed them purina hellhound chow they make that what do you think kay charlie said it took a couple of hours but after sophie started smelling like diaper surprise one of the giant dogs nosed her toward charlie as if to say clean her up and bring her back charlie could feel them watching him as he changed his daughter grateful that disposable diapers didnt require pins if hed accidentally poked sophie with a pin he was sure one of the hellhounds would have bitten his head off they watched him carefully as he moved her to the breakfast bar and sat on either side of her high chair as he gave her breakfast as an experiment he made an extra piece of toast and tossed it to one of the hounds it snapped it out of the air and licked its chops once eyes now locked on charlie and the loaf of bread so charlie toasted four more slices and the hounds alternately snapped each out of the air so swiftly that charlie wasnt sure he didnt see some sort of vapor from the pressure of their jaws clamping down so youre hellish beasts from another dimension and you like toast okay then as charlie started to toast four more slices he stopped feeling stupid you dont really care if its toasted do you he flipped a slice of bread to the closest of the dogs who snapped it out of the air okay that will speed things up charlie fed them the remainder of the loaf of bread he spread a few slices with a thick coat of peanut butter which did nothing whatsoever then a half dozen more he spread with lemon dishwasher gel which appeared to have no ill effect except that it made them burp neat aquamarinecolored bubbles go walk daddy sophie said no walk today sweetie i think well just stay right here in the apartment and try to figure out our new pals charlie got sophie out of her chair wiped the jelly off her face and out of her hair then sat down with her on the couch to read to her from the chronicles classified ads which was where he plied a large part of his business other than the death stuff but no sooner had he settled into a rhythm than one of the hellhounds came over took his arm in its mouth and dragged him into his bedroom even as he protested swore and smacked it in the head with a brass table lamp the big dog let him go then stood staring at charlies date book like it had been sprayed with beef gravy what charlie said but then he saw somehow in all the excitement he hadnt noticed a new name in the book look the number is thirty i have a whole month to find this one leave me alone charlie also noticed in passing that engraved on the hellhounds great silver collar was the name alvin alvin thats the stupidest name ive ever heard charlie went back to the couch and the dog dragged him back into the bedroom this time by the foot as they went through the door charlie reached for his swordcane when alvin dropped him charlie leapt to his feet and drew the blade the big dog rolled over on his back and whimpered his companion appeared at the door panting mohammed was the hounds name according to the plate on the collar charlie considered his options he had always felt the swordcane a pretty formidable weapon had even been willing to take on the sewer harpies with it but it occurred to him that these animals had obviously wiped the floor with one of those other creatures of darkness and had no problem sitting down and eating a loaf of soapy toast a couple of hours later in short he was out of his league they wanted him to go retrieve the soul vessel he would retrieve the soul vessel but he wasnt leaving his darling daughter alone with them alvin is still a stupid name he said sheathing the sword when mrs korjev arrived charlie had put sophie down for her nap and a dark pile of hellhounds was napping by her cribsnoring great clouds of lemonyfresh dog breath into the air it was probably part of charlies rising rascal nature but he let mrs korjev enter sophies room with only the warning that the little girl had a couple of new pets he suppressed a snicker as the great cossack grandmother backed out of the room swearing in russian is giant dogs in there yes there are but not like normal giant dog they are like extragiant black animal they are like bear charlie suggested no i wasnt going to say bear mr smartalec not like bear like volf only bigger stronger like bear charlie ventured you make your mother ashamed when you are mean charlie asher not like bear charlie asked is not important now i am just surprised vladlena is old woman with weak heart but you go have good laugh and i will sit with sophie and huge dogs thank you mrs korjev their names are alvin and mohammed its on their collars you have food for them there are some steaks in the freezer just give each one of them a couple and stand back how they like steaks done i think frozen will be fine they eat like mrs korjev raised a finger in warning it lined it up with a large mole on the side of her nose and looked as if she was sighting down a weapon like horses they eat like horses charlie said mrs ling did not take her introduction to alvin and mohammed with quite the composure of her russian neighbor aiiiiieeeeeeeeee giant shiksas shitting exclaimed mrs ling as she ran down the hall after charlie come back shiksas shitting indeed charlie returned to the apartment to find great steaming baguettes of poo strewn about the living room alvin and mohammed were flanking the door to sophies room like massive chinese foo dogs at the temple gates looking not so fierce as shamefaced and contrite bad dogs charlie said scaring mrs ling bad dogs he considered for a moment trying to rub their noses in their offense but short of bringing in a backhoe and chaining them to it he wasnt sure that he could make that happen i mean it you guys he added in an especially stern voice im sorry mrs ling charlie said to the diminutive matron these are alvin and mohammed i should have been more specific when i said id gotten new pets for sophie actually he had been vague on purpose hoping for some sort of hysterical reaction not that he really wanted to frighten the old lady its just that beta males are seldom ever in a position to frighten anyone physically so when they get the opportunity they sometimes lose their sense of judgment is okay said mrs ling staring at the hellhounds she seemed distracted mainly because she was having recovered from the initial shock she was doing the math in her heada rapidfire abacus clicking off the weight and volume of each ponysized canine and dividing him into chops steaks ribs and packages of stew meat youll be all right then charlie asked you not be late okay said mrs ling i want to go to sears and look at chest freezer today you have power saw i can borrow power saw well no but im sure ray has one he can lend you ill be back in a couple of hours charlie said but let me clean this up first he headed to the basement in hopes of finding the coal shovel that his father had once kept there as they parted ways that day both charlie and mrs ling were counting on sophies history of high pet mortality to quickly solve their respective poop and soup problems such however was not to be the case when several weeks passed with no ill effects on the hellhounds charlie accepted the possibility that these might indeed be the only pets that could survive sophies attention he was tempted many times to call minty fresh and ask his advice but since his last call might have caused the hellhounds to appear in the first place he resisted the urge lilys research trips yielded little more they talk about them all through time lily said calling from the berkeley library on her cell phone mostly its about how they like to chase blues singers and evidently theres a german robot soccer team called the hellhounds but i dont think thats relevant the thing that comes up again and again in a dozen cultures is that they guard the passage between the living and the dead well that makes sense charlie said i guess it doesnt say where that passage is does it what bart station no asher it doesnt but i found this book by a nun who had been excommunicated in the s isnt that cool this library is amazing they have like nine million books yes thats great lily what did the exnun say she had found all the references for hellhounds and the thing they all seemed to agree on was they serve directly the ruler of the underworld she was catholic and she called it the underworld well they threw her out of the church for writing this book but yeah thats what she said she didnt have a number we could call in case they got lost im over here on my day off asher trying to do you a favor are you going to keep being a smartass about it no im sorry lily go on thats it its not like theres a careandfeeding guide mostly the research implies that having hellhounds around is a bad thing whats the title of this book the complete guide to the fucking obvious youre paying me for this you know time and travel sorry yes so i should try to get rid of them they eat people asher whos riding the duh train now so with that charlie decided that he needed to take an active role in ridding himself of the monstrous canines since the only thing about the hellhounds that he could be sure of was that they would go anywhere he took sophie he brought them along on their trip to the san francisco zoo and left them locked in the van with the engine running and a shopvac hose run from the exhaust pipe through the vent window after what he considered to be an extraordinarily successful tour of the zoo in which not a single animal shuffled off the mortal coil under the delighted eye of his daughter charlie returned to the van to find two very stoned but otherwise unharmed hellhounds who were burping a burnt plastic vapor after having eaten his seat covers various experiments revealed that alvin and mohammed were not only immune to most poisons but they rather liked the taste of bug spray and consequently licked all the paint off the baseboards in charlies apartment in the week following the exterminators quarterly service as time wore on charlie tried to measure the danger of having the giant canines around against the damage that would be done to sophies psyche from witnessing their demise as she was obviously becoming attached to them so he backed off the more direct attacks on them and stopped throwing snausages in front of the number crosstown express bus this decision was also made easy when the city of san francisco threatened to sue charlie if his dogs wrecked another bus direct attacks in fact were difficult for charlie as the only true beta male martial art was based entirely on the kindness of strangers so he turned on the hellhounds the awesome power of the beta male kung fu of passive aggression he started conservatively taking them for a ride over to the east bay in the van luring them onto the oakland mudflats with a rack of beef ribs then driving away quickly only to find them waiting in the apartment when he returned having covered the entire living room with a patina of drying mud he then tried an even more indirect approach crating up the hounds and airfreighting them to korea in the hope they would find themselves in an entrée only to find that they actually made it back to the shop before he had time to sweep the dog hair out of his apartment he thought that perhaps he might use their own natural instincts to chase them away after he read on the internet that the essence of cougar urine was sometimes sprinkled on shrubs and flowers to keep dogs from urinating on them after a fairly exhaustive search through the phone book he finally found the number of an outdoorsmans supply store in south san francisco that was a certified mountainlion whizz dealer sure we carry cougar urine the guy said he sounded like he was wearing a buckskin jacket and had a big beard but charlie might have just been projecting and thats supposed to keep dogs away charlie asked works like a charm dogs deer and rabbits how much do you need i dont know maybe ten gallons there was a pause and charlie was sure he could hear the guy picking flecks of elk meat out of his beard we sell it in one two and fiveounce bottles well thats not going to do it charlie said cant you get me like a large economy sizepreferably from a cougar thats been fed nothing but dog for a couple of months i assume that this is domesticated cougar pee right i mean you dont go out in the wild and collect it yourself no sir i believe they get it from zoos the wild stuff is probably better huh charlie asked if you can get it i mean i dont mean you personally i wasnt implying that you were out in the wild following a mountain lion around with a measuring cup i meant a professionalhello the bearded buckskinsounding guy had hung up so charlie sent ray over to south san francisco in the van to buy up all the cougar whizz they had but in the end it achieved nothing other than making the whole second floor of charlies building smell like a cat box when it appeared that even the most passiveaggressive attempts would not work charlie resorted to the ultimate beta male attack which was to tolerate alvin and mohammeds presence but to resent the hell out of them and drop snide remarks whenever he had the chance feeding the hellhounds was like shoveling coal into two ravenous steam enginescharlie started having fifty pounds of dog food delivered every two days to keep up with them which they in turn converted to massive torpedoes of poo that they dropped in the streets and alleys around ashers secondhand like they were staging their own doggie blitzkrieg on the neighborhood the upside of their presence was that charlie went for months on end without hearing a peep from the storm drains or seeing an ominous raven shadow on a wall when he was retrieving a soul vessel and to that end the death dealing the hounds served their purpose as well for whenever a new name appeared in his date book the hounds would drag charlie to the calendar every morning until he returned with the soul object so he went two years without missing or being late for a retrieval the big dogs of course accompanied charlie and sophie on their walks which had resumed once charlie was sure that sophie had her special language skill under control the hounds while certainly the largest dogs that anyone had ever seen were not so large as to be unbelievable and everywhere they went charlie was asked what breed they were tired of trying to explain he would simply say theyre hellhounds and when asked where he got them he would reply they just showed up in my daughters room one night and wouldnt go away after which people not only thought him a liar but an ass as well so he modified his response to theyre irish hellhounds which for some reason people accepted immediately except for one irish football fan in a north beach restaurant who said im irish and those things arent bloody irish to which charlie replied black irish the football fan nodded as if he knew that all along and added to the waitress can i get another fookin pint o here before i dry up and blow away lass in a way charlie started to enjoy the notoriety of being the guy with the cute little girl and the two giant dogs when you have to maintain a secret identity you cant help but relish a little public attention and charlie did until the day he and sophie were stopped on a side street on russian hill by a bearded man in a long cotton caftan and a woven hat sophie was old enough by then to do a lot of her own walking although charlie kept a piggyback kid sling with him so he could carry her when she got tired but more often he would just balance her while she rode on the back of alvin or mohammed the bearded man passed a little too closely to sophie and mohammed growled and imposed himself between the man and the child mohammed get back here charlie said it turned out the hellhounds could be trained especially if you only told them to do things they were going to do anyway eat alvin good boy poop now excellent why do you call this dog mohammed asked the bearded man because thats his name you should not have called this dog mohammed i didnt call the dog mohammed charlie said his name was mohammed when i got him it was on his collar it is blasphemy to call a dog mohammed i tried calling him something else but he doesnt listen watch steve bite this mans leg see nothing spot bite off this mans leg nothing i might as well be speaking farsi you see where im going with this well i have named my dog jesus how do you feel about that well then im sorry i didnt realize youd lost your dog i have not lost my dog really i saw these flyers all over town with have you found jesus on them it must be another dog named jesus was there a reward a reward helps you know charlie noted that more and more lately he had a hard time resisting the urge to fuck with people especially when they insisted upon behaving like idiots i do not have a dog named jesus and that doesnt bother you because you are a godless infidel no really you can not name your dog anything you want and it wont bother me but yes i am a godless infidel at least thats how i voted in the last election charlie grinned at him death to the infidel death to the infidel said the bearded man in response to charlies irresistible charm he danced around shaking his fist in the death merchants face which scared sophie so that she covered her eyes and started to cry stop that youre scaring my daughter death to the infidel death to the infidel mohammed and alvin quickly got bored watching the dance and sat down to wait for someone to tell them to eat the guy in the nightshirt i mean it charlie said you need to stop he looked around feeling embarrassed but there was no one else on the street death to the infidel death to the infidel chanted the beard have you seen the size of these dogs mohammed death tohey how did you know my name was mohammed doesnt matter never mind death to the infidel death to the wow you certainly are brave charlie said but shes a little girl and youre scaring her and you really need to stop that now death to the infidel death to the infidel kitty sophie said uncovering her eyes and pointing at the man oh honey charlie said i thought we werent going to do that charlie slung sophie up on his shoulders and walked on leading the hellhounds away from the bearded dead man who lay in a peaceful heap on the sidewalk he had stuffed the mans little woven hat in his pocket it was glowing a dull red strangely the bearded mans name wouldnt appear in charlies date book until the next day see a sense of humor is important charlie said making a goofy face over his shoulder at his daughter silly daddy sophie said later charlie felt bad about his daughter using the kitty word as a weapon and he felt that a decent father would try to give some sort of meaning to the experienceteach some sort of lesson so he sat sophie down with a pair of stuffed bears some tiny cups of invisible tea a plate of imaginary cookies and two giant hounds from hell and had his first hearttoheart fatherdaughter talk honey you understand why daddy told you not to ever do that again right why people cant know that you can do that were different than other people sophie said thats right honey because were different than other people he said to the smartest prettiest little girl in the world and you know why that is right because were chinese and the white devils cant be trusted no not because were chinese because we are russian and in our hearts are much sorrow no there is not much sorrow in our hearts because we are strong like bear yes sweetie thats it were different because were strong like bear i knew it more tea daddy yes id love some more tea sophie so said the emperor i see you have experienced the multifarious ways in which a mans life is enriched by the company of a good brace of hounds charlie was sitting on the back step of the shop pulling whole frozen chickens from a crate and tossing them to alvin and mohammed one at a time each chicken was snapped out of the air with so much force that the emperor and bummer and lazarus who were crouched across the alley suspiciously eyeing the hellhounds flinched as if a pistol was being fired nearby multifarious enrichment charlie said tossing another chicken that is exactly how id describe it there is no better nor more loyal friend than a good hound said the emperor charlie paused having pulled not a chicken from the box but a portable electric mixer a friend indeed he said a friend indeed mohammed snapped down the mixer without even chewingtwo feet of cord hung from the side of his mouth that doesnt hurt him said the emperor roughage charlie explained throwing a frozen chicken chaser to mohammed who gulped it down with the rest of the mixer cord theyre not really my dogs they belong to sophie a child needs a pet said the emperor a companion to grow up withalthough these fellows seem to have done most of their growing charlie nodded tossing the alternator from an eightythree buick into alvins eager jaws there was a clanking and the dog belched but his tail thumped against the dumpster asking for more well they have been her constant companions charlie said at least now we have them trained so theyll just guard whatever building shes in for a while they wouldnt leave her side bath time was a challenge the emperor said i believe it was the poet billy collins who wrote no one here likes a wet dog yes and he probably never had to get a squirming toddler and two fourhundredpound dogs out of a bubble bath either but theyve mellowed you say they had to sophie started school the teacher frowned on giant dogs in class charlie flipped an answering machine to alvin who crunched it up like a dog biscuit shards of dogspitcovered plastic raining down from his jaws so what did you do it took us a few days and a lot of explaining but i trained them to just sit outside the front door of the school and the faculty relented well i spraypaint them with that granitetexture spray paint every morning then tell them to sit absolutely still on either side of the door no one seems to notice them and they obey all day well its just a half day right now shes only in kindergarten and you have to promise them a cookie theres always a price to be paid the emperor pulled a frozen chicken out of the box may i please charlie waved him on the emperor tossed the chicken to mohammed who chomped it down in a single bite my that is satisfying said the emperor thats nothing charlie said if you feed them minipropane cylinders they burp fire the call of booty fuck puppets ray said out of nowhere he was on the stairclimbing machine next to charlie and they were both sweating and staring at a row of six perfectly tuned female bottoms aimed at them from the machines in front of them what was that charlie said fuck puppets ray said thats what they are ray had talked charlie into coming to his health club with him under the pretense of getting him into the flow of being single actually because ray was an excop watched people more closely than really was healthy had too much time on his hands and didnt get out much himself the real reason he asked charlie to come work out with him was so he could get to know him outside of the shop hed noticed a strange pattern that had developed since rachels death of charlie showing up with peoples property shortly after their obituary appeared in the paper because charlie kept to himself socially and was secretive about what he did when he was out of the shop not to mention all the little animals that ended up dead in charlies apartment ray suspected that he might be a serial killer ray decided to try to get close to his boss and find out for sure keep your voice down ray charlie said jeez since ray couldnt turn his head he was talking right at the womens butts they cant hear me look every single one has on a headset he was right every one of them was talking on a cell phone you and i are invisible to them having actually been invisible to people or nearly so charlie did a double take it was midmorning and the gym was full of lean spandexclad women in their twenties with disproportionately large breasts perfect skin and expensive hair who seemed to have the ability to look right through him the way that everyone did when he was in pursuit of a soul vessel in fact when he and ray had first come into the gym charlie had actually looked around for some object pulsing red thinking that he might have missed a name on his date book that morning after i was shot i dated a physical therapist that worked here for a while ray said she called them that fuck puppets every one of them has an apartment that some older executive guy is paying forjust like he paid for the healthclub membership and the fake tits they spend their days getting facials and manicures and their nights under some suit out of his suit charlie was wildly uncomfortable with rays litany talking about these women who were only a couple of feet away like any beta male he would have been wildly uncomfortable in the presence of so many beautiful women anyway but this made it worse so like theyre like trophy wives charlie said nuhuh like wannabe trophy wives they dont get the guy the house whatever they just exist to be his perfect piece of ass fuck puppets charlie said fuck puppets said ray but forget them theyre not why youre here ray was right of course they werent why charlie was there five years had passed since rachels death and everyone had been telling him he needed to get back in the game but thats not why he agreed to accompany the excop to the gym because charlie spent too much time on his own especially since sophie had started school and because hed been hiding a secret identity and avocation hed started to suspect that everyone might have one and since ray kept to himself talked a lot about people in the neighborhood who had died and because he really didnt seem to have a social life beyond the filipino women he contacted online charlie suspected ray might be a serial killer charlie thought hed try to get closer to ray and find out so theyre like mistresses charlie said like in europe i suppose ray said but did you ever get the impression that mistresses worked this hard to look good i think fuck puppet is more accurate because when they get too old to hold the attention of their guy theyve got nothing more going theyll be done like marionettes with no one at the strings jeez ray thats harsh maybe ray is stalking one of these women charlie thought ray shrugged charlie looked up and down the line of perfect derrieres then felt the weight of his years alone or in the company of a child and two giant dogs and said i want a fuck puppet aha thought ray hes picking a victim me too he said but guys like us dont get fuck puppets charlie we just get ignored by them aha charlie thought the bitter sociopath comes out so thats why you brought me here so i could show i was out of shape in front of gorgeous women who wouldnt notice no the fuck puppets are fun to look at but theres some normal women who come here too who wont talk to me either ray thought who wont talk to you either charlie said because they can tell that you are a psychokiller well see in the juice bar after our workout ray said where ill sit at an angle so i can watch you pick your victim you sick fuck they thought charlie awoke to find not one but three new names in his date book and the last one a madison mckerny had only three days for him to retrieve her soul vessel charlie kept a stack of newspapers in the house and typically would go back for a month looking for an obituary of his new client more often if the hellhounds would give him some peace he would simply wait for the name to appear in the obituary section then go find the soul vessel when it was easy to get into the house with mourners or posing as an estate buyer but this time he had only three days and madison mckerny hadnt appeared in the obituaries so that meant she was probably still alive and he couldnt find her in the phone book either so he was going to need to get moving quickly mrs ling and mrs korjev liked to do their marketing on saturdays so he called his sister jane and asked her to come watch sophie i want a baby brother sophie announced to her auntie jane oh sweetie im sorry you cant have a baby brother because that would mean that daddy had sex and thats never going to happen again jane dont talk to her that way charlie said he was making sandwiches for them and wondering why he always got stuck making the sandwiches to sophie he said honey why dont you go in your room and play with alvin and mohammed daddy needs to talk with auntie jane okay sophie said skipping off to her room and dont change clothes again those are fine charlie said thats the fourth outfit shes had on today he said to jane she changes clothes like you change girlfriends ouch be gentle chuck im sensitive and i can still kick your ass charlie spanked some mayonnaise onto a whole wheat slice to show he was serious jane im not sure its healthy for her to have all these different aunties around shes already had a hard time losing her mother and now youve moved awayi just dont think she should keep getting attached to these women only to have them yanked out of her life she needs a consistent female influence first i have not moved away ive moved across town and i see her every bit as often as when i lived in the building second its not like im promiscuous im just shitty at relationships third cassie and i have been together for three months and were doing fine so far which is why ive moved out and fourth sophie did not lose her mother she never had her mother she had you and if youre going to be a decent human being you need to get laid thats what i mean you cant talk like that in front of sophie charlie its true even sophie can see it she doesnt even know what it is and she can tell that youre not getting any charlie stopped constructing sandwiches and came over to the counter its not sex jane its human contact i was getting my hair cut the other day and the hairdressers breast rubbed against my shoulder and i almost came then i almost cried sounds like sex to me little brother have you been with anyone since rachel died you know i havent thats wrong rachel wouldnt want that for you you have to know that i mean she took pity on you and hooked up with you and that couldnt have been easy for her knowing she could do so much better took pity on me thats what im saying she was a sweet woman and youre much more pitiful now than you were then you had more hair then and you didnt have a kid and two dogs the size of volvos hell theres probably some order of nuns that would do you now just as a holy act of mercy or penance stop it jane the sisters of perpetual nookiless suffering im not that bad charlie said the holy order of saint bonny of the bj patron saint of web porn and incurable wankers okay jane im sorry i said that about you changing girlfriends i was out of line jane leaned back on her bar stool and crossed her arms looking satisfied but skeptical but the problem remains im fine i have sophie and i have the business i dont need a girlfriend a girlfriend a girlfriend is too ambitious for you you just need someone to have sex with i do not yes you do yes i do charlie said defeated but i have to go are you okay to watch sophie sure im going to take her to my place i have an obnoxious neighbor up the street that id like to introduce to the puppies will they poop on command they will if sophie tells them perfect well see you tonight promise me youll ask someone out or at least look for someone to ask out i promise good did you get that new blue pinstripe tailored yet stay out of my closet dont you need to get going ray figured that it had probably started when charlie murdered all those little animals he brought home for his daughter maybe buying the big black dogs was a cry for helppets that someone would really notice being gone according to the movies they all started out that waywith the little animals then before long they moved up to hitchhikers hookers and pretty soon they were mummifying a whole flock of counselors at some remote summer camp and posing the crusty remains around a card table in their mountain lair the mountain lair didnt fit the profile for charlie since he had allergies but that might just be an indication of his diabolical genius ray had been a street cop so it hadnt really been necessary for him to study criminal profiling and his theories tended toward the colorful a side effect of his beta male imagination and large dvd collection but charlie had asked ray to use his contacts on the force and at the dmv a halfdozen times to locate people all of whom ended up dead a few weeks later but not murders and while a lot of items belonging to the recently deceased had turned up in the shop in the last few years ray had found antitheft numbers etched on a dozen items and called them in to a friend on the force who identified the owners none of them had been murdered either there were a few accidents but mostly it was natural causes either charlie was devious to an extraordinary degree or ray was out of his mind a possibility that he didnt discount completely if for no other reason than he had three exwives who would testify to it thus hed devised the workout ruse to draw charlie out then again charlie had always treated him really well and if it turned out he didnt have a mountain lair full of mummified camp counselors ray knew hed feel bad about tricking him what if there was nothing wrong with charlie except that he needed to get laid ray was chatting with eduardo his new girlfriend at desperatefilipinacom when charlie came down the back steps ray i need you to find someone for me hang on a second i have to sign off charlie check out my new squeeze ray pulled up a photo on the screen of a heavily madeup but attractive asian woman shes pretty ray i cant give you any time off right now to go to the philippines though not until we hire someone to take lilys shifts charlie leaned into the screen dude her name is eduardo i know its a filipino thing like edwina she has a fiveoclock shadow youre just being a racist some races have more facial hair than others i dont care about that i just want someone who is honest and caring and attractive she has an adams apple ray squinted at the screen then quickly clicked off the monitor and spun around on the stool so who do you need me to find its okay ray charlie said an adams apple doesnt preclude someone from being honest caring and attractive it just makes it less likely right it was just bad lighting i think anyway who do you need to find all i have is the name madison mckerny i know he or she lives in the city but thats all i know its a she pardon me madison its a strippers name charlie shook his head you know this woman i dont know her although the name seems familiar but madison is a newgeneration stripper name like reagan and morgan lost me ray ive spent some time in strip joints charlie im not proud of it but its sort of what you do when youre a cop and you pick up on the pattern of stripper names didnt know that yeah and theres sort of a progression going back to the fifties bubbles boom boom and blaze begat bambi candy and jewel who begat sunshine brandy and cinnamon who begat amber brittany and brie who begat reagan morgan and madison madison is a stripper name ray you werent even alive in the fifties no i wasnt alive during the forties either but i know about world war two and bigband music im into history right so i need to look for a stripper doesnt help i dont even know where to start ill go through the dmv and the tax records if shes in town well have an address on her by this afternoon why do you need to find her there was a pause while charlie pretended to find a smudge on the glass of the counter display case wiped it away then said uh its an estate thing one of the estates we got recently had some items that were left to her shouldnt the executor of the estate take care of that or his lawyer its minutiae not named in the will the executor asked me to handle it theres fifty bucks in it for you ray grinned thats okay i was going to help anyway but if she turns out to be a stripper i get to go with you okay deal charlie said three hours later ray gave the address to charlie and watched as his boss bolted out of the shop and grabbed a cab why a cab why not take the van ray wanted to follow needed to follow but he had to find someone to cover the store he should have anticipated this but hed been distracted ray had been distracted since talking to charlie not just by the search for madison mckerny but also because he was trying to figure out how to work do you have a penis casually into the conversation with his sweetheart eduardo after a couple of teasing emails he could stand it no longer and had just typed out eduardo not that it makes any difference but im thinking of sending you some sexy lingerie as a friendship present and i wondered if i should make any special accommodations for the panties then he waited and waited and granted that it was five in the morning in manila he was secondguessing himself had he been too vague or had he not been vague enough and now he had to go he knew where charlie was going but he had to get there before anything happened he dialed lilys cell phone hoping that she wouldnt be working at her other job and would do him a favor speak ingrate lily answered how did you know it was me ray asked ray yeah how did you know it was me i didnt lily said what do you want can you come cover the store for me for a couple of hours then as he heard her take a deep breath that he was pretty sure would be propellant for verbal abuse he added theres fifty bucks extra in it for you ray heard her exhale yes after graduating from the culinary institute lily had gotten a job as a sous chef at a bistro in north beach but she didnt make enough to move out of her mothers apartment yet so she let charlie talk her into keeping a couple of shifts at ashers secondhand at least until he could find a replacement okay ray ill come in for a couple of hours but i have to be at the restaurant by five so be back or im closing up early thanks lily charlie sincerely hoped that ray wasnt a serial killer despite all the indications to the contrary he would never have found this woman without rays police contacts and what would he do in the future if he needed to find someone and ray was in jail then again rays experience as a cop could account for his never leaving any evidence but why then would he continue to pursue the filipino women over the internet if he was just looking to kill people maybe thats what he did when he went to the philippines to visit his paramours maybe he killed desperate filipinas maybe ray was a tourist serial killer deal with it later charlie thought for now theres a soul vessel to retrieve charlie got out of the cab outside of the fontana an apartment building just a block up from ghirardelli square the waterfront chocolate factory turned tourist mall the fontana was a great curved concreteandglass building that commanded views of alcatraz and the golden gate bridge and that had drawn the disdain of san franciscans since it had been built in the s it wasnt that it was an ugly building although no one would argue that it wasnt but with the victorian and edwardian structures all around it it looked very much like a giant air conditioner from outer space attacking a nineteenthcentury neighborhood however the views from the apartments were exquisite there was a doorman underground parking and a pool on the roof so if you could handle the stigma of residing in an architectural pariah it was a great place to live the address ray had given him for madison was on the twentysecond floor and so presumably was her soul vessel charlie wasnt sure of the exact range of his unnoticeability he refused to think of it as invisibility because it wasnt but he hoped that it reached twentytwo floors he was going to have to get past the doorman and into an elevator and posing as an estate buyer wasnt going to work ah well nothing ventured nothing gained if he got caught hed just have to find another way in he waited by the door until a young woman in business attire went in then followed her into the lobby the doorman didnt even look at him ray saw charlie get out of the cab and told his own driver to stop a block away where he hopped out threw the driver a five and told him to keep the change then dug in his pocket for the rest of the fare while the driver pounded on the wheel impatiently and cursed under his breath in urdu sorry its been a while since i took a cab ray said ray had a car a nice little toyota but the only parking place he could find was eight blocks away from his apartment in the parking lot of a hotel managed by a friend of his and when you got a parking place in san francisco you kept it so ray mostly used public transportation and only drove the car on his days off to keep the battery charged hed jumped in a taxi outside charlies shop and shouted follow that cab thus completely terrifying the japanese family in the back sorry ray said konichiwa its been a while since i took a cab then he jumped back out and caught a cab that didnt have a fare he sneaked quickly up the street going from light post to newspaper machine to ad kiosk ducking behind each staying in his stealthcrouch and achieving nothing whatsoever except to look like a complete loon to the kid standing at the bus stop across the street he reached the underground parking entrance of the fontana just as charlie was making for the door ray crouched behind the keycard pillar he wasnt sure what he was going to do if charlie went for the building fortunately hed memorized madison mckernys phone number and he could warn her that charlie was coming in the cab on the way down here hed remembered where hed seen her name on the register at his health club madison mckerny was one of the midmorning fuck puppets from the gym and as ray suspected charlie was stalking her he watched charlie fall in behind a young woman in business dress who was heading up the walk into the fontana then charlie was gone just gone ray came out onto the sidewalk to get a better angle the woman was still there shed gone only a couple of steps but he couldnt see charlie there were no bushes no walls the whole damn lobby was glass where the hell had he gone ray was sure he hadnt looked away he didnt even think he had blinked and he would have seen any sudden move charlie might have made reverting to the beta males tendency to blame himself ray wondered if maybe hed had some kind of petit mal seizure that had made him black out for a second whether he did or not he had to warn madison mckerny he reached to his belt and felt the empty cellphone clip then remembered putting his phone under the register when hed gotten to work that morning charlie found the right apartment and rang the bell if he could get madison mckerny to come out into the hallway he could slip in behind her and look through her apartment for her soul vessel just down the hall there was a table with an artificial flower arrangement hed tipped it over hoping she was compulsive or curious enough to come out of her apartment to get a closer look if she wasnt home well hed have to break in odds were that with a doorman downstairs she didnt have an alarm system but what if she could see him sometimes they could the clients not often but it happened and she opened the door charlie was stunned she was stunning charlie stopped breathing and stared at her breasts it wasnt that she was a young and gorgeous brunette with perfect hair and perfect skin nor was it that she was wearing a thin white silk robe that just barely concealed her swimsuitmodel figure nor was it because she had disproportionately large but alert breasts that were straining against the robe and peeking out of the plunging neckline as she leaned out the door although that would have been enough to render the hapless beta breathless under any circumstances it was that her breasts were glowing red right through the silk robe glowing right out of the décolletage like twin rising suns pulsating like the lightbulb boobies of a kitschy hawaiian hula girl lamp madison mckernys soul was residing in her breast implants ive got to get my hands on those charlie said forgetting that he wasnt exactly alone and he wasnt exactly thinking to himself then madison mckerny noticed that charlie was there and the screaming started the call of booty ii requiem for a fuck puppet ray threw the door open so hard that the little bell went flying off its holder and tinkled across the floor oh jeez ray said you wont believe it i cant believe it myself lily looked at ray over her halfframe reading glasses and set down the french cookbook shed been looking at she didnt really need reading glasses but looking over the top of them conveyed instant condescension and disdain a look that she felt flattered her i have something i need to tell you too lily said no ray said looking around to make sure there were no customers in the store what i have to tell you is really important okay lily said mines not that important to me you go first okay ray took a deep breath and launched i think charlie may be a serial killer with ninja powers wow that is good lily said okay my turn a miss mesohorny called for you she wanted you to know that shes packing eight inches of luscious manmeat lily held up rays cell phone which hed left under the register oh my god not again ray cradled his head in his hands and fell against the counter she said she was eager to share it with you lily examined her nails so ashers a ninja huh ray looked up yes and hes stalking a fuck puppet from my gym think youre living a rich enough fantasy life ray shut up lily this is a disaster my job and my apartment depend on charlie not to mention that he has a kid and the new light of my life is a guy no shes not lily wondered about herself giving in so earlyshe didnt enjoy torturing ray the way she used to huh what im just fuckin with you ray she didnt call i read all of your email and ims that stuff is private which is why you have it all here on the stores computer i spend a lot of time here with the time difference and speaking of privacy whats the deal with asher being a ninja and a serial killer i mean both at the same time ray moved in close and talked into his collar as if revealing a huge conspiracy ive been watching him charlies been taking in a lot of stuff from dead people its gone on for years but hes always having to take off on a moments notice having me cover his shifts and he never explains where hes going except soon after that happens one of the dead peoples things shows up in the shop so today i followed him and he was after a woman who goes to my gym who we might have seen the other day lily stepped back crossed her arms and looked disgusted with ray which was fairly easy since shed had years of practice ray did it occur to you that asher handles estates and that weve been doing much better business since he started doing more estatesthat the quality of the merchandise is much higher probably because he gets there early i know but thats not it youre not around as much now lily i was a cop i notice these things for one thing did you know that there was a homicide detective keeping track of charlie thats right gave me his card told me to call if anything unusual happened no ray you didnt charlie disappeared lily i was watching him and he just blinked out of existence right before my eyes and last i saw him he was going into the fuck puppets building lily wanted to grab the stapler off the counter and rapidly drive about a hundred staples into rays shiny forehead you ungrateful fucktard you called the cops on asher the guy who has given you a job and a place to live for what ten years i didnt call the blackandwhites just this inspector rivera i know him from when i was on the force hell keep it on the down low go get your checkbook and your car lily barked were going to bail him out he probably hasnt even been processed yet ray said ray you pathetic tossbeast go ill close up the store and wait for you out front lily you cant talk to me that way i dont have to put up with it because he couldnt turn his head ray wasnt able to avoid the first two staples lily put in his forehead but by then he had decided it was best to go get his checkbook and his car and backed away whats a fuck puppet anyway lily shouted after him somewhat surprised at the violent intensity of her loyalty to charlie the policewoman fingerprinted charlie nine times before she looked up at inspector alphonse rivera and said this motherfucker got no fingerprints rivera took charlies hand and turned it palm up and looked at his fingers i can see the ridges right there hes got completely normal fingerprints well you do it then said the woman cause alls i got on the card is smooth fine then rivera said come with me he led charlie over to a wall that had a big ruler painted on it and told him to face a camera hows my hair charlie said dont smile charlie frowned dont make a face just look straight ahead andyour hair is fine though now youve got ink on your forehead this is not that hard mr asher criminals do this all the time im not a criminal charlie said you broke into a security building and harassed a young woman that makes you a criminal i didnt break into anything and i didnt harass anyone well see ms mckerny said you threatened her life shes definitely going to press charges and if you ask me youre both lucky i showed up when i did charlie wondered about that the fuck puppet had started screaming and backed into her apartment and he had followed her trying to explain trying to figure out how this was going to work and at the same time paying way too much attention to her breasts i didnt threaten her you said she was going to die today well they had him there charlie had in all the confusion and screaming mentioned that he had to get hold of her breasts because she was going to die today in retrospect he felt he probably should have kept that information to himself rivera led him upstairs and into a small room with a table and two chairs just like on tv charlie looked for a oneway mirror but was disappointed to see only concreteblock walls painted in easyclean mossgreen enamel rivera had him sit but then went to the door im going to leave you here for a few minutes until miss mckerny comes down to file charges its more hospitable here than the holding cell you want something to drink charlie shook his head should i call an attorney its up to you mr asher thats certainly your right but i cant advise you one way or another ill be back in five you can make your call then if youd like rivera left the room and charlie saw the inspectors partner a gruff baldheaded bull of a guy named cavuto standing outside the door waiting for him that guy actually scared charlie not as much as the prospect of having to retrieve madison mckernys breast implants or what would happen if he didnt but still scary cut him loose cavuto said what cut him loose i just got him processed the mckerny woman is dead boyfriend shot her then when our guys responded to the shotsfired call did himself what boyfriend was married mckerny wanted more security and was going to tell the wife he flipped out you know all that already her neighbor told the uniforms as soon as they arrived come on its our case we need to roll cut this guy loose ray macy and some gothchef chick are waiting for him downstairs ray macy is the one who called me he thought asher was going to kill her i know right crime wrong guy lets go we still have him on the concealedweapon charge a cane with a sword in it what you want to go before a judge and tell him that you arrested this guy on suspicion of being a serial killer but he pleabargained it down to being a huge fucking nerd okay ill cut him loose but im telling you nick this guy told mckerny that she was going to die today theres some weird shit going on here and we dont have enough weird shit to deal with already good point rivera said madison mckerny looked beautiful in her beige silk dress her hair and makeup perfect as usual her diamondstud earrings and a platinumdiamond solitaire necklace complemented the silver handles of her walnutburl casket for someone who wasnt breathing she was breathtaking especially for charlie who was the only one who could see her hooters pulsing red in the casket charlie hadnt been to a lot of funerals but madison mckernys seemed nice and fairly well attended for someone who had been only twentysix it turned out that madison had grown up in mill valley just outside san francisco so a lot of people had known her evidently except for her family most of them had lost touch and seemed somewhat surprised that she had been gunned down by her married boyfriend who had kept her in an expensive apartment in the city not like you vote most likely for that in the yearbook charlie said trying to make conversation with one of her classmates a guy hed ended up standing next to at the urinals in the mens room how did you know madison said the guy a condescending tone in his voice he looked like hed been voted most likely to piss everyone off by being rich and having nice hair oh me friend of the groom charlie said he zipped up and headed to the sink before hair guy could think of something to say charlie was surprised to see a few people at the funeral whom he knew and each time he walked away from one hed run into another first inspector rivera who lied had to come its our case ive gotten to know the family a little then ray who lied she went to my gym i just thought i should pay my respects then riveras partner cavuto who didnt lie i still think youre kinky and that goes for your excop friend too and lily who was also honest i wanted to see a dead fuck puppet whos running the store charlie asked closed death in the family you know ray called the cops on you right they hadnt had a chance to talk since charlie had been released i shouldve figured charlie said he said he saw you go into the dead chicks building and just disappear he thinks you have ninja powers that part of the thing she bounced her eyebrowsa groucho marx conspiracy bouncemade less effective by the fact that her eyebrows were pencil thin and drawn on in magenta yeah its kind of part of the thing ray doesnt suspect about the thing does he no i covered for you but he still thinks you might be a serial killer i thought he might be a serial killer lily shuddered god you guys need to get laid true but right now im here to do a thing regarding the thing you still havent gotten her thing thing i cant even figure out how to get it her thing is still in the thing he nodded to the casket youre fucked lily said we have to go sit now charlie said he led her into the chapel where the service was beginning behind him nick cavuto who had been standing three feet away with his back to charlie made a beeline for his partner and said can we just shoot asher and find cause later im sure the fuckers done something to deserve it charlie didnt know what he was going to do how he was going to retrieve the soul implants but he really thought something would occur to him some supernatural ability would manifest itself at the last minute he thought that all through the ceremony he thought that when they closed the casket during the funeral procession to the cemetery and all through the graveside ceremony he began to lose hope as the mourners dispersed and the casket was lowered and by the time the ground crew started throwing dirt down the hole with a backhoe hed pretty much given up on having an idea there was grave robbing but that really wasnt an idea was it and even with his years of experience in the deathdealing business charlie didnt think he was up for breaking into a cemetery spending all night digging up a casket then cutting the implants out of a dead womans body it wasnt the same as swiping a vase off the mantel why couldnt madison mckernys soul be in a vase on the mantel didnt get the thing then said a voice beside him charlie turned to see inspector rivera standing not a foot away he hadnt even seen him since theyd left the funeral home what thing yeah what thing rivera said they didnt bury her with those diamonds you saw you know that right that would have been a shame charlie said sisters got them rivera said you know charlie most people dont stay to watch them actually cover the box really charlie said i was just curious see if they used shovels or what how about you me im watching you you ever get over that thing with the storm sewers oh that i just needed a little adjustment in my medication it was an expression that charlie had picked up from jane she wasnt actually on medication but the excuse seemed to work for her well you keep an eye on that charlie and ill keep an eye on you adios rivera walked off adios inspector charlie said hey by the way nice suit thanks i bought it from your store rivera said without turning around when was he in my store charlie thought for the next couple of weeks charlie felt as if someone had dialed his nervous system up past the recommended voltage and he was nearly vibrating with anxiety he thought that perhaps he should call minty fresh warn him of his failure to retrieve madison mckerneys soul vessel but if the sewer harpies werent rising because of that maybe the contact with another death merchant would put them over the top instead he kept sophie home and made sure that she was never out of sight of the hellhounds in fact he kept the hellhounds locked in her room most of the time otherwise they kept dragging him to his day planner which had no new names only the overdue madison mckerny and the two womenesther johnson and irena posokovanovichwho had appeared on the same day but still had some time left before expirationor whatever you called it so he started his walks again listening as he passed storm drains and manhole covers but the darkness didnt appear to be rising charlie felt naked walking the street without his swordcane which rivera had kept so he set out to replace it and in the process found two more death merchants in the city he found the first at a usedbook store in the mission book em danno well it wasnt really a bookstore anymoreit still had a couple of tall cases of books but the rest of the store was a bricolage of bricabrac from plumbing fittings to football helmets charlie understood completely how it happened you started with a bookstore then you made a single innocent trade a set of bookends for a first edition maybe then another you picked up a graball box at a yard sale to get one itempretty soon you had a whole section of unmatched crutches and obsolete radio tubes and couldnt for the life of you remember how youd acquired a bear trap yet there it was next to the limegreen tutu and the armadrillo penis pump secondhand out of hand in the back of the store by the counter stood a bookcase in which every volume was pulsing with a dull red light charlie tripped over a spittoon and caught himself on an elkantler coatrack you okay asked the proprietor looking up from the book he was reading he was maybe sixty skin spotted from too much sun but he hadnt seen any in a while and hed gone pasty he had long thinning gray hair and wore oversized bifocals that gave him the look of an educated turtle no im fine charlie said ripping his gaze off the soulvessel books i know its a little cluttered in here the turtle guy said ive been meaning to clear it out but then ive been meaning to clear it out for thirty years and i havent managed it yet its okay i like your store charlie said great selection the owner looked at charlies expensive suit and shoes and squinted it was clear he recognized the worth of the clothes and was qualifying charlie as a rich collector or antiques hunter you looking for anything special he asked swordcane charlie said doesnt have to be antique he wanted to buy this guy a coffee and share stories of snatching soul objects of confronting the underworlders of being a death merchant this guy was a kindred spirit and from the size of his collection of soul objects all of them books hed been doing this longer than minty fresh turtle guy shook his head havent seen one for years if you want to give me a card ill put out feelers for you thanks charlie said ill keep looking thats part of the fun he started backing down the aisle but he couldnt leave without saying something else getting some kind of information hey how is it doing business in this neighborhood better now than it used to be said the guy the gangs have settled down some this part of the mission has turned into the edgy artsyfartsy neighborhood thats been good for business you from the city born and raised charlie said just havent been to this neighborhood much you havent had any weird stuff on the street last couple of weeks then the turtle guy looked fully at charlie now even took off his giant glasses except for the thumper sound systems going by quiet as a mouse whats your name charlie charlie asher i live over in the north beachchinatown area im anton charlie anton dubois nice meeting you okay charlie said i have to go now charlie theres a pawnshop off fillmore street fulton and fillmore i think the owner carries a lot of edged weapons she might have your cane thanks charlie said you watch yourself anton okay always do said anton dubois and he looked back to his book charlie left the store feeling even more anxious but not quite as alone as he had five minutes before the next day he found a new swordcane at the pawnshop in the fillmore and he also found a case of cutlery and kitchen utensils that pulsated with red light the owner was younger than anton dubois late thirties maybe and wore a revolver in a shoulder holster which shocked charlie less than the fact that she was a woman hed envisioned all the death merchants as being men but of course there was no reason to think that she wore jeans and a plain chambray shirt but was dripping with mismatched jewelry that charlie guessed was a selfindulgence she justified for being in the business the same way he justified his expensive suits she was pretty in a ladycop sort of way with a nice smile and charlie found himself wondering if he should maybe ask her out then heard an audible pop in his head as that bubble of selfdestructive stupidity exploded sure dinner and a movie and release the forces of darkness on the world great first date everyone was right he really needed to get laid he bought the swordcane for cash without quibbling and left the store without engaging the owner in conversation but he took a business card from the holder on the counter as he left her name was carrie lang it was all he could do to not warn her tell her to be careful of what might be coming from below but he realized that every second he was there he was probably increasing the danger to all of them watch yourself carrie he whispered to himself as he walked away that evening he decided to take action to ease some of the tension in his life or at least it was decided for him when jane and her girlfriend cassandra showed up at the apartment and offered to watch sophie go find a woman jane said i got the kid it doesnt work that way charlie said i was gone all day i havent spent any quality time with my daughter jane and cassandraan athletic attractive redhead in her midthirties who charlie promised himself he would have asked out if she hadnt been living with his sisterpushed him out the door slammed it in his face and locked it dont come home until youve gotten some jane shouted over the transom does that work for you charlie shouted back just go find someone to do you like a scavenger hunt heres five hundred dollars five hundred dollars works for anyone a wad of bills came flying over the transom followed by his cane a sport coat and his wallet this is my money isnt it charlie shouted its you that needs to get laid jane shouted back go dont come back until youve done the dance of the beast with two backs i could just lie no you cant cassie said she had a sweet voice like youd want her to tell you a bedtime story the desperation will still show in your eyes and i mean that in a nice way charlie sure how else could i take it bye daddy sophie said from the other side of the door have fun jane relax she just came in go so charlie thrown out of his own home by his own sister said goodbye to the daughter he adored and went out to find a total stranger with whom to be intimate just a massage charlie said okay said the girl as she arranged oils and lotions on a shelf she was asian but charlie couldnt tell from where in asia maybe thailand she was petite and had black hair that hung down past her waist she wore a red silk kimono with a chrysanthemum design she never looked him in the eye really im just tense i dont want anything but a completely ethical and hygienic massage just like it says on the sign charlie stood at the end of a narrow cubicle fully dressed with a massage table on one side of him and the masseuse and her shelf of oils on the other okay said the girl charlie just looked at her unsure of what to do next clothes off said the girl she placed a clean white towel on the massage table near charlie nodded to it then turned her back okay okay charlie said feeling now that he was here he needed to go through with it hed paid the woman at the door fifty dollars for the massage after which she made him sign a release that stated that all he was getting was a massage that tipping was encouraged but did not imply any services beyond a massage and that if he thought that he was getting anything but a massage he was going to be one disappointed white devil she made him initial each of the six languages it was printed in then she winked a long slow wink exaggerated by very long false eyelashes and performed the internationally accepted blowjob mime with round mouth and rhythmic tongue pushing out the cheek lotus flower make you bery relax mr macy charlie had signed rays name not so much as a small revenge for calling the cops on him but because he thought the management might recognize rays name and give him a discount he kept his boxers on and climbed on the table but lotus flower slipped them off him as deftly as a magician pulling a scarf from his sleeve she draped a towel over his bottom and dropped her kimono charlie saw it fall and glanced back to see a tiny seminaked woman rubbing oil on her palms to warm it he looked away and slammed his forehead into the table several times even as he felt his erection struggling for freedom beneath him my sister made me come here he said i didnt want to come okay she said she rubbed the oil into his shoulders it smelled of almonds and sandalwood there must have been menthol or lavender or something in it because he felt it tingle on his skin every place she touched hurt like hed dug a ditch to ecuador the day before or pulled a barge across the bay with a rope it was like she had special sensory powers she could find the exact spot where he carried his pain then touch it release it he moaned just a little bery tense she said working her fingers up his spine i havent slept well in two weeks he said that nice she reached across to work his rib cage and he felt her small breasts press against his back he stopped breathing for a second and she giggled bery tense she said i had this thing happen at work well not at work but im afraid i did something that could put everyone i know in danger and i cant make myself do what needs to be done to fix it people could die that nice said lotus flower kneading his biceps you dont speak english do you oh little no worries you want happy ending charlie smiled can you just keep rubbing no happy ending okay twenty dollar fifteen minute so charlie paid her and talked to her and she rubbed his back and he paid her again and he told her all the things that he couldnt share with other people all the worries all the fears all the regrets he told her of how he missed rachel yet how sometimes he would forget what she looked like and would run to the dresser in the middle of the night to look at her photo he paid her for two hours in advance and dozed off feeling her hands on his skin and he dreamed of rachel and sex and when he woke up lotus flower was massaging his temples and tears were running into his ears he told her it was the menthol in the oil but it was the lonely coming up in him like the pain in his back that he hadnt known hed had until it was touched she massaged his chest reaching over his head and letting her breasts rub against his face as she worked and when he rose again under the towel she asked you want happy ending now nah he said happy endings are so hollywood then he caught her wrists sat up kissed the back of her hands and thanked her he tipped her a hundred dollars she smiled put on her kimono and left the cubicle charlie dressed and left the happy relax good time oriental massage parlor which he had walked by a thousand times during his life always wondering what was behind the red door with brown paper taped over the window now he knew the pathetic puddle of lonely frustration that was charlie asher for whom there would be no happy ending he made his way up to broadway and headed up the hill into north beach he was only a few blocks from home when he sensed someone behind him he turned but all he saw was a guy a couple of blocks back buying a newspaper from a machine he walked another half block and could see the activity on the street up ahead tourists out walking waiting for tables in italian restaurants barkers trying to lure tourists into strip clubs sailors barhopping hipsters smoking outside of city lights bookstore looking cool and literary before the next poetry slam which would go off in a bar across the street hey soldier a voice at his side a womans voice soft and sexy charlie turned and looked down the alley he was passing he could see a woman in the shadows leaning against the wall she was wearing an iridescent body stocking or something and a mercury light at the other end of the alley was drawing a silver outline of her figure the hair rose on his neck but he felt something twinge in his loins as well this was his neighborhood and the hookers had been calling to him since he was twelve but this was the first time hed ever stopped and paid more attention than a wave and a smile hey charlie said he felt dizzydrunk or stonedmaybe all the toxins had broken loose from the long massage but he had to lean on his cane to steady himself she stepped away from the wall and the light silhouetted her highlighting outlandish curves charlie realized he was grinding his teeth and his right kneecap began to bounce this was not the streetworn body of a junkiea dancer maybe a goddess sometimes she said hissing the last s a rough fuck down a dark alley is the best medicine for a weary warrior charlie looked around the party a block ahead the guy reading his newspaper under the streetlamp two blocks back no one down the alley waiting to ambush him how much he asked he couldnt even remember what sex felt like but all he could think about right now was releasea rough fuck down a dark alley with thisthis goddess he couldnt see her face just the line of a cheekbone but that was exquisite the pleasure of your company she said why me charlie said he couldnt help himselfit was his beta nature come find out she said she cupped her breasts fell back against the wall and propped one heel up on the bricks come he walked into the alley and leaned the cane on the wall then took her uplifted knee in one hand a breast in the other and pulled her against him for a kiss she felt like she was wearing velvet her mouth was warm and tasted base gamy like venison or liver he didnt even feel her undo his jeans just a strong hand on his erection ah strong meat she hissed thanks ive been going to the gym she bit his neck hard and he squeezed her breast and thrust against her hand she threw her uplifted leg around his back and pulled him hard against her he felt something sharp painful digging into his scrotum and he tried to pull away she pulled him tighter with her leg she was incredibly strong new meat she said dont fight me or ill tear them off charlie felt the claw on his balls and the breath caught in his throat her face was an inch from his now and he looked for her eyes but could see only an obsidian blackness reflecting the highlights from the streetlight she held her free hand in front of his face and he watched as claws began to grow out of her fingertips reflecting the streetlight like brushed chrome until they were three inches long she poised them over his eyes and he reached for his swordcane against the wall she knocked it away and the claws were at his face again oh no meat not this time she hooked a claw into his nostril shall i drive it into your brain that would be quickest but i dont want quick ive waited so long for this she released the pressure on his balls and to his horror he realized that he was still hard she started rubbing his erection pushing the claw deeper into his nose to hold him steady i know i knowwhen you come ill put it in your ear and yank ive taken off a half a mans head that way youll like it youre lucky if nemain had been sent youd be dead already bitch charlie managed to say she was stroking him harder and he was cursing his body for betraying him this way he tried to pull away and her leg wrapped behind him crushed the breath out of him no you come then ill kill you she pulled the claw from his nose and put it next to his ear dont make me leave unsatisfied meat she said but in that instant her claw caught the side of his scalp and he hit her as hard as he could in the ribs with both of his fists you fuckface she shrieked she let her leg fall yanked him aside by his penis and reared back for a full slash of her claws to his head charlie tried to raise his forearm to take the blow but then there was an explosion and a piece of her shoulder splattered on the wall spinning her around charlie felt her release his penis and he threw himself across the alley she rebounded off the wall with both claws aimed at his face there was another explosion and she was knocked back again this time she came up facing the street and before she could brace to leap two more shots hit her in the chest and she screeched the sound like a thousand angry ravens set afire five more quick shots and she was danced backward by the impacts even as she went she was changing her arms getting wider her shoulders smoothing two more shots and the next screech wasnt even remotely human but that of a huge raven she rose into the night sky trailing feathers and spattering a liquid that might have been blood except that it was black charlie climbed to his feet and staggered out of the alley to where inspector alphonse rivera was still in shooting stance holding a mm beretta aimed at the dark sky do i even want to know what the fuck that was rivera said probably not charlie said tie your coat around your waist said the cop charlie looked down and saw that the front of his jeans had been shredded as if by razors thanks charlie said you know rivera said this could have all been avoided if youd just taken the happy ending like everybody else was it good for you the next morning janes girlfriend cassie heard someone in the hall and opened the door charlie stood there covered in blood black goo and smelling of sandalwood and almond oil he had a cut over his ear blood crusted in his nose the front of his pants were in shreds and there were tiny black feathers stuck to him everywhere why charlie she said somewhat surprised it appears that i underestimated you when you decide to get your freak on you do not mess around shower charlie said daddy sophie called from her bedroom she came running out with arms thrown wide followed by two giant dogs and a lesbian aunt in brooks brothers halfway across the living room she saw her father turned and went squealing out of the room in terror jane pulled up by the couch and stared jesus chuck whatd you do try to fuck a leopard something like that charlie said he stumbled by her and went through his bedroom to the master bath jane looked at cassandra who was trying to keep her smile from breaking into laughter you wanted him to get out more you tell him about mom jane said thought that news should come from you said cassandra well guns suck i can tell you that said babd the most recent of the three death divas to make an appearance above sure they look great from down here but up closenoisy impersonalgive me a battleax or a cudgel any day i like to cudgel said macha who had her claws up inside madison mckernys severed head and was working the mouth like a hand puppet its your own fault scolded nemain she had one of madison mckernys silicone implantsbits of fuckpuppet gore still clinging to itand was pressing it to babds wounds to heal them even as the black flesh regenerated the red glow in the implant dimmed were wasting the power in these and after waiting years to get another soul babd sighed i suppose in retrospect the hand job wasnt such a great idea i suppose the hand job wasnt such a great idea mocked machas hand puppet i did that on the battlefields of the north what ten thousand times said babd a final wank for the dying warriorjust seemed like the least i could do im especially good at it you know it takes a powerful touch to keep a soldier hard when his guts are running between his fingers she is good at it said orcus ill vouch for that he leaned back on his throne to display three feet of black bull deathwood to show his enthusiasm not now i just did my lipstick puppeted macha with the head making its eyes bug out with her claws so it appeared that the dead girl was impressed by orcuss prodigious unit they all snickered shed had orcus and her morrigan sisters giggling all morning with her puppet show putting the implants on a shelf and working the head above them of course theyre real he really paid for them didnt he theyd been giddy since pulling the soul vessels out of the fuck puppets grave that victory even overshadowing babds failure to kill the death merchant but as the light ebbed out of the implants their mood darkened nemain threw the useless implant against the bulkhead of the ship and it exploded and spattered the room with clear goo what a waste she growled we will take the above and i will eat his liver while he watches what is it with you and eating livers babd said i hate liver patience princesses said orcus as he weighed the remaining implant in his talon we were a thousand years coming to this place for this battle a few more to gather our force will but make the victory sweeter he snatched the head away from macha and took a bite out of it as if it were a crisp ripe plum you really could have passed on the hand job though he said spraying bits of brain at babd ive got us on a flight to phoenix at two jane said we connect there to a commuter and were in sedona by suppertime charlie had just come out of the shower and wore only a pair of fresh jeans he was drying his hair with a beige towel leaving red streaks on it from his stillbleeding scalp he sat down on the bed wait wait wait how long has she known they diagnosed her six months ago it had already spread from her colon to her other organs and she waited until now to tell us she didnt tell us a guy named buddy called evidently theyve been living together he said she didnt want us to worry he broke down on the phone moms living with a guy charlie was staring at the red stripes on the towel hed been up all night trying to explain to inspector rivera what had happened in the alley without actually telling him anything he was bleeding battered exhausted and his mother was dying i cant believe her she flipped when rachel moved in before we were married yeah well you can yell at her for being a hypocrite when you see her tonight i cant go jane i have the store and sophieshes too little for something like this i called ray and lily theyve got the shop covered cassandra will watch sophie overnight and the communistbloc ladies can watch her until cassie gets home from work cassies not coming with you charlie mom still refers to me as her tomboy oh yeah sorry charlie sighed he was nostalgic for the days when jane was the freak in the family and he was the normal one you going to try to reconcile that with her i dont know i dont really have a plan i dont even know if shes lucid ive been on autopilot since i heard i was waiting for you to get home so i could fall apart charlie stood up went to his sister and put his arms around her you did great im back i got it from here what do you need she hugged him back then pushed back with tears in her eyes i need to go home and pack ill come by at noon with a cab to get you okay ill be ready he shook his head i cant believe mom is living with a guy a guy named buddy jane said the slut charlie said jane laughed which is all that charlie wanted right then lois asher was sleeping when charlie and jane arrived at her home in sedona a potbellied sunburned man wearing bermuda shorts and a safari shirt let them in buddy he sat at the kitchen table with charlie and jane and professed his love for their mother told them about his own life as an aircraft mechanic in illinois before he retired then recited a playbyplay of what they had done since lois had been diagnosed shed gone through three courses of chemotherapy then sick and hairless she had given in charlie and jane looked at each other feeling guilty that they hadnt been there to help she didnt want to bother you two buddy said shes been acting like dying was something she could do in her spare time between hair appointments charlie snapped to attention that was the kind of thing hed thought to himself several times when he was retrieving a soul vessel and had seen people who were so far in denial about what was happening to them that they were still buying fiveyear calendars women what are you gonna do with em buddy said winking at jane charlie suddenly felt a great wave of affection for this sunburned little bald guy who his mother was shacked up with we want to thank you for being here for her buddy yeah jane nodded still looking a little dazed well im here for the whole shebang and then some if you need me thanks charlie said we will and they would because it was immediately evident to charlie that buddy was going to hang on himself only as long as he felt he was needed buddy said a soft female voice from behind charlie he turned to see a big thirtyish woman in scrubs another hospice workeranother of the amazing women that charlie had seen in the homes of the dying helping to deliver them into the next world with as much comfort and dignity and even joy as they could gatherbenevolent valkyries midwives of the final light they wereand as charlie watched them at work he saw that rather than become detached from or callous to their job they became involved with every patient and every family they were present hed seen them grieve with a hundred different families taking part in an intensity of emotion that most people would feel only a few times in their lives watching them over the years had made charlie feel more reverent toward his task of being a death merchant it might be a curse on him but ultimately it wasnt about him it was about serving and the transcendence in serving and the hospice workers had taught him that the womans name tag read grace charlie smiled buddy she said shes awake and shes asking for you charlie stood grace im charlie loiss son this is my sister jane oh she talks about you two all the time she does said jane a tad surprised oh yes she tells me you were quite the tomboy grace said and you she said to charlie you used to be nice but then something happened i learned to talk charlie said thats when i stopped liking him jane said lois asher was propped in a nest of pillows wearing a perfectly coiffed gray wig tied back in the style she had always worn her real hair a silver squashblossom necklace and matching earrings and rings a mauve silk nightgown that blended so well with the southwestern decor of the bedroom that it looked as if lois might be trying to disappear into her surroundings and she did except the space shed made for herself in the world was a little bigger than she now required there was a gap between the wig and her scalp her nightgown hung almost empty and her rings jangled on her fingers like bangles it was clear to charlie that she hadnt actually been sleeping when theyd arrived but had sent buddy out with the excuse to give grace time to dress and arrange her for presentation to her children charlie noticed that the squashblossom necklace was glowing dull red against loiss nightgown and he felt a long sad sigh rise in his chest he hugged his mother and could feel the bones in her back and shoulders as delicate and fragile as a birds jane tried to fight down a sob as soon as she saw her mother but managed only to produce what sounded like a painful snort she fell to her knees at her mothers bedside charlie knew it was perhaps the stupidest question one could ask the dying yet he asked how are you doing mom she patted his hand i could use an oldfashioned buddy wont let me have any alcohol since i cant keep it down you met buddy he seems like a nice man jane said oh he is hes been good to me were just friends you know charlie looked across the bed at jane who raised her eyebrows its okay we know you guys are living together charlie said living together me what do you take me for never mind mom his mother waved off the thought as if she was shooing a fly and how is that little jewish girl of yours charlie sophie shes doing great mom no thats not it whats not it it wasnt sophie it was something else pretty girltoo good for you really youre thinking of rachel mom she passed on five years ago remember well you cant blame her can you you were such a sweet little boy then i dont know what happened to you do you remember yeah mom i was sweet lois looked at her daughter and what about you jane have you found yourself a nice man i hate the idea of you being alone still looking for mr right jane said giving charlie the weve got to get away and have an emergency meeting head toss that she had practiced around their mother since she was eight mom jane and i will be right back we can call sophie and talk to her then okay whos sophie lois asked shes your granddaughter mom you remember beautiful little sophie dont be silly charles im not old enough to be a grandmother outside the bedroom jane fumbled around and in her purse and produced a pack of cigarettes but couldnt figure out whether to smoke one or not holy motown jesus with pips what the fuck is going on in there shes got a lot of morphine in her jane did you smell that acrid smell thats her sweat glands trying to take the poisons out of her body that her kidneys and liver would normally filter her organs are starting to shut down it means that theres a lot of toxins going to her brain how do you know that ive read about it look she never lived in reality completely you know that she hated the shop and hated dads work even though it supported her she hated his collecting even though she was just as bad and the thing with buddy not living hereshes trying to reconcile who shes always thought she was with who she really is is that why i still want to punch her lights out jane said thats wrong isnt it well i suppose im a horrible person my mother is dying of cancer and i want to punch her lights out charlie put his arm around his sisters shoulder and started walking her toward the front door so she could go outside and smoke dont be so hard on yourself he said youre doing the same thing trying to reconcile all the moms that mom ever wasthe one you wanted the one she was when you needed her and she was there the one she was when she didnt understand most of us dont live our lives with one integrated self that meets the world were a whole bunch of selves when someone dies they all integrate into the soulthe essence of who we are beyond the different faces we wear throughout our lives youre just hating the selves youve always hated and loving the ones youve always loved its bound to mess you up jane stopped and stepped back from him then how come its not messing you up i dont know maybe because of what i went through with rachel so you think that when someone dies suddenly like that that this facereconciliation thing happens i dont know i dont think its a conscious process maybe more for you than for mom you know what i mean you feel like you have to put things right before shes gone and its frustrating so what happens if she doesnt integrate all that before she dies what happens if i dont i think you get another chance really like reincarnation what about jesus and stuff i think that theres a lot of stuff thats not in the book in any of the books wheres this coming from i never got the impression you were spiritual you wouldnt even go to yoga with me i wouldnt go to yoga with you because im not bendy not because im not spiritual theyd gotten to the door and when charlie pulled it open it made the same sound a refrigerator door makes when they stepped out onto the front porch he realized why as a wave of hundredandtendegree heat hit them jeez did you accidentally open the door to hell jane said i dont need to smoke this badly get inside get inside get inside she shoved him inside and closed the door thats heinous why would someone live in this climate im confused charlie said did you start smoking again or not i didnt really jane said i just have one when im really stressed out its like thumbing your nose at death havent you ever felt like doing that you have no idea charlie said with charlie and jane there they sent the hospice nurse home at night and watched lois in fourhour shifts charlie gave his mother her medication wiped her mouth fed her what little she would take in but by now she was mostly having sips of water or apple juice and he listened as she lamented losing her looks and her things as she remembered being a great beauty the belle of the ball at parties before he was born an object of desire which clearly she loved more than being a wife or a mother or any of the dozen other faces she had worn in her life sometimes she would actually turn her attention to her son i loved you as a little boy i would take you to cafés in north beach and everyone would just dote on you you were so sweet beautiful both of us were i know remember when we dumped all of the cereal out of the boxes so you could get the prize out a little submarine i think do you remember i remember mom we were close then yeah we were charlie would take her hand then and let her remember great times that they had never really had the time had long passed for correcting facts and changing impressions when she exhausted herself he let her sleep and read by a flashlight sitting in the chair at her bedside he was there in the middle of the night reading a crime novel when the door opened and a slight man of about fifty crept into the room stopped by the door and looked around he wore sneakers and black jeans a longsleeved black tshirtbut for the oversized wireframe glasses he was just short a hand grenade and a survival knife from looking like someone on a commando mission just be quiet charlie said softly shes sleeping the little man jumped straight up about two feet and came down in a crouch he was breathing hard and charlie was afraid he might faint if he didnt relax its okay its in the top drawer of that dresser over thereits a squashblossom necklace take it the little man ducked behind the door then peeked around the edge you can see me yes charlie put his book down and got up from the chair and went to the dresser oh this is bad this is really really bad its not that bad charlie said the little man shook his head violently no its really bad look away look over there im not here im not here you cant see me here it is charlie said he took the squashblossom necklace from its velvet case in the drawer and held it up what is what youre looking for how did you know because i do what you do im a death merchant a what then charlie remembered that minty fresh said he had coined the term so maybe only the death merchants in san francisco knew it i collect soul vessels no you dont you cant see me you cant see me sleep sleep the little man was waving his hands up and down in the air like he was drawing a curtain of deception before him or possibly clearing spiderwebs out of the room these are not the droids you seek charlie said grinning what you dont have jedi powers you git just take the necklace i dont understand come with me charlie said its time for my sister to watch her anyway he led the little guy out of his mothers room into the living room they stood by the front window looking at the sun coming up and casting shadows of the broken teeth of the red rock mountains around them whats your name vern vern glover im charlie nice to meet you how long does she have vern what do you mean how long on your calendar how many days were left how do you know about that i told you i do what you do i can see you i can see that necklace glowing red i know what you are but you cant the great big book says that horrible forces of darkness will rise if i talk to you see this cut over my ear vern vern nodded forces of darkness fuck em fuck the forces of darkness vern how long does my mother have its your mother im sorry charlie she has two more days okay charlie said nodding then wed better go get a doughnut pardon doughnut doughnut you like doughnuts dont you yes but why because the continuance of human existence as we know it depends on us having doughnuts together really verns eyes went wide no not really im just fucking with you charlie put his arm around verns shoulder but lets go get one anyway ill wake my sister for her watch charlie called home from his mobile phone to check on sophie then satisfied she was safe he returned to the booth at dunkin donuts where vern and a cruller were waiting for him vern had taken off his stocking cap and had a wild mop of silver gray hair over large aviatorframe glasses that made him look like a tan and wiry mad scientist so like she was really hot vern you wouldnt believe im telling you body of a goddess covered with really fine feathers soft as down charlie innately recognized another beta male like he recognized another death merchant so he nearly stumbled over himself to tell the story of his adventure with the sexy sewer harpy knowing he had a sympathetic audience but she was going to put her claw through your brain right yeah she said she was but you know something i think there was some chemistry there you dont think it was just that she had your crank in her hand at the time because that can cloud a guys judgment yeah theres that but still you have to think of all the death merchants in all of the cities on the planet she chose me to share the death wank i think she had a thing for me well youre in the city of two bridges said vern brushing a little maple glaze from the corner of his mouth thats where its supposed to happen where whats supposed to happen charlie had really enjoyed being the senior death merchant acting as the elder statesman to vern who had been called to recruit souls only six months ago now he was thrown in the great big book of death it says that we cant talk about what we do or try to find each other or the forces of darkness will rise up in the city of two bridges and there will be a horrible battle and the underworld will rise and cover the land if we lose you guys have two bridges in san francisco right charlie tried to hide his surprise vern had obviously gotten a different version of the great big book than they got in san francisco well two main ones yes sorry its been a long time since i read the book remind me why the city of two bridges is so important vern gave charlie the big duh look because that is where the new luminatus the great death will take power oh yeah of course the luminatus charlie thumped himself in the side of the head he had no idea what vern was talking about you think that they wont need us anymore after the great death takes power vern asked i mean will there be layoffs because the big book makes it sound like the luminatus rising is a good thing but ive been making a ton of money since i got this gig yeah thats going to be our problem layoffs charlie thought i think well be fine like the book says its a dirty job but someone has to do it right right right so this cop that shot the sexygoddess babe he didnt do anything no not nothing first he put me in the back of his cop car and tried to get me to tell him what had been going on when he showed up and what had been going on for these last few years hes been checking on me and what did you tell him i told him that it was as much a mystery to me as it was to him and he believed that no he didnt but he did believe it when i told him that if i told him more it would get worse so we came up with a story that justified his firing his weapon a guy with a gun taking a shot at me then at himdescriptions everything then when he was sure we had it straight he took me to the station and i wrote out my statement thats it he let you go no then he told me stories about his career and the weird stuff hes encountered and why because of that he was going to let me go the guy is a complete nut job he believes in vampires and demons and giant owlshe said that he once handled a call for a polarbear attack in santa barbara wow said vern you lucked out i called him before we left the city hes going to check on my building until i get home make sure my daughter is okay charlie hadnt told vern about the hellhounds you must be worried sick about her vern said i have a kid shes a junior in high school lives with my exwife in phoenix yeah so you know charlie said so vern youve never seen any of these dark creatures never heard voices coming out of the storm drains nothing like that nope not like youre talking about we dont have storm drains in sedona we have a desert with rivers through it right but have you ever missed getting a soul vessel yeah at first when i got the great big book i thought it was a joke i skipped three or four of them and nothing happened well i wouldnt say that id wake up early and look up at the mountain above my house and thered be a shadow there looked like a big oil slick so so it would be on the wrong side of the mountain it would be on the same side as the sun and during the course of the day it moved down the mountain oh if you didnt look at it watch it youd look right by it but it was coming down into the city hour by hour i drove out to where i saw it going and waited for it and you could hear crows calling i waited until it got a half a block from me moving so slow you could barely see it but it got louder and louder like a huge flock of crows scared the bejesus out of me i went home looked up the name id written down during the night and they lived in the neighborhood id been in the shadow was coming out of the mountain for the soul vessel did it get it i guess i didnt and nothing happened oh yeah something happened the next time the shadow moved faster like a cloud blowing over and i followed it and sure enough it was heading right for a womans house whose name was on my calendar thats when i realized that the great big book wasnt bullshitting but the shadow thing it never came for you third time vern said there was a third time oh yeah like you didnt think this was all a load of crap when it first started happening to you okay good point charlie said sorry go on so the third time the shadow comes down off a mountain on the other side of town at night during a full moon and this time you can see the crows flying in it not like really see them but like shadows of them some people noticed it that time i got in my car again took my dog scottie with me i already knew where the thing was going i pulled up a couple of doors down from the guys houseto warn him you know i didnt realize yet what the book was saying about us not being seen otherwise i would have just gone for the soul vessel anyway im at the door and the shadow is coming across the street all the edges shaped like crows and scottie starts barking like mad and runs at it brave little guy anyway as soon as the shadow touches him he yelps and drops over dead meantime a woman comes to the door and i look in and see a statue like a fake remington bronze on the table in the foyer behind her and its glowing red like redhot and i blow by her and grab it and the shadow evaporates just like that its gone thats the last time i was late getting a soul vessel sorry about your dog charlie said what did you tell the woman thats the funny thing i didnt tell her anything she was talking to her husband in the next room and he wasnt answering her and she runs back to see what happened to him didnt even look at me turns out the guy was having a heart attack i took the statue went and picked up scotties body and left that had to be tough i thought i was death for a while you know special because the guy croaked with me there but it was just coincidence yeah that happened to me too charlie said but he was still disturbed by the whole great battle revelation vern would you mind if i took a look at your great big book i dont think so charlie in fact i think wed better say goodbye i mean if the great big book is right and i dont have any reason to believe its not then we shouldnt even be talking but its a different version than i have you dont think theres a reason for that vern said his eyes magnified in his big glasses made him look like a madman for a second okay then charlie said but email me okay that shouldnt hurt vern looked in his coffee cup like he was thinking as if by telling the story of the shadow that came down out of the mountains hed frightened himself finally he looked up and smiled you know id like that i could use some pointers and if something weird starts to happen well stop deal charlie said he drove vern back to his car which was parked around the block from his mothers house and they said goodbye jane met charlie at the door where have you been i need the car to go get her floss i brought doughnuts charlie said holding up the box maybe a little too proud well thats not the same is it as floss dental floss can you believe it charlie if im still flossing on my deathbed you have my permission to garrote me with it no im leaving you instructions to garrote me with it okay charlie said so other than that shes okay jane was digging in her purse had found her cigarettes and was looking for her lighter like gum disease is the big danger at this point goddammit did they take my lighter at the airport you still dont smoke jane charlie said she looked up so whats your point nothing he handed her the keys to the rental car can you grab me some toothpaste while youre out she gave up searching for the lighter and threw the cigarettes back into her purse what is it with this family and the compulsive dental hygiene i forgot to bring any okay jane braced the keys in her hand ready to go in the ignition and tucked her purse under her arm like a football she dropped into a crouch and pulled down her mirrored wraparound sunglasses that with her short platinum blond hair and charlies black pinstripe suit made her look a little like a cyborg assassin from the future getting ready to dash out into the poisonous atmosphere of planet duran duran its fucking hot out there isnt it charlie nodded and held up the doughnut box again the glazed have suffered oh jane said lifting her glasses again cassandra called after you called this morning she noticed your date book on the nightstand well actually she said that alvin and mohammed dragged her in there and pushed it at her she wondered if you needed it what about sophie is she okay no shes been abducted by aliens but i wanted you to digest the bad news about forgetting your date book first you know that right there is why mom is ashamed of you charlie said jane laughed guess what shes not shes not no this morning she told me that she always knew who i was always knew what i was and that she has always loved me just the way i am did you card her theres an impostor in our moms bed shut up it was nice important she was probably just saying that because shes dying she did say that she wished i wouldnt wear mens suits all the time shes not alone on that one charlie said jane fell back into assault mode im off on the floss mission call cassandra done charlie said and buddy needs a doughnut jane threw open the door and ran out into the heat screaming like a berserker charging the enemy charlie closed the door behind her so as not to let the airconditioning out and watched through the glass as his sister ran across the zeroscaped yard like she was on fire he looked beyond her to the red rock mesa rising out of the desert there seemed to be a deep crevasse in it that he hadnt seen there before he looked again and saw that it wasnt a crevasse at all just a long sharp shadow then he ran out into the driveway and looked at the position of the sun then at the shadow it was on the wrong side of the mesa there couldnt be a shadow on this sidethe sun was also on this side he shaded his eyes and watched the shadow until he thought his brains were cooking in the sun it was moving slowly but moving and not the way a shadow moves it was moving with purpose against the sun toward his mothers house my date book he said to himself oh shit yo momma so dead that on her last day lois asher rallied after not having even been able to get up to go to the breakfast table or into the living room to sit and watch tv for three weeks got up and danced with buddy to an old ink spots song she was playful and full of laughter she teased her children and hugged them she ate a chocolatemarshmallow sundae and she brushed and flossed afterward she put on her favorite silver jewelry and wore it to the dinner table and when she couldnt find her squashblossom necklace she shrugged it off like it was a minor thingshe must have misplaced it oh well charlie knew what was happening because he had seen it before and buddy and jane knew because grace the hospice nurse explained it to them it happens again and again ive seen people come out of a coma and sing their favorite songs and all i can tell you is to enjoy it people see the light come back into eyes that have been dull for months and they start to place hope on it its not a sign of getting well its an opportunity to say goodbye its a gift charlie had also learned by observing that it really helped everyone to let go if they were at least mildly medicated so he and jane took some antianxiety pills that janes therapist had prescribed and buddy washed down a timereleased morphine pill with some scotch medication and forgiveness can make for joyous moments with the dyingits like they get to return to childhoodand because nothing in the future matters because you dont have to train them for life teach lessons forge applicable and practical memories all the joy can be wicked from those last moments and stored in the heart it was the best and closest time charlie had ever had with his mother and his sister and buddy in the sharing became family as well lois asher went to bed at nine and died at midnight i cant stay for the funeral charlie said to his sister the next morning what do you mean you cant stay for the funeral charlie looked out the window at the giant ice pick of a shadow that had made its way down the mountain toward his mothers house charlie could see it churning at the edges like flocks of birds or swarming insects the point was less than a half mile away i have something i have to do at home jane i mean i forgot to do it and i really really cant stay dont be mysterious what the hell do you need to do that you cant attend your own mothers funeral charlie was pressing his beta male imagination to the breaking point to come up with something credible on the spot then a light went on the other night when you sent me out to get laid yeah well it was an adventure to be sure but when i went to get my scalp sewed up i also had a test i talked to the doctor today and i have to go get treatment right now you moron i didnt send you out to have unsafe sex what were you thinking it was safe sex right sure he thought he almost scoffed at himself its the wounds theyre worried about but if i get on these drugs right away theres a good chance that ill be okay theyre putting you on the cocktail as a preventative sure thats it the cocktail charlie thought he nodded gravely okay then go jane turned and hid her face maybe i can get back in time for the funeral charlie said could he he had to retrieve two overdue soul vessels in less than a week and hope that no new names had appeared in his date book well do it a week from today jane said turning back around tears blinked away you go home get treated come back buddy and i will handle the arrangements im sorry charlie said he put his arms around his sister dont you die on me too you fucker jane said ill be fine ill be back as soon as i can bring back that charcoal armani of yours for me to wear to the funeral and cassies strappy black pumps okay you in strappy black pumps its what mom would have wanted jane said when charlie landed in san francisco there were four frantic messages on his cell phone from cassandra she had always seemed so calm composeda stable counterpoint to his sisters flights of fancy she sounded a wreck on the phone charlie shes got him trapped and theyre going to eat him and i dont know what to do i dont want to call the cops call me when you land charlie did call all the way into the city in the shuttle van he called but kept getting transferred to voice messaging when he got out of the van in front of his store he heard a hiss coming out of the storm drain at the corner i missed finishing with you lover came the voice no time charlie said hopping over the curb and running into the store you never called purred the morrigan ray was behind the counter mousing through asian cuties when charlie came storming through youd better get upstairs ray said theyre freaking out up there no kidding charlie said as he passed he took the stairs two at a time he was fumbling his key into the lock when cassandra threw the door open and pulled him into his apartment she wont let him go im afraid theyre going to eat him who what thats what you said on my voice mail where is sophie cassandra dragged him to sophies room where he was met in the doorway by a growling mohammed daddy sophie shrieked she ran across the room and leapt into his arms she gave him a big hug and a sloppy kiss that left a chocolate sophieprint on his cheek down she said down down charlie put her down and she ran back into her room but mohammed prevented charlie from entering pushed his nose into charlies shirt leaving a giant dognose print in chocolate evidently there had been a chocolate orgy going on in his absence his mother is supposed to pick him up at one cassandra said i dont know what to do charlie strained to see around the hellhound and saw sophie standing with her hand on alvins collar while he menaced a little boy who was crouched in the corner the little boy was a little wideeyed but otherwise unhurt and he didnt seem that frightened in fact he was hugging a box of crunchy cheese newts and was eating one then feeding the next one to alvin who was dripping hellish dog drool onto the kids shoes in anticipation of the next newt i love him sophie said she went to the little boy and kissed him on the cheek leaving a chocolate smear not the first it appeared that this little guy had been suffering sophies affections for quite some time for he was covered with chocolaty goodness and orange cheesenewt dust i want to keep him the little boy grinned he came over for a playdate i guess you scheduled it before you left cassandra said i thought it would be okay i tried to get him out of there but the dogs wont let me by what are we going to tell his mother i want to keep him sophie said big kiss his name is matthew cassie said i know his name he goes to sophies school charlie started into the room mohammed blocked the doorway matty are you all right charlie said uhhuh said the chocolate cheese and dogdroolsodden kid i want him to stay dad sophie said alvin and mohammed want him to stay too charlie thought that perhaps he had not been strict enough in setting limits for his daughter maybe after losing her mother he just hadnt had the heart to say no to her and now she was taking hostages honey matty has to get cleaned up his mommy is coming to get him so he can go be traumatized in his own house no hes mine honey tell mohammed to let me in if we dont get matty cleaned up he wont be able to come back he can sleep in your room sophie said ill take care of him no young lady you tell mohammed to get i have to pee matthew said he climbed to his feet and skipped by alvin who followed him then under mohammed and past charlie and cassandra to the bathroom hi he said as he went by he closed the door and they could hear the sound of tinkle alvin and mohammed bullied their way through the doorway and waited outside the bathroom sophie sat down hard her feet splayed out her lower lip pushed out like the cowcatcher on a steam engine her shoulders started heaving before he could hear the soblike she was saving up breaththen the wailing and the tears charlie went to her and picked her up iiii hehehehe its okay honey its okay but i love him i know you do honey itll be okay hell go to his house and you can still love him noooooooooooooooooooooo she buried her face in his jacket and as much as his heart was breaking for his daughter he was also thinking about how much three fingered wu was going to ding him for getting the chocolate stain out of his jacket they just let him go pee cassandra said staring at the hellhounds just like that i thought they were going to eat him they wouldnt let me near him its okay charlie said you didnt know know what they love the crunchy cheese newts youre kidding sorry look cassie can you clean up sophie and matty and take care of this i have some stuff in my date book i have to take care of right away sure but sophie will be fine wont you honey sophie nodded sadly and wiped her eyes on his coat i missed you daddy i missed you too sweetie ill be home tonight he kissed her got his date book from the bedroom and ran around the apartment collecting his keys cane hat and man purse thanks cassie you have no idea how grateful i am sorry about your mother charlie cassandra said as he passed yeah thanks charlie said quickly checking the edge of the sword in his cane as he went by charlie your life is out of control cassandra said now slipping back into the unflappable persona that they were all used to okay ill need to borrow your strappy black pumps too charlie said as he headed out the door i think ive made my point cassie called after him ray stopped charlie at the bottom of the stairs you got a minute boss not really ray im in a hurry well i just wanted to apologize for what well it seems silly now but i kind of suspected you of being a serial killer charlie nodded as if he were considering the grave consequences of rays confession when in fact he was trying to remember if there was any gas in the van well ray i accept your apology and im sorry i ever gave you that impression i think all those years on the force made me suspicious but inspector rivera stopped by and set me straight he did did he what exactly did he say he said that you had been checking some stuff out for him getting into places he couldnt get without a warrant and so forth stuff that youd both get in a lot of trouble for if anyone found out but was helping to put the bad guys away he said thats why youre so secretive yes charlie said solemnly i have been fighting crime in my spare time ray im sorry i couldnt tell you i understand ray said backing away from the stairway again im sorry i feel like a traitor its okay ray but i really have to go you know fighting the forces of darkness and all charlie held his cane out as if it were a sword and he was charging into action which bizarrely it was and he was charlie had six days to retrieve three soul vessels if he was going to get caught up before he returned to arizona for his mothers funeral two the names that had appeared in his date book the same day as madison mckerny were seriously overdue the last had appeared in the book only a couple of days ago when he was in arizonayet it was in his own handwriting hed always thought that he had been doing some kind of sleep writing but now this was a whole new twist he promised himself he would freak out about it as soon as he had some time meanwhile with the neardeath hand job and the deadmom thing he hadnt even done the preliminary research on the first of the two esther johnson and irena posokovanovich and both were now past their pickup dateone by three days what if the sewer harpies had already gotten there as strong as theyd become already he didnt even want to think about what they could do if they got hold of another soul he considered calling rivera to watch his back when he went to the house but what would he say he was doing the sharpfaced cop knew there was something supernatural going on and hed taken charlies word that he was one of the good guys not a hard sell when hed seen the sewer harpy driving a threeinch claw up his nostril only to survive nine rounds of mm in the torso and still fly away charlie was driving with no destination heading into pacific heights just because the traffic was lighter in that direction he pulled over to the curb and called information i need a number and address for an esther johnson theres no esther johnson sir but i have three e johnsons can you give me the addresses she gave him the two who had addresses a recording offered to dial the number for him for an additional charge of fifty cents yeah how much to drive me there charlie asked the computer voice then he hung up and dialed the e johnson with no address hi could i speak with esther johnson charlie said cheerfully theres no esther johnson here said a mans voice im afraid you have the wrong number wait was there an esther johnson there until maybe three days ago charlie asked i saw the e johnson in the phone book thats me said the man im ed johnson sorry to bother you mr johnson charlie disconnected and dialed the next e johnson hello a womans voice hi could i speak to esther johnson please a deep breath who is calling charlie used a ruse that had worked a dozen times before this is charlie asher of ashers secondhand weve taken in some merchandise that has esther johnsons name on it and we wanted to make sure its not stolen well mr asher im sorry to tell you that my aunt passed away three days ago bingo charlie said pardon sorry charlie said my associate is playing a scratchoff lotto ticket here in the shop and hes just won ten thousand dollars mr asher this isnt really a good time is this merchandise you have valuable no just some old clothes another time then the woman sounded not so much bereaved as harried if you dont mind no im sorry for your loss charlie said he disconnected checked the address and headed up toward golden gate park and the haight the haight mecca for the free love movement of the sixties where the beat generation begat the flower children where kids from all over the country had come to tune in turn on and drop outand had kept coming even as the neighborhood went through alternating waves of renewal and decline now as charlie drove down haight street amid the head shops vegetarian restaurants hippie boutiques music stores and coffeehouses he saw hippies that ranged in age from fifteen to seventy grizzled oldsters panhandling or passing out pamphlets and young whiterastafarian dreadlocked teenagers in flowing skirts or hemp drawstring trousers with shining piercings and vacant potblissed stares he passed browntoothed crackheads barking at cars as they passed a spiky holdover here and there from the punk movement old guys in berets and wayfarers who might have stepped out of a jazz club in it wasnt so much like the hands of time had stood still here more like theyd been thrown in the air in exasperation the clock declaring whatever im outta here esther johnsons house was just a couple of blocks off haight and charlie was lucky enough to find parking in a twentyminute green zone nearby if the time came that he ever got to talk to someone in charge he was going to make a case for special parking privileges for death merchants for while it was nice that no one could see him when he was retrieving a soul vessel some cool death plates or black parking zones would be even better the house was a small bungalow unusual for this neighborhood where most everything was three stories tall and painted in whatever color would contrast most with the house next to it charlie had taught sophie her colors here using grand victorians as color swatches orange daddy orange yes honey the man barfed up orange look at that house sophie its purple the block did have its share of transients so he knew the doors of the johnson house would be locked ring the bell and try to sneak through or wait he really couldnt afford to waitthe sewer harpies had hissed at him from a grate as he approached the house he rang the bell then quickstepped to the side a pretty darkhaired woman of about thirty wearing jeans and a peasant blouse opened the door looked around and said hello can i help you charlie nearly fell through a window he looked behind his back then back at the woman no she was looking right at him yes you rang the bell oh me yes charlie said im uhyou meant me right the woman stepped back into the house what can i do for you she said a bit stern now oh sorrycharlie asheri own a secondhand store over in north beach i just talked to you on the phone i think yes but i told you that it wasnt important right right right you did but i was in the neighborhood and i thought well id just drop by i got the impression you were calling from your shop you got all the way across town in five minutes oh right well the van is like a mobile shop to me so the person who won the lotto is with you right no he quit i had to kick him out of the van new money you know all full of himself will probably buy a big rock of cocaine and a halfdozen hookers and hell be broke by the weekend good riddance i say the woman backed another step into the house and pulled the door partway shut well if you have the clothes with you i suppose i can take a look at them clothes charlie couldnt believe she could see him he was completely screwed now hed never get the soul vessel and thenwell he didnt want to think of what would happen then the clothes you said you thought might belong to my aunt i could look at them oh i dont have those with me now she had the door closed to the point where he could see just one blue eye the embroidery around the neckline of her blouse the button on her jeans and two toes she was barefoot maybe youd better check another time im trying to get my aunts things together and im doing it all by myself so its a little hectic she was in this house for fortytwo years im overwhelmed thats why im here charlie said thinking what the hell am i talking about i do this all the time uh ms mrs actually mrs elizabeth sarkoff well mrs sarkoff i do this sort of thing a lot and sometimes it can get overwhelming going through the possessions of a loved one especially if theyve been in one place for a long time like your aunt it helps to have someone who doesnt have an emotional attachment to help sort things out plus i have a pretty good eye for whats valuable and whats not charlie wanted to give himself a high five for coming up with that on the spur of the moment and do you charge for this service no no no but i may make an offer to buy items youd like to get rid of or you can place them in my shop on consignment if youd prefer elizabeth sarkoff sighed heavily and hung her head are you sure i wouldnt want to take advantage it would be my pleasure he said mrs sarkoff swung the door wide thank god you showed up mr asher i just spent an hour trying to figure out which set of elephant saltandpepper shakers to keep and which to throw away she has ten pairs ten please come in charlie sauntered through the door feeling very proud of himself six hours later when he was waist deep in porcelaincow figurines and he still hadnt located the soul vessel he lost all sense of accomplishment so she had a special connection to holsteins charlie called to mrs sarkoff who was in the next room inside a walkin closet sorting through yet another huge pile of collectible crap no i dont think so lived her whole life here in the city im not sure if she ever saw a cow outside of those talking ones that sell cheese on tv swell charlie said hed been through every inch of the house except the closet where elizabeth sarkoff was working and he hadnt found the soul vessel hed peeked into the closet a couple of times taking a fast inventory of the contents and didnt see anything glowing red he was starting to suspect that either he was too late and the underworlders had gotten the soul vessel or it had been buried with esther johnson he was heading down toward the basement again when his cell phone rang charlie ashers phone charlie said charlie its cassie sophie wants to know if youre going to come home in time to tell her a story and tuck her in i gave her dinner and her bath charlie ran up the stairs and looked out the front windows it had gotten dark and he hadnt even noticed crap cassie im sorry i didnt realize it was so late im with an estate client tell her ill be home to tuck her in okay i will cassandra said sounding exhausted and charlie you can clean up the bathroom floor youve got to do something about those dogs getting in the tub with her there are drifts of mr bubble suds all over your apartment they do enjoy their bath thats cute charlie if i didnt love your sister id hire someone to break your legs my mom just died cassie youre playing the deadmom card now charlie asher you gotta go charlie said be home soon charlie pushed the disconnect button four times then one more time just to be sure cassandra had been such a sweet woman only days ago what happened to people charlie bounded into the bedroom mrs sarkoff yes still in here came a voice from the closet im going to have to be going my daughter needs me i hope everything is all right yes not an emergency ive just been gone for a couple of days look if you need any more help no i wouldnt think of it why dont you give me a few days to sort things out and ill bring some items by your shop i dont mind really charlie felt silly yelling to someone who was in a closet no ill be in touch i promise charlie couldnt think of any way of pressing the situation right now and he needed to get home okay then ill be going thank you mr asher youve been a lifesaver youre welcome bye charlie let himself out and the front door locked behind him with a click he could hear stirring below the streetthe rustling of feathers the distant calls of ravensas he made his way back to where he had parked his van and when he got there of course it had been towed when she heard the front door lock audrey went to the back of the closet and moved the big cardboard wardrobe box aside to reveal an elderly woman who was sitting calmly in a folding lawn chair knitting hes gone esther you can come out now well help me up dear i think im stuck like this esther said im sorry audrey said i had no idea hed stay that long i dont understand why you let him in in the first place esther said creaky but on her feet now so he could satisfy his curiosity see for himself and where did you get that elizabeth sarkoff name my secondgrade teacher it was the first thing i could think of well i guess you fooled him i dont know how to thank you hell be back you know that right audrey said i hope not too soon esther said i really need to visit the powder room where is it lover hissed the morrigan from the grate on haight street near where charlie was trying to flag down a cab youre slipping meat said the hellish chorus charlie looked around to see if anyone else had heard but passersby seemed very intent on their own conversations or if alone were staring intently at a point only twelve feet in front of them on the sidewalk both strategies to avoid eye contact with the panhandlers and crazy people who lined the sidewalk not even the crazy people seemed to notice fuck off charlie said in a furious whisper at the curb fucking harpies oh lover this teasing is so delicious the little ones blood will be so delicious the young homeless guy sitting just down the curb looked up at charlie dude get the clinic to up your lithium and theyll go away it worked for me charlie nodded and gave the guy a dollar thanks ill look into that hed have to call jane in arizona in the morning and find out how far the shadow had moved down the mesa if it had moved why would what he did or didnt do in san francisco affect what was happening in sedona all this time hed been trying to convince himself that it wasnt about him and now it appeared that it very much was about him the luminatus will rise in the city of two bridges vern had said what kind of dependable prophecy can you get from a guy named vern anyway come on down to verns discount prophecythe nostradamus with the lowprice promise it was absurd he had to keep going forward doing his part and doing his best to collect the soul vessels that came to him and if he didnt well the forces of darkness would rise and rule over the world so what bring it on sewer hoes big deal but his inner beta male the gene that had kept his kind alive for three million years spoke up forces of darkness ruling the world okay that would be bad it said she so loved the smell of pinesol said the third woman that day to claim to have been charlies mothers best friend the funeral hadnt been so bad but now there was a potluck in the clubhouse of a nearby gated senior community where buddy had lived before he moved in with charlies mom the couple had returned there often to play cards and socialize with buddys old crew did you get some sloppy joe asked best friend number three despite the hundreddegree heat she wore a pink sweatsuit emblazoned with rhinestone poodles and carried a nervous little black poodle under her arm everywhere she went the dog licked her potato salad while she was distracted by talking to charlie i dont know if your mother ever ate sloppy joe only thing i ever saw her take in was an oldfashioned she did enjoy her cocktails yes she did charlie said and i think im going to go enjoy one myself right now charlie had flown into sedona that morning after spending the night in san francisco trying to find the two overdue soul vessels although he couldnt find a burial notice for esther johnson the pretty brunette woman at her house had told him that she had been interred the day after hed first gone to the house in the haight and he assumed that the soul vessel had been once again buried with her was the brunettes name elizabeth of course it was elizabeth he was fooling himself to even pretend to forget beta males do not forget the names of pretty women charlie could remember the name of the centerfold of the first playboy hed ever swiped from the shelves in his dads shop he even remembered that her turnoffs were bad breath mean people and genocide and resolved that he would never have be or commit any of those things just in case he ran into her sometime when she was casually sunning her breasts on the hood of a car there was no trace of the other woman irena posokovanovich who was supposed to have died days ago no notice no records at hospitals no one living in her house it was as if shed evaporated and taken her soul vessel with her he had a couple more weeks to get to the third name in his date book but he wasnt sure what he was going to have to deal with to get to it darkness was rising someone beside him said small talk doesnt really get any smaller than when youve lost a loved one huh charlie turned toward the voice surprised to see vern glover diminutive death merchant munching some coleslaw and ranch beans thanks for coming charlie said automatically vern waved off the thanks with his plastic fork you saw the shadow charlie nodded when hed gotten to his mothers house this morning the shadow of the mesa had reached his mothers front yard and the calls of the carrion birds that churned in its edges were deafening you didnt tell me that no one else could see it i called my sister from san francisco to check the progress but she didnt see anything sorry they cant see itat least as far as ive ever been able to tell they cant it was gone for five days it came back this morning when i came back i guess did we cause this doughnuts and coffee and its the end of the world i missed two souls back home charlie said smiling at a gentleman in burgundy golf wear who held his hand to his heart in sympathy as he passed them missed did thewhat did you call themthe sewer harpies get them could be charlie said but whatever is happening it seems to be following me sorry vern said im glad we talked though i dont feel so alone yeah charlie said and sorry about your mother vern added quickly you okay hasnt even hit me yet charlie said i guess im an orphan ill make sure and check out whoever gets her necklace vern said ill be careful with it thanks charlie said you think we have any control over who gets the soul next i mean really the great big book says it will move on as it should i guess vern said every time ive sold one the glow has gone out right away if it wasnt the right person that wouldnt happen right yeah i guess so charlie said so there is some order to this youre the expert vern saidthen he dropped his fork who is that shes so hot thats my sister charlie said jane was coming across the room toward them she was wearing charlies charcoal doublebreasted armani and the strappy black pumps her platinum hair was lacquered into thirties finger waves which flowed out from under a small black hat with a veil that covered her face down to her lips which shone like red ferraris to charlie she looked as usual like the cross between a robot assassin and a dr seuss character but if he tried to squint past the fact that she was his sister and a lesbian and his sister then he could possibly see how the hair lips and sheer linear altitude of her might strike someone as hot especially someone like vern who would require climbing equipment and oxygen to scale a woman janes height vern id like you to meet my incredibly hot sister jane jane this is vern hi vern jane took verns hand and the death merchant winced at her grip sorry for your loss vern said thanks jane said did you know our mother vern knew her very well charlie said in fact it was one of moms dying wishes that you let vern buy you a doughnut wasnt it vern vern nodded so hard that charlie thought he could hear vertebrae cracking her dying wish vern said jane didnt move or say anything because her eyes were covered charlie couldnt see her expression but he guessed that she might be trying to burn holes in his aorta with her laserbeam vision you know vern that would be lovely but could i take a rain check we just buried my mother and i have some things to go over with my brother thats fine vern said and it doesnt have to be a doughnut if youre watching your figure you know a salad coffee anything sure jane said since its what mom wanted ill give you a call charlie told you im a lesbian though right oh my god vern said he almost doubled over with excitement before he remembered that he was at a postfuneral potluck and he was openly imagining a ménage à trois with the deceaseds daughter sorry he squealed see you vern charlie said as his sister hustled him toward the kitchen cubicle of the clubhouse ill email you about that other thing as soon as they rounded the corner into the kitchen jane punched charlie in the solar plexus knocking the wind out of him what were you thinking jane hissed she flipped back her veil so he could see just how pissed off she was just in case the punch in the breadbasket hadnt conveyed the message charlie was gasping and laughing at the same time its what mom would have wanted my mom just died charlie yeah charlie said but you have no idea what youve just done for that guy in there really jane raised an eyebrow he will remember this day always charlie said that guy will never again have a sexual fantasy in which you do not walk through probably wearing borrowed shoes and you dont find that creepy well yes youre my sister but its a seminal moment for vern jane nodded youre a pretty good guy charlie looking out for a tiny stranger like that yeah well you know for an ass bag jane said as she sank a fist into charlies solar plexus strangely as he gasped for breath charlie felt that wherever his mother was right now she was pleased with him bye mom he thought part three battleground tomorrow we shall meet death and i and he shall thrust his sword into one who is wide awake dag hammarskjöld were okay as long as things dont get weird alvin and mohammed when charlie arrived home from his mothers funeral he was met at the door by two very large very enthusiastic canines who undistracted by keeping watch over sophies love hostage were now able to visit the full measure of their affection and joy upon their returning master it is generally agreed and in fact stated in the bylaws of the american kennel club that you have not been truly doghumped until you have been doubledoghumped by a pair of fourhundredpound hounds from hell section paragraph standards of humping and assdragging and despite having used an extrastrength antiperspirant that very morning before leaving sedona charlie found that getting poked repeatedly in the armpits by two damp devildog dicks was leaving him feeling less than fresh sophie call them off call them off the puppies are dancing with daddy sophie giggled dance daddy mrs ling covered sophies eyes to shield her from the abomination of her fathers unwilling journey into bestiality go wash hands sophie have lunch while you daddy make nasty with shiksas mrs ling couldnt help but do a quick appraisal of the monetary value of the slippery red dogwoods currently pummeling her landlords oxfordcloth shirt like pistondriven leviathan lipsticks the herbalist in chinatown would pay a fortune for a powder made from the desiccated members of alvin and mohammed the men of her homeland would go to any length to enhance their virility including grinding up endangered species and brewing them in tea not unlike certain american presidents who believe there is no stiffy like the one you get from bombing a few thousand foreigners yet it appeared that the desiccateddogdick fortune would remain unclaimed mrs ling had long ago given up on collecting hellhound bits when after trying to dispatch alvin with a sharp and ringing blow to the cranium from her castiron skillet he bit the skillet off its handle crunched it down in a slurry of dog drool and iron filings and then sat up and begged for seconds throw some water on them charlie cried down doggies good doggies oh yuck mrs ling was galvanized into action by charlies distress call and timing her move with the oscillating pyramid of man and dog meat in the doorway dashed by charlie into the hallway and down the steps lily lily came up the stairs and skidded to a stop on the hallway carpet when she saw the hellhounds pounding away at charlie oh asher you sick bastard help charlie said lily pulled the fire extinguisher off the wall dragged it to the doorway pulled the pin and proceeded to unload on the bouncing trio two minutes later charlie was collapsed in a frosty heap on the threshold and alvin and mohammed were locked in charlies bedroom where they were joyfully chewing away on the expended fire extinguisher lily had lured them in there when they had tried to bite the co stream seeming to enjoy the freezing novelty of it over the welcomehome humping they were giving charlie you okay lily said she was wearing one of her chef coats over a red leather skirt and kneehigh platform boots its been kind of a rough week charlie said she helped him to his feet trying to avoid touching the damp spots on his shirt charlie did a controlled fall toward the couch lily helped him land ending with one arm pinned awkwardly under his back thanks charlie said there was still frost in his hair and eyelashes from the fire extinguisher asher lily said trying not to look him in the eye im not comfortable with this but i think given the situation that its time i said something okay lily you want some coffee no please shut up thank you she paused and took a deep breath but did not extricate her arm from behind charlies back you have been good to me over the years and although i would not admit this to anyone else i probably wouldnt have finished school or turned out as well as i have if it hadnt been for your influence charlie was still trying to see blinking away ice crystals on his eyelids thinking that maybe his eyeballs were frostbitten it was nothing he said please please shut up lily said another deep breath you have always been decent to me despite what i would call some of my bitchier moments and in spite of the fact that you are some dark death dude and probably had other things to worry aboutsorry about your mom by the way thanks charlie said well given what ive heard about your night out before your mom died and whatnot and what ive seen here today i thinkthat its only rightthat i do you do me yes she said for the greater good even though you are a complete tool charlie squirmed away from her on the couch he looked at her for a second trying to figure out if she was putting him on then deciding that she wasnt he said thats very sweet of you lily and nothing weird asher you need to understand that im only doing this out of basic human decency and pity you can just take it to the hoes on broadway if you need to get your freak on lily i dont know what and not in the butt lily added there was a highpitched littlegirl giggle from behind the couch hi daddy sophie

oh thatlily had to spray some frost on alvin and mohammed to settle them down and it got on me they missed you too i could tell charlie said honey could you go play in your room for a bit while i talk

well that ought to liven up mrs magnussens firstgrade class sure its embarrassing now lily said without missing a beat but someday shell thank me charlie tried to look at his shirt buttons as if he were deep in thought but instead started to giggle tried to stop and ended up snorting a little jeez lily youre like a little sister to me i could never oh fine i offer you a gift out of the goodness of my heart and you coffee lily charlie said with a sigh could i just get you to make me a cup of coffee instead of doing meand sit and talk to me while i drink it youre the only one who knows whats

be a while that would be great charlie said i was only going to do you in exchange for information about your death merchant thing anyway lily said picking up the phone on the breakfast bar charlie sighed again thats what i need to sort out either way lily said im unbending on the butt issue charlie tried to nod gravely but started giggling again lily chucked the san francisco yellow pages at him the morrigan this soul smells like ham said nemain wrinkling her nose at a lump of meat she had impaled on one long claw i want some said babd gimme she slashed at the carrion with her own talons snagging a fistsized hunk of flesh in the process the three were in a forgotten subbasement beneath chinatown lounging on timbers that had been burned black in the great fire of macha who was starting to manifest the pearl headdress she wore in her woman form studied the skull of a small animal by the light of a candle shed made from the fat of dead babies macha was ever the artsycraftsy one and the other two were jealous of her skills i dont understand why the soul is in the meat but not in a man tastes like ham too i think nemain said spitting glowing red bits of soul when she talked macha do you remember ham do we like it babd ate her bit of meat and wiped her claws on her breast feathers i think ham is new she said like cell phones ham is not new macha said its smoked pork no said babd aghast yes said macha not human flesh then how is there a soul in it thank you macha said thats what ive been trying to say ive decided that we like ham said nemain theres something wrong macha said it shouldnt be this easy easy said babd easy its taken hundredsno thousands of years to get this far how many thousands of years nemain babd looked to the poison sister many said nemain many said babd many thousands of years thats not easy souls coming to us without bodies without the soul stealers that seems too easy i like it nemain said they were quiet for a moment nemain nibbled at the glowing soul babd preened and macha studied the animal skull turning it over in her talons i think its a woodchuck macha said can you make ham from woodchuck nemain asked dont know said macha i dont remember woodchuck nemain said babd sighed heavily things are going so well do you two ever think about when we are above all the time and darkness rules all about you know what then what do you mean what then macha asked we will hold dominion over all souls and visit death as we wish until we consume all the light of humanity yeah i know babd said but then what i mean you know dominion and all that is nice but will orcus always have to be around snorting and growling macha put down her skull and sat up on a blackened beam whats this about nemain smiled her teeth perfectly even the canines just a little too long shes pining about that skinny soul stealer with the sword new meat macha couldnt believe her ears which had become visible only a few days ago when the first of the gift souls had wandered into their claws so they hadnt been tested in a while you like new meat like is a little strong babd said i just think hes interesting interesting in that youd like to arrange his entrails in interesting patterns in the dirt macha said well no im not talented that way like you macha looked at nemain who grinned and shrugged we could probably try to kill orcus once darkness rises nemain said i am a little tired of his preaching and hell be impossible if the luminatus doesnt appear macha shrugged a surrender sure why not the emperor the emperor of san francisco was troubled he sensed that something very wrong was going on in the city yet he was at a loss as to what to do he didnt want to alarm the people unduly but he did not want them to be unprepared for whatever danger they might face he believed that a just and benevolent ruler would not use fear to manipulate his people and until he had some sort of proof that there was an actual threat it would be criminal to call for any action sometimes he said to lazarus the steadfast golden retriever a man must muster all of his courage to simply sit still how much humanity has been spoiled for the confusion of movement with progress my friend how much still hed been seeing things strange things one late night in chinatown hed seen a dragon made of fog snaking through the streets then early one morning down by the boudin bakery at ghirardelli square he saw what looked like a nude woman covered in motor oil crawl out of a storm sewer and grab a tall halffull latte cup out of the trash then dive right back in the sewer as a policeman on a bicycle rounded the corner he knew that he saw these things because he was more sensitive than other people and because he lived on the streets and could sense the slightest nuance of change there and largely because he was completely barkingatthemoon batshit but none of that relieved him of the responsibility to his people nor did it ease his mind about the disturbing nature of what he was seeing the squirrel in the hoop skirt was really bothering the emperor but he couldnt exactly say why he liked squirrelsoften took the men to golden gate park to chase them in factbut a squirrel walking upright and digging through the trash behind the empanada emporium while wearing a pink ball gown from the eighteenth centurywellit was offputting he was sure that bummer who was curled up sleeping in the oversized pocket of his coat would agree bummer being a rat dog at heart had a less than enlightened outlook upon coexistence with any rodent no less one dressed for the court of louis xvi not to be critical said the emperor but shoes would be a welcome complement to the ensemble dont you think lazarus lazarus normally tolerant of all noncookie creatures great and small growled at the squirrel who appeared to have the feet of a chicken sticking out from under her skirt whichyou knowwas weird with the growl bummer squirmed awake and emerged from the woolen bedchamber like grendel from his lair he immediately erupted into an apoplectic barking fit as if to say you guys in case you didnt notice theres a squirrel in a ball gown going through the trash over there and youre just sitting here like a couple of concrete library lions the message thus barked off he went a furry squirrelseeking missile bent on singleminded annihilation of all things rodent bummer called the emperor wait too late the squirrel had tried to take off up the side of the brick building but snagged her skirt on a gutter and fell back to the alley just as bummer was hitting full stride then the squirrel snatched up a small board from a broken pallet and swung it at his pursuer who leapt just in time to miss taking a nail in one of his bug eyes growling ensued the emperor noticed at that point that the squirrels hands were reptilian in nature the fingernails painted a pleasant pink to match her gown you dont see that every day the emperor said lazarus barked in agreement the squirrel dropped the board and took off toward the street moving nicely on her chicken feet her skirt held up in her lizard hands bummer had recovered from the initial shock of a weaponwielding squirrel something he had encountered before only in doggie nightmares brought on by the latenight gift of chorizo pizza from a charitable dominos guy and took off after the squirrel followed closely by the emperor and lazarus no bummer the emperor called shes not a normal squirrel lazarus because he did not know how to say well duh stopped in his tracks and looked at the emperor the squirrel rocketed out of the alley and took a quick turn down the gutter falling now to all fours as she went just as he reached the corner the emperor saw the trail of the tiny pink dress disappear down a storm sewer followed closely by the intrepid bummer the emperor could hear the terriers bark echoing out of the grate fading as bummer pursued his prey into the darkness rivera nick cavuto sat down across from rivera with a plate of buffalo stew roughly the size of a garbagecan lid they were having lunch at tommys joynt an oldschool eatery on van ness that served homestyle food like meat loaf roasted turkey and stuffing and buffalo stew every day of the year and featured san francisco sports teams on the tv over the bar whenever anyone was playing what said the big cop when he saw his partner roll his eyes fucking what buffalo almost went extinct once rivera said you have ancestors on the great plains special law enforcement portionsprotecting and serving and stuff requires protein a whole bison do i criticize your hobbies rivera looked at his half a turkey sandwich and cup of bean soup then at cavutos stew then at his runt of a sandwich then at his partners colossus of a stew my lunch is embarrassed he said serves you right revenge for the italian suits i love going to every call with people thinking im the victim you could buy a steamer or i could have my guy find you some nice clothes your guy the serialkilling thriftstore owner no thanks hes not a serial killer hes got some weird shit going on but hes not a killer just what we need more weird shit what was he really doing when you had that shotsfired report just like it said i was going by and a guy tried to rob him at gunpoint i drew my weapon and told the perp to halt he drew down on me and i fired your ass you never fired eleven shots in your life you didnt hit the ten x ring with nine of them the fuck happened rivera looked down the long table made sure the three guys sitting down at the other end were engaged in the game showing on the tv over the bar i hit her with every shot her perp was a woman i didnt say that cavuto dropped his spoon partner dont tell me you shot the redhead i thought that was over no this was a new thinglikenick you know me im not going to fire unless its justified just say what happened i got your back it was like this bird woman or something all black i mean fucking black as tar had claws that looked likei dont know like threeinchlong silver ice picks or something my shots took chunks out of herfeathers and black goo and shit everywhere she took nine in the torso and flew away flew rivera sipped his coffee eyeing his partners reaction over the edge of the cup they had been through some extraordinary things working together but if the situation had been reversed he wasnt sure hed believe this story either yeah flew cavuto nodded okay i can see why you wouldnt put that in the report yeah so this bird woman cavuto said like that was settled he totally believed it now what she was robbing the asher guy from the thrift shop giving him a hand job cavuto nodded picked up his spoon and took a huge bite of stew and rice still nodding as he chewed he looked as if he were going to say something then quickly took another bite as if to stop himself he appeared to be distracted by the game on television and finished his lunch without another word rivera ate his soup and sandwich in silence as well as they were leaving cavuto grabbed two toothpicks from the dispenser by the register and gave one to rivera as they walked out into a beautiful san francisco day so you were following asher ive been trying to keep an eye on him just in case and you shot her nine times for giving the guy a hand job cavuto finally asked i guess rivera said you know alphonse that right there is why i dont hang out with you socially your values are fucked up she wasnt human nick still a hand job deadly force i dont know it wasnt deadly force i didnt kill her nine to the chest i saw heritlast night on my street watching me from a storm sewer ever think to ask asher how he happened to know the flying bulletproof bird woman in the first place yeah i did but i cant tell you what he said its too weird cavuto threw his arms in the air well sweet tidy bowl jesus skipping on the blue toilet water we wouldnt want it to get fucking weird would we lily they were on their second cup of coffee and charlie had told lily about not getting the two soul vessels about the encounter with the sewer harpy about the shadow coming out of the mountains in sedona and the other version of the great big book of death and his suspicions that there was a frightening problem with his little girl the symptoms of which were two giant dogs and an ability to kill with the word kitty to charlies thinking lily was reacting to the wrong story you hooked up with a demon from the underworld and im not good enough for you its not a competition lily can we not talk about that i knew i shouldnt have told you im worried about other stuff i want details asher lily a gentleman doesnt share the details of his amorous encounters lily crossed her arms and assumed a pose of disgusted incredulity an eloquent pose because before she said it charlie knew what was coming bullshit that cop shot pieces off her but youre worried about protecting her honor charlie smiled wistfully you know we shared a moment oh my god you complete manwhore lily you cant possibly be hurt by myby my response to your generousand let me say right hereextraordinarily tempting offer gee whiz its because im too perky isnt it not dark enough for you you being mr death and all lily the shadow in sedona was coming for me when i left town it went away the sewer harpy came for me the other death merchant said that i was different they never had deaths happen as a result of their presence like i have did you just say gee whiz to me what am i nine i am a woman i think i might be the luminatus lily lily shut up she raised her eyebrows as if no charlie nodded as if yes the big death with a capital d charlie said well youre totally not qualified for that lily said thanks i feel better now minty fresh being two hundred feet under the sea always made minty uneasy especially if hed been drinking sake and listening to jazz all night which he had he was in the last car on the last train out of oakland and he had the car to himself like his own private submarine cruising under the bay with the echo of a tenor sax in his ear like sonar and a halfdozen sakesodden spicy tuna rolls sitting in his stomach like depth charges hed spent his evening at satos on the embarcadero japanese restaurant and jazz club sushi and jazz strange bedfellows shacked up by opportunity and oppression it began in the fillmore district which had been a japanese neighborhood before world war ii when the japanese were shipped off to internment camps and their homes and belongings sold off the blacks who came to the city to work in the shipyards building battleships and destroyers moved into the vacant buildings jazz came close behind for years the fillmore was the center of the san francisco jazz scene and bop city on post street the premier jazz club when the war ended and the japanese returned many a late night might find japanese kids standing under the windows of bop city listening to the likes of billie holiday oscar peterson or charles mingus listening to art happen and dissipate into the san francisco nights sato was one of those kids it wasnt just historical happenstancesato had explained to minty late one night after the music had ended and the sake was making him wax eloquentit was philosophical alignment jazz was a zen art dig controlled spontaneity like sumie ink painting like haiku like archery like kendo fencingjazz wasnt something you planned it was something you did you practiced you played your scales you learned your chops then you brought all your knowledge your conditioning to the moment and in jazz every moment is a crisis sato quoted wynton marsalis and you bring all your skill to bear on that crisis like the swordsman the archer the poet and the painterits all right thereno future no past just that moment and how you deal with it art happens and minty taken by the need to escape his life as death had taken the train to oakland to find a moment he could hide in without the regret of the past or the anxiety of the future just a pure right now resting in the bell of a tenor sax but the sake too much future looming ahead and too much water overhead had brought on the blues the moment melted and minty was uneasy things were going badly hed been unable to retrieve his last two soul vesselsa first in his careerand he was starting to see or hear the effects voices out of the storm sewerslouder and more numerous than evertaunting him things moving in the shadows on the periphery of his vision shuffling scuffling dark things that disappeared when you looked right at them hed even sold three discs off the soulvessels rack to the same person another first he hadnt noticed it was the same woman right away but when things started to go wrong the faces played back and he realized shed been a monk the first time a buddhist monk of some kind wearing goldandmaroon robes her hair very short as if her head had been shaved and was growing out what he remembered was that her eyes were a crystal blue unusual in someone with such dark hair and skin and there was a smile deep in those eyes that made him feel as if a soul had found its rightful place a good home at a higher level the next time hed seen her was six months later and she was in jeans and leather jacket her hair sort of out of control shed taken a cd from the one per customer rack a sarah mclachlan which is what hed have chosen for her if asked and he barely noticed the crystalblue eyes other than to think that hed seen that smile before then last week it was her again with hair down around her shoulders wearing a long skirt and a belted muslin poets shirtlike an escapee from a renaissance fair not unusual for the haight but not quite common in the castrostill he thought nothing of it until she had paid him and glanced over the top of her sunglasses to count the cash out of her wallet the blue eyes again electric and not quite smiling this time he didnt know what to do he had no proof she was the monk the chick in the leather jacket but he knew it was her he brought all his skills to bear on the situation and essentially he folded so you like mozart he asked her its for a friend was all she said he rationalized not confronting her by that simple statement a soul vessel was supposed to find its rightful owner right it didnt say he had to sell it directly to them that had been a week ago and since then the voices the scuffling noises in the shadows the general creepiness had been nearly constant minty fresh had spent most of his adult life alone but never before had he felt the loneliness so profoundly a dozen times in the last few weeks hed been tempted to call one of the other death merchants under the pretense of warning them about his screwup but mainly just to talk to someone who had a clue about what his life was like he stretched his long legs out over three train seats and into the aisle then closed his eyes and laid his head back against the window feeling the rhythm of the rattling train coming through the cool glass against his shaved scalp oh no that wasnt going to work too much sake and something akin to bed spins he jerked his head forward and opened his eyes then noticed through the doors that the train had gone dark two cars up he sat upright and watched as the lights went out in the next carno thats not what happened darkness moved through the car like a flowing gas taking the energy out of the lights as it went oh shit minty said to the empty car he couldnt even stand up inside the train but stand up he did staying slumped a little his head against the ceiling but facing the flowing darkness the door at the end of the car opened and someone stepped through a woman well not exactly a woman what looked like the shadow of a woman hey lover it said a low voice smoky hed heard this voice before or a voice like it the darkness flowed around the two floor lights at the far end of the car leaving the woman illuminated in outline only a gunmetal reflection against pure blackness since he was first tapped as a death merchant minty had never remembered feeling afraid but he was afraid now im not your lover minty said his voice as smooth and steady as a bass sax not giving up a note of fear a crisis in every moment he thought once youve had black you never go back she said taking a step toward him her blueblack outline the only thing visible in any direction now he knew there was a door a few feet behind him that was held shut with powerful hydraulics and that led to a dark tunnel two hundred feet under the bay lined with a deadly electric railbut for some reason that sounded like a really friendly place to be right now ive had black said minty no you havent lover youve had shades of brown dark cocoa and coffee maybe but i promise you youve never had black because once you do you never ever come back he watched as she moved toward himflowed toward himand long silver claws sprouted from her fingertips playing in the dim glow from the safety lights dripping something that steamed when it hit the floor there were scurrying sounds on either side of him things moving in the darkness low and quick okay good point minty said attack of the crocodile guy it was a brutally hot night in the city and everyone had their windows open from the roof across the alley the spy could see the little girl happily splashing away in a tub full of suds the two giant hounds sitting just outside the tub licking shampoo from her hand and belching bubbles as she screeched with glee sophie dont feed the puppies soap okay the shopkeepers voice from another room okay dad i wont im not a kid you know she said pouring more strawberrykiwi shampoo into her palm and holding it out for one of the dogs to lick a cloud of fragrant bubbles burped out of the beast through the bars of the window and out into the still air over the alley the hounds were the problem but if the spy had his timing right hed be able to take care of them and get to the child without interference in the past hed been an assassin a bodyguard a kickboxer and most recently a certified fiberglassinsulation installerskills that could serve him well in his current mission he had the face of a crocodilesixtyeight spiked teeth and eyes that gleamed like black glass beads his hands were the claws of a raptor the wicked black nails encrusted with dried blood he wore a black silk tuxedo but no shoeshis feet were webbed like those of a waterbird with claws for digging prey from the mud he rolled the large persian rug to the edge of the roof and waited then just as he had planned he heard sweetie im going to take the trash out ill be right back okay dad funny how the illusion of security can make us careless the spy thought no one would leave a young child alone in the bath unattended but the company of two canine bodyguards wouldnt make her unattended would it he waited and the shopkeeper emerged from the steel door downstairs carrying two trash bags he seemed momentarily thrown off by the fact that the dumpster which was normally right outside the door had been moved down the alley twenty feet or so but shrugged kicked the door wide and while it hissed slowly shut on its pneumatic cylinder he dashed for the dumpster thats when the spy sent the rug off the roof the rug unrolled as it fell the four stories unfurled it hit the shopkeeper with a substantial thud and drove him to the ground in the bathroom the huge dogs perked up one let out a woof of caution the spy already had the first bolt in his crossbow now he let it flynylon line hissed out and the bolt hit the rug with a thump penetrating the rug and probably the shopkeepers calf effectively pinning him under the rug perhaps even to the ground the shopkeeper screamed the great hounds dashed out of the bathroom the spy loaded another bolt attached it to the free end of the nylon line attached to the first bolt then fired it through another section of the rug below the shopkeeper continued to shout but with the heavy rug pinned over him he couldnt move as the spy loaded his third bolt the hounds burst through the doorway into the alley the third bolt wasnt attached to a line but had a wicked titaniumspiked tip the spy aimed at the pneumatic cylinder on the door hit it and the door slammed shut locking the hounds in the alley hed practiced this a dozen times in his mind and it was all going exactly as planned the front doors to the shop and the apartment building had been super glued shut before hed come up on the roofno easy job getting that done without being seen his fourth shot put a bolt in the window frame over the hall window the bars on the bathroom were too narrow but he knew that the shopkeeper would have left the door to the apartment open he attached a carabiner to the nylon line and slid silently down the line to the window ledge he unclipped then squeezed through the bars and dropped to the floor in the hallway he kept close to the hall walls taking careful exaggerated steps to keep his toenails from catching on the carpet he could smell onions cooking in a nearby apartment and hear the childs voice coming from the door down the hall which he could see was open if only a crack dad im ready to get out dad im ready to get out he paused at the doorway peeked into the apartment he knew the child would scream when she saw himhis jagged teeth the claws his cold black eyes he would see to it that her screams were shortlived but nobody could remain calm in the face of his fearsomeness of course the fearsome effect was somewhat reduced by the fact that he was only fourteen inches tall he pushed the door open but as he stepped into the apartment something grabbed him from behind yanking him off his feet and in spite of his training and stealth skills he screamed like a flaming wood duck someone had super glued the key slot in the back door and charlie had snapped his key off trying to get it open there was some kind of arrow stuck on a string through the back of his leg and it hurt like hellblood was filling up his shoe he didnt know what had happened but he knew it wasnt good that the hellhounds were bouncing around him whimpering he pounded the door with both fists open the goddamn door ray ray opened the door what the hellhounds knocked them both down going through the door charlie jumped to his feet and limped after them up the steps ray followed charlie youre bleeding i know wait youre dragging some kind of line let me cut it ray ive got to go before charlie could finish his sentence ray had pulled a knife from his back pocket flicked it open and cut the nylon line used to carry this on the job to cut seat belts and stuff charlie nodded and headed up the steps sophie was standing in the kitchen wrapped in a mintgreen bath towel shampoo horns still protruding from her headshe looked like a small soapy version of the statue of liberty dad where were you i wanted to get out are you okay honey he knelt in front of her and smoothed down her towel i needed help on the rinse thats your responsibility dad i know honey im a horrible father okay sophie said hi ray ray was topping the steps holding a bloody arrow on the end of a string charlie this went through your leg charlie turned and looked at his calf for the first time then sat on the floor sure that he was going to pass out can i have it sophie said picking up the arrow ray grabbed a dish towel from the counter and pressed it on charlies wound hold this on it ill call no im okay charlie said pretty sure now he was going to throw up what happened out there ray said i dont know i was someone in the building started screaming like they were being deepfried rays eyes went wide help me up charlie said they ran through the apartment and out into the hallthe screaming was coming from the stairwell can you make it ray said go go im with you charlie steadied himself against rays shoulder and hopped up the stairs behind him the harsh screaming coming from mrs lings apartment had dwindled to pleas for help in english peppered with swearing in mandarin no shiksas help back help charlie and ray found the diminutive chinese matron backed against her stove by alvin and mohammed swinging a cleaver at them to keep them at bay while they barked salvos of strawberrykiwiflavored bubbles at her help shiksas try to take supper said mrs ling charlie saw the stockpot steaming on the stove a pair of duck feet sticking out of it mrs ling is that duck wearing trousers she looked quickly then turned and took a swipe at the hellhounds with the cleaver could be she said down alvin down mohammed charlie commanded which the hellhounds ignored completely he turned to ray ray would you go get sophie the excop who felt himself the master of all situations chaotic said huh they wont back off unless she tells them to go get her okay charlie turned to mrs ling sophie will call them off mrs ling im sorry mrs ling had been considering her dinner she tried to shove the duck feet under the broth with her cleaver but to little effect is ancient chinese recipe we dont tell white devils about it so you dont ruin it you hear of paperwrap chicken this duck in pants the hellhounds growled well im sure its delicious charlie said leaning against her fridge so he didnt fall over you bleeding mr asher yes i am charlie said ray arrived carrying the towelwrapped sophie he set her down hi mrs ling sophie said then she stepped out of her towel went to the hellhounds and grabbed them by their collars you guys didnt rinse she said then buck naked her hair still in shampoo spikes sophie led the hellhounds out of mrs lings apartment uh someone shot you boss ray said yes they did said charlie you should get medical attention yes i should charlie said his eyes rolled back in his head and he slid down the front of mrs lings refrigerator charlie spent the entire night in the emergency room of st francis memorial waiting for treatment ray macy stayed with him the whole time while charlie enjoyed the screaming and whimpering from the other patients waiting for treatment the retching and pervasive barf smell began to wear on him after a while when he started to turn green ray tried to use his excop status to gain favor with the head er nurse whom he had known in that old life hes hurt bad cant you sneak him in somewhere hes a good guy betsy nurse betsy grinned which was the expression she used in lieu of telling people to fuck off and scanned the waiting room to make sure that no one seemed particularly attentive can you get him to the window sure ray said he helped charlie out of his chair and got him to the little bulletproof window this is charlie asher ray said my friend charlie looked at ray i mean my boss ray added quickly mr asher are you going to die on me hope not charlie said but you might want to ask someone with more medical experience than me nurse betsy grinned hes been shot ray said ever the advocate i didnt see who shot me charlie said its a mystery nurse betsy leaned into the window you know we have to report all gunshot wounds to the authorities are you sure you dont want to take a veterinarian hostage and have him sew you up i dont think my insurance will cover that charlie said besides it wasnt a gunshot ray added it was an arrow nurse betsy nodded let me see charlie started to roll up his pant leg and lift his leg up on the little counter nurse betsy reached through the little window and knocked his foot off the shelf for christs sakes dont let the others see im looking ouch sorry is it still bleeding no i dont think so hurt like a bitch big bitch or little bitch extra large charlie said you allergic to any painkillers nope antibiotics nope nurse betsy reached into her uniform pocket and pulled out a handful of pills picked out two round ones and one long one and slid them through the little window by the power invested in me by saint francis of assisi i now pronounce you painless the round ones are percocet the oval one is cipro ill put it on your chart she looked at ray fill out his papers for him hes going to be too fucked up to do it in a few minutes thanks betsy you get any prada or gucci bags in that store where you worktheyre mine no problem ray said charlie owns the store really charlie nodded free betsy added she slid another round pill across the counter for you ray im not hurt its a long wait anything could happen she grinned in lieu of telling him to fuck off an hour later the paperwork was done and charlie was heaped in a fiberglass chair in a posture that seemed possible only if his bones had turned to marshmallow they killed rachel here charlie said yeah i know ray said im sorry i still miss her yeah i know ray said hows your leg but they gave me sophie charlie said ignoring the question so you know that was good yeah i know ray said how are you feeling now im a little concerned that growing up without a mother sophie wont be sensitive enough youre doing a great job with her i meant how are you feeling physically like that thing where she kills people just by looking at them that cant be good for a little girl my fault all my fault charlie does your leg hurt ray had opted not to take the painkiller nurse betsy had given him and now he was regretting it and the thing with the hellhoundswhat kid has to deal with that that cant be healthy charlie how do you feel im a little sleepy charlie said well you lost a lot of blood im relaxed though you know blood loss relaxes you you suppose thats why they did leeches in the middle ages they could use them instead of tranquilizers yes bob ill be right in to the meeting but let me stick a leech on im feeling a little anxious like that great idea charlie you want some water youre a good guy ray did i ever tell you that even if you are serialkilling desperate filipinas on your vacation what nurse betsy came to the window asher she called ray looked pleadingly at her through the windowa few seconds later she was

wow i guess i dont like that movie after all help me get painless into the chair well have him home by breakfast we got here at dinnertime ray said see how you are when youre off your meds charlie had a foam walking cast and crutches when he got home from the hospital the painkillers had worn off to a level where he was no longer painless his head was throbbing like tiny twin aliens were going to burst out of his temples mrs korjev came out of his apartment and cornered him in the hallway charlie asher i am having bone to pick with you last night am i seeing my little sophie run by my apartment naked and soapy like bear pulling giant black dogs around singing not in butt in old country we have word for that charlie asher word is nasty i still have number for child service from days

charlie had waited his entire life to say those words and he felt very macho at that moment i dont know who shot me its a mystery they dropped a rug on me too the rug diminished the machismo somewhat he vowed not to mention it henceforth you come in have breakfast sophie will not eat toast vladlena make she say is raw and have toast germs thats my girl charlie said charlie was no sooner in the door and on his way to rescue his daughter from toastborne pathogens when mohammed grabbed the tip of one of his crutches in his mouth and dragged a hopping charlie into the bedroom hi daddy sophie said as her father went hopping by no skipping in the house she added mohammed headbutted the hapless beta male to his date book there were two names there under todays date which wasnt that unusual what was unusual was that they were the names that had appeared before esther johnson and irena posokovanovichthe two soul vessels hed missed he sat down on the bed and tried to rub the pain aliens back into his temples how to even start would these names keep coming back until he got the soul vessels that hadnt happened with the fuck puppet what was different here things were obviously getting worsenow they were shooting at him charlie picked up the phone and dialed ray macys number it took ray four days to come back to charlie with the report he had the information in three but hed wanted to be absolutely sure that all the painkillers had worn off and charlie wasnt going to be crazy anymoregoing on all night about being the big death with a capital d ray also felt a little guilty because hed been holding out on charlie about breaking some rules in the store they met in the back room on a wednesday morning before the store opened charlie had made coffee and taken a seat at the desk so he could prop his foot up ray sat on some boxes of books okay shoot charlie said well first i found three more crossbow bolts two had barbedsteel tips like the one that went through your leg and one had a titanium spike that one was stuck in the pneumatic closer on the back door dont care ray what about the two women charlie someone shot you with a deadly weapon you dont care correct dont care its a mystery know what i like about mysteries theyre mysterious ray was wearing a giants cap and he flipped it around backwards for emphasis if hed been wearing glasses he would have whipped those off but he wasnt so he squinted like he had im sorry charlie but someone wanted you and the dogs out of the house at the same time they threw that rug on you from the rooftop across the alley then when you were pinned down and the dogs were outside they shot the closer on the door so it would slam shut they sabotaged the back doors lock and glued the front doors shut probably before they even started with the rug then they slid down a line to the hall window slipped between the bars andwell then its unclear charlie sighed youre not going to tell me about the two women until you finish this are you it was highly organized this wasnt a random assault the hall window upstairs has bars on it ray no one can get in no one got in well thats where it gets a little crazy you see i dont think it was a human intruder you dont charlie actually seemed to be paying attention now in order to get through those bars an intruder would have to be under two feet tall and less than say thirty pounds im thinking a monkey charlie put down his coffee so hard that a java geyser jumped out of the cup onto some papers on the desk you think that i was shot by a highly organized monkey dont be that way who then slid down a wire broke into the building and did what made off with fruit you should have heard some of the stupid shit you were saying the other night at the hospital and did i make fun of you i was on drugs ray well theres no other explanation to rays beta male imagination the monkey explanation seemed completely reasonableexcept for lack of motive but you know monkeys theyll fling poo at you just for the hell of it so whos to say the explanation is that its a mystery charlie said i appreciate your trying to bring thisthis furry bastard to justice ray but i need to know about the two women ray nodded defeated he should have just shut up until hed figured out why someone would want to get a monkey into charlies apartment people can train monkeys you know do you have any valuable jewelry in your apartment you know charlie said scratching his chin and looking at the ceiling as if remembering there was a small car parked across from the shop all day on vallejo and when i looked the next day there was a pile of banana peels like someone had been staking the place out someone who ate bananas what kind of car was it ray said his notepad ready im not sure but it was red and definitely monkey size ray looked up from his notes really charlie paused as if thinking carefully about his answer yes he said very sincerely monkey size ray flipped his notebook back to the pages in the front there is no need to be that way charlie im just trying to help it might have been bigger charlie said remembering like a monkey suvlike what you might drive if you were transportingi dont knowa barrel of monkeys ray cringed then read from the pages i went to the johnson womans house no one is living there but the house isnt on the market i didnt see the niece you talked about funny thing is the neighbors knew shed been sick but no one had heard that shed died in fact one guy said he thought he saw her getting into a uhaul truck with a couple of movers last week last week her niece said that she died two weeks ago no niece what esther johnson doesnt have a niece she was an only child didnt have brothers or sisters and no nieces on her late husbands side of the family so shes alive apparently ray handed charlie a photograph thats her latest driverslicense photo this changes things now were looking for a missing person someone who will leave a trail but the other oneirenais even better he handed charlie another picture shes not dead either oh there was a death notice in the paper three weeks ago but heres the giveawayall of her bills are still being paid by personal check checks she signed ray sat back on his stool smiling feeling the sweetness of righteous indignation over the monkey theory and a little guilt alleviation for not telling charlie about the special transactions well charlie finally asked shes at her sisters house in the sunset heres the address ray tore a page out of his notebook and handed it to charlie common courtesy charlie was tornhe really wanted to take his swordcane but he couldnt carry it while using the crutches he considered ducttaping it to one of the crutches but he thought that might attract attention you want me to go with you ray asked i mean you okay to drive with your leg and all ill be fine charlie said someone needs to watch the store charlie before you go can i ask you something sure dont ask dont ask dont ask charlie thought why did you need me to find these two women you robotnecked bastard you had to ask i told you estate stuff charlie shrugged no big deal let it go nothing to see here yeah i know you told me that and normally that would make sense but i found out a lot about these two while looking for themno one in either of their families has died recently funny thing charlie said juggling his keys the cane his date book and his crutches by the back door both bequests were from nonrelatives old friends no wonder women dont like you you just wont leave things alone uhhuh ray said unconvinced you know when people run when they go as far as faking their own death to get away they are usually running from something are you that something charlie ray listen to yourself are you back on your serialkiller thing i thought rivera explained that so this is for rivera lets say hes interested charlie said why didnt you just say so charlie sighed ray im not supposed to talk about this stuff you know that fourth amendment and all i came to you because youre good and you have contacts i depend on you and i trust you i think you know that you can depend on me and trust me right i mean in all these years ive never put your disability pension in jeopardy by being careless about our arrangement have i it was a threat however subtle and charlie felt bad for doing it but he just couldnt let ray continue to push on this particularly since he was in unexplored territory himselfhe didnt even know what kind of bluff he was covering so mrs johnson isnt going to end up dead if i find her for you i will not lay a hand on mrs johnson or mrs pojomrs pokojoor that other woman either you have my word on it charlie raised his hand as if swearing on a bible and dropped one of his crutches why dont you just use the cane ray said right charlie said he leaned the crutches on the door and tried his weight on the bad leg and the cane the doctors had indeed said that it was just a flesh wound so there was no tendon damage just muscle but it hurt like hell to put any weight on that foot the cane would work he decided i should be back to relieve you before five he limped out the door ray didnt like being lied to hed had quite enough of that from his desperate filipinas and was becoming sensitive about being taken for a fool who did charlie asher think he was fooling as soon as he got the store squared away hed give rivera a call and see for himself he went out into the store and did a little dusting then went to charlies special rack where he kept the weird estate items that he made such a fuss about you were only supposed to sell one to each customer but ray had sold five of them to the same woman in the last two weeks he knew he should have said something to charlie but really why charlie wasnt being open with him about anything it seemed besides the woman who bought the stuff was cute and shed smiled at ray she had nice hair a cute figure and really striking light blue eyes plus there was something about her voiceshe seemed so what peaceful maybe like she knew that everything was going to be okay and no one needed to worry maybe he was projecting and she didnt have an adams apple which was a big plus in rays book lately hed tried to get her name even get a look at something in her wallet but shed paid in cash and had been as careful as a poker player covering her cards if shed driven shed parked too far away for him to see her get into her car from the store so there was no license number to trace he resolved to ask her name if she came in today and she was due to come in she only came in when he was working alone hed seen her check through the window once when he was working with lily and only came into the store later when lily was gone he really hoped shed come in he tried to calm himself down for his call to rivera he didnt want to seem like a rube to a guy who was still on the job he used his own cell phone for the call so rivera would see it was him calling charlie didnt like leaving sophie for this long given what had happened a few days ago but on the other hand whatever might be threatening her was obviously being caused by his missing these two soul vessels the quicker he fixed the problem the quicker the threat would be diminished besides the hellhounds were her best defense and hed given express instructions to mrs ling that the dogs and sophie were not to be separated for any amount of time for any reason he took presidio boulevard through golden gate park into the sunset reminding himself to take sophie to the japanese tea garden to feed the koi now that her plague on pets seemed to have subsided the sunset district lay just south of golden gate park bordered by the american highway and ocean beach on the west and twin peaks and the university of san francisco on the east it had once been a suburb until the city expanded to include it and many of its houses were modest singlestory family dwellings built en masse in the s and s they were like the mosaics of little boxes that peppered neighborhoods across the entire country in that postwar period but in san francisco where so much had been built after the quake and fire of then again in the economic boom of the late twentieth century they seemed like anachronisms from both ends of time charlie felt like he was driving through the eisenhower era at least until he passed a mother with a shaved head and tribal tattoos on her scalp pushing twins in a double stroller irena posokovanovichs sister lived in a small onestory frame house with a small covered porch that had jasmine vines growing up trellises on either side and springing off into the air like morningaftersex hair the rest of the tiny yard was meticulously groomed from the holly hedge at the sidewalk to the red geraniums that lined the concrete path up to the house charlie parked a block away and walked to the house on the way he was nearly run over by two different joggers one a young mother pushing a running stroller they couldnt see himhe was on track now how to go about getting in and then what if he was the luminatus then perhaps just his presence would take care of the problem he checked around back and saw that there was a car in the garage but the shades were drawn on all the windows finally he decided on the frontal approach and rang the doorbell a few seconds later a short woman in her seventies wearing a pink chenille housecoat opened the door yes she said looking a little suspicious as she eyed charlies walking cast she quickly flipped the lock on the screen door can i help you it was the woman in the picture yes maam im looking for irena posokovanovich well shes not here said irena posokovanovich you must have the wrong house she started to close the door wasnt there a death notice in the paper a couple of weeks ago charlie said so far his awesome presence as the luminatus wasnt having much of an effect on her well yes i believe there was said the woman sensing an out she opened the door a little more it was such a tragedy we all loved irena so much she was the kindest most generous most loving attractiveyou know for her agewellread and evidently didnt know that its considered common courtesy when you publish a death notice to actually die charlie held out the enlarged driverslicense picture he considered adding aha but thought that might be a little overthetop irena posokovanovich slammed the door i dont know who you are but you have the wrong house she said through the door you know who i am charlie said actually she probably had no idea who he was and i know who you are and you are supposed to have died three weeks ago youre mistaken now go away before i call the police and tell them that theres a rapist at my door charlie gagged a little then pushed on i am not a rapist mrs posoposokevim death irena thats who i am and you are overdue you need to die this minute if possible theres nothing to be afraid of its like going to sleep only well im not ready irena whined if i was ready i wouldnt have left my home im not ready im sorry maam but i have to insist im sure youre mistaken perhaps another mrs posokovanovich no here it is right here in the calendar with your address its you charlie held his date book turned to the page with her name on it up to the little window in the door and you say that that is deaths calendar thats correct maam notice the date and this is your second notice and you are death thats right well thats just silly i am not silly mrs posokovanovich i am death arent you supposed to have a sickle and a long black robe no we dont do that anymore take my word for it i am death he tried to sound really ominous death is always tall in the pictures she was standing on tiptoe he could tell the way she kept bouncing up by the little window to get a look at him you dont seem tall enough theres no height requirement then could i see your business card sure charlie took out a card and held it against the glass this says purveyor of fine vintage clothing and accessories right exactly he knew he should have had a second set of business cards printed up and where do you think i get those things from the dead you see mr asher im going to have to ask you to leave no maam im going to have to insist that you pass away this instant youre overdue go away you are a charlatan and i think you need psychological help death youre fucking with death capital d bitch well that was uncalled for charlie felt bad the second he said it sorry he mumbled to the door im calling the police you go ahead mrs uhirena you know what theyll tell you that youre dead it was in the chronicle they hardly ever print stuff thats not true please go away i practiced for a long time so i could live longer its not fair what go away i heard that part i mean the part about practicing never you mind you just go take someone else charlie actually had no idea what he would do if she let him in maybe he had to touch her for his death abilities to kick in he remembered seeing an old twilight zone as a kid where robert redford was death and this old lady wouldnt let him in so he pretended to be injured and when she came to help himalakazam she croaked and he peacefully led her off to hole in the wall where she helped him produce independent movies maybe that would work he did have the cast and the cane going for him he looked up and down the street to make sure that no one could see him then he lay down half on the little porch half on the concrete steps he threw his cane against the door and made sure that it clattered loudly on the concrete then he let out what he thought was a very convincing wail ahhhhhhhhh ive broken my leg he heard footsteps inside and saw gray hair at the little window bouncing a little so she could see out oh it hurts charlie wailed help more steps the shade in the window to the right of the door parted and he saw an eye he grimaced in fake pain are you all right said mrs posokovanovich i need help my leg was hurt before but i slipped on your steps i think ive broken something theres blood and a piece of bone sticking out he kept his leg below the level where she could see it oh my she said give me a minute help please the pain somuchpain charlie coughed the way cowboys do when they are dying in the dirt and things are getting all dark he heard the latch being thrown and then the inner door opened youre really hurt bad she said please charlie said holding his hand out to her help me she unlatched the screen charlie suppressed a grin oh thank you he gasped she threw open the screen door and blasted him in the face with a stream of pepper spray i saw that twilight zone you son of a bitch the doors slammed the latch was thrown charlies face felt like it was on fire when he could finally see well enough to walk as he limped back to his van he heard a female voice say id have let you in lover then a chorus of spookygirlish laughter erupted from the storm sewer he backed against the van ready to draw the sword from the cane but then he heard what sounded like a small dog barking in the sewer where did he come from said one of the harpies he bit me you little fucker get him i hate dogs when we take over no dogs the barking faded away followed by the voices of the sewer harpies charlie took a deep breath and tried to blink the pain out of his eyes he needed to regroup but then he was taking the old lady down pepper spray or not it took him the better part of an hour to get into position but once he was ready he put down the cinder block flipped open his cell phone and dialed the number hed gotten from information a woman answered hello maam this is the gas company charlie said in his best gascompany voice my grid is showing pressure loss at your address were sending a truck right out but you need to get everyone out of the house right now well im the only one here right now but im sorry i dont smell gas it may be building up under the house charlie said feeling proud of himself for being quick on his feet is there anyone else in the house no just me and my kitty samantha maam please take the cat and go out by the street our truck will meet you there go right now okay well all right thank you maam charlie clicked off he could feel movement inside of the house he moved right to the edge of the porch roof and raised the concrete cinder block over his head itll look like an accident he thought like a cinder block fell off the porch roof he was glad that no one could see him up here he was sweating from the climb his armpits stained his trousers wrinkled he heard the door open and got ready to throw the cinder block as soon as his target emerged from under the roof good afternoon maam a mans voice out by the street charlie looked down to see inspector rivera standing at the sidewalk having just climbed out of an unmarked car what the hell was he doing here are you the gas company said mrs posokovanovich no maam im from the san francisco police he flashed his badge they told me there was a gas leak she said thats been taken care of maam could you step back inside and ill check with you in a minute okay well okay then charlie heard the doors open and close again his arms were trembling from holding the cinder block over his head he tried to breathe quietly thinking that the sound of his wheezing might attract riveras attention make him visible mr asher what are you doing up there charlie nearly lost his balance and went over you can see me yes sir i certainly can and i can also see that cinder block youre holding over your head oh this old thing what were you planning on doing with that repairs charlie tried how could rivera see him when he was in soulvesselretrieval mode im sorry but i dont believe you mr asher youre going to have to drop the cinder block id rather not it was really hard getting it up here be that as it may im going to have to insist that you drop it i was planning on it but then you showed up please indulge me look youre sweating climb down and you can sit in my airconditioned car with me well chattalk about italian suits the giantsi dont knowwhy you were about to brain that sweet old lady with a cinder block airconditioning mr asherwont that be nice charlie brought the cinder block down and rested it on his thigh feeling his trousers snagging beyond repair as he did so thats not much of an incentive what am i some primitive amazon native ive had airconditioning before i have airconditioning in my own van yes ill admit its not exactly a weekend in paris but the next choice was that i shoot you off the roof and they put you in a body bag which is going to be sweltering on a warm day like this oh well yes charlie said that does make airconditioning sound a lot more inviting thanks im going to toss my brick down first if thats okay that would be great mr asher disillusioned with desperatefilipinas ray was browsing through the selection of lonely firstgrade teachers with masters degrees in nuclear physics on ukrainiangirlslovingyoucom when she came through the door he heard the bell and caught her out of the corner of his eye and forgetting that his neck vertebrae were fused he sprained the left side of his face trying to turn to see her she saw him looking and smiled ray smiled back then out of the corner of his eye saw the monitor with the photo of the firstgrade teacher holding her breasts and sprained the right side of his face trying to turn in time to punch the power button before she passed the counter just browsing said the love of his life how are you today hi ray said in his mental rehearsals he started with hi and it just sort of burped out of him before he realized that it put him behind a beat i mean fine sorry i was working i can see that again the smile she was so understanding forgivingand kind you could just tell that by her eyes he knew in his heart that he would even sit through a hat movie for this woman he would watch a room with a view and the english patient backtoback just to share a pizza with her and she would stop him from eating his service revolver halfway through the second movie because thats just how she was compassionate she made a show of browsing the store but two minutes hadnt passed before she made for charlies special shelf even the sign said special itemsone per customer but it didnt say if that was a perday policy or one per lifetime charlie hadnt really specified now that ray thought about it sure lily had yammered on about how important it was that they adhere to the policy but that was lily she might have grown up some but she was still disturbed after a short time she picked up an electric alarm clock and brought it over to the counter this was it this was it ray heard the back door open will this be everything he said yes said the future mrs ray macy ive been looking for one like this yep you cant beat a sunbeam ray said thats twosixteen with taxaw heck call it two even thats very nice of you she said digging into a small purse woven from colorful guatemalan cotton thread hi ray lily said suddenly standing there beside him like some evil phantom who appeared out of nowhere to leech every potentially joyous moment out of his life hi lily he said lily clicked some keys on the computer slowed down by his freshly sprained face ray wasnt able to turn before shed hit the power button on the monitor whats this asked lily with his free hand ray thumped lily in the thigh under the counter ouch freak im sure youll enjoy waking up with that ray said handing the alarm clock to the woman who would be his queen thank you so much said the lovely brunette goddess of all things ray by the way ray said pushing on youve been in a couple of times i was wondering you know because im curious that way uh whats your name audrey hi audrey im ray nice to meet you ray gotta go bye she waved over her shoulder and headed out the door ray and lily watched her walk away nice butt lily said she said my name ray said shes a little biti dont knowunimaginary for you ray turned to the nemesis lily you have to watch the store i have to go why i have to follow her find out who she is ray began to gather his stuffphone keys baseball cap yeah thats healthy ray tell charlie idont tell charlie okay so is it okay if i switch the computer from the ugly web site what are you talking about lily stepped back from the screen and pointed to the letters as she read ukrainian girls loving youugly ugly lily smiled a perky selfsatisfied smile like that kid who won the spelling bee in third grade didnt you hate that kid ray couldnt believe it they werent even being subtle about it anymore cant talk he said gotta go he ran out the door and headed up mason street after the lovely and compassionate audrey rivera had driven up to the cliff house restaurant overlooking seal rocks and forced charlie to buy him a drink while they watched the surfers down on the beach rivera was not a morbid man but he knew that if he came here enough times eventually hed see a surfer get hit by a white shark in fact he sorely hoped that it would happen because otherwise the world made no sense there was no justice and life was just a tangled ball of chaos thousands of seals in the water and on the rocksthe mainstay of the white shark diethundreds of surfers in the water dressed like seals well it just needed to happen for all to be right with the world i never believed you mr asher when you said that you were death but since i couldnt explain whatever that thing was in the alley with you didnt want to explain in fact i let it slide and i appreciate that said charlie showing a little discomfort at drinking a glass of wine with handcuffs on his face was candyapple red from having been burned by the pepper spray is this normal procedure for interrogations no rivera said normally the city is supposed to pay but ill have the judge take the drinks off your sentence great thanks charlie said and you can call me charlie okay and you can call me inspector rivera now braining the old lady with the cinder blockjust exactly what were you thinking do i need a lawyer of course not youre fine this bar is full of witnesses rivera had once been a bythebook kind of cop that was before the demons the giant owls the bankruptcy the polar bears the vampires the divorce and the saberclawed womanthing that turned into a bird now not so much in that case i was thinking that no one could see me charlie said because you were invisible not really just sort of not noticeable well ill give you that but i dont think thats any reason to crush a grandmothers skull you have no proof of that charlie said of course i do rivera said holding up his glass to signal to the waitress that he needed another glenfiddich on the rocks i saw pictures of her grandchildren she showed me when i went in the house no i mean you have no proof that i was going to crush her skull i see said rivera who did not see at all how did you know mrs posokovanovich i didnt her name just showed up in my date book like i showed you yes you did yes you did but that doesnt really give you a license to kill her now does it thats the point she was supposed to be dead three weeks ago there was even a death notice in the paper i was just trying to make sure it was accurate so in lieu of having the chronicle print a correction you thought youd bash in grannys brains well it was that or have my daughter say kitty at her and i refuse to exploit my child in that way well i admire your taking the high ground on that one charlie rivera said thinking who do i have to shoot to get a drink around here but lets just say that for one millisecond i believe you and the old lady was supposed to die but didnt and that because of it you were shot with a crossbow and that thing i shot in the alley appearedlets just say i believe all that what am i supposed to do about it you need to be careful charlie said you may be turning into one of us pardon thats how it happened to me when my wife passed away in the hospital i saw the guy that came to collect her soul vessel and wham i was a death merchant you saw me today when no one else could and you saw the sewer harpy that night in the alley most of the time im the only one who can see them rivera really really wanted to turn this guy over to a psychiatrist at the hospital and never see him again but the problem was he had seen the womanthing that night and another time on his own street and he had seen reports of weird stuff happening in the city over the last two weeks and not just normal san francisco weird stuff but really weird stuff like a flock of ravens attacking a tourist in coit tower and a guy who slammed his car through a storefront in chinatown saying that he had swerved to miss a dragon and people all over the mission saying that theyd seen an iguana dressed like a musketeer going through their garbage tiny sword and all i can prove it charlie said just take me to the music store in the castro rivera looked at the sad naked ice cubes in his glass and said anyone ever tell you that its hard to follow your train of thought charlie you need to talk to minty fresh of course that clears things up ill have a word with krispy kreme while im there hes also a death merchant he can tell you that what im telling you is true and you can let me go get up rivera stood im not finished with my wine leave the money for the drinks and get up please rivera hooked his finger in charlies handcuffs and pulled him up were going to the castro i dont think i can work my cane with these things on charlie said rivera sighed and looked down on the surfers he thought he saw something large moving in a wave behind one surfer but as his heart leapt at the prospect a sea lion poked his whiskered face out of the curl and riveras spirits sank again he threw charlie the handcuff keys meet me in the car i have to take a leak i could escape you do that charlieafter you pay reconsidering a career in secondhand retail anton dubois the owner of book em danno in the mission had been a death merchant longer than anyone else in san francisco of course he hadnt called himself a death merchant at first but when that minty fresh fellow who opened the record store in the castro coined the term he could never think of himself as anything else he was sixtyfive years old and not in the best health having never used his body for much more than to carry his head around which is where he lived most of the time he had however in his years of reading acquired an encyclopedic knowledge of the science and mythology of death so on that tuesday evening just after sundown when the windows of his store went black as if all the light had been sucked suddenly out of the universe and the three female figures moved toward him through the store as he sat under his little reading light at the counter in the back like a tiny yellow island in the vast pitch of space he was the first man in fifteen hundred years to know exactly whatwhothey were morrigan anton said with no particular note of fear in his voice he set his book down but didnt bother to mark the page he took off his glasses and cleaned them on his flannel shirt then put them back on so as not to miss any detail just now they were only blueblack highlights moving among the deep shadows in the store but he could see them they stopped when he spoke one of them hissednot the hiss of a cat a long steady tonemore like the hiss of air escaping the rubber raft that is all that lies between you and a dark sea full of sharks the hiss of your life leaking out at the seams i thought something might be happening anton said a little anxious now with all the signs and the prophecy about the luminatus i knew something was happening but i didnt think it would be youin personso to speak this is very exciting a devotee said nemain a fan said babd a sacrifice said macha they moved around him just outside his circle of light i moved the soul vessels anton said i guessed that something had happened to the others aw are you disappointed because youre not the first said babd it will be just like the first time pumpkin said nemain for you anyway she giggled anton reached under his counter and pushed a button steel shutters began to roll in the front of the store over the windows and door you afraid well get away turtle man said macha dont you think he looks like a turtle oh i know the shutters wont keep you in thats not what theyre for the books say that youre immortal but i suspect that thats not exactly true too many tales of warriors injuring you and watching you heal yourself on the battlefield we will be here ten thousand years after your death which starts pretty soon i might add said nemain the souls turtle man where did you put them she extended her claws and reached out so they caught the light from antons reading lamp venom dripped from their tips and sizzled when it hit the floor youd be nemain then anton said the morrigan smiled he could just see her teeth in the dark anton felt a strange peace fall over him for thirty years he had in some way or another been preparing for this moment what was it that the buddhists said only by being prepared for your death can you ever truly live if collecting souls and seeing people pass for thirty years didnt prepare you what would under the counter he carefully unscrewed a stainlesssteel cap that concealed a red button i installed those four speakers at the back of the store a few months ago im sure you can see them even if i cant anton said the souls macha barked where of course i didnt know it would be you i thought it might be those little creatures ive seen wandering the neighborhood but i think youll enjoy the music nonetheless the morrigan looked at each other macha growled who says things like nonetheless hes babbling said babd lets torture him take his eyes nemain do you remember what a claymore looks like anton asked a great twohanded broadsword said nemain good for the taking of heads i knew that i knew that said babd shes just showing off well in this time a claymore means something else anton said you acquire the most interesting things working in the secondhand business for three decades he closed his eyes and pushed the button he hoped that his soul would end up in a book preferably his first edition of cannery row which was safely stored away the curved claymore antipersonnel mines that he had installed in speaker cabinets at the rear of the store exploded sending twentyeight hundred ball bearings hurtling toward the steel shutters at just under the speed of sound shredding anton and everything else in their path ray followed the love of his life a block up mason street where she hopped on a cable car and rode it the rest of the way up the hill into chinatown the problem was that while it was pretty easy to figure out where a cable car was going they only came along about every ten minutes so ray couldnt wait for the next one jump on and shout follow that antiquated but quaint public conveyance and step on it and there were no cabs in sight it turned out that jogging up a steep city hill on a hot summer day in street clothes was somewhat different from jogging on a treadmill in an airconditioned gym behind a row of taut fuck puppets and by the time he got to california street ray was drenched in sweat and not only hated the city of san francisco and everyone in it he was pretty much ready to call it quits with audrey and go back to the relative desperation of ukrainian girls loving him from afar he caught a break at the powell street exchange where the cable cars pick up in chinatown and was actually able to jump on the car behind audreys and continue the breathtaking sevenmileperhour chase ten more blocks to market street audrey hopped off the cable car walked directly out to the island on market and stepped onto one of the antique streetcars which left before ray even got to the island she was like some kind of diabolical railtransit supervixen ray thought the way the trains just seemed to be there when she needed them then gone when he got there she was master of some sort of evil streetcar mojo no doubt about that in matters of the heart the beta male imagination can turn quickly on a floundering suitor and at that point rays was beginning to consume what little confidence he had mustered it was market street however the busiest street in the city and ray was able to quickly grab a cab and follow audrey all the way into the mission district and even kept the cab for a few blocks when she was on foot again ray stayed a block away following audrey to a big jadegreen queen anne victorian building off seventeenth street which had a small plaque on the column by the porch that read three jewels buddhist center ray had his breath and his composure back and was able to watch comfortably from behind a light post across the street as audrey climbed the steps of the center as she got to the top step the leadedglass door flew open and two old ladies came rushing out frantic it seemed to tell audrey something but entirely out of control the old ladies looked familiar ray stopped breathing and dug into the back pocket of his jeans he came up with the photocopies hed kept of the driverslicense photos of the women charlie had asked him to find it was them esther johnson and irena posokovanovich standing there with the future mrs macy then just as ray was trying to get his head around the connection the door of the buddhist center opened again and out charged what looked like a river otter in a sequined minidress and gogo boots bent on attacking audreys ankles with a pair of scissors charlie and inspector rivera stood outside fresh music in the castro trying to peer in the windows past the cardboard cutouts and giant album covers according to the hours posted on the door the store should have been open but the door was locked and it was dark inside from what charlie could see the store was exactly as he had seen it years ago when hed confronted minty fresh except for one distinct difference the shelf full of glowing soul vessels was gone there was a frozenyogurt shop next door and rivera led charlie in and talked to the owner a guy who looked entirely too fit to run a sweetshop who said he hasnt opened for five days didnt say a word to any of us is he okay im sure hes fine rivera said three minutes later rivera had obtained minty freshs phone numbers and home address from the sfpd dispatcher and after trying the numbers and getting voice mail they went to freshs apartment in twin peaks to find newspapers piled up by the door rivera turned to charlie do you know of anyone else who could vouch for what youve been telling me you mean other death merchants charlie asked i dont know them but i know of them they probably wont talk to you usedbookstore owner in the haight and a junk dealer off lower fourth street right rivera said no charlie said i dont know of anyone like that why did you ask because both of them are missing rivera said there was blood all over the walls of the junk dealers office there was a human ear on the floor of the bookstore in the haight charlie backed against the wall that wasnt in the paper we dont release stuff like that both lived alone no one saw anything we dont know that a crime was even committed but now with this fresh guy missing you think that these other guys were death merchants im not saying i believe that charlie it could just be a coincidence but when ray macy called me today about you that was actually the reason i came to find you i was going to ask you if you knew them ray ratted me out let it go he may have saved your life charlie thought about sophie for the hundredth time that night worried about not being there with her can i call my daughter sure rivera said but then book em danno in the mission charlie said pulling his cell phone out of his jacket pocket that cant be ten minutes away i think the owner is one of us sophie was fine feeding cheese newts to the hellhounds with mrs korjev she asked charlie if he needed any help and he teared up and had to get control of his voice before he answered seven minutes later they were parked crossways in the middle of valencia street watching fire trucks blasting water into the second story of the building that housed book em danno they got out of the car and rivera showed his badge to the police officer who had been first on the scene fire crews cant get in the cop said theres a heavy steel fire door in the back and those shutters must be quarterinch steel or more the security shutters were bowed outward and had thousands of small bumps all over them what happened rivera asked we dont know yet said the cop neighbors reported an explosion and thats all we know so far no one lived upstairs weve evacuated all the adjacent buildings thanks rivera said he looked at charlie raised an eyebrow the fillmore charlie said a pawnshop at fulton and fillmore lets go rivera said taking charlies arm to help speedlimp him to the car so im not a suspect anymore charlie asked well see if you live rivera said opening the car door once in the car charlie called his sister jane i need you to go get sophie and the puppies and take them to your place sure charlie but we just had the carpets cleanedalvin and do not separate sophie and the hellhounds for one second jane do you understand jeez charlie sure i mean it she may be in danger and theyll protect her whats going on do you want me to call the cops im with the cops jane please go get sophie right now im leaving now how am i going to get them all into my subaru youll figure it out if you have to tie alvin and mohammed to the bumper and drive slowly thats horrible charlie no its not theyll be fine no i mean they tore my bumper off last time i did that it cost six hundred bucks to fix go get her ill call you in an hour charlie disconnected well claymores suck i can tell you that said babd i used to like the big sword claymore but nownow they have to make them all splody and full ofwhat do you call that stuff nemain shrapnel shrapnel said babd i was just starting to feel like my old self shut up barked macha but it hurts said babd they were flowing along a storm sewer pipe under sixteenth street in the mission they were barely twodimensional again and they looked like tattered black battle flags threadbare shadows oozing black goo as they moved up the pipe one of nemains legs had been completely severed and she had it tucked under her arm while her sisters towed her through the pipe can you fly nemain asked babd youre getting heavy not down here and im not going back up there we have to go back above said macha if you want to heal before a millennium passes as the three death divas came to a wide junction of pipes under market street they heard something splashing in the pipe ahead whats that said babd they stopped something pattered by in the pipe they were approaching what was that what was that asked nemain who couldnt see past her sisters looked like a squirrel in a ball gown said babd but im weak and could be delusional and an idiot said macha it was a gift soul get it we can heal nemains leg with it macha and babd dropped their unidexter sister and surged forward toward the junction just as the boston terrier stepped into their path the morrigan backpedaling in the pipe sounded like cats tearing lace whoa whoa whoa chanted macha what was left of her claws raking the pipe to back up bummer yapped out a sharp tattoo of threat then bolted down the pipe after the morrigan new plan new plan new plan said babd i hate dogs said macha they snagged their sister as they passed her we the goddesses of death who will soon command the all under darkness are fleeing a tiny dog said nemain so whats your point hoppie said macha over in the fillmore carrie lang had closed her pawnshop for the night and was waiting for some jewelry shed taken in that day to finish in the ultrasonic cleaner so she could put it in the display case she wanted to finish and get out of there go home and have dinner then maybe go out for a couple of hours she was thirtysix and single and felt an obligation to go out just on the off chance that she might meet a nice guy even though shed rather stay home and watch crime shows on tv she prided herself on not becoming cynical a pawnbroker like a bail bondsman tends to see people at their worst and every day she fought the idea that the last decent guy had become a drummer or a crackhead lately she didnt want to go out because of the strange stuff shed been seeing and hearing out on the streetcreatures scurrying in the shadows whispers coming from the storm drains staying at home was looking better all the time shed even started bringing her fiveyearold basset hound cheerful to work with her he really wasnt a lot of protection unless an attacker happened to be less than kneehigh but he had a loud bark and there was a good chance that he might actually bark at a bad guy as long he wasnt carrying a dog biscuit as it turned out the creatures who were invading her shop that evening were less than kneehigh carrie had been a death merchant for nine years and after adjusting to the initial shock about the whole phenomenon of transference of souls subsided which only took about four years shed taken to it like it was just another part of the business but she knew from the great big book of death that something was going on and it had her spooked as she went to the front of the store to crank the security shutters down she heard something move behind her in the dark something low back by the guitars it brushed a low estring as it passed and the note vibrated like a warning carrie stopped cranking the shutters and checked that she had her keys with her in case she needed to run through the front door she unsnapped the holster of her revolver then thought what the hell im not a cop and drew the weapon training it on the stillsounding guitar a cop she had dated years ago had talked her into carrying the smith wesson when she was working the store and although shed never had to draw it before she knew that it had been a deterrent to thieves cheerful she called she was answered by some shuffling in the back room why had she turned most of the lights out the switches were in the back room and she was moving by the case lights which cast almost no light at the floor where the noises were coming from i have a gun and i know how to use it she said feeling stupid even as the words came out of her mouth this time she was answered by a muffled whimper cheerful she ducked under the lift gate in the counter and ran to the back room fanning the area with her pistol the way she saw them do in cop shows another whimper she could just make out cheerful lying in his normal spot by the back door but there was something around his paws and muzzle duct tape she reached out to turn on the lights and something hit her in the back of the knees she tried to twist around and something thumped her in the chest setting her off balance sharp claws raked her wrists as she fell and she lost her grip on the revolver she hit her head on the doorjamb setting off what seemed like a strobe light in her head then something hit her in the back of the neck hard and everything went black it was still dark when she came to she couldnt tell how long shed been out and she couldnt move to look at her watch oh my god theyve broken my neck she thought she saw objects moving past her each glowing dull red barely illuminating whatever was carrying themtiny skeletal facesfangs and claws and dead empty eye sockets the soul vessels appeared to be floating across the floor with a carrion puppet escort then she felt claws the creatures touching her moving under her she tried to scream but her mouth had been taped shut she felt herself being lifted then made out the shape of the back door of her shop opening as she was carried through it only a foot or so off the floor then she was hoisted nearly upright and she felt herself falling into a dark abyss they found the back door to the pawnshop open and the basset hound taped up in the corner rivera checked the shop with his weapon drawn and a flashlight in one hand then called charlie in from the alley when he found no one there charlie turned on the shop lights as he came in uhoh he said what rivera said charlie pointed to a display case with the glass broken out this case is where she displayed her soul vessels it was nearly full when i was in herenow well rivera looked at the empty case dont touch anything whatever happened here i dont think it was the same perp who hit the other shopkeepers why charlie looked back to the back room to the bound basset hound because of him rivera said you dont tie up the dog if youre going to slaughter the people and leave blood and body parts everywhere thats not the same kind of mentality maybe she was tying him up when they surprised her charlie said she kind of had the look of a lady cop yeah and all cops are into dog bondage is that what youre saying rivera holstered his weapon pulled a penknife from his pocket and went to where the basset hound was squirming on the floor no im not sorry she did have a gun though she must have been here rivera said otherwise the alarms would have been set whats that on that doorjamb he was sawing through the duct tape on the bassets paws being careful not to cut him he nodded toward the doorway from the shop to the back room blood charlie said and a little hair rivera nodded that blood on the floor there too dont touch charlie looked at a threeinch puddle to the left of the door yep i think so rivera had the bassets paws free and was kneeling on him to hold him still while he took the tape off his muzzle those tracks in it dont smear them what are they partial shoe prints look like birdfeet prints chickens maybe no rivera released the basset who immediately tried to jump on the inspectors italian dress slacks and lick his face in celebration he held the basset hound by the collar and moved to where charlie was examining the tracks they do look like chicken tracks he said yep charlie said and you have dog drool on your jacket i need to call this in charlie so dog drool is the determining factor in calling in backup forget the dog drool the dog drool is not relevant i need to report this and i need to call my partner in hell be pissed that ive waited this long i need to take you home if you cant get the stain out of that thousanddollar suit jacket youll think its relevant focus charlie as soon as i can get another unit here im sending you home you have my cell let me know if anything happens anything rivera called the dispatcher on his cell phone and asked him to send a uniform unit and the crimescene squad as soon as they were available when he snapped the phone shut charlie said so im not under arrest anymore no stay in touch and stay safe okay you might even want to spend a few nights outside of the city i cant im the luminatus i have responsibilities but you dont know what they are just because i dont know what they are doesnt mean i dont have them charlie said perhaps a little too defensively and youre sure you dont know how many of these death merchants are in the city or where they might be minty fresh said there was at least a dozen thats all i know this woman and the guy in the mission were the only ones i spotted on my walks they heard a car pull up in the alley and rivera went to the back door and signaled to the officers then turned to charlie you go home and get some sleep if you can charlie ill be in touch charlie let the uniformed police officer lead him to the cruiser and help him into the back then waved to rivera and the basset hound as the patrol car backed out of the alley a fuckedup day it was a fuckedup day in the city by the bay at first light flocks of vultures perched on the superstructures of the golden gate and bay bridges and glared down at commuters as if they had a lot of goddamn gall to still be alive and driving traffic copters that were diverted to photograph the ranks of carrion birds ended up covering a spiral cloud of bats that circled the transamerica pyramid for ten minutes then seemed to evaporate into a black mist that floated out over the bay three swimmers who had been competing in the san francisco triathlon drowned in the bay and a helicopter camera photographed something under the water a dark shape approaching one of the swimmers from below and dragging him under numerous replays of the tape revealed that rather than the sleek shape of a shark the creature had a wide wingspan and a distinctly horned head unlike any ray or skate that anyone had ever seen before the ducks in golden gate park suddenly took to the wing and left the area the hundreds of sea lions that normally lounged in the sun down at pier were gone as well and even the pigeons seemed to have disappeared from the city a grunt reporter who had been covering the overnight police blotter noticed the coincidence of seven reports of violence or missing persons at localarea secondhand stores and by early evening the television stations were mentioning it along with spectacular footage of the book em danno building burning in the mission and there were hundreds of singular events experienced by individuals creatures moving in the shadows voices and screams from the sewer grates milk souring cats scratching owners dogs howling and a thousand people woke up to find that they no longer cared for the taste of chocolate it was a fuckedup day charlie spent the rest of the night fretting and checking locks then doublechecking them then looking on the internet for clues about the underworlders just in case someone posted a brandnew ancient document since hed last checked he wrote a will and several letters which he walked outside and put in the mailbox out on the street rather than with the outgoing mail on the counter of the store then around dawn completely exhausted yet with his beta male imagination racing at a thousand miles an hour he took two of the sleeping pills jane had given him and slept through the fuckedup day to be awakened in early evening by a call from his darling daughter hello aunt cassie is an antisemite said sophie honey its six in the morning can we discuss aunt cassies politics a little later it is not its six at night its bath time and aunt cassie wont let me bring alvin and mohammed into the bathroom with me for my bath because shes an antisemite charlie looked at his watch he was sort of glad that it was six in the evening and he was talking to his daughter whatever happened while he was sleeping at least hadnt affected that cassie is not an antisemite it was jane on the other line is too said sophie be careful daddy aunt jane is an antisemite sympathizer i am not jane said listen to how smart my daughter is said charlie i didnt know words like antisemite and sympathizer when i was her age did you you cant trust the goyim daddy said sophie she lowered her voice to a whisper they hate baths the goyim daddys a goyim too baby oh my god theyre everywhere like pod people he heard his daughter drop the phone scream and then a door slammed sophie you unlock this door this instant cassie said in the background jane said charlie where does she get this stuff are you teaching her this its mrs korjevshes descended from cossacks and she has a little residual guilt for what her ancestors did to the jews oh jane said not interested now that she couldnt blame charlie well you shouldnt let the dogs in the bathroom with her they eat the soap and sometimes they get in the tub and then let them go with her jane charlie interrupted they may be the only thing that can protect her okay but im only letting them eat the cheap soaps no frenchmilled soaps theyre fine with domestic soap jane look i drew up a holographic will last night if something happens to me i want you to raise sophie its in there jane didnt answer he could hear her breathing on the other end jane sure sure of course what the hell is going on with you guys whats the big danger sophies in why are you being spooky like this and why didnt you call earlier you fucker i was up all night doing stuff then i took two of those sleeping pills you gave me suddenly twelve hours are gone you took two never take two yeah thanks charlie said anyway im sure ill be okay but if for some reason im not you need to take sophie and get out of the city for a while i mean

want to borrow your tux too its armani right no jane you wont give me away no no its not that id pay her to take you its not that then you dont think that gay people should be allowed to get married is that it youre finally coming clean i knew it after all i just dont think that gay people should be allowed to get married wearing my tux oh jane said youll wear my armani tux and ill have to rent some piece of crap or buy something new and cheap and then ill go through eternity looking like a total dork in the wedding pictures i know how you guys like to show wedding picturesits like a disease by you guys you mean lesbians jane said sounding very much like a prosecuting attorney yes i mean lesbians dumbfuck said charlie sounding very much like a hostile witness oh okay jane said it is my wedding i guess i can buy a tux that would be nice charlie said im sort of needing the pants cut a little looser in the seat these days anyway jane said thatta girl so youll be safe and give me away ill sure try you think cassandra will let me bring the little jewish kid jane laughed call me every hour she said i wont do that okay when you can yeah charlie said bye he smiled to himself and rolled out of bed wondering if this might be the last time he would ever do that smile charlie showered ate a peanutbutterandjelly sandwich and put on a thousanddollar suit for which he had paid forty bucks he limped around the bedroom for a few minutes and decided that his leg felt pretty good and he could do without the foam walking cast so he left it on the floor by the bed he put on a pot of coffee and called inspector rivera it was a fuckedup day rivera said charlie you need to take your daughter and get out of town i cant do that this is about me youll keep me informed right promise you wont try to do anything stupid or heroic not in my dna inspector ill call you if i see anything charlie disconnected having no idea what he was going to do but feeling like he had to do something he called janes house to say good night to sophie i just want you to know that i love you very much honey me too daddy why did you call what you have a meeting or something were having ice cream thats nice look sophie daddy has to go do some things so i want you to stay with aunt jane for a few days okay okay do you need some help im free no honey but thank you okay daddy alvin is looking at my ice cream he looks hungry like bear i have to go love you honey love you daddy apologize to aunt cassie for calling her an antisemite kay click she hung up on him the apple of his eye the light of his life his pride and joy hung up on him he sighed but felt better heartbreak is the natural habitat of the beta male charlie took a few minutes in the kitchen to sharpen the edge of the swordcane on the back of the electric can opener he and rachel had received as a wedding present then he headed out to check on the store as soon as he opened the door to the back staircase charlie heard strange animal noises coming from the store it sounded as if they were coming from the back room and there were no lights on although he could see plenty of light filtering in from the store was this it sort of solved the problem of what he was going to do he drew the sword from his cane and crept down the stairs in a crouch moving along the edge of each step to minimize squeakage halfway down he saw the source of the animal noises and he recoiled leaping nearly halfway back up the staircase for the love of god it needed to be done lily said she was astraddle ray macy her plaid pleated skirt mercifully draped out over him covering the parts that would have caused charlie to have to tear his eyes out which he was thinking about doing anyway it did ray agreed breathlessly charlie peeked down into the back roomthey were still at it lily riding ray like he was a mechanical bull one bare breast bouncing out of the lapel of her chef s coat he was despondent she said i found him giving himself hickies with the shop vac its for the greater good asher well stop it charlie said no no no no no said ray its a charity thing lily said you know lily charlie said covering his eyes you could exercise your charity in other ways like salvation army santa or something i dont want to fuck those guys most of them are raging alcoholics and they stink at least ray is clean i dont mean do one i mean be one ring the bell with the little red kettle jeez i am clean said ray you shut up charlie said shes young enough to be your daughter he was suicidal lily said i may be saving his life she is ray said shut up ray charlie said this is pathetic desperate pity sex thats all it is he knows that lily said i dont mind said ray im doing this for the cause too lily said ray was holding out on you i was said ray how charlie said he found a woman who was buying all the soul vessels she was with the clients you missed somewhere in the mission he wasnt going to tell you about her i dont know what youre talking about ray said then added faster please tell him the address lily said lily charlie said this isnt really necessary no ray said there was a loud smack charlie opened his eyes they were still there doing it but rays right cheek was bright red and lily was winding up to slap him again tell him its on guerrero street between eighteenth and nineteenth i dont know the number but its a big green victorian you cant miss it three jewels buddhist center smack ouch i told him ray whined thats for not getting the address bitch lily said then to charlie there you go asher i want a prime position when you take over the underworld charlie thought that one of the first things he was going to change when he took over was expanding the great big book of death to include how to handle situations like this but instead he said you got it lily youll be in charge of dress code and torture sweet lily said scuse me asher i have to finish this then to ray hear that no more flannel shirts for you grommet smack the grunts coming from ray increased in frequency and intensity sure charlie said ill just go out the other door see ya ray said im never going to look either one of you in the eye again okay sounds good asher lily said be careful charlie crept back up the steps went out the front door of his apartment and down the elevator to the street entrance suppressing his gag reflex the whole way on the street he flagged down a cab and rode into the mission trying to wipe the image of his shagging employees out of his mind the morrigan had followed the gift souls that had escaped through the drains to a deserted street in the mission now they waited watching the green victorian building from stormdrain grates at either end of the street they were more cautious now their rapacious nature having been dampened somewhat by having been severely blown up the night before they called them the gift souls because the little patchwork creatures brought the souls right to them in the sewersthe gifts showing up in the morrigans weakest moment after the accursed boston terrier had chased them through miles of pipelines leaving them battered and exhausted on a high ledge at a pipe junction along marched twenty or so of the darling little nightmares all dressed up in finery and carrying just what they needed to heal their wounds and replenish their strength human souls and thus renewed they were able to scare away that obnoxious little dog the morrigan were backnot to the strength theyd achieved before the explosion maybe not even enough to fly but certainly enough to venture above once again especially with so many souls at hand no one was out on the streets tonight except the junkies the hookers and the homeless after the fuckedup day in the city most everyone had decided that it was just a better idea to stay in safer to the morrigan for all they cared they were safer in their homes the same way a tuna fish is safer in a can but no one knew that yet no one knew what they were hiding from except charlie asher and he was getting out of a cab right in front of them as they watched its new meat said macha we should give him a new name said babd i mean hes really not that new anymore hush hushed macha hey lover babd called out of her drain did you miss me charlie paid the cabbie and stood in the middle of the street looking at the big jadegreen queen anne there were lights on in the turret upstairs and in one window downstairs he could just make out the sign that read three jewels buddhist center he started to step toward the house and saw movement in the lattice under the porcheyes shining a cat maybe his cell phone rang and he flipped it open charlie its rivera i have some good news we found carrie long the woman from the pawnshop and shes still alive she was tied up and thrown in a dumpster a block from her store thats great charlie said but he wasnt feeling great the things that had been moving under the porch were coming out moving up the stairs standing on the porch lining up and facing him twenty or thirty of them a little more than a foot tall dressed in ornate period costumes each had the skeletal face of a dead animal cats foxes badgersanimals charlie couldnt identify but just the skullsthe eye sockets empty black yet they stared you wont believe what she said put her there charlie little creatures little monsters she said about fourteen inches tall charlie said yeah howd you know lots of teeth and claws like animal parts stuck together all dressed up like they were going to a grand costume ball what are you telling me charlie what do you know just guessing charlie said he unclipped the latch on his swordcane hey lover came a female voice from behind him did you miss me charlie turned she was crawling out of the drain almost directly behind him the bad news rivera said is we found the junk dealer and the bookstore guy from book em dannopieces of them that is bad news charlie said he started moving up the street away from the sewer harpy and the porch full of satans sock puppets new meat came a voice from up the street charlie looked to see another sewer harpy coming out of the drain her eyes gleaming black in the streetlight behind him he heard the clacking of little animal teeth charlie i still think you should leave town for a while but if you dont and dont tell anyone i told you this you should get a gun maybe a couple of guns i think that would be a great idea charlie said the two sewer harpies were moving very slowly toward him awkwardly as if their nerves were shortcircuiting the one closest to him the one from the alley in north beach was licking her lips she looked a little ragged compared to the night shed seduced him he moved up the street away from them a shotgun so you wont need to learn to shoot i cant give you one but inspector im going to have to get back to you im serious charlie whatever these things are they are going after your kind you have no idea how clear that is to me inspector is that the one who shot me said the closest harpy tell him im going to suck his eyeballs out of the sockets and chew them in his ear you get that inspector charlie said shes there they charlie said this way meat said the third sewer harpy coming out of the drain at the far end of the block she stood extended her claws and flicked a line of venom down the side of a parked car the paint sizzled and ran where it hit where are you charlie where are you im in the mission near the mission the little creatures were coming down the steps now down the walk toward the street look said a harpy he brought presents charlie where exactly are you said rivera gotta go inspector charlie flipped the phone closed and dropped it in his coat pocket then he drew the sword from the cane and turned to the harpy from the alley for you he said to her whipping the sword in a flourish through the air thats sweet she said you always think about my needs the cadillac eldorado brougham was the perfect showoff of death machines it consisted of nearly three tons of steel stamped into a massively mawed hightailed beast lined with enough chrome to build a terminator and still have parts left overmost of it in long sharp strips that peeled off on impact and became lethal scythes to flay away pedestrian flesh under the four headlights it sported two chrome bumper bullets that looked like unexploded torpedoes or triplegcup madonna death boobs it had a noncollapsible steering column that would impale the driver upon any serious impact electric windows that could pinch off a kids head no seat belts and a horsepower v with such appallingly bad fuel efficiency that you could hear it trying to slurp liquefied dinosaurs out of the ground when it passed it had a top speed of a hundred and ten miles an hour mushy bargelike suspension that could in no way stabilize the car at that speed and undersized power brakes that wouldnt stop it either the fins jutting from the back were so high and sharp that the car was a lethal threat to pedestrians even when parked and the whole package sat on tall whitewall tires that looked and generally handled like oversized powdered doughnuts detroit couldnt have achieved more deadly finned ostentatia if theyd covered a killer whale in rhinestones it was a masterpiece and the reason you need to know all that is that along with the battleworn morrigan and the welldressed chimeras a eldorado was rapidly approaching charlie the bloodred lacquered eldo slid around the corner tires screaming like flaming peacocks hubcaps spinning off toward the curb engine roaring spewing blue smoke out of the rear wheel wells like a flatulent dragon the first of the morrigan turned in time to take a bumper bullet in the thigh before she was dragged and folded under the car and spit out the back into a black heap the headlights came on and the caddy veered toward the morrigan nearest charlie the animal creatures scurried back up the sidewalk and charlie ran up onto the hood of a parked honda as the eldo smacked the second morrigan she ragdollwhipped over the hood as the cars brakes screamed then flew twenty yards down the street the caddy peeled out and hit her again this time rolling over her with a series of thumps and leaving her tossing down the tarmac shedding pieces as she rolled the caddy blazed on toward the final morrigan this one had a few seconds on her sisters and started running up the street her shape changing arms to wings tail feathers trying to manifest but she didnt seem able to make the transformation in time to fly the eldo plowed over her then hit the brakes reversed and burned rubber on her back charlie ran up on the roof of the honda ready to leap away from the street but the caddy stopped and the blackedout electric window wound down get the fuck in the car said minty fresh minty fresh hit the final morrigan again as he speeded off down the block took two screeching lefts then pulled the car to the curb jumped out and ran around to the front oh goddamn said minty fresh damn on the downbeat with pain and sustain goddamn my hood and grille are all fucked up goddamn i will tolerate the rising of darkness to cover the world but you do not fuck with my ride he jumped back in the car threw it into gear and screeched around the next corner where are you going im going to run over the bitches again you do not fuck with my ride well what did you think would happen when you ran them over not this i never ran over anyone before dont act like thats a surprise charlie looked at the gleaming interior of the car the bloodred leather seats the dash fitted with walnut burl and goldplated knobs this is a great car my mailman would love this car your mailman he collects vintage pimp wear so what are you trying to say nothing they were already on guerrero street and minty floored it as they approached the target block the first morrigan he had hit was just getting to her knees when he hit her again knocking her over two parked cars and into the side of a vacant building the second one turned to face them and bared her claws which raked the hood as he rolled over her with a drumroll of thumps then he ran over the third ones legs as she was crawling back into the storm sewer jeez charlie said turning and looking out the back window minty fresh seemed to turn his full attention to driving safely now what the hell are those things i call them sewer harpies theyre the things that call to us from the storm sewers theyre a lot stronger now than they used to be theyre scary is what they are said minty i dont know charlie said have you gotten a good look at them i mean they got the badonkadonk out back and some fine bajoopbadangs up front know what im sayin dog buss a rock wid a playa he offered his fist for minty to buss him a rock but alas the mint one left him hangin stop that fresh said sorry charlie said talk like a playa in ten days or lessstone thug edition minty asked charlie nodded we got the cd into the store a couple of months ago i practice in the van how am i doing your negroosity is uncanny i had to keep checking to make sure youre still

coming back from oakland howd you get away those little animal things a bunch of them attacked her in the dark i could hear her screaming at them tearing them to ribbons but they held her off until the train pulled into the station which was full of people she bolted back into the tunnel there were pieces of the animal creatures everywhere in the train car minty turned onto van ness and started heading toward charlies side of town so they helped you theyre not part of the underworlders trying to take over they dont appear to be they saved my ass so you know some of the death merchants have been killed i didnt know it wasnt in the paper i saw where antons shop burned up last night he didnt make it out they found pieces of him charlie said charlie i think i caused this minty fresh turned

employees like that have you never met anyone who works in a record store theres no greater repository of unjustified arrogance in the world id poison my employees if i thought i could find replacements i dont think shes seeing anybody but since the world is about to be taken over by the forces of darkness you may not have time for dating i dont know she seems like she might have an in with the forces of darkness i like her shes funny in a sort of macabre way and she likes miles lily likes miles davis you dont know that about your little sister charlie threw his hands up take her use her throw her away i dont care shes only parttime you can date my daughter too shes going to be six and probably loves coltrane for all i know calm down youre overreacting just turn around and

do charlie said i knew there was something different about you but i thought that the luminatus would bei dont knowtaller dont start with that okay minty swung the car off van ness into a hotel turnaround where are you going charlie said to run over some sewer harpies again back to the buddhist center uhhuh you have any weapons besides that stupid sword my cop friend told me i should get a gun minty fresh reached into his mossgreen jacket and came out with the biggest pistol charlie had ever seen he placed it on the seat take it desert eagle fiftycaliber itll stop a bear charlie picked up the chromeplated pistol it weighed like five pounds and the barrel looked big enough to stick your thumb in this thing is huge im a big guy listen it holds eight shots theres a round in the chamber you have to cock it and release the safety before you fire there and there he pointed to the safety and the hammer hold on to it if you have to shoot it will knock you on your ass if youre not ready what about you minty patted the other side of his coat i have another one charlie turned the gun in his hand and watched the streetlights playing off its chromed surface beta males who inherently feel they are always at a competitive disadvantage are suckers for showy equalizers you have a lot going on under the surface mr fresh you are not just the runofthemill sevenfoottall death merchant in a pastelgreen suit thank you mr asher very kind of you to say my pleasure charlies cell phone rang and he flipped it open rivera said asher where the hell are you ive been circling the mission and theres nothing here but a lot of black feathers flying in the air yeah its okay im okay inspector i found minty fresh the guy who owns the music store im in the car with him so youre safe relatively good lay low and ill call you okay i want to talk to your friend tomorrow you got it inspector thanks for coming to help careful asher gotcha im laying low bye charlie snapped the phone shut and turned to minty fresh you ready absolutely said the fresh one the street was deserted when they pulled up in front of the three jewels buddhist center ill go around to the back minty said well cars suck i can tell you that said babd trying to keep herself together as the morrigan limped back to the great ship five thousand years horses are fine all of a sudden we have to have paved streets and cars i dont see the attraction im not even sure that we need to rise and let darkness rule said nemain apparently darkness isnt qualified yet speaking as an agent of darkness i think it needs more time she had been crushed into a halfwoman halfraven form and was shedding feathers as they limped through the pipe its like that new meat has someone watching over him said macha next time orcus can deal with him yeah lets get orcus to go after him babd said see what he thinks of cars audrey and the squirrel people charlie could hear things scurrying under the porch as he walked to the front door of the buddhist center but the weight of the enormous pistol hed stuck down the back of his belt reassured him even if it was pulling his pants down a little the front door was nearly twelve feet tall red with reeded glass running the length and there were arrays of colorful tibetan prayer wheels like spools on either side of the door charlie knew what they were because hed once had a thief try to sell him some hot ones stolen from a temple charlie knew he should kick down the door but then it was a really big door and although he had watched a lot of cop shows and movies where door kicking had been done he was inexperienced himself another option was to pull his pistol and blast the lock off the door but he didnt know any more about lock blasting than he did door kicking so he decided to ring the doorbell the scurrying noises increased and he could hear heavier footsteps inside the door swung open and the pretty brunette he knew as elizabeth sarkoffesther johnsons fake niecestood in the doorway why mr asher what a pleasant surprise it wont be for long sister said his inner tough guy mrs sarkoff nice to see you what are you doing here im the receptionist come in come in charlie stepped into the foyer which opened up to a staircase and had sliding double doors on either side he could see that straight back the foyer led to a dining room with a long table and beyond that a kitchen the house had been restored nicely and didnt really have the appearance of a public building the inner tough guy said dont try to run your game on me floozy ive never hit a dame before but if i dont get some straight talk quick im willing to give it a try see charlie said i had no idea you were a buddhist thats fascinating hows your aunt esther by the way he had her now didnt even have to slap her around still dead thanks for asking though what can i do for you mr asher the sliding door to the left of them opened an inch and someone a young mans voice said master we need you ill be right there said the alleged mrs sarkoff master charlie raised an eyebrow we hold receptionists in very high regard in the buddhist tradition she grinned really big and goofy like she didnt even believe it herself charlie was totally charmed by the laughter and open surrender in her eyes trust there with no reason for it good god youre a bad liar he said guess you could see right through my moopoo huh big grin so you are charlie offered his hand to shake i am the venerable amitabha audrey rinpoche she bowed or just audrey if youre in a hurry she took two of charlies fingers and shook them charlie asher charlie said so youre not really mrs johnsons niece and youre not really a usedclothing dealer well actually thats all charlie got out there was a crashing sound from straight ahead glass and splintering wood then he saw the table go over in the next room and minty fresh screamed freeze as he leapt over the fallen table and headed toward them gun in hand oblivious evidently to the fact that he was seven feet tall and that the doorway built in was only six feet eight inches high stop charlie shouted about a half second too late as minty fresh drove four inches of forehead into some very nicely finished oak trim above the door with a thud that shook the whole house his feet continued on his body swinging after and at one point he was parallel to the floor about six feet off the ground when gravity decided to manifest itself the chrome desert eagle clattered all the way through the foyer and hit the front door minty fresh landed flat and quite unconscious on the floor between charlie and audrey and this is my friend minty fresh charlie said he doesnt do this a lot boy you dont see that every day said audrey looking down at the sleeping giant yeah charlie said i dont know where he found raw silk in moss green thats not linen audrey asked no its silk hmm its so wrinkled i thought it must be linen or a blend well i think maybe all the activity yeah i guess so audrey nodded then looked at charlie so mr asher a womans voice to his right the doors on charlies right slid open and an older woman stood there irena posokovanovich the last time hed seen her he was sitting in the back of riveras cruiser in handcuffs mrs posokovmrs posokovanoirena how are you you werent so concerned about that yesterday no i was i really was sorry about that charlie smiled thinking it was his most charming smile i hope you dont have that pepper spray with you i dont irena said charlie looked at audrey we had a little misunderstanding i have this irena said producing a stun gun from behind her back pressing it to charlies chest and sending a hundred and twentyfive thousand volts surging through his body he could see animals or animallike creatures dressed in period finery approaching him as he convulsed in pain on the floor get them both tied up guys audrey said ill make tea tea audrey said so for the second time in his life charlie asher found himself tied to a chair and being served a hot beverage audrey was bent over before him holding a teacup and regardless of the awkwardness or danger of the situation charlie found himself staring down the front of her shirt what kind of tea charlie asked buying time noticing the cluster of tiny silk roses that perched happily at the front clasp of her bra i like my tea like i like my men audrey said with a grin weak and green now charlie looked into her eyes which were smiling your right hand is free she said but we had to take your gun and your swordcane because those things are frowned upon youre the nicest captor ive ever had charlie said taking the teacup from her what are you trying to say said minty fresh charlie looked to his right where minty fresh was tied to a chair that made him look as if hed been taken hostage at a childs tea partyhis knees were up near his chin and one of his wrists was taped near the floor someone had put a large ice pack on his head which looked vaguely like a tamoshanter nothing charlie said you were a great captor too dont get me wrong tea mr fresh audrey said do you have coffee back in a second audrey said she left the room theyd been moved to one of the rooms off the foyer charlie couldnt tell which it must have been a parlor for entertaining during its day but it had been converted into a combination office and reception room metal desks a computer some filing cabinets and an array of older oak office chairs for working and waiting i think she likes me charlie said she has you taped to a chair minty fresh said pulling at the tape around his ankles with his free hand the ice pack fell off his head and hit the floor with a loud thump i didnt notice how attractive she was when i met her before would you help me get free please minty said cant charlie said tea he held up his cup clicking noises by the door they looked up as four little bipeds in silk and satin scampered into the room one who had the face of an iguana the hands of a raccoon and was dressed like a musketeer bigfeathered hat and all drew a sword and poked minty fresh in the hand he was using to pull at the duct tape ow dammit thing i dont think he wants you to try to get loose charlie said the iguana guy saluted charlie with a flourish of his sword and pointed to the end of his snout with his free hand as if to say on the nose buddy so audrey said entering the room carrying a tray with mintys coffee i see youve met the squirrel people squirrel people charlie asked a little lady with a ducks face and reptilian hands wearing a purple satin evening gown curtsied to charlie who nodded back thats what we call them audrey said because the first few i made had squirrel faces and hands but then i ran out of squirrel parts and they got more baroque theyre not creatures of the underworld charlie said you made them sort of audrey said cream and sugar mr fresh please minty said you make these monsters all four of the little creatures turned to him at once and leaned back as if to say hey pal who are you calling monsters theyre not monsters mr fresh the squirrel people are as human as you are yeah except they have better fashion sense charlie said im not always going to be taped to this chair asher minty said woman who or what the hell are you be nice charlie said i suppose i should explain audrey said ya think minty said audrey sat down on the floor crosslegged and the squirrel people gathered around her to listen well its a little embarrassing but i guess it started when i was a kid i sort of had this affinity for dead things like you liked to touch dead things asked minty fresh get naked with them would you please let the lady talk charlie said bitch is a freak minty said audrey smiled why yes yes i am mr fresh and you are tied up in my dining room at the mercy of any freaky thing that might occur to me she tapped a silver demitasse spoon shed used to stir her tea on her front tooth and rolled her eyes as if imagining something delicious please go on said minty fresh with a shudder sorry to interrupt it wasnt a freaky thing audrey said glancing at minty daring him to speak up it was just that i had an overdeveloped sense of empathy with the dying mostly animals but when my grandmother passed i could feel it from miles away anyway it didnt overwhelm me or anything but when i got to college to see if i could get a handle on it i decided to study eastern philosophyoh yeah and fashion design i think its important to look good when youre doing the work of the dead charlie said welluhokay audrey said and i was a good seamstress i really liked making costumes anyway i met and fell in love with a guy a dead guy minty asked soon enough mr fresh he was dead soon enough audrey looked down at the carpet see you insensitive fuck charlie said you hurt her feelings hello tied to a chair here minty said surrounded by little monsters asher not the insensitive one sorry charlie said its okay audrey said his name was williambilly and we were together for two years before he got sick wed only been engaged a month when he was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor they gave him a couple of months to live i dropped out of school and stayed with him every moment one of the nurses from hospice knew about my eastern studies course and recommended we talk with dorje rinpoche a monk from the tibetan buddhist center in berkeley he talked to us about bardo thodrol what you know as the tibetan book of the dead he helped prepare billy to transfer his consciousness into the next worldinto his next life it took our focus off of the darkness and made death a natural hopeful thing i was with billy when he died and i could feel his consciousness move onreally feel itdorje rinpoche said that i had some special talent he thought i should study under a high lama so you became a monk charlie asked i thought a lama was just a tall sheep said minty fresh audrey ignored him i was heartbroken and i needed direction so i went to tibet and was accepted at a monastery where i studied bardo thodrol for twelve years under lama karmapa rinpoche the seventeenth reincarnation of the bodhisattva who had founded our school of buddhism a thousand years ago he taught me the art of phowathe transference of the consciousness at the moment of death so you could do what the monk had done for your fiancé charlie asked yes i performed phowa for many of the mountain villagers it was a sort of a specialty with mealong with making the robes for everyone in the monastery lama karmapa told me that he felt i was a very old soul the reincarnation of a superenlightened being from many generations before i thought perhaps he was just trying to test me to get me to succumb to ego but when his own death was near and he called me to perform the phowa for him i realized that this was the test and he was trusting the transference of his own soul to me just so were clear said minty fresh i would not trust you with my car keys the iguana musketeer poked minty in the calf with his little sword and the big man yelped see charlie said when youre rude it comes back on youlike karma audrey smiled at charlie put her tea on the floor and folded her legs into the lotus position settling in when the lama passed i saw his consciousness leave his body then i felt my own consciousness leave my body and i followed the lama into the mountains where he showed me a small cave buried deep beneath the snow and in that cave was a stone box sealed with wax and sinew he told me that i must find the box and then he was gone ascended and i found myself back in my body were you superenlightened then charlie asked i dont even know what that is audrey said the lama was wrong about that but something had changed me while performing the phowa for him when i came out of the room with his body i could see a red spot glowing in people right at their heart chakra it was the same thing i had followed into the mountains the undying consciousnessi could see peoples souls but what was more disturbing to me i could see that the glow was absent in some people or i couldnt see it in them or in myself i didnt know why but i did know that i had to find that stone box by following the exact path into the mountains that the lama had shown me i did inside was a scroll that most buddhists thoughtstill thinkwas a myth the lost chapter of the tibetan book of the deadit outlined two longlost arts the phowa of forceful projection and one i hadnt even heard of the phowa of undying the first allows you to force a soul from one being to another and the second allows the practitioner to prolong the transition the bardo between life and death indefinitely does that mean you could make people live forever charlie asked sort ofmore like they just stop dying i meditated on the amazing gift id been given for months afraid to try to perform the rituals but one day when i was attending the bardo of an old man who was dying of a painful stomach cancer i could watch the suffering no longer and i tried the phowa of forceful projection i guided his soul into the body of his newborn grandson who i could see had no glow at his heart chakra i could actually see the glow move across the room and the soul enter the baby the man died in peace only seconds later a few weeks later i was called to attend the bardo of a young boy who had taken ill and was showing all the signs of imminent death i couldnt bear to let it happen knowing that there might be something i might be able to do so i performed the phowa of undying on him and he didnt die in fact he got better i succumbed to the ego of it then and i started to perform the ritual on other villagers instead of helping them on to their next life i did five in as many months but there was a problem the parents of the little boy summoned me he wasnt growingnot even his hair and nails he was stuck at age nine but by then the villagers were all coming to me with the dying and word spread throughout the mountains to other villages they lined up outside of our monastery demanding i come see them but i had refused to perform the ritual realizing that i was not helping these people but in fact freezing them in their spiritual progression plus you know kind of freaking them out understandably charlie said i couldnt explain to my fellow monks what was happening so i ran away in the night i presented myself to be of service to a buddhist center in berkeley and i was accepted as a monk it was during that time that i saw for the first time a human soul contained in an inanimate object when i went into a music store in the castro it was your music store mr fresh i knew that was you said minty i told asher about you he did charlie said he said you were very attractive i did not minty said he did nice eyes he said charlie said go on there was no mistaking it thoughthe glow in the cdit was exactly the same presence that i could sense in people who had a soul needless to say i was freaked out needless to say charlie said i had a similar experience audrey nodded i was going to discuss all of this with my master at the center you know come clean about what i had learned in tibetturn the scrolls over to someone who perhaps understood what was going on with the souls inside of objects but after only a few months word came from tibet that i had left under suspicious circumstances i dont know what details they gave but i was asked to leave the center so you formed a posse of spooky animal things and moved to the mission said minty fresh thats nice you can let me loose from this chair now and ill be on my way fresh will you please let audrey finish telling her story im sure theres a perfectly innocent reason that she hangs out with a posse of spooky animal things audrey pressed on i was able to get a job as costumer for a local theater group and being around theater people basically a bunch of born showoffs can put you back into the swing of a life i tried to forget about my practice in tibet and i focused on my work trying to let my creativity drive me i couldnt afford to make fullsized costumes so i began to create smaller versions i bought a collection of stuffed squirrels from a secondhand store in the mission and used those as my first models later i made my models out of other taxidermied animal partsmixing and matching them but id already started calling them my squirrel people a lot of them have bird feet chicken and duck because i could purchase them in chinatown along with things like turtle heads andwell you can buy a lot of deadanimal parts in chinatown tell me about it charlie said i live a block from the shark parts store never actually tried to build a shark from spare parts though bet that would be fun yall are twisted minty said both of youyou know that right messin with dead things and all charlie and audrey each raised an eyebrow at him a creature in a blue kimono with the face of a dog skull gave minty the critical eye socket and would have raised an eyebrow at him if shed had one all right go on minty said waving audrey on with his free hand you made your point audrey sighed so i started to hit all of the secondhand stores in the city looking for everything from buttons to hands and at at least eight stores i found the soul objectsall grouped together at each store i realized that i wasnt the only one who could see them glowing red someone was imprisoning these souls in the objects thats how i came to know about you gentlemen whatever you are i had to get these souls out of your hands so i bought them i wanted them to move on to their next rebirth but i didnt know how i thought about using the phowa of forceful projection forcing a soul into someone who i could see was soulless but that process takes time what would i do tie them up and i didnt even know if it would work after all that method was used to force a soul from one person to another not from an inanimate object charlie said so you tried this forcefulprojection thing with one of your squirrel people yeah and it worked but what i didnt count on is that they became animated she started walking around doing things intelligent things which is how they came to be these little guys youve seen today more tea mr asher audrey smiled and held the teapot out to charlie those things have human souls charlie asked thats heinous oh yeah and its better that you have the soul imprisoned in an old pair of sneakers in your shop theyre only in the squirrel people until i can figure how to put their souls into a person i wanted them saved from you and your kind were not the bad guys tell her fresh were not the bad guys were not the bad guys minty said can i get some more coffee were death merchants charlie said but it came out much less cheerfulsounding than hed hoped he was very desperate for audrey not to think of him as a bad guy like most beta males he didnt realize that being a good guy was not necessarily an attraction to women thats what im saying audrey said i couldnt just let you guys sell the souls like so much secondhand junk thats how they find their next rebirth minty said what audrey looked at charlie for confirmation charlie nodded hes right we get the souls when someone dies and then someone buys them and they get to their next life ive seen it happen no way audrey said overpouring mintys coffee yep charlie said we can see the red glow but not in peoples bodies like you only in the objects when someone who needs a soul comes in contact with the object the glow goes out the soul moves into them i thought youd trapped the souls between lives youre not holding these souls prisoner nope it wasnt us after all minty fresh said to charlie she was the one that brought all of this on what on what audrey said there are forces of darknesswe dont know what they are charlie said what weve seen are giant ravens and these demonlike women we call them sewer harpies because theyve come out of the storm sewers they gain strength when they get hold of a soul vesseland theyre getting really strong the prophecy says they are going to rise in san francisco and darkness will cover the world and they are in the sewers audrey said both death merchants nodded oh no thats how the squirrel people get around town without being seen ive sent them to the different stores in the city to get the souls i must have been sending them right to these creatures and a lot of them havent come home i thought they just might be lost or wandering around they do that they have the potential of full human consciousness but something is lost with time out of the body sometimes they can get a little goofy no kidding said charlie so is that why iguana boy over there is gnawing on the light cord ignatius get off there if you electrocute yourself the only place i have to put your soul is that cornish hen i got at the safeway its still frozen and i dont have any pants that will fit it she turned to charlie with an embarrassed smile the things you never think youll hear yourself say yeah kids what are you gonna do charlie said trying to sound easygoing you know one of your squirrel people shot me with a crossbow audrey looked distraught now charlie wanted to comfort her give her a hug kiss her on the top of the head and tell her that everything was all right maybe even get her to untie him they did crossbow oh that would be mr shelly he was a spy or something in a former lifehad a habit of going off on his own little missions i sent him to keep an eye on you and report back so i could figure out what you were doing no one was supposed to get hurt he never came home im really sorry report back charlie said they can talk well they dont talk audrey said but some of them can read and write mr shelly could actually type ive been working on that i need to get them a voice box that works i tried one out of a talking doll but i just ended up with a ferret in a samurai outfit that cried and kept asking if it could go play in the sandbox it was unnerving its a strange process as long as theres organic parts stuff that was once living they knit together they work muscles and tendons make their own connections ive been using hams for the torsos because it gives them a lot of muscle to work with and they smell better until the process is finished you know smoky but some things are a mystery they dont grow voice boxes they dont appear to grow eyes either charlie said gesturing with his teacup at a creature whose head was an eyeless cat skull how do they see got me audrey shrugged it wasnt in the book man i know that feeling said minty fresh so ive been experimenting with a voice box made out of catgut and cuttlebone well see if the one who has it learns to talk why dont you put the souls back in human bodies asked minty i mean you can right i suppose audrey said but to be honest i didnt have any human corpses lying around the house but there does have to be a piece of human being in themi learned that from experimentinga finger bone blood something i got a great deal on a backbone in a junk store in the haight and ive been using one vertebra for each of them so youre like some monstrous reanimator charlie said then he quickly added and i mean that in the nicest way thanks mr death merchant audrey smiled back and went to the nearby desk for some scissors but it looks like i need to cut you loose and hear how you guys got into your line of work mr greenstreet could you bring us some more tea and coffee a creature with a beavers skull for a head wearing a fez and a red satin smoking jacket bowed and scampered by charlie headed toward the kitchen nice jacket charlie said the beaver guy gave him a thumbsup as he passed lizard thumbs the rhythm of lost and found the emperor was camped in some bushes near an open culvert that drained into lobos creek in the presidio the land point on the san francisco side of the golden gate where forts had stood from the time of the spanish but had recently been turned into a park the emperor had wandered the city for days calling into storm drains following the sound of his lost soldiers barking the faithful retriever lazarus had led him here one of the few drains in the city where the boston terrier might be able to exit without being washed into the bay they camped under a camouflage poncho and waited mercifully it hadnt rained since bummer had chased the squirrel into the storm sewer but dark clouds had been bubbling over the city for two days now and whether or not they were bringing rain they made the emperor fear for his city ah lazarus said the emperor scratching his charge behind the ears if we had even half the courage of our small comrade we would go into that drain and find him but what are we without him our courage our valor steady and righteous we may be my friend but without courage to risk ourselves for our brother we are but politiciansblustering whores to rhetoric lazarus growled low and hunkered back under the poncho the sun had just set but the emperor could see movement back in the culvert as he climbed to his feet the sixfoot pipe was filled with a creature that crawled out and virtually unfolded in the creekbeda huge bullheaded thing with eyes that glowed green and wings that unfurled like leathery umbrellas as they watched the creature took three steps and leapt into the twilight sky his wings beating like the sails of a death ship the emperor shuddered and considered for a moment moving their camp into the city proper perhaps passing the night on market street with people and policemen streaming by but then he heard the faintest barking coming from deep in the culvert audrey was showing them around the buddhist center which except for the office in the front and a living room that had been turned into a meditation room looked very much like any other sprawling victorian home austere and oriental in its decor yes and perhaps the smell of incense permeating it but still just a big old house its just a big old house really she said leading them into the kitchen minty fresh was making audrey feel a little uncomfortable he kept picking at bits of ducttape adhesive that had stuck to the sleeve of his green jacket and giving audrey a look like he was saying this better come out when its drycleaned or its your ass his size alone was intimidating but now a series of large knots were rising on his forehead where hed smacked the doorway and he looked vaguely like a klingon warrior except for the pastelgreen suit of course maybe the agent for a klingon warrior so he said if the squirrel people thought i was a bad guy why did they save me from the sewer harpy in the train last week they attacked her and gave me time to get away audrey shrugged i dont know they were supposed to just watch you and report back they must have seen that what was after you was much worse than you they are human at heart you know she paused in front of the pantry door and turned to them she hadnt seen the debacle in the street but esther had been watching through the window and had told her what had happenedabout the womanlike creatures that had been coming after charlie evidently these strange men were allies of a sort practicing what she had taken on as her holy work helping souls to move to their next existence but the method could she trust them so from what you guys are saying there are thousands of humans walking around without souls millions probably charlie said maybe that explains the last election she said trying to buy time you said you could see if people had one said minty fresh he was right but shed seen the soulless and never thought about their sheer numbers and what happened when the dead didnt match with the born she shook her head so the transfer of souls depends on material acquisition thats just soi dont knowsleazy audrey believe me charlie said were both as baffled by the mechanics of it as you are and were instruments of it she looked at charlie really looked at him he was telling the truth he had come here to do the right thing she threw open the pantry door and the red light spilled out on them the pantry was nearly as big as a modern bedroom and every shelf from floor to ceiling and most of the floor space was covered with glowing soul vessels jeez charlie said i got as many as i couldor the squirrel people did minty fresh ducked into the pantry and stood in front of a shelf full of cds and records he grabbed a handful and started shuffling through them then turned to her holding up a halfdozen cd cases fanned out these are from my store yes we got all of them audrey said you broke into my store she kept them from the bad guys minty charlie said stepping in the pantry she probably saved them maybe saved us no way man none of this would be happening if it wasnt for her no it was always going to happen i saw it in the other great big book in arizona i was just trying to help them audrey said charlie was staring at the cds in mintys hand he seemed to have fallen into some sort of trance and reached out and took the cds as if he were moving through some thick liquidthen shuffled away all but one which he just stared at then flipped over to look at the back he sat down hard in the pantry and audrey caught his head to keep him from bumping it on the shelf behind him charlie she said are you okay minty fresh squatted down next to charlie and looked at the cdreached for it but charlie pulled it away minty looked at audrey its his wife he said audrey could see the name rachel asher scratched into the back of the cd case and she felt her heart breaking for poor charlie she put her arms around him im so sorry charlie im so sorry tears splattered on the cd case and charlie wouldnt look up minty fresh stood and cleared his throat his face clear of any rage or accusation he seemed almost ashamed audrey ive been driving around the city for days i could sure use a place to lie down if you have it she nodded her face against charlies back ask esther shell show you minty fresh ducked out of the pantry audrey held charlie and rocked him for a long time and even though he was lost in the world of that cd that held the love of his life and she was outside crouched in a pantry that glowed red with cosmic bricabrac she cried with him after an hour passed or maybe it was three because thats the way time is in grief and love charlie turned to her and said do i have a soul what she said you said you could see peoples souls glowing in themdo i have a soul yes charlie yes you have a soul he nodded turning away from her again but pushing back against her you want it he said nah im good she said but she wasnt she took the cd out of his hand pried his hands off of it really and put it with the others lets let rachel rest and go in the other room okay charlie said he let her help him up upstairs in a little room with cushions all over the floor and pictures of the buddha reclining amid lotuses they sat and talked by candlelight theyd shared their histories of how they had come to be where they were what they were and with that out of the way they talked about their losses ive seen it again and again charlie said more with men than with women but definitely with botha wife or husband dies and its like the survivor is roped to him like a mountain climber whos fallen into a crevasse if the survivor cant let gocut them loose i guessthe dead will drag them right into the grave i think that would have happened to me if it wasnt for sophie and maybe even becoming a death merchant there was something bigger than me going on something bigger than my pain thats the only reason i made it this far faith audrey said whatever that is its funny when esther came to me she was angry dying and angryshe said that shed believed in jesus all her life now she was dying and he said she was going to live forever so you told her sucks to be you esther audrey threw a cushion at him she liked the way that he could find the silliness in such dark territory no i told her that he told her that shed live forever but he didnt say how her faith hadnt been betrayed at all she just needed to open to a broader understanding which was total bullshit charlie said another cushion bounced off his forehead no it wasnt moopoo if anyone should understand the significance of the book not covering everything in detail it should be youus you cant say bullshit can you audrey felt herself blush and was glad they were in the dim orange candlelight im talking faith over here you want to give me a break sorry i knowor i think i know what you mean i mean i know that theres some sort of order to all this but i dont know how someone can reconcile say a catholic upbringing with a tibetan book of the dead with a great big book of death secondhand dealers selling objects with human souls and vicious raven women in the sewers the more i know the less i understand im just doing well the bardo thodrol talks about hundreds of monsters you will encounter as your consciousness makes its journey into death and rebirth but youre instructed to ignore them as they are illusions your own fears trying to keep your consciousness from moving on they cant really harm you i think this may be something they left out of the book audrey because ive seen them ive fought with them wrenched souls out of their grasp watched them take bullets and get hit by cars and keep goingthey are definitely not illusions and they definitely can hurt you the great big book isnt clear about the specifics but it definitely talks about the forces of darkness trying to take over our world and how the luminatus will rise and do battle with them luminatus audrey said something to do with light the big death charlie said death with a capital d sort of the kahuna the big cheese the boss death like minty and the other death merchants would be santas helpers the luminatus would be santa santa claus is the big death audrey said wideeyed no thats just an example charlie saw she was trying not to laugh hey ive been bruised and electrocuted and tied up and traumatized tonight so my seduction strategy is working audrey grinned charlie was flustered i didnti wasntwas i staring at your breasts because if i was it was totally by accident because you knowthere they were and shh she reached over and put her finger on his lips to shush him charlie i feel very close to you right now and very connected to you right now and i want to keep that connection going but im exhausted and i dont think i can talk anymore i think id like you to come to bed with me really are you sure am i sure i havent had sex in fourteen yearsand if youd asked me yesterday id have told you that id rather face one of your raven monsters than go to bed with a man but now im here with you and im as sure as ive ever been of anything she smiled then looked away i mean if you are charlie took her hand yeah he said but i was going to tell you something important cant it wait till morning sure they spent the night in each others arms and whatever fears or insecurities they had been feeling turned out to be illusions loneliness evaporated off of them like the steam off dry ice and by morning it was just a cloud on the ceiling of the room then gone with the light during the night someone had picked up the diningroom table and cleaned up the mess minty fresh had made when he crashed through the kitchen door he was sitting at the table when charlie came down they towed my car said minty fresh theres coffee thanks charlie skipped across the dining room to the kitchen he poured himself a cup of coffee and sat down with minty hows your head the big man touched the purple bruise on his forehead better howre you doing i accidentally shagged a monk last night sometimes in times of crisis that shit cannot be avoided how are you doing besides that i feel wonderful yeah imagine the rest of us all bummed about the end of the world not being cheerful not the end of the world just darkness over everything charlie cheerfully said it gets darkturn on a light good for you charlie now scuse me i got to go get my car out of impound before you start with the whole if life gives you lemons you make lemonade speech and i have to beat you senseless its true there is little more obnoxious than a beta male in love so conditioned is he to the idea that he will never find love that when he does he feels as if the entire world has fallen into step with his desiresand thus deluded he may act accordingly its a time of great joy and danger for him wait we can share a cab i have to go home and get my date book me too i left mine on the front seat of the car you know those two clients i missedtheyre here alive audrey told me charlie said theres six of them altogether she did that phowa of undying thing on them obviously thats whats been causing the cosmic shit storm but what can we do we cant kill them no i think its what you said the battle is going to happen here in san francisco and its going to happen now and since youre the luminatus i guess this whole thing is riding on your shoulders so id say were doomed maybe not i mean every time theyve almost gotten me something or someone has intervened to pull out a victory i think destiny is on our side i feel very optimistic about this thats just because you just shagged the monk said minty im not a monk said audrey bounding into the room with a sheaf of papers in hand oh shit said the death merchants in unison no its okay audrey said he did shag me or i think more appropriatelywe shaggedbut im not a monk anymore not because of the shagging you know it was a preshag decision she threw her papers on the table and climbed into charlies lap hey goodlooking hows your morning going she gave him a backbreaking kiss and entwined him like a starfish trying to open an oyster until minty fresh cleared his throat and she turned to him and good morning to you mr fresh yes thank you minty leaned to the side so he could see charlie whether they were here for you or for our clients who didnt die theyll be back you know that the morrigan said audrey huh said the death merchants again in chorus you guys are so cute audrey gushed theyre called the morrigan raven womenpersonifications of death in the form of beautiful warrior women who can change into birds there are three of them all part of the same collective queen of the underworld known as the morrigan charlie leaned back from her so he could look her in the eye how do you know that i just looked it up on the internet audrey climbed out of charlies lap picked up the papers on the table and began to read the morrigan consists of three distinct entities macha who haunts the battlefield and takes heads of warriors as tribute in battleshe is said to be able to heal a warrior from mortal wounds in the field if his men have offered enough heads to her the celtic warriors called the severed heads machas acorns she is considered the mother goddess of the three babd is rage the passion of battle and killingshe was said to collect the seed of fallen warriors and use its power to inspire a sexual frenzy for battle a literal bloodlust and nemain who is frenzy was said to drive soldiers into battle with a howl so fierce that it could cause enemy soldiers to die of frighther claws were venomous and the mere prick of one would kill a soldier but she would fling the venom into the eyes of enemy soldiers to blind them thats them said minty fresh i saw venom come from the claws of the one on the bart yeah charlie said and i think i remember babdthe bloodlust one thats them i have to talk to lily i sent her to berkeley to find out about them but she came back with nothing she must have not even looked yeah ask her if shes seeing anybody minty fresh said to audrey did it say how you kill them what their weaknesses are audrey shook her head just that warriors took dogs into battle to protect against the morrigan dogs charlie echoed that explains why my daughter got the hellhounds to protect her im telling you fresh were going to be okay destiny is on our side yeah you said that call us a cab i wonder why of all the different gods and demons in the underworld the celtic ones are here maybe theyre all here minty said i had a crazy indian tell me once that i was the son of anubis the egyptian jackalheaded god of the dead thats great charlie said a jackalthats a type of dog you have natural abilities to battle the morrigan see minty looked at audrey if you dont do something to disappoint him and mellow his ass out im going to shoot him oh yeah charlie said can i still borrow one of your big guns minty unfolded to his feet im going outside to call a cab and wait charlie if youre coming you better start saying goodbye now because im leaving when it gets here swell charlie said looking adoringly at audrey i think were safe in the daylight anyway monk shagger minty growled as he ducked under the doorway auntie cassie let charlie into their small home in the marina district and sophie called off the greeting hump of devil dogs almost as soon as it started daddy charlie swept sophie up in his arms and squeezed her until she started to change color then when jane came out of the kitchen he grabbed her in his other arm and hugged her as well uh let go jane said pushing him away you smell like incense oh jane i cant believe it shes so wonderful he got laid cassandra said you got laid jane said kissing her brother on the cheek im so happy for you now let me go daddy got laid sophie said to the hellhounds who seemed very happy at hearing the news no not laid charlie said and there was a collective sigh of disappointment well yes laid and there was a collective sigh of relief but thats not the thing the thing is shes wonderful shes gorgeous and kind and sweet and charlie jane interrupted you called us and told us that there was some great danger and we had to go get sophie and protect her and you were going on a date no no

shouldnt say that either its not nice like kitty and not in the butt exactly honey okay daddy so it wasnt nice daddy has to go to our house and get his date book pumpkin well talk about this later give me a kiss sophie gave him a huge hug and a kiss and charlie thought that he might cry for so long she had been his only future his only joy and now he had this other joy and he wanted to share it with her ill come right back okay okay let me down charlie let her slide to the floor and she ran off to another part of the house so it wasnt nice jane asked im sorry jane this is really crazy i hate that i put you guys in the middle of it i didnt mean to scare you jane thumped him in the arm so it was nice it was really nice charlie said breaking into a grin shes really nice shes so nice i miss mom lost me cassandra said because id like mom to see that im doing okay that i met someone whos good for me whos going to be good for sophie whoa dont jump the gun there tiger jane said you just met this woman you need to slow downand remember this comes from someone whose typical second date is moving a woman in slut cassie murmured i mean it jane shes amazing cassie looked at jane you were right he really did need to get laid thats not it charlies cell rang excuse me guys he flipped it open asher what the hell have you done it was lily she was crying what the hell have you let loose what lily what it was just here the front window of the shop is gone gone it just came in ripped through the shop and took all of your soul thingies loaded them into a bag and flew away fuck asher i mean fuck this thing was huge and fucking hideous yeah lily are you okay is ray okay yeah im okay ray didnt come in i ran into the back when it came through the window it wasnt interested in anything but that shelf asher it was as big as a bull and it fucking flew she sounded like she was on the edge of hysteria hold on lily stay there and ill come to you go in the back room and dont open the door until you hear me okay asher what the fuck was that thing i dont know lily the bullheaded death flew into the culvert and immediately fell to all fours to move through the pipe dragging the bag of souls behind him not for much longerhe would not crawl much longer the time had come orcus could feel it he could feel them converging on the citythe city where he had staked his territory so many years agohis city still they would come and they would try to take what was rightfully his all of the old gods of death yama and anubis and mors thanatos and charon and mahakala azrael and emmao and ahkoh balor erebos and nyxdozens of them gods born of the energy of mans greatest fear the fear of deathall of them coming to rise as the leader of darkness and the dead as the luminatus but he had come here first and with morrigan he would become the one but first he had to marshal his forces heal the morrigan and take down the wretched human soul stealers of the city the satchel of souls would go a long way toward healing his brides he marched into the grotto where the great ship was moored and leapt into the air the beat of his great leathery wings like a war drum echoing off the grotto walls and sending bats to the wing swirling around the ships masts in great clouds the morrigan torn and broken were waiting for him on the deck what did i tell you babd said its really not that great above huh i for one could do without cars altogether jane drove while charlie fired out phone calls on his cell first to rivera then to minty fresh within a half an hour they were all standing in charlies store or the wreckage that had been charlies store and uniformed policemen had taped off the sidewalk until someone could get the glass swept up the tourists have to love this nick cavuto said gnawing an unlit cigar right on the cablecar line perfect rivera was sitting in the back room interviewing lily while charlie jane and cassandra tried to sort through the mess and put things back on their shelves minty fresh stood by the front door wearing shades looking entirely too cool for the destruction that lay strewn around him sophie was content to sit in the corner and feed shoes to alvin and mohammed so cavuto said to charlie some kind of flying monster came through your window and you thought this would be a good place to bring your kid charlie turned to the big cop and leaned on the counter tell me detective in your professional opinion what procedure should i use in dealing with robbery by a flying monster what the fuck is the sfpd giantfuckingflyingmonster protocol detective cavuto stood staring at charlie as if hed had water thrown in his face not really angry just very surprised finally he grinned around his cigar and said mr asher i am going to go outside and smoke call in to the dispatcher and have her look that particular protocol up you have stumped me would you tell my partner where ive gone ill do that charlie said he went into the office with lily and rivera and said rivera can i get some police protection here at my apartmentofficers with shotguns rivera nodded patting lily on the hand as he looked away i can give you two charlie but not for longer than twentyfour hours you sure you dont want to get out of town upstairs we have the security bars and steel doors we have the hellhounds and minty freshs weapons and besides theyve already been here i have a feeling they got what they came for but the cops would make me feel better lily looked at charlie she was in total mascara meltdown and had smudged her lipstick halfway across her face im sorry i thought i would handle it better than this it was so scary it wasnt mysterious and cool it was horrible the eyes and the teethi peed asher im sorry dont be sorry kid you did fine im glad you had the sense to get out of its way asher if youre the luminatus that thing must be your competition what what is that rivera said its her weird gothy stuff inspector dont worry about it charlie said he looked through to the door and saw minty fresh standing at the front of the shop looking at him shrugging as if saying well so charlie asked hey lily are you seeing anyone lily wiped her nose on the sleeve of her chef s coat look asheri uhim going to have to withdraw that offer i made you i mean after ray im not sure i really ever want to do that again ever i wasnt asking for me lily charlie nodded toward the towering fresh oh lily said following his gaze now wiping her eyes with her sleeves oh fuck cover for me ive got to regroup she dashed into the employee washroom and slammed the door rivera looked at charlie what the hell is going on here charlie was going to try to come up with some kind of answer when his cell phone rang and he held up his finger to pause time charlie asher he said charlie its audrey came the whispered voice theyre here right now the morrigan are here orpheus in the storm sewer charlie parked the van sideways in the street and ran up the steps of the buddhist center calling her name the huge front door was hanging askew by one hinge the glass broken and every drawer and cabinet had been opened and the contents scattered every piece of furniture overturned or broken audrey he heard a voice to the front of the house and ran back out on the porch audrey down here she called were still under the porch charlie ran down the steps and around to the side of the porch he could see movement behind the lattice he found a small gate and opened it inside audrey was crouched with a halfdozen other people and a whole crowd of the squirrel people he scrambled into the crawl space and took her in his arms charlie had tried to keep her on the line during the drive over but a few blocks away the battery in his phone had died and he had tried for those few terrifying moments to imagine losing herhis future his hopeafter his hope had just been awakened again he was so relieved he could barely breathe are they gone audrey asked yes i think so im so glad youre all right charlie led them out of the crawl space and back into the house the squirrel people staying close to the walls and moving quickly so as not to be seen from the street charlie felt a tap on his shoulder and turned to see irena posokovanovich smiling at him he jumped up a couple of steps and screamed dont shock me again im a good guy i know that mr asher i was wondering if youd like me to park your van for you before it gets towed away oh yes that would be nice he handed her the keys thank you in the house audrey said she just wants to help shes creepy charlie said but then he caught what he thought was a look of disapproval rising in audreys eyes and he quickly added in a completely sweet way i mean they went directly to the kitchen and stood before the open pantry they got them all audrey said thats why they didnt hurt usthey werent interested in us charlie was so angry he was having trouble thinking but without an outlet he just shook and tried to keep his voice under control they just did the same thing at my store something did there must have been three hundred souls in here audrey said they took rachels soul audrey put her arm around his back but he couldnt respond other than to walk out of the kitchen thats it audrey im done what do you mean youre done charlie youre scaring me ask your squirrel people where i can get into the storm sewer system can they tell you that probably but you cant do that he wheeled on her and she jumped back i have to do that find out audrey everyone into my van i want you at my building where youll be safe they were all gathered in charlies living room sophie audrey jane cassandra lily minty fresh the undead clients from the buddhist center the hellhounds and fifty or so of the squirrel people lily jane and cassandra were standing on the couch to get away from the squirrel people who were milling on and around the breakfast bar nice outfits lily said but ewww thank you audrey said sophie was standing next to audrey looking her up and down as if trying to guess her weight im a jewess sophie said are you a jewess no im a buddhist audrey said is that like a shiksa yes i think it is said audrey its a type of shiksa oh i guess thats okay then my puppies are shiksas too thats what mrs ling calls them theyre very impressive puppies too audrey said they want to eat your little guys but i wont let them okay thank you that would be nice unless youre mean to my daddy then theyre toast of course audrey said special circumstances he likes you a lot im glad i like him a lot i think youre probably okay well right back at you audrey said she smiled at the little brunette with the heartbreaking blue eyes and the attitude and it was all she could do not to scoop her up and hug the bejeezus out of her charlie jumped up on the couch next to jane cassandra and lily and then realized as he looked across the room at minty fresh that he still didnt stand taller than the death merchant which was a little unnerving minty seemed focused on lily which was also a little unnerving you guys im going to go do something and i might not come back jane that letter i sent you has all the papers making you sophies legal guardian im out of here lily said no charlie said catching her by the arm i want you here too im leaving you the business but with the understanding that a percentage of the profits go to jane to help with sophie and will also go into a college fund for her i know you have your career as a chef but i trust you and youre good at the business lily looked like she wanted to say something sarcastic but shrugged and said sure i can run your business and cook too you do your death merchant thing and raise a daughter thanks jane youll get the building of course but when sophie grows up if she wants to stay in the city you always have to have an apartment for her jane jumped off the couch charlie this is crap im not letting you do anything please jane ive got to go this is all in writing i just want you to hear what i wanted in person okay she said charlie hugged his sister cassandra and lily then went to the bedroom and gestured for minty fresh to follow him minty im going into the underworld after the morriganafter rachels soul all the souls its time the big man nodded gravely im right there with you no youre not i need you to stay here and watch over audrey and sophie and the others there are cops outside but i think their disbelief might make them hesitate if the morrigan come you wont do that minty shook his head what chance do you have down there alone let me come with you well fight this thing together i dont think so charlie said im blessed or something the prophecy says the luminatus will rise and do battle with the forces of darkness in the city of two bridges it doesnt say the luminatus and his trusty sidekick minty fresh i am not a sidekick thats what im saying said charlie who wasnt saying that at all im saying that i have some sort of protection but you probably dont and if i dont come back youll need to carry on as a death merchant in the citymaybe get the scales tipped back for our side minty fresh nodded lowering his gaze to the floor youll take my desert eagles then for luck he looked up and was grinning ill take one of them charlie said minty fresh slipped out of his shoulderholster rig and adjusted the straps until they fit charlie then helped him into the harness there are two extra clips in here under your right arm minty said i hope you dont have to fire it that many times down there or you will be one deaf motherfucker thanks charlie said minty helped him get his tweed jacket on over the shoulder holster you know you might be heavily armed but you still look like an english professordont you have some clothes more appropriate for fighting james bond always wears a tux charlie said yeah i understand the line between reality and fiction seems a little blurred here lately im kidding charlie said there are some motocross leathers and pads in the shop that will fit me if i can find them good minty patted charlies shoulders like he was trying to make them bigger you see that bitch with the poison claws you light her up for me okay ill buss a cap in da hoes ass charlie said dont do that sorry the hardest part came a few minutes later honey daddy has to go do something are you going to get mommy charlie was crouched in front of his daughter and he nearly rolled over backward at the question she hadnt mentioned her mommy a dozen times in the last two years why would you say that honey i dont know i was thinking about her well you know that she loved you very much yeah and you know that no matter what i love you very much yeah you said that yesterday and i meant it yesterday but this time i really do have to go i have to fight some bad guys and i might not win sophies lower lip pushed out like a big wet shelf dont cry dont cry dont cry dont cry charlie chanted in his head i cant handle it if you cry dont cry honey everything will be okay nooooooooooo sophie wailed i want to go with you i want to go with you dont go daddy i want to go with you charlie held her and looked across the room to his sister pleading she came and took sophie from his arms noooooo i want to go with you you cant go with me honey and charlie ducked out of the apartment before his heart broke again audrey was waiting in the hall with fiftythree squirrel people im driving you to the entrance she said dont argue no charlie said im not losing you after just finding you you stay here you creep what gives you the right to be that way i just found you too yeah but im not much of a find youre an ass she said and she walked into his arms and kissed him after a long time charlie looked around the squirrel people were all looking up at them what are they doing here theyre going with you no its too risky then its too risky for you too you dont even know what could be down therethis thing that broke into your store wasnt one of the morrigan im not going to be afraid audrey there might be a hundred different demons but the book of the dead is right they are only keeping us from our path i think these things exist for the same reason i was chosen to do this because of fear i was afraid to live so i became death their power is our fear of death im not afraid and im not taking the squirrel people they know the way and besides theyre fourteen inches tall what do they have to live for hey said a beefeater guard whose head was the skull of a bobcat did he say something charlie asked one of my experimental voice boxes its a little squeaky hey sorry uh beef charlie said the creatures seemed resolute onward then charlie ran down the hall so he wouldnt have to say goodbye again ten yards behind him marched a small army of nightmare creatures put together from the parts of a hundred different animals it just so happened that at the time they were reaching the staircase mrs ling came downstairs to see what all the commotion had been about and the entire army stopped in the stairway and looked up at her mrs ling was and had always been a buddhist and so she was a firm believer in the concept of karma and that those lessons you did not learn would continually be presented to you until you learned them or your soul could never evolve to the next level that afternoon as the forces of light were about to engage the forces of darkness for dominion over the world mrs ling staring into the blank eyes of the squirrel people had her own epiphany and she never again ate meat of any kind her first act of atonement was an offering to those she felt she had wronged you want snack she said but the squirrel people marched on the emperor saw the van pull up near the creek and a man in bright yellow motorcycle leathers climb out the man reached back into the van and grabbed what looked like a shoulder holster with a sledgehammer in it and slipped into the harness if the context hadnt been so bizarre the emperor could have sworn it was his friend charlie asher from the secondhand shop in north beach but charlie here with a gun no lazarus who was not so dependent on his eyes for recognition barked a greeting the man turned to them and waved it was charlie he walked down to the creekbank across from them your majesty charlie said you seem upset charlie is something wrong no no im okay i just had to take directions from a mute beaver in a fez to get here its unsettling well i can see how it would be said the emperor nice ensemble though the leathers and the pistol not your usual sartorial splendor well no im on a bit of a mission going to go into that culvert find my way into the underworld and do battle with the forces of darkness good for you good for you forces of darkness seem to be on the rise in my city lately you noticed then the emperor hung his head yes im afraid weve lost one of our troops to the fiends bummer he went into a storm sewer days ago and hasnt come out im sorry sir would you look for him charlie please bring him out your majesty im not sure that im coming back myself but i promise if i find him ill try to bring him out now if youll excuse me im going to open this van and i dont want you to be alarmed by what you see but i want to get into the pipe while theres still some light from the grates what you see coming out of the vantheyre friends carry on said the emperor charlie slid the door open and the squirrel people hopped scampered and scooted down the bank of the creek toward the culvert charlie reached into the van took out his swordcane and flashlight and buttbumped the door shut lazarus whimpered and looked at the emperor as if someone who was able to talk should say something good luck then valiant charlie said the emperor you go forth with all of us in your heart and you in ours youll watch the van until the golden gate crumbles to dust my friend said the emperor and so charlie asher in the service of life and light and all sentient beings and in hope of rescuing the soul of the love of his life led an army of fourteeninchtall bundles of animal bits armed with everything from knitting needles to a spork into the storm sewers of san francisco they slogged on for hourssometimes the pipes became narrow enough that charlie had to crawl on his hands and knees other times they opened into wide junctions like concrete rooms he helped the squirrel people climb to higher pipes hed found a lightweight construction helmet fitted with an led headlamp which came in handy in narrow passages where he couldnt aim the flashlight he was also bumping his head about ten times an hour and although the helmet protected him from injury hed developed a throbbing headache his leathersnot really leathers but more heavy nylon with lexan pads at the knees shoulders elbows shins and forearmswere protecting him from bumps and abrasions on the pipes but they were soaked and rubbing him raw at the backs of his knees at an open junction with a grate at the top he climbed the ladder and tried to get a look at the neighborhood to perhaps get a sense of where they were but it had gotten dark out since they started and the grate was under a parked car what irony that he would finally summon his courage and charge into the breach only to end up lost and stuck in the breach a human misfire where the hell are we he said no idea said the bobcat guy the one who could talk the little beefeater was disturbing to watch when he spoke since he really didnt have a face only a skull and he spoke without ever making the p sound also instead of a halberd which charlie thought should have come with the costume for authenticity the bobcat had armed himself with a spork can you ask the others if they know where we are okay he turned to the damp gallery of squirrel people hey anybody know where we are they all shook their heads looking from one to another shrugging nope no said the bobcat well i could have done that charlie said why dont you its your arty he said charlie realized he meant party why no ps charlie asked no lis right lips sorry what are you going to do with that spork well when we find some bad guys im going to sork the fuck out of them excellent youre my lieutenant because of the sork no because you can talk whats your name bob no really really its bob so i suppose your last name is cat wilson just checking sorry s okay do you remember who you were in your last life i remember a little i think i was an accountant so no military experience you need some bodies counted im your man er thing swell does anyone here remember if they used to be a soldier or a ninja or anything extra credit for ninjas or a viking or something werent any of you like attila the hun or captain horatio hornblower in a former life or something a ferret in a sequined minidress and gogo boots came forward paw raised you were a naval commander the ferret appeared to whisper into bobs hat since bob no longer had ears she says no she misunderstood she thought you meant horn blower she was a prostitute cornet layer said bob sorry charlie said its the boots the ferret waved him off in a no worries way then leaned over and whispered to bob again what charlie said nothing bob said not nothing i didnt think they could talk well not to you said bob what did she say she said were fucked well thats not a very good attitude charlie said but he was starting to believe the gogo ferret was right and he leaned back into a semisitting position in the pipe to rest bob climbed up to a smaller pipe and sat on the edge his feet dangling over water dripped from his little patentleather shoes but the floral pattern brass buckles still shone in the light of charlies headlamp nice shoes charlie said yeah well audrey digs me said bob before charlie could answer the dog had grabbed bob from behind and was shaking him like a rag doll his mighty spork clattered off the pipe and was lost in the water below bitchs brew lily had been looking all night for a way to approach minty fresh shed made eye contact with him a dozen times over the course of the evening and smiled but with the atmosphere of dread that fell over the room she was having trouble thinking of an opening line finally when an oprah movie of the week came on the television and everyone gathered around to watch the media diva beat paul winfield to death with a steam iron minty went to the breakfast bar and started flipping through his day planner and lily made her move so checking your appointments she said you must be feeling optimistic about how things will go he shook his head not really lily was smitten he was beautiful and moroselike a great brown mangift from the gods how bad can it be lily said pulling the appointment book out of his hand and flipping through the pages she stopped on todays date why is ashers name in here she asked minty hung his head he said youve known all about us for a while yeah but she looked at the name again and the realization of what she was seeing was like a punch in the chest this is that book this is your date book for that minty nodded slowly not looking at her when did this name show up lily asked it wasnt there an hour ago well fucksocks she said sitting down on the bar stool next to the big man yeah said minty fresh he put his arm around her shoulders with charlie pulling on the legs of the bobcat guy who was doing some impressive screaming considering he had prototype vocal cords and the squirrel people dogpiling onto the boston terrier they were eventually able to extricate their lieutenant from the jaws of the bugeyed fury with only a few snags in his beefeaters costume down bummer charlie said just chill he didnt know if chill was an official dog command but it should be bummer snorted and backed away from the surrounding crowd of squirrel people not one of us said the bobcat guy pointing at bummer not one of us you shut up charlie said he pulled a beef jerky from his pocket that hed brought for emergency rations tore off a hunk and held it out to bummer come on buddy i told the emperor id look out for you bummer trotted over to charlie and took the beef jerky from him then turned to face down the squirrel people as he chewed the squirrel people made clicking noises and brandished their weapons not one of us not one of us chanted bob stop that charlie said you cant get a mob chant going bob youre the only one with a voice box oh yeah bob let his chanting trail off well hes not one of us he added in his defense he is now charlie said to bummer he said can you lead us to the underworld bummer looked up at charlie as if he knew exactly what was being asked of him but if he was going to find the strength to carry on he was going to need the other half of that beef jerky charlie gave it to him and bummer immediately jumped up to a higher fourfoot pipe stopped barked then took off down the pipe follow him charlie said after an hour following bummer through the sewers the pipes gave way to tunnels that got bigger as they moved along soon they were moving in caves with high ceilings and stalactites in the ceiling that glowed in various colors illuminating their way with a dull shadowy light charlie had read enough about the geology of the area to know that these caves were not natural to the city he guessed that they were somewhere under the financial district which was mostly built on gold rush landfill so there would be nothing as oldlooking or as solid as these caves bummer kept on leading them down one fork or another without the slightest hesitation until suddenly the cave opened up into a massive grotto the chamber was so large that it simply swallowed up charlies flashlight and headlamp beams but the ceiling which was several hundred feet high was lined with the luminous stalactites that reflected red green and purple in a mirrorsmooth black lake in the middle of the lake probably two hundred yards away stood a great black sailing shiptallmasted like a spanish galleonred pulsating light coming from the cabin windows in the rear a single lantern lighting the deck charlie had heard that whole ships had been buried in the debris during the gold rush but they wouldnt have been left preserved like this things had changed these caves were all the result of the underworld risingand he realized that this was just a hint of what was going to happen to the city if the underworlders took over bummer barked and the sharp report echoed around the grotto sending a cloud of bats into the air charlie saw movement on the deck of the ship the blueblack outline of a woman and he knew that bummer had led them to the right place charlie handed his flashlight to bob and set his swordcane on the cave floor he drew the desert eagle from the shoulder holster checked that there was a round in the chamber cocked the hammer then reset the safety and reholstered the pistol were going to need a boat charlie said to bob see if you guys can find something we can make a raft from the bobcat guy started down the shore with charlies flashlight scanning the rocks for useful flotsam bummer growled tossed his head like he had ear mites or perhaps to indicate that he thought charlie was insane and ran out into the lake fifty yards away he was still only in water up to his shoulder charlie looked at the black ship and realized that it was sitting way way too high out of the waterthat in fact it was sitting with its hull on the bottom in only about six inches of water uh bob charlie said forget the boat were walking everyone quiet he unsheathed his sword and sloshed onward as they approached the ship they could make out details in its construction the railings were fashioned from leg bones lashed together the mooring cleats were human pelvises the lantern on the deck was in fact a human skull charlie wasnt exactly sure how his powers as luminatus were going to manifest themselves but as they reached the hull of the ship he found himself very much wishing it would happen soon and that levitation would be one of the powers were fucked said bob looking up at the black hull curving above them were not fucked charlie said we just need someone to climb up there and throw us a rope there was some milling around amid the squirrel people then a lone figure stepped out of the little crowdthis one appeared to be a nineteenthcentury french dandy with the head of a monitor lizard his outfitthe ruffles and the coatactually reminded charlie of pictures that lily had shown him of charles baudelaire you can do it charlie asked the lizard guy he held out his hands and lifted one foot out of the water squirrel paws charlie lifted the lizard guy as high as he could up to the hull and the little creature caught ahold in the black wood then scurried up the side of the ship and over the gunwale minutes passed and charlie found himself listening hard for some hint as to what was going on above when the thick rope splashed down next to him he leapt two feet in the air and barely contained blasting out a fullblown manscream nice said bob you first then charlie said testing the rope to see if it would hold his weight he waited until the bobcat guy was about three feet over his head before he tucked the swordcane down inside the lexan plate strapped over his back and started the climb himself by the time he was threequarters of the way up the rope he felt as if his biceps were going to pop like water balloons and he entwined his motocross boot into the rope to rest as if being granted a second wind by the gods his biceps relaxed and when he resumed climbing he felt as if he might really be gaining his power as the luminatus when he reached the railing he grabbed one of the bone mooring cleats and swung himself up until he sat straddling the rail he swung around and his headlamp caught the black shine in her eyes she was holding the bobcat guy like an ear of corn her claw driven through his skull pinning his jaw shut there was flesh and goo glowing dull red running down her face and over her breasts as she tore another bite out of the beefeater want some lover she said tastes like ham at the breakfast bar in charlies apartment lily said shouldnt we tell them they dont all know about us about this minty held the date book just audrey then shouldnt we tell her minty looked at audrey who was sitting on the couch entwined in a sleepy pile with charlies sister and one of the hellhounds looking very content no i dont think that would serve any purpose right now hes a good guy lily said she snatched a paper towel off the roll on the counter and dabbed her eyes before her mascara went raccoon on her again i know minty said hes my friend as he said it he felt a tug on his pant leg he looked down to where sophie was staring up at him hey do you have a car she asked yes i do sophie can we go for a ride without any hesitation charlie whipped the swordcane out of his back and snapped it down on the morrigans wrist she lost her grip on the bobcat guy who bolted screaming across the deck and over the opposite railing the morrigan grabbed the swordcane and tried to wrench it from charlies grasp he let herpulled the sword free then drove it into her solar plexus so hard that his fist connected with her ribs and the blade came out her back sinking into the wooden hull of the lifeboat she was reclining against for a split second his face was an inch from hers miss me she asked he rolled away just as she slashed at him he got his forearm up just in time to deflect the blow away from his face the thick lexan plate on his forearm stopping the claws from taking off his hand she lunged for him but the sword kept her pinned to the boat charlie ran down the deck away from her as she screeched in anger he saw light coming from a door that must have led to the cabin at the aft of the shipthat same red glowand he realized that it had to be coming from the soul vessels rachels soul could still be in there he was only a step from the hatch when the giant raven dropped in front of him and spread her wings out across the deck as if trying to block the whole end of the ship he backpedaled and drew the desert eagle from the shoulder holster he tried to hold it steady as he clicked off the safety the raven snapped at him and he leapt back the beak then pulled back changed bubbled into the face of a womanbut the wings and talons remained in bird form new meat said macha how brave of you to come here charlie pulled the trigger flame shot a foot out of the barrel and he felt as if someone had hit him in the palm with a hammer he thought he had aimed right between her eyes but the bullet had ripped through her neck taking half of the black flesh with it her head lolled to the side and the raven body flailed its wings at him charlie fell backward onto the deck but pulled the pistol up and fired again as the raven was coming down on him this one caught her in the center of the chest and sent her flying backward up onto the cabin roof the ringing in his ears felt like someone had driven tuning forks into his head and hit them with drumsticksa long painful highpitched wail he barely heard the shriek from his left as another morrigan dropped out of the rigging behind him he rolled to the railing and brought the gun up just as she slashed at his face the gun and his forearm pad absorbed most of the blow but the desert eagle was knocked from his grasp and slid down the deck charlie did a somersault to his feet and ran after the gun nemain flicked her claws at his back and he heard the sizzle as the poison strafed the lexan pad down his spine and burned onto the deck on either side of him he dove for the pistol and tried to roll and come up with it pointed at his attacker but he misjudged and came up with the back of his knees against the bone railing she leapt claws first and hit him in the chest just as he fired the desert eagle and he was driven backward over the railing he hit flat on the water the air exploded from his body and he felt like hed been hit by a bus he couldnt breathe but he could see he could feel his limbs and after a couple of seconds of gasping he finally caught a breath so hows it going so far asked the bobcat guy about two feet from charlies head good charlie said theyre running scared there was a big chunk bitten out of the middle of bobs torso and his beefeater uniform was in tatters but otherwise he seemed in good spirits he was holding the desert eagle cradled in his arms like a baby youll likely need this that last shot connected by the way you took off about half of her skull good charlie said still having a little trouble catching his breath he felt a searing pain in his chest and thought he might have broken a rib he sat up and looked at his chest plate the morrigans claws had raked the front of it but in one spot he could see where a claw had slipped under the plate and into his chest he wasnt bleeding badly but he was bleeding and it hurt like hell are they still coming not the two you shot we dont know where the one you stuck with your sword went i dont know if i can make it up that rope again charlie said that may not be a roblem bob said he was looking up to the ceiling of the grotto where a whirlwind of squeaking bats was spiraling around the mast but above them was beating the wings of another creature altogether charlie took the pistol from bob and climbed to his feet nearly fell then steadied himself and backed away from the hull of the ship the squirrel people scattered around him bummer let loose with a fusillade of angry yapping the demon hit the water about thirty feet away charlie felt a scream rising in his throat but fought it down the thing was nearly ten feet tall with a wingspan of thirty feet its head was as big as a beer keg and it appeared to have the shape and horns of a bull except for the jaws which were predatory lined with teeth like a cross between a shark and a lion its eyes were gleaming green soul stealer it growled it folded its wings into two high points behind its back and stepped toward charlie well that would be you wouldnt it charlie said a little breathless still im the luminatus the demon stopped charlie took the hesitation to bring up the pistol and fire the shot took the demon high in the shoulder and spun him to the side he turned back and roared charlie could smell the creatures breath like rotting meat wash over him he backed up and fired again his hand numb now from the recoil of the big pistol the shot knocked the demon back a step there was shrill cheering from above charlie fired again and again the slugs opened craters in the demons chest he wavered then fell to his knees charlie aimed and pulled the trigger again the gun clicked charlie backed up a few more steps and tried to remember what minty had shown him about reloading he managed to hit a button that released the clip from the pistol which plopped into the water then he unsnapped one of the pouches under his arm to retrieve an extra clip it slipped out and fell into the lake as well bob and a couple of the squirrel people splashed forward and started diving beneath the water looking for the clip the demon roared again unfurled his wings and in one great flap pulled himself to his feet charlie unsnapped the second clip and with his hands shaking managed to fit it into the bottom of the desert eagle the demon crouched as if to leap charlie jacked a shell into the chamber and fired at the same time the demon fell forward as the huge slug took a chunk out of his thigh well done meat came a female voice from above charlie looked up quickly but then back to the bullheaded demon who was on his feet again then he braced his wrist and fired and again walking forward pumping bullets into the demons chest with each step feeling any second as if his wrist would just shatter into pieces from the recoil until the hammer clicked on an empty chamber he stopped just five feet away from the demon when it fell over facefirst into the water charlie dropped the desert eagle and fell to his knees the grotto seemed to be tilting before him his vision tunneling down the morrigan landed on three sides of him each had a glowing soul vessel in her claw and was rubbing it on her wounds that was excellent lover said the raven woman standing closest to the fallen demon charlie recognized her from the alley the stab wound his sword had made in her stomach healed over as he watched she kicked the bullheaded demons body see i told you that guns suck that was well done meat said the one to charlies right her neck was still knitting back together she was the one hed blasted up onto the cabin roof you guys do bounce back with a certain wile e coyote charm charlie said he grinned feeling drunk now like he was watching all this from another place hes so sweet said the handjob harpy i could just eat him up sounds good to me said the morrigan to his left whose head was still a little lopsided charlie saw the venom dripping from her claws then looked to the wound below his chest plate yes darling said hand job im afraid nemain did nick you you really are quite the warrior to have lasted this long im the luminatus charlie said the morrigan laughed the one in front of charlie did a little dance step as she did the bullheaded demon lifted his head from the water im the luminatus said the demon black goo and water running between his teeth as he spoke the morrigan stopped dancing grabbed one of the demons horns then pulled his head back you think she said then she plunged her claws into the demons throat he rolled and threw her off sending her sailing twenty feet in the air to smash into the hull of the ship the morrigan behind charlie patted his head as she passed well be right with you darling im macha by the way and we are the luminatusor we will be in a minute the morrigan fell on the bullheaded demon taking great chunks of flesh and bone off his body with each slash of their talons two took to the air and swept in taking swipes at the demon who flailed at them sometimes connecting but too weakened from the gunshots to fight effectively in two minutes it was finished and most of the flesh had been flayed from it macha held his head by the horns like she was holding the handlebars of a motorcycle even as the demons jaws continued to snap at the air your turn soul stealer macha said yeah your turn said nemain baring her claws macha held the demon head out in front of her driving it at charlie he backed away as the teeth snapped inches from his face wait a minute said babd the other two stopped and turned to their sister who stood over what was left of the demons corpse we never got to finish she took one step before something hit her like a ball of darkness knocking her out of sight charlie looked at the demon head coming at him then there was a loud smack and macha was yanked to the side as if shed had a bungee cord attached to her ankle the screeching started again and charlie could see the morrigan being whipped around in the darkness splashing and chaoshe couldnt follow what was happening his eyes wouldnt focus he looked to nemain who was now coming at him with her claws dripping venom a small hand appeared at the edge of his vision and the morrigans head exploded into what looked like a thousand stars charlie looked to where the hand had appeared before his eyes hi daddy sophie said hi baby charlie said now he could see what was happeningthe hellhounds were tearing at the morrigan one of them broke jumped into the air and unfurled her wings then dove at sophie screeching sophie raised her hand as if she was waving byebye and the morrigan vaporized into a spray of black goo the souls thousands of them that she had consumed over the millennia floated into the air red lights that circled the grotto making the whole huge chamber appear to have been frozen in the middle of a fireworks display you shouldnt be here honey charlie said yes i should sophie said i had to fix this send them all back im the luminatus you yeah she said matteroffactly in that master of all death and darkness voice that is so irritating in a sixyearold the hellhounds were both on the remaining morrigan now tearing her in half as charlie watched no honey charlie said sophie raised her hand and babd was vaporized like the othersthe captured souls rose like embers from a bonfire lets go home daddy sophie said no charlie said barely able to hold up his head we have something we have to get he lurched forward and one of the hellhounds was there to brace him the whole army of squirrel people was coming around the bow of the ship each carrying a glowing soul vessel hed retrieved from the ships cabin is this it sophie said she took a cd from bob and handed it to charlie he turned it in his hands and hugged it to his chest you know what this is honey yeah lets go home daddy charlie fell over the back of alvin sophie and the squirrel people steadied him until they were out of the underworld minty fresh carried charlie to the car a doctor had come and gone when charlie came to he was on his bed at home and audrey was wiping his forehead with a damp cloth hi he said hi audrey said did sophie tell you yeah they grow up so fast charlie said yeah audrey smiled i got this he reached behind his chest plate and pulled out the sarah mclachlan cd that pulsated with red light audrey nodded and reached out for the disc lets put that over here where you can keep an eye on it as soon as her fingers touched the plastic case the light went out and audrey shuddered oh my she said audrey charlie tried to sit up but was forced back down by the pain ouch audrey what happened did they get it did they take her soul she was looking at her chest then looked up at charlie tears in her eyes no charlie its me she said but you had touched that before that night in the pantry why didnt it happen then i guess i wasnt ready then charlie took her hand and squeezed it then squeezed it much harder than he intended as a wave of pain washed through him goddammit he said he was panting now breathing like he might hyperventilate i thought it was all dark audrey all the spiritual stuff was spooky you made me see im glad audrey said makes me think i should have slept with a poet so i could have understood the way the world can be distilled into words yes i think you have the soul of a poet charlie i should have made love with a painter too so i could feel the wave of a brushstroke so i could absorb her colors and textures and really see yes audrey said brushing at his hair with her fingers you have such a wonderful imagination i think said charlie his voice going higher as he breathed harder i should have bedded a scientist so i would understand the mechanics of the world felt them right down to my spine yes so you could feel the world audrey said with big tits charlie added his back arching in pain of course baby audrey said i love you audrey i know charlie i love you too then charlie asher beta male husband to rachel brother to jane father to sophie the luminatus who held dominion over death beloved of audrey death merchant and purveyor of fine vintage clothing and accessories took his last breath and died audrey looked up to see sophie come into the room hes gone sophie sophie put her hand on charlies forehead bye daddy she said epilogue the girls things settled in the city of two bridges and all the dark gods that had been rising to erupt out over the world remembered their place and returned to their domains deep in the underworld jane and cassie were married in a civil ceremony that was dissolved and sanctioned a halfdozen times over the years nevertheless they were happy and there was always laughter in their home sophie went home to live with her aunties jane and cassandra she would grow to be a tall and beautiful woman and eventually take her place as the luminatus but until then she went to school and played with her puppies and had a fairly wonderful time as she waited for her daddy to come get her the shopkeepers while minty fresh had believed in the adage that in every moment there is a crisis his belief had been somewhat academic until he started seeing lily severo when it became very practical indeed life jumped up several steps for him on the interesting scale to the point where the death merchant part of his existence became the more prosaic of his pursuits they became renowned around town the giant in pastels always in company with the short gothic chef but the city really stood up and took notice when they opened up the jazz and gourmet pizza place in north beach in the building that had once housed ashers secondhand as for ray macy inspector rivera set him up with a lady pawnbroker from the fillmore named carrie lang and they hit it off almost immediately having in common a love of detective movies and handguns as well as a deep mistrust for most of humanity ray fell deeply in love and true to his beta male nature was doggedly loyal to her although he always secretly suspected her of being a serial killer rivera inspector alphonse rivera has spent most of his life trying to change his life hed worked in a halfdozen different police departments in a dozen different capacities and although he was very good at being a cop he always seemed to be trying to get out after the debacle with the death merchants and the strange unexplainable things that had gone on around it he was simply exhausted there had been a brief time when hed been able to leave police work and open a rarebook store and he felt as if that might have been the only time he had ever truly been happy now at age fortynine he was ready to try it again take an early retirement and just read and live in a calm uneventfilled world of books so he was somewhat pleased when two weeks after the death of charlie asher he went to his mailbox to find a substantial envelope that could only be a book it was like an omen he thought as he sat down at his kitchen table to open the package it was a bookwhat looked like a very rare and bizarre childrens book he opened it and turned to the first chapter so now youre death heres what youll need the emperor the emperor enjoyed a happy reunion with his troops and went on to rule benevolently over san francisco to the end of his days for leading charlie into the underworld and for his boundless courage the luminatus gave bummer the strength and durability of a hellhound it would fall to the emperor to explain how his now allblack companionwhile he never weighed more than seven pounds soaking wetcould outrun a cheetah and chew the tires off a toyota audrey audrey continued her work at the buddhist center and did costuming for a local theater group but she also took a volunteer job with hospice where she helped people to the other side as she had done for so long in tibet the hospice position also however gave her access to bodies that had been recently vacated by their souls and she used these opportunities to cycle the squirrel people back into the human flow of birth and rebirth and for a while there were remarkable instances of people recovering from terminal illness in the city as she exercised the phowa of undying she didnt give up her work with the squirrel people altogether however as it was a skill she had come to over a long time and a lot of work and it could still be extraordinarily rewarding at least thats how she was feeling as she looked over her latest masterpiece in the meditation room of the three jewels buddhist center he had the face of a crocodilesixtyeight spiked teeth and eyes that gleamed like black glass beads his hands were the claws of a raptor the wicked black nails encrusted with dried blood his feet were webbed like those of a waterbird with claws for digging prey from the mud he wore a purple silk robe trimmed in sable and a matching hat with a wizards star embroidered on it in gold thread its only temporary until we find someone audrey said but take my word for it you look great no i dont im only fourteen inches tall yeah but i gave you a teninch schlong he opened his robe and looked down wow would you look at that charlie said nice authors note and acknowledgments as with any book i owe a debt of gratitude to

thoughts and feelings during the time of pats passing also thanks to the hospice workers in all capacities who share their lives and hearts every day with the dying and their families the city of san francisco is always an inspiration and im grateful to her people for letting me stalk their neighborhoods and for being understanding about my teasing while ive tried to represent the feeling of the neighborhoods in san francisco im quite aware that the actual locations in the book like charlies shop and the three jewels buddhist center are not at the addresses indicated if you find it absolutely necessary to write me to inform me of my inaccuracies i will be forced to point out that you wont find giant shampooslurping hellhounds in north beach either i did not go into the storm sewer to confirm the details of descriptions in scenes that take place there mainly because its the sewer san francisco is one of the few coastal cities that combine their sewer and stormdrain systema fact that i completely ignored in my description of that underground world if youre really that concerned about how it looks down in the sewerswelleww just take my word for it all that stuff could happen down there and dont ruin the story for yourself by being a stickler about the details theres a squirrel in a ball gown for christs sake just let the sewer thing go as for other factual faux pas i do not know if you can actually pinch a kids head off in the electric window of a cadillac eldoradoi just thought it would be cool for this book if you could please dont experiment at home my sincere thanks go to monique motil upon whose amazing art the squirrel people are based i happened across her sculptures which she calls sartorial creatures at paxton gate a gallery in the mission district of
